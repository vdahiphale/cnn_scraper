President Biden did right at the beginning of the week and then than over the (ph) weekend, we saw a big division of the military pull out of southern Gaza, of Khan Younis. We've seen since then a significant ramp-up of aid going into Gaza, the past three days, biggest amounts of aid according to Israeli officials who has gone into Gaza.So, it is clear that what we heard President Biden express in that interview did connect during his conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. However, as far as a ceasefire goes, this really does seem to be in the hands of Hamas and the negotiations to get the hostages released. And this is something that just yesterday, Secretary Blinken said, the ball on that account was firmly in Hamas' court. So on a ceasefire, whatever the Israeli government has put forward, and we don't know all the details, in those conversations in Cairo over the past couple of days, it now seems to be Hamas that would have to take the step next to lead to that ceasefire. But undoubtedly, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been put under pressure by President Biden and responded in some kind. And he is also under levels of pressure domestically saying this -- that the Rafah operation, that a date is set.",

We know the State Department the previous day said that more than 300 trucks of aid had got in that day. But both the State Department and the Israelis are saying these are the largest amounts of aid that have been able to get in a single day since the beginning of the conflict back in October 7.However, there does appear to be some level of shortcoming on the other side, the U.N. not in a position to distribute the aid. Of course, there's a war, there's a huge amount of destruction that has been caused by the Israeli Defense Forces inside of Gaza. And the ability to move that aid around Gaza, particularly to the north is strained. The Israeli government said that they would open a border crossing at Erez in the north of the country. That has not happened yet. There are indications it may not be Erez, but it may be somewhere else in the north. So, the logistics of trying to make good on the commitments are not things that are happening immediately. The logistics on the ground to distribute it to the people who need it most are not there. So, today is a day in Gaza where people are celebrating Eid, the end of Ramadan, where traditionally they would gather in their homes and eat sweets and where new clothes that they would have bought in the market. CNN has been talking to people in Gaza today who are scratching through the rubble of their homes just to try to find a piece of furniture, a piece of clothing. They are not celebrating Eid as the way they would do normally. They don't have the wherewithal to do it. And I think that's the picture that even though the number of trucks has ramped up, it is going to be a long time before it has a significant difference. And of course, State Department saying very, very clearly through Secretary Blinken yesterday, it is not just about the number of trucks getting in. We need to see it consistently reaching and spreading out on the ground to everyone that needs it.",

And he says the process to fill all of the tiny gaps in between those pieces of the plane hasn't been done properly and that could put a lot of added stress on those parts and it could dramatically reduce the decades' long lifespan of the plane or at least what should be decades long. And there is a dire warning in this complaint that I want to read. It says that these defects ultimately cause a premature fatigue failure without any warning, thus creating unsafe conditions for the aircraft with potentially catastrophic accidents and passenger fatalities. Now, Boeing, for their part, is vehemently denying these claims, saying that they are inaccurate and they do not represent the work that Boeing has done to ensure safety. And as they put it, they say these issues have -- that have been raised have been subject to rigorous engineering examination under FAA oversight. Bear in mind, Erica, some of these allegations are not entirely new. The FAA halted deliveries of the Dreamliner, the 787 back in 2021, and was because of similar issues with those gaps, I was talking about, in-between the parts of the plane.

And if you give them some, they will just go for more because they will say, you see, where -- it is working out, we are getting further. Let's do it. And then if to give them even theoretically, which by the way, legally is also impossible. But if theoretically, to provide them -- to give them something like concessions in exchange for peace, they will take concession straightaway, but the peace will be fragile and most likely will not hold even for a short period of time because they will break that deal as well as they broke all other deals before. So that just like, it will not work.",

The antivirus software from Kaspersky Lab is already forbidden from being used on U.S. government computers, but now the Commerce Department is considering a ban for private companies and individuals. Officials say that's because it is a security risk, saying the Kremlin could use it to gather data on Americans or even hack into U.S. computers. CNN Cybersecurity Reporter Sean Lyngaas joins us now with more on this. So, this would be quite the ban. What more do you know here, Sean?",

U.S. officials have long been distrustful of Kaspersky software. Like you said, they claim, a claim that Kaspersky denies, but they claim that Russian cyber agents could use access to the computers, to the software to gain access to personal data, national security sensitive information.And so, Kaspersky thought they were done with all these legal troubles. In 2017, the U.S. government forbid federal agencies from installing the software on their networks. Now, they are trying to go a step further and use an unprecedented authority that both the Trump Administration and the Biden Administration lawyers have worked on for years. And this is in some ways a test case because they are trying to say we don't want the software anywhere in the U.S. And again, I should point out that Kaspersky denies any wrongdoing, any what they call unethical ties with the Kremlin. Yes, they are headquartered in Russia. They have world-class cybersecurity researchers. But right now, because they are headquartered in Russia, U.S. officials argue that they are subjected to Russian laws when it comes to handing over data and it is very much a geopolitical tug of war over this technology, Erica.",

This is, of course, close to Russia's border with Kazakhstan. Cities along the river have been left submerged. You can see just some of the water, the damage there. CNN's Isa Soares tells us, anger is also mounting over the government's lack of response.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Catastrophic flooding and thousands of lives upended across several regions in Russia, forcing many to evacuate with just their pets and a handful of belongings. At least three people are reported to have died so far. Authorities declared a state of emergency in the Orenburg region near Kazakhstan after the Ural, Europe's third longest river, swelled several meters and burst through a dam embankment in Orsk, a city of more than 200,000 residents. The anger there was palpable on Monday, with protesters chanting shame on you at local officials and Putin help over the government's response. No one is helping us here, a man in this crowd shouts. The state is doing nothing he says. The city mayor said the flood has now peaked according to Russian State News Agency TASS. And the Kremlin spokesperson described the deluge in these regions as inevitable due to an abnormal increase in water levels. Dmitry Peskov also said that President Vladimir Putin is currently not planning on visiting the affected areas. Across the border, in Kazakhstan, the country's president said the floods were his country's worst natural disaster in decades. In Russia, the country's emergency situations minister flew over some of the flooded zones on Tuesday to inspect the damage. And over in the Kurgan region, melting ice and torrential rains caused another river to overflow. This is not a joke, the regional governor says bluntly. Leave, take your papers, valuables, children, elderly relatives with limited mobility. You need to do this now, he says. Flood waters in Kurgan are expected to rise even higher over the next 48 hours, putting thousands more lives at risk and wreaking even more havoc. Isa Soares, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's up from 3.2 percent in February. It is the highest it has been since last September and the usual suspects are blamed here, rising gas prices and the high cost of housing. CNN's Matt Egan is with us now for a closer look at the numbers. Matt, what is the takeaway from these numbers?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, I think the takeaway is that this war against inflation is not over, right. I mean, put away those mission accomplished signs because the last mile of getting inflation back under control is proving to be more difficult than some had anticipated, right? So we are seeing that consumer prices, as you mentioned, up 3.5 percent year-over-year. Some context that is hotter than 3.2 percent, just the month before. This is hotter-than-expected, it is also the fastest pace in six months. So that's moving in the wrong direction. Month over month, we saw that prices were up by 0.4 percent between February and March, again, hotter-than-expected.That is no improvement from the month before. So why is this happening? Well, you touched on some of them, right, the price of gasoline, we know that has gone up. The price of housing, that continue just remain hot, and hotter than some people had expected. Some other big culprits here are the price of car insurance, shelter, medical care, all of them rising on a month over month basis. Now, that is not to say there is not some positives, right? We know that some things like the price of used cars, of new cars, those have gone down month over month, airfare as well. But when you -- and when you zoom out, you can also see that year-over-year inflation really has cooled. There has been a lot of progress. Remember, this figure peaked above 9 percent back in June of 2022. That's when gas prices were going through the roof and there were all these recession fears. So, the fact that it has gone from 9.1 percent or so down to 3.5 percent, that of course is progress. It is just not quite where it needs to be yet. And so this is not sitting well, as you might imagine, on Wall Street. We saw us stock futures were pointed to a slightly higher open before this number came out, not anymore. Look at that, Dow Futures down by 400-plus points, 1 percent; more than that for the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500. I think the concern here, Erica, is what does this mean for the Fed? A lot of investors had been hoping for interest rate cuts as soon as June, hoping for maybe three total rate cuts this year. But a number like this today, on top of the other inflation readings that have been hotter than expected, on top of the really strong Jobs Report, raises a lot of questions about whether the Fed is really going to be able to start cutting interest rates anytime soon.",
