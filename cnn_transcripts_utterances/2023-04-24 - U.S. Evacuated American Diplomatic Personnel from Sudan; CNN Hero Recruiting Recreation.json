U.S. officials said they do hope there`s an opportunity here, a ceasefire that holds a resolution between the two warring parties there, and an opportunity to reopen the embassy. But that is an enormous question as the fighting there enters its second week. The U.S. was looking for a window of opportunity, a ceasefire that holds essentially, to be able to evacuate the embassy itself. And the weekend brought that opportunity with the Eid al-Fitr Holiday. The two warring parties committed to the ceasefire, even though there were reports of violations of that ceasefire. Now, a large question, what about all the U.S. nationals, the private citizens who remain in the country? And there are thousands of them. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It means purple island in Spanish. And this place is known as the Sportfishing Capital of the World. Healthy coral reefs are essential to a healthy marine ecosystem. Well, after watching coral reefs disappear over the 20 years he lived in Florida, one man decided he wanted to build them back. But he knew he couldn`t do it alone. So he co-founded I.CARE. and recruited other divers to help rebuild reefs in Florida one coral at a time. Meet Mike Goldberg, one of our CNN heroes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE GOLDBERG, CO-FOUNDED I.CARE:  I love being underwater. The minute you go diving, the fish are right in your face. The interaction with that marine life is unlike anything I`d ever experienced. You`re close up in person with all the animals, all the fish, the lobster, the crustaceans. The Keys, in general, the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life used to be the best anywhere. The thriving coral reef is incredibly biodiverse. Multiple species coral, multiple species of fish, invertebrates, all living happily together. It`s kind of buzzing when you get down there. There`s so much activity. I can tell you what a dying and struggling reef looks like easily because it`s what I see most of the time now. Due to the water quality issues, rising temperature, acidification attracts algae. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease as incredibly virulent. Once you lose the coral, there`s nothing there. It`s a literal underwater desert. Good morning. You ready for the afternoon? DR. KYLIE SMITH, CO-FOUNDED I.CARE:  Yeah. You got 14.",

I was chasing money the whole time. It just wasn`t true to my core. So in 2004 we moved to Islamorada here in the Florida Keys and opened up a dive shop. You we`ve lost so much coral since I moved here 20 years ago. It truly is a pretty devastating number. What I saw here was so sad that I just wasn`t sure how to solve the problem. I`m just one guy who`s watched all of this loss. But then he said, you know what? I`m going to do something. I`m going to try something. It`s not in me to walk away. It wasn`t in me to just leave it to someone else to do. Our organization, I.CARE, focuses on the rebuilding of the coral reefs here in the Florida Keys.",

(Voice-over):  Our goal is to make our reef self-sustaining and that it requires putting down resilient core. So what we do is we`ll take multiples of that small piece of core, put them close together on a dead coral head, they fuse. And once they fuse, they`re now large enough to spawn in five to seven years. (On camera):  So we are speeding up that process. The coral reefs absolutely need human intervention to help. There is no way that this reef is going to bounce back all on its own. (Voice-over):  I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. I`m not a scientist, but what I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there. Let`s band together. Any certified diver with recent dive skill is able to come out with us and plant coral.",
