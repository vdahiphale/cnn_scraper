You know, life is 20 percent more expensive right now for people than it was when Kamala Harris and Joe Biden took office. And you go back to Donald Trump stays in office, when he left the White House 1.4 percent was the inflation rate. He wants to make sure that wage growth is meeting inflation and that we bring inflation down. If you recall, when he was in office, he doubled the child tax credit. He advocated for him passing paid family leave. These are important factors for working families out there, and he does not discount for a second how expensive life has become. We all as parents, I have two young kids, want to know that we can make this life in America a life for our kids that is better than the ones we are in right now. And for many people, it doesn't feel that way. That is very antithetical to the human spirit and human nature.
