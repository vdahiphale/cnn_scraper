Three of those people have, sadly, died, in this instant. The 20 others have been injured, five hospitalized, one of those people needed to get surgery. We don't yet know why the aircraft crashed. The recovery effort for the people who died is ongoing as well. We do know that these aircraft, these Ospreys, have had a bad track record of accidents in the past. Just last year in California and in Norway there were crashes of this aircraft. Nine U.S. military personnel dying then. So today while authorities looked over the cause, the potential cause of this crash, the Australian public waited with bated breath to find out more about the American personnel based here in a rotational force in the northern territory of Australia. Very concerned for their well- being. Of course, it was just weeks ago in a separate incident between U.S. and Australian personnel training together that an Australian helicopter went down, killing four personnel. Now, the prime minister has spoken today. We have also had a statement from the Australian defense minister praising the U.S. personnel who risk their lives in this training endeavor in Australia's north saying the gravity of that, the seriousness of that is real, of course, deadly potentially, as it was today and these brave people have lost their lives.

But that's something that former President Donald Trump is opposed to doing. A judge has set a case date for Chesebro in October. And so, it remains to be seen what that means for the rest of the defendants. Now, another issue here is whether this case is kept in state court or moved into federal court. We have seen five of the 19 defendants have made a request to move their case into federal court. This is significant because it would change the jury pool. In state court, it would be in Fulton County, which is a very blue county. But the federal court would expand the district and the jury pool potentially including more pro-Trump jurors. Now, we're going to see this play out on Monday when we get the first hearing about the venue of the case for Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff.
