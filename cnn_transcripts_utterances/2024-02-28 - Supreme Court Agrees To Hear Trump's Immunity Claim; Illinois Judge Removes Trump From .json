It's the heart of Trump's defense. Is the DOJ's case now in trouble? Also breaking right now, Trump on the hook for $454 million. The clock is ticking because a New York court has just ruled that he cannot get out of putting up the full amount. And Trump is saying he does not have the money. We'll give all you the details. And inside Putin's decision to use nuclear weapons. \"The Financial Times\" tonight obtaining secret Russia intelligence documents showing Putin could resort to using nukes just to stop, quote, aggression. It is a stunning report. The reporter who broke it will be OUTFRONT. So, let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC)",

The nation's highest court tonight saying justices will hear Trump's argument that he has absolute immunity for crimes he allegedly committed in office. In the one-page order, just one page, very clear to the point, the court writes that this is the key question that they'll answer. Quote, whether and if so, to what extent does the former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. Look, nothing matters more than this case before the Supreme Court. Now, this is a major decision. This one page is a major decision because the court could have simply said that it would not take up the case, and simply let the lower court decision stand. Something that would have been totally standard in a case where three judges had ruled unanimously and very narrowly that Trump was not immune. But that is not what the Supreme Court has done tonight, and the bottom line of this ruling that they're going to hear the case means delay. The Supreme Court will not even hear the case until the end of April. And that means if the court rules against Trump and the Justice Department's January 6 case against Trump goes ahead. It will begin later -- it will begin later, and every day matters in the countdown to Election Day, whether they're even as a full trial and a verdict by Election Day. The immunity claim now before the Supreme Court is at the core and the heart of the Justice Department's case against Trump. Because if Trump is immune from prosecution, from acts committed while he was president, then Jack Smith's case is over done. And Trumps lawyers have argued that he is immune from smiths criminal charges because even if Trump had ordered the military to assassinate a political rival, they say, if he did it while he was president, he couldn't be prosecuted. Of course, the three judges in the scathing rebuke from the lower court rejected Trump's argument. But now, the Supreme Courts nine justices will have the final say, and how the justices decide could have a profound impact on this election. Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb is standing by. First, though, I want to go to Evan Perez because he's OUTFRONT live in Washington. Evan, we just get this one page, many had expected that the court would just not take this up, right, and just let that lower court decision stand. That's not what they've done. What do you know about why? What do you know about how? Obviously, they took their time to make this decision. What do you know?",

But what we know from this is the fact that it takes five justices to grant this stay, which is something that they did.And that means that there's five justices who at least are trying to help Donald Trump, or at least agreeing to helped buy Donald Trump more time, which is after all, the entire strategy by the Trump campaign, and the legal strategy also by the former president, which is to buy time and to delay both of these trials, both of these federal trials until after the November election. And so with the fact that the justices took, you know, at least three weeks to make this decision, they could have made this decision and issued this order anytime in the last three weeks, they waited this three weeks and they've decided that they're not going to hear oral arguments, at least for another couple of months, it tells us that the effort by the Justice Department to try to get this case heard as quickly as possible because they said this was in the interests of the public, of the nation for this, for this case to go to trial and for a decision to be rendered, it means that that will not happen, anytime soon. Now, it's not impossible. But what it means is that, you know, certainly by the analysis of Joan Biskupic, we're looking at a decision from the Supreme Court, perhaps in June. And then, you know, the -- if you can get a trial restarted, the calendar is extremely crowded. By the time Donald Trump becomes presumably the Republican nominee. We should also note, Erin, that the Supreme Court is also, we're still waiting to hear from them on the 14th Amendment challenge in Colorado, right? The ruling by this Colorado Supreme Court. So, we widely -- everyone expects that Donald Trump will win that case. So at this point, we should point out also that the Supreme Court had the option, Erin, to hear this case if they wanted to take this up when Jack Smith went to them in December, they decided not to take it up then, but they have now decided that they do want to hear this case.",

I do want to go to Ty Cobb now, former Trump White House lawyer. Ty, look, they could have said let the lower court ruling stand. It was unanimous. It was three justices. They took three weeks to say that. They're not going to do that. They're actually going to hear this case and decide on the merits. Evan laying out that calendar that they could have made that decision in December. This puts a possible, you know, decision in June.

However, I'm disappointed.

So they got to go to the appeals court in Illinois for two days. The state is going to continue to look at it.And then so much is at stake at the U.S. Supreme Court. They already are looking at what Colorado did to remove him from on the ballot, how that could also affect the third state that has removed Trump from the ballot, Maine, that wasn't in a judicial proceeding. That was by the people who oversee the elections there. But the U.S. Supreme Court is ultimately going to have to come down on, is this something that states even can do in their primary elections, and would someone like Donald Trump potentially qualify is the office of the presidency, something that is applicable when you're looking at the insurrectionist clause of the U.S. Constitution. So, all of that is at stake here in this decision. It's not on hold waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule. So if they take a very long time and the Illinois state courts say, no, he can be removed from the ballot, then that may be it.

ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Knowing the facts of the case, Erin, and having been on the floor when Donald Trump incited and aimed the mob that pause the counting of the vote and led to the violence, I'm not surprised that a judge would find that he's disqualified because he committed insurrection, which, of course, the constitution says, if you do that you can't be on the ballot. Erin, I don't know if your viewers know this, but I was the only member who testified in the Colorado case and I did that a little bit reluctantly, because I'm competitive, and I want to beat Donald Trump, and the idea of MAGA and I want to do that this November, because I think doing that is the best reset we can have for democracy. But a plain reading of the Constitution suggests that if you've committed direction and it seems pretty clear that he did, that you can't be on the ballot.

He was worth less than $10 million when we put him up there at $400 million. He is -- he is -- he -- and I also want to say in 1989, he sent a letter to Forbes that I thought was really interesting and trying to inflate his net worth before he went bankrupt, when he was actually bankrupt, saying he had $700 million in marketable securities. That's very similar to the 400 million that he told the court in his deposition or $600 million, he claimed to have right now or believed he had. In that case, that was money that flowed through his account for one week to finance in junk bonds, the Taj Mahal Hotel. So he had an accountant literally write a letter about the money that was there that one week, even though it was never there again. And so I think the $400 million everyone says, well, wait, I thought he had $400 million. He never had it to begin with. It was working capital for loans and stuff and fiction. But I do want to say that I do think Letitia James and the New York state court will take his hundred million dollars in cash. The first thing they will do is take all the liquid assets. And because this is in receivership right now and carefully, he's not going to be able to funnel out. So they'll get that hundred million first, and that will be the beginning of the other guy. Just wanted to say, its going to take time to collect and it's going to tremendous ego, you know, collapse because he is probably not a billionaire and he's been avoiding the transparency around his fraud until now.
