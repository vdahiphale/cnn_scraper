And this was only several months after he left office, before we saw that huge fight ensue between the National Archives and Trump's legal team to get those documents back.And so I think this actually is very difficult for the Trump legal team to respond to. I mean, Jim Trusty last night in this interview that Abby and I did with him was essentially just criticizing the Justice Department for what he said was a leak, indicating that this story came from them. Obviously, it came from a lot of reporting that Paula, Katelyn and I did put together. And so I do think it is a struggle for them. And I think it raises a lot of questions about the legal exposure that Trump faces here and what argument his attorneys are going to make given their own client is on this recording that's in the hands of prosecutors saying that, you know, indicating he had this information, indicating that it was not declassified and that he couldn't share it with those who were in the room with him.

COLLINSTrump did respond to a print outlet to the Cedar Rapids Gazette. He didn't respond, just only shouted questions about this. But he did respond to them. He just essentially called it fake news and talked about how long he's been under investigation. Obviously, he's facing multiple investigation, not just this one with Jack Smith specifically but I do think there is a concern, because the sense among Trump's legal team, even has been that Jack Smith is going to make a decision soon on whether or not there are going to be indictments in this, and I think there are questions that Trump's legal team has about this. Tim Parlatore, Trump's former attorney, who has now left the team, still said earlier he doesn't think that the former president is going to be charged here. But the fact that this makes it not just about whether or not something is declassified but it's about a military plan that the former president apparently had in his possession, I think, that's what's raising the questions here, Trump himself though not speaking on camera about it today.",

But they do underscore that over the course particularly the last several weeks and several conversations by phone and Oval Office meeting with the president that McCarthy has been an honest broker, that he has been very clear throughout the entire process behind the scenes that there could not be a default and he empowered his negotiators, his top two deputies who are negotiating this with the White House team, to reach an agreement.And keep in mind, that might seem like a low bar avoiding default for the first time in the history of the country, but particularly after it took 15 votes for McCarthy to lock up the speakership just in the beginning of things, his act to have this moment and start to create a dialogue with the president is one that at least shows they can have it.

Interestingly, just in the last hour, we heard from a New Hampshire representative who has flipped his endorsement from Trump to DeSantis, of course, a big coup for the DeSantis campaign, and that representative saying it was really the last straw for him was the former president's treatment of his former press secretary, Kaleigh McEnany, who he attacked on Truth Social. This representative said that he doesn't see the former president as loyal and he doesn't think it's good for the country. So, he's now switched his endorsement.

They've been trying to orchestrate everything. And what we saw in that clip was a flash of DeSantis' temper. That's never a good thing to show to the American public.And we also saw that he probably doesn't have a great relationship with the mainstream media. I mean, to keep saying to a journalist, are you blind, are you blind, is not exactly a great exchange for him to have this early in the campaign. I think if I'm on DeSantis' staff and I'm watching that, I'm saying to the governor privately, you know, you got to cool it a little bit because you're going to get asked a lot of questions that you don't want to answer. And so far, they've tried to shelter his interactions with the media to kind of friendly media.",

And now when it's really happening, the people in those towns are saying, hey, you haven't been paying attention to us, but you begin to pay attention when Moscow is hit with drones. In other words, there are disparities in Russia, big ones, between the elite and regular people.And that, I think, is a problem for Putin. What does he say? Does he come out, you know, really strongly condemning, et cetera. They did say notably that Putin called the mayor of this town that's Shebekino. And even that, Alex, the people in town said people in the media, the state media can't even pronounce the name of our town, so they don't seem to care.",

WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think the attacks in the Belgorod region definitely have a military impact. Belgorod is a rail terminus. It was used as a staging area for the invasion in February of 2022. And it is probably still a logistics hub for some of the Russian forces in Luhansk. So, sure, we want to disrupt that. We want to take out as much as we can. We want to discombobulate the civilian leadership in the region as well so that repairs are more difficult with rail lines, bridges, warehouses and so forth.
