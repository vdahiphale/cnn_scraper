We're also hearing from residents less than a couple of miles from the center of Damascus that they are seeing rebels on the streets there.And this really fits the emerging picture that's developed hour by hour of rebels arriving from the south, from the east and from the north into those outer suburbs around the capital Damascus. We knew that there was a reconnaissance force of rebels inside the capital overnight last night. They were able to figure out that Bashar al- Assad wasn't at his normal places of residence, which was gave them to understand that effectively Assad was on the run somewhere. They're still looking for him. They don't know where he is. If he's left the capital, if he's somewhere else in the country, or even if he has left the country completely. But the picture that is emerging now, what is just a couple of hours after midnight there in Damascus, about 2:00 a.m. in the morning, is that rebels are now on the streets very close to the center and the military defenses that Assad's army, the police force, have it appears melted away. In fact, we saw 2,000 of Assad's army in military trucks. Some of those trucks hauling heavy weapons, fleeing out of Syria into Iraq, crossing the border and driving into Iraq. And this is not quite unprecedented, but it is utterly unheard of in the recent history. Assad's family has had an iron grip over Syria for the last 53 years. Here is his army fleeing into a neighboring country. Rebels on the streets of the capital. The president nowhere to be seen. And effectively the rebels, as you said, at the gates of Damascus and the gates seem to be open, and there's nobody behind the gates.",

In other words, sort of effectively fallen, if you will. This fits an emerging picture through the day where rebels have arrived from the north, the east and the south, getting into suburbs just right around the capital. Some of those suburbs about five miles from the center of the capital. That was sort of late afternoon early evening. But as we've gone into the night it's about 2:30 in the morning there in Damascus now. We now know that the rebels are on the streets. The residents are saying that they can hear some sorts of clashes going on, but adding to that mix, the fact that President Bashar al-Assad, his whereabouts are now unknown. The rebels last night had a reconnaissance force inside the capital looking for where he may be. They weren't able to locate him. He wasn't in his normal locations. They're still looking for him. They don't know if he's in the capital somewhere hiding out, somewhere else in the country, or even if he has left the country at this time, that is unclear. But the picture that is emerging here is Assad's defense forces essentially downing tools and running away, 2,000 of them were seen fleeing across the border with some of their heavy weapons into Iraq earlier this evening. So, the military defending the capital has gone. The president whose capital it was, has disappeared. The rebels are in the city. We're getting close to that point where until we hear from Assad, he effectively seems to be now ousted from power. This is something that's still in the process. It's not complete. We can't say that definitively, but the momentum where we stand at this minute right now, the momentum is heading in that direction. Obviously, we will have to see what happens in the morning and learn more details. But it's the rebels who are driving forward. It's the rebels who've arrived at the city gates, who have opened the city gates, have pushed through, found no one defending it and not found the president of the country there either.

All he owes is to the lawmakers and to President Trump himself. So, they really wanted President Trump to come out defending him. Now, we've heard that certainly in that clip. And so, I think that what folks are waiting now for is the background check, because, of course, you can deny all of these anonymous media reports. They, in their own words, saying that they didn't happen or you know, saying that he is a changed man but certainly what they can't deny is what could be in those background checks. So, I think that on the Hill, that is kind of where the conversation is right now.",

But we believe in redemption and what Pete brings to the table is a love for the military, a great education background, a great experience set. I think he's well-suited for the job, and he will shake up the status quo, which is why this pick is so important. That's what President Trump -- that's the common denominator.

Obviously, in a Senate confirmation process, the House doesn't really have any say at all. But seeing Mike Johnson out there speaking for in favor of Pete Hegseth, certainly, you know, is good for Pete Hegseth.But it is interesting just how different it is when you go to the Senate. Some of those senators, again, on six-year terms, not two-year terms, are a little more willing to or could be a little more willing to buck Trump in some way.",

But certainly there are going to be certain things that they are just unable to accept and, you know, maybe some of that womanizing, those womanizing allegations aren't the biggest deal for most of the people.But certainly, the drinking allegations I've heard from a number of folks on both sides of the aisle are a bigger, bigger deal. And they're waiting to see what that background check shows. I mean, when you think about Speaker Mike Johnson and other House Republicans coming to the defense of Pete Hegseth, he went over to that side of Capitol Hill and asked them to rally around him, to put pressure on these Senate Republicans who may want to be more independent or who may want to buck some of Trump's nominees. Basically saying that I need you guys to support me, and so, here you're seeing Mike Johnson speak out. You're probably going to be seeing more and more of them speak out over the next two weeks, really trying to ramp up the pressure on Senate Republicans potentially, maybe even those female Senate Republicans who do take issue with some of the allegations of sexual assault and other type of womanizing allegations that we've seen in the media over the last five, six, seven days. And so, I think you're going to see more of an effort to kind of circle around Pete Hegseth trying to defend him, certainly, at least until that background check process comes up, Jessica. But of course, right, what we don't know is what we don't know, which is are there more allegations waiting and any more allegations makes it that much more difficult for him to stay in this confirmation process.",

President Biden reportedly considering announcing these preemptive pardons for people who may be targeted by the Trump administration for prosecution once he takes office. We know that Congressman Jim Clyburn has been a proponent of this, Senator-elect Adam Schiff, though, who might be one of those people considered for a pardon.Again, though we need to underscore, none of these people have done anything illegal. There are no charges against them. But Schiff is reportedly urging the president not to do this, saying it would come off as, quote defensive and unnecessary. What are you hearing about this?",

So, really rebounding as that Arctic air gets kicked out.We've got temperatures 10, 15, even 20 degrees warmer than they were this time yesterday in some locations. And it's because that arctic air that's kind of been in place since Thanksgiving is finally exiting, and its letting some warmer air come in and temperatures will start to go on the other side of average. We will start to find highs continuing in the 50s and 60s across the eastern half of the country on Sunday about five to 10 degrees above normal; in some places, 20 degrees above normal. Same thing going into Monday as well. We'll find these temperatures pretty warm even up towards New York. Highs in the 50s, about seven degrees above normal. Now, when you look at the forecast in New Orleans, you've got these temperatures in the 70s, warm and above average. But look at what happens, it comes with rain. What's happening is, is they're kicking out the cold air with a storm. And that storm is going to linger in the Gulf over the next couple of days and could cause a limited flood threat. We have multiple days of a flooding risk along the Gulf Coast on Monday and Tuesday. We have a level two out of five slight risk there for parts of New Orleans, the Florida Panhandle. On Tuesday, it starts to stretch up towards Atlanta and then even getting up into the Carolinas and it's because the system is kind of slow moving and the way that its positioned, the moisture in the Gulf of Mexico will just continue to feed into it and funnel it. So, we'll continue to find some of this rain that could be heavy at times. We could find rainfall rates two inches per hour at times. So you have a lot of rain falling in a short amount of time. And some of these areas have saturated soil, so they can't really take that much more rain. So, something that well need to watch overall looking at some three to five inches of rain possible -- Jessica.",
