NSC Spokesman John Kirby also saying it is not the U.S.'s intention to put American boots on the ground, and also saying that there is so far no smoking gun in his words to directly tie Iran to these attacks. All that to say, it is a fluid and evolving situation, and the White House acknowledges that new information is being obtained every single minute. Kayla Tausche, CNN, the White House.

      "sentences": "Well, this is such a dramatic unfolding of events. It's very hard to know. There is some reason for cautious optimism that it will not spread further. Hezbollah seems to be maintaining a limited response, of course, showing sympathy as Iran is. Iran is denying involvement directly in these attacks. Israel doesn't look like it would want to open -- it's certainly prepared -- but open another front when it has this pending conflict that is unfolding in Gaza. So there's a number of reasons for restraint.On the other hand, this -- these set of events in Gaza have completely surprised everyone. So a lot of assumptions are really turned upside down. So I think anything is possible now. And of course, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a shadow war for years, not to mention the uptick in violence in the West Bank over the past nine months. So I think there's a lot of room for worry about this escalation. Especially and depending on how events on the ground in Gaza do unfold.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. There's a lot of controversy about this. What -- it's hard to know. I think anybody saying anything definitively at this early stages is probably doesn't have full information. It -- what is interesting is Iran is denying a role. IDF spokesperson does not believe Iran had a direct role. And the U.S. is kind of playing down a direct Iranian role. So whether or not, no question the Iranians are strong supporters militarily, politically, ideologically, especially with Palestinian Islamic Jihad but growing ties with Hamas. But the role, direct role, I think, is uncertain.If there are reasons to believe Iran would not want a big shake up and have a confrontation with Israel. And for that matter, it would be the United States under these circumstances, the U.S. is strongly backing Israel. U.S. citizens were among those killed and likely held hostage. So this is a -- you know, Iran was doing actually pretty well in the region on its own terms. It had suppressed domestic unrest, it had been normalizing ties with the broader Arab region, and it had cut some deals with the United States to get its own prisoners out, some frozen funds released. So the idea that I'd want to shake things up and have a direct conflict I think does not seem logical. But again, I think in this new landscape we're in, we all need to test our previous assumptions. It is not clear and again depending on how events unfold, there could be tremendous pressure for engagement even if the logic suggests that actors would not want this kind of conflict.",

That is what you're looking at.Dalia, just finally back to you. It goes without saying that in Western liberal democracies at least, the leaders depend on the publics either approval or indifference to whatever decisions or stances that they take. And though plenty of leaders are denouncing these pro-Palestinian rallies and reaffirming their support for Israel, they are still happening.

MICHAL OHANA, SURVIVED ATTACK ON MUSIC FESTIVAL (through translator): I really don't know. It's a miracle. It's a miracle -- a miracle because people who were next to me did not get out alive. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With a bullet in her leg and shrapnel in her stomach, 27-year-old Michal Ohana considers herself one of the lucky ones. But when rocket sirens sounded at the Nova Music Festival in Southern Israel and Hamas militants began killing and kidnapping hundreds of festival goers, Michal's fate was far from sealed. OHANA (through translator): It was just shooting and shooting, whoever that could run ran, and then others got killed. DIAMOND (voice-over): After bullets pierced the windows of the car she and her boyfriend were trying to escape in, Michal soon found refuge in a small shed, crammed in with at least 50 other people. OHANA (through translator): There were already people who were injured. Some in their legs, some on their backside, some in their heads. I had a scarf on me and somebody next to me was bleeding, so I gave her a tourniquet on her leg. DIAMOND (voice-over): Minutes later, shots rang out. OHANA (through translator): There was silence for a few minutes and the police woman who was there with us simply screamed. Whoever wanted to be alive needs to leave now. Those who could leave, left. Those who couldn't, I don't know what happened with them. DIAMOND (voice-over): Michal and her boyfriend took off running. But Michal panicked, but her legs buckled, her boyfriend dragged her across the ground and managed to shove her into the window of passing vehicle. But at every turn, more Hamas fighters. OHANA (voice-over): They just went with white pick-up trucks. On each pick-up truck there were at least 20 terrorists with Kalashnikov grenade guns, shotguns, machine guns. I've never seen anything like this in my life. DIAMOND (voice-over): Seemingly encircled, Michal once again jumped out of the car and began running before finding an abandoned army tank on the side of the road. Bullets reached her there too. Hiding under the tank, Michal was shot in the leg. Shrapnel from a grenade pierced her stomach. OHANA (through translator): And in that time, we didn't see, we couldn't see anything, and they were taken, some people were taken. DIAMOND (voice-over): For six more hours, Michal lay lying underneath that the tank until Israeli soldiers rescued her and evacuated her to Hadasa hospital, where she was one of more than 60 victims treated.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, we're seeing ripple effects across a number of markets, a number of asset classes. I think what we're seeing is that there was initial -- an initial shock, which in some areas has subsided, but now I think it's just a waiting game and watching to see how this plays out. If it spreads through the region, that will be critical, for example, for the oil markets. We saw oil, of course, surge on Monday. It's pretty flat today, it's just slightly higher. You see there, it's actually very flat right now.I think the question is of course, if this spreads for oil, right? Israel is not a supplier of oil. So this is not an immediate supplier risk. But of course, if we see any issues with Iran, the Strait of Hormuz that it would be the worst-case scenario if that was affected. That's what people are watching for there. We're also monitoring natural gas futures, particularly in Europe this morning. Because Chevron said on Monday that the Israeli authorities had told them to shut down one of their gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean. That was a gas field that supplied some 70 percent of the gas that Israel used for power generation, that has been shut down. Natural gas futures went up 12 percent on Monday. They're up again some 4 or 5 percent this morning. Israel can still get gas from another gas field in the eastern Mediterranean, but that is something certainly the markets are watching. And the other thing that we're paying close attention to is the currency, the shekel. Because that has been -- well, it's been falling pretty steadily throughout this year. It fell again on this conflict. It's now slightly higher, again, pretty flat even with unprecedented central bank intervention by Israel on Monday to try to stabilize that currency. I think that reflects the level of uncertainty out there right now over how this. Is going to play out.",

There was a warning from the FAA, the U.S. regulator, to pilots, saying that while they're not putting in restrictions that this is a potentially hazardous situation, which seems a bit of an understatement, under the circumstances.Look, this is not like we saw with Ukraine, where the airspace was shut down literally on day one of the war. There are still flights coming in. A spokesperson for the Israeli flag carrier El Al told Reuters that they're actually adding flights to try and bring in reservists who of course have been called up by the Israeli Government.
