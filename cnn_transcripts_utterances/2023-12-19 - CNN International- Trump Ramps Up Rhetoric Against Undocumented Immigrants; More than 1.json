That is really a one of the major challenges they're facing right now. Even though on paper the epicenter is only some 100 kilometers or 60 miles away from the provincial capital city of Lanzhou where residents, by the way, also felt strong tremors overnight.But the quake zone itself is largely mountainous and rural, sparsely populated and some of the roads have been cut off by mudslides and also damaged infrastructure hampering the rescue effort. Now the other factor really of the obstacle here is the weather condition. Much of northern China, including that part of the country, has been under a cold snap in the past few days. Overnight temperatures in the quake zone reaching minus 15 degrees Celsius That's about 5 degrees Fahrenheit. That kind of bitter cold weather obviously slowing down the rescuers as well. Not to mention this could shorten the so-called golden window of about 72 hours after a major quake for people to survive under the debris. And even those who managed to escape the quake also impacted by the weather condition as they now seek a shelter amid numerous aftershocks. But already we've seen some local officials able to set up tents in villages or towns, Starting to a hand out food and other supplies. The Chinese military joining in the effort as well. Flying a large transport aircraft carrying 14 tons of supplies, including special vehicles, as well as personnel. That's in addition to the more than 1,600 firefighters already on the scene. But given the weather condition and the remote location of this quake, time is really of the essence here -- Max.",
