The driver is asleep. How many attempts are made to wake him and then essentially ensure that he does no harm?Once they're in the car, then the other question is, why were they able to do -- the one thing you'd want to do when you're in the car is ensure that it does not move. Once the car is moving, they've lost control of the situation. So, there are legitimate questions to be raised. On the counter to this, they -- maybe they did try to wake him in the in the moments before and we were -- we are not privy to what that was, and he may not have been responsive. And then it is clear that when the accident occurs, they do try to revive him. So, this is not your typical case of police brutality essentially, you know, trying to kill an unarmed passenger or -- there are enough questions about this case and certainly about jurisdiction. What did the Metropolitan Police Department do? Why were the Park Police in the situation they were in that is worthy of investigation at this stage.",

January 6th, Lafayette Park, you know D.C. because of its territorial status does not have -- has a very different jurisdictional structure. Why does that matter to the average citizen? Because this does sound a little bit cold when we're talking about unarmed and dead teenager is who is investigating it, and then what legal authorities would apply?So, D.C. under protocol, I should say, the Metropolitan Police Department have a lead here. So, they will be investigating this case, even though it involves the Park Police. The U.S. attorney's office, the federal jurisdiction, what we view that and determine whether there should be intervening federal charges. So, it's very complicated for citizens of D.C. What I'd have to say is, there's a lot of training between the state, the local -- or I should, say D.C. and federal agencies. But it does matter who in fact fired the shot. The police -- Park Police are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior, this is a lot of governmental boxes at play now, and those officers are now under protocol are now on leave simply because this is rare. I looked it up before I went on air. I think the last time there was a Park Police shooting of a civilian was over 60 years ago at this stage.",

I should say that both of these are declines. And what this really signifies is an economy that is slowing but normalizing after years of really strong growth in the labor market. Let's take a look at sectors in terms of where we're seeing jobs being lost and where we're seeing jobs being added. So, we look at jobs being lost, manufacturing, financial activities, professional and businesses are all losing jobs.
