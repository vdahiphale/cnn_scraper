      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing a busy news day with us. President Biden again taps the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 15 million barrels is barely one day of what America consumes, but the price of gas is hurting. Democrats' midterm prospects and the announcement from the president next hour, an effort to show he is trying to ease your pain at the pump.Plus, a preview an important one from the man who would the speaker. No blank check for Ukraine. A promise to boot Democrats from committees, no promise to rule out cutting social security and Medicare. Kevin McCarthy gives a big window into his agenda, should Republicans take back the House and martial law. Russia signs off on new decrees direct from Vladimir Putin trying to exert more power over Ukraine. Up first for us, though President Biden in a new move designed to help your budget a bit. And he hopes also maybe improve his party's midterm outlook some. In just a short while, the president announces a batch of new oil, drawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, some 15 million barrels and his energy team today won't rule out releasing more oil over the winter. Team Biden hopes adding a little more supply to the market keeps prices stable, maybe even helps drive them down a bit. The hope is voters see this as proof the president is doing whatever he can to help in an election year. We're worried about inflation and the economy are a big drag on Democrats. Let's get straight to the White House live to our CNN's Phil Mattingly. Phil, tell us more?",

      "sentences": "Look, there are a few things that the individuals in the building behind me care about more than gas prices. Yes, it has a massive effect on consumers, but the political effect is very clear. There is a correlation between the president's approval between consumer sentiment, between really the prospects for Democrats in the midterm elections, it's pretty clearly tied directly to what the prices are at the pump. And that was brought into more of an acute reality when OPEC plus decided to lower its output targets by 2 million barrels.Now, keep this in mind, John, administration officials I have been talking to have long been planning to try and deploy other tools in the weeks leading up to the election to try and dampen gas prices. The OPEC decision really accelerated that effort and expanded it, including this 15-million-barrel release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's actually part of the 180 million barrels unprecedented amount that the president pledged to deploy over a six-month period. The bigger issue though, is the commitment for future releases if they feel like it's a necessity, this is something that sent a very clear message to the market that may shave some sense. And yes, that matters off of the price at the pump here. You're also going to see the president take a direct shot at oil executives and gas companies, again, a regular focus of his trying to reduce the spread between what you're seeing at the retail level on gas prices and what you're seeing at the wholesale level as well. There's some correlation there, officials tell me in terms of prices, this underscores just how important this issue is for the White House, how important the issue is for consumers. Generally, the president also holding an infrastructure event today, talking about battery supply chains, $2.8 billion in grants, that's an inflation issue. That's the cost issue. Also, the 12 states that will benefit some of them, Georgia, Nevada, York, Michigan, you might be familiar with those states and the importance of them in the next three weeks or so, John.",

So, the next 20 days, so important in districts like this, as Democrats try and make this a choice election.Yes, abortion is still very much an important issue, particularly here in Michigan, where abortion rights is also actually on the ballot or voters are being asked to decide if they want to add that to the state constitution.

The speaker of the House is traveling quite a bit in these final weeks to try to help Democrats with turnout. An interesting interview published in Punchbowl today, I want to read a piece of it about inflation. This is the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Inflation is there, but it's global and not as bad as it is in some countries. We'll have to message it better in the next three weeks ahead. I think we're in great shape. Other people don't want to believe that. The part about, we'll have to message it better in the next three weeks ahead. On the one hand, many voters don't tune in until it's late. On the other hand, if you need to message it better, three weeks from election day, when in some states people are already voting. That's a concession that we have a problem.",

Now, of course, she's the Democrat. She's going to say that. However, we know we've seen elections, that the economy is top of mind, and we've seen that the party and power thrown out.

It's the first medical update directly from a medical professional since, since - he's made since June, he suffered a stroke. Fetterman did back in May. The letter says, the Democrat is recovering well from that stroke and has no work restrictions.Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, I know you've had a chance to look at the letter from Dr. Clifford Chen. A, what stands out at you and just from somebody who does this for a living? Is there anything missing? Is there any data or data point? If you're trying to assess, how's he doing? Is he getting better? Did you'd like to see here? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, in terms of what this letter reveals, I mean, the big issue, the big question regarding his speech and his ability to understand, they talk a lot about that here. And Dr. Chen, who's his general practitioner says, Fetterman speech was normal. He was able to speak intelligently without any cognitive deficits. He does have auditory processing disorder, which is something that we talked about last week, John. Dr. Chen said this auditory processing disorder comes across as hearing difficulties more than anything else. Interestingly, he makes a note here that this auditory processing seems to be localized to language, to words, but for example, he could hear music and process music without difficulty. So really making the case. This isn't a hearing problem, it's an auditory processing problem. This isn't a comprehension problem, given that he's able to still speak intelligently, did not have evidence of cognitive sort of deficit. In terms of your second question, John. I mean, we still haven't heard really what the underlying issue was that may have caused this stroke in the first place. It sounds like it was a pretty serious event back in May, he had to have a defibrillator place and he had to have a pacemaker placed at the same time. So, what exactly was going on there, he had a procedure to remove a blood clot from a blood vessel inside his brain. Again, I don't want to minimize what had happened to him at that point. But now, five months later, what his doctor is saying, Dr. Chen, is that these exams have continued to improve and that he is fit. This is the last line he is fit for duty for public office.",

As physical exam was normal, the letter says blood pressure 115 and over 82, heart rate 80, pulse oximetry 97 percent on room air. Where's that put him on the spectrum?DR. GUPTA: You know, all these numbers look good. I looked at all those lab values as well. I will tell you that the other thing that Dr. Chen writes here is that that Lieutenant Governor Fetterman takes appropriate medications to help control these things. We aren't told at least in this letter, what those medications are. And the big question is, you know, what would those lab values be like, if he was not taking these medications? Nevertheless, what the underlying issues are that may have led to the stroke and any other health problems seem to be adequately controlled or addressed with these medications, which is what I think Dr. Chen is saying here. So again, functional issue in terms of auditory processing, more than cognitive and good health, you know, numbers overall.",

This debate is going to answer that question for the voters.And the open question is whether Dr. Oz is going to be more like he was in an interview recently, where he was more like you would want a physician to be a little bit more empathetic, or whether he's going to go for the jugular like his campaign has done when he's on stage with him.",
