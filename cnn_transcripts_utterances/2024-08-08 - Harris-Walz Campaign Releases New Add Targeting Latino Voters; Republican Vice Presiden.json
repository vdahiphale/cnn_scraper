And the question is going to be how this registers with voters now.I will note one of the top people on the Trump campaign right now is Chris LaCivita, who is a longtime Republican strategist who was one of the masterminds behind the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004. And he's a veteran himself.

Here are the facts: Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005 to launch a campaign for Congress, months before his unit announced a potential deployment to Iraq. His unit was deployed two months after he retired. Vance served four years in the Marine Corp as an enlisted combat correspondent though he says he did not see combat and deployed to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal. For more insight on Walz's record, I want to bring in Charles Djou who served with Tim Walz in Congress and is now endorsing him. And it should be noted, you're a Republican and you are now endorsing Tim Walz, a Democrat. You are a veteran, what do you think of JD Vance's attack on Tim Walz? CHARLES DJOU (R), FORMER US REPRESENTATIVE: Well, good morning. Thanks for having me on. Let me get begin by just saying, as an Afghanistan war veteran myself, I think Tim Walz gave 24 years of honorable service to our nation. That's something to be commended, as is Senator Vance's years of service in the Marine Corps when less than one percent of Americans are stepping up and taking the oath of office to serve on our nation's military.
