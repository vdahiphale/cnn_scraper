If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories at this hour.At least 20 tornadoes have been reported across the U.S. Southeast. Tornado watch alerts are in place for parts of Alabama and Mississippi. And a federal court investigating the January 6th Capitol riots has convicted the leader of the Oath Keepers and an associate for seditious conspiracy. Now to some breaking news out of China. State media are reporting that the former leader Jiang Zemin has died of leukemia and organ failure at the age of 96. He served as president from 1993 to 2003 and met with world leaders from Bill Clinton to Vladimir Putin, to Fidel Castro. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has a look at the life and legacy of the former Chinese leader. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was the communist hardliner with a softer side. Jiang Zemin was also a shrewd and cunning politician. He rose to the pinnacle of power after massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He didn't order the crackdown but was handpicked by the man who did, supreme leader Deng Xiaoping. A year after the bloodshed Jiang Zemin told America's ABC News, it was, quote, much to do about nothing. At first, he was written off by most as a political light weight who wouldn't last. He was known as the flower pot. Lots of decoration and no action. But history would prove them wrong.",

BILL CLINTON, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT: On this issue we believe the policy of the government is on the wrong side of history. STOUT (voice-over): But he never gave ground on political reforms and explained why during a rare interview with CNN. JIANG ZEMIN, FORMER CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): I do think that to require all countries to adopt the same model of democracy would itself be undemocratic. STOUT (voice-over): He was leader when Hong Kong was handed back to the mainland, when Beijing was awarded the Olympics and business people were allowed to become communists. In 2003 he retired as president, a year after that he gave up his last post as Chinese military commander, completing the first smooth leadership transition ever in communist China. I want to thank you for accepting my resignation, he said at the time. Jiang still exerted political influence behind the scenes for years, including the selection of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping who secured a norm busting third term as party head. Xi, China's most powerful leader in decades, has eviscerated political rivals including those in Jiang's faction and rolled back much of the economic and personal freedoms enjoyed during the Jiang era. In retirement Jiang reportedly Saying an aria at Beijing's National Grand Theater before it was officially opened. For man who once ruled more than a billion people, the performance was said to be the fulfillment of a lifetime ambition. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is almost 14,000 feet tall and most of the eruptions in its historical record which has covered the last 200 years occur somewhere near the summit region which is quite a ways from any population center many tens of miles. Different parts of the volcano are more or less steep. And so, the steepness of the volcano determines how fast the lava can flow down towards the coast and affect the population centers.Fortunately, the current eruption is happening in the northeast sector of the volcano where the slopes are the most gentle. But in the past if lava flows from there have reached population centers, it's taken multiple weeks. So, there would be plenty of warning if that were to be how the eruptions proceed.",

You might be familiar with Kilauea Volcano which is much more active volcano that sits just next to it. It's been erupting nearly continuously since the mid-1980s. So, this difference of behavior where Kilauea erupts for very long periods of time.Mauna Loa tends to have short and more intense eruptions although, you know, much like a mutual fund, we can't predict what the future will be based on the past but we can say with some confidence that we anticipate that the eruption will likely be short lived.",

      "sentences": "So, the -- much like many volcanos in the world that are near population centers, there's a lot of instrumentation both on the volcano as well as measurements made from satellites. They detect things like changes in the shape of the volcano. We call this ground affirmation. We detect earthquakes and we detect volcanic gases. And there was an uptick in activity. It wasn't a dramatic uptick. It was sort of a gradual increasing of activity over the last year really starting to step up during this past summer. And this caused the combination of the volcano observatory, which is run by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the local civil defense officials, to start to warn the local population that an eruption might be coming and to prepare.Interestingly enough, this volcano had a couple of other periods of similar unrest in the last 10 to 15 years which then proceeded to not have an eruption. So even, you know, though the precursor activity was indicative of something going on, we weren't sure if it was going to erupt until just right before it happened.",
