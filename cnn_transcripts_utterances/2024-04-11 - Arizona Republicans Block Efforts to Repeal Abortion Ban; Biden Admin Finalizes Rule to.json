And they say this is the result of that policy. President Biden's campaign just today unveiling a new ad in the state of Arizona with exactly that message.

But certainly, Harris has been taking up the mantle of this messaging for some time. She's made two trips to Arizona and has been crisscrossing the country, arguing for reproductive freedoms.

So tell us how this is going to work here.[04:40:00] DETTELBACH: Right, so Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which redefined this notion of what is engaged in the business, which had already by the way been the law for a long time since the 60s. But there was a lot of non-compliance. So people were out there who were engaging in the business of dealing firearms and we were seeing that increasingly they were doing it without a license. So you have the people who are following the rules, the businesses who are licensed firearms dealers, they're running background checks. They're selling guns with records so the cops could trace a gun when it's used in a crime, catch the killer. And then you have a group of people who are selling guns without running background checks, right, not licensed as firearms dealers, not keeping records. And whether you're doing that out of your trunk of your car or at a gun show or on some new social media platform, it doesn't matter. What this rule says and what Congress's law says is that if your predominant intent is to earn a profit and you're engaged in the business, you need a license no matter where you do that conduct.",

There's a process to do this that's an inclusive process. We got 387,000 public comments submitted to ATF based on that proposed rule.We reviewed each and every one of them. We have now addressed them publicly in a 400-page document where we look at the comments, talk about their merits, and we've made some changes to the final rule based upon some of the comments that we got. And designed a system based on years of experience that shows the kind of particular conduct that's likely to indicate that somebody's in business, right, and not a private collector or just, you know, making a private sale, let's say, to a family member. Like, for instance, practical things. If you take credit cards for payment. If you've registered with your state licensing authority as a business, right, that's a pretty good hint you're in business. If you've gotten certain kinds of business security with centralized business monitoring. If you stock inventory and turn it over, over and over again. If you have the same kind of gun that you're selling in stock, that's right, that's not as much like a collection as it is business inventory. We also set forth, based on the comments, some specific things that are not likely to mean that a person is presumed to be engaged in the business. Like if they're only providing firearms as gifts or to family members or occasionally to other actually licensed dealers, right? So what we're trying to do here is to make it crystal clear the actual kinds of conduct so that people hopefully begin complying with the law because it's deadly consequences.",

This provision doesn't implicate people's Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Thousands of dealers are out there doing this the right way now.And let me just say one last thing about that for people who are looking at fundamental fairness. It is unfair to a federal licensed firearms dealer who's spending the extra time, effort, and money to obey the rules and run these background checks, right? That sitting over there is somebody who's flouting the law, dealing the felons, and making money off it. So there's a fairness issue in addition to the public safety issue here.
