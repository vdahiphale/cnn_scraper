Congressman, thank you so much for being with us.Before we get into the speaker's job, I want to talk about aid to Ukraine. You were just there. Why do you think this aid is so important? REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY):  The Ukrainians are desperate. They need our help right now. There were power plants destroyed last night. There are missiles coming in. They're running out of ammunition. As the prime minister of Japan said the other day, the United States is the indispensable nation. They need us right now. There are some people that are just sad and anxious and frustrated by the behavior of the United States of America. There are other people, including allies of ours, that are mad at us.

Now, they want to break it up into the four pieces to maybe get it so we don't have to go through suspension votes.

So if it goes through the Rules Committee, then you just need a majority. If it doesn't go through the Rules Committee, you need 290 people.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan -- he's now saying that the sanctions will also target entities supporting Iran's defense ministry. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem with much more on this.

One poll that we haven't been able to fully verify -- but it suggests that three-quarters of people here really do want the leadership to listen to what international allies are saying because they don't want to lose that significant defense support that they have. And I was speaking last night with a former senior defense official here -- intelligence official here who was actually involved in two of Israel's most significant strikes back -- threats in the region. He was the fighter pilot that dropped a bomb on Iraq's nuclear reactor back in '98 -- 1981 and 2007. He put together the plan to take out Syria's nuclear reactor as well. Look, his read of the situation is Iran reads this increasing tension between the United States, particularly between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, is being read by Iran as weakness, and that was why Iran believed it could strike back over the weekend. So this support from the international community for Israel is a vital part of Israel's defense, and that's why people feel strongly about it.",

So the three major drugmakers that committed to these $35.00 caps are GSK, Boehringer Ingelheim, and AstraZeneca. Unfortunately, none of those three major drugmakers make three of the drugs that kids rely on -- the youngest children -- to prevent asthma attacks. Those asthma inhalers are called generic fluticasone -- or Flovent -- that used to be made by GSK but it took the branded version off the market in January and a different company makes the authorized generic version. Another one is called Asmanex and one is called Alvesco. Now, these can be $100.00 to $300.00, or even more per month out-of-pocket. Even with insurance coverage, if that comes in -- and it doesn't always -- these can be very expensive. And what's important to know about these is little kids need this kind of device. This is called a spacer. You have a metered dose of haler that basically gives you an aerosol. And little kids can just breathe out of this face mask and that makes sure they get their medication. Those three drugs are the only ones that can work for these little kids. And doctors and parents are telling us they can't get these because a) their insurance might not cover them; b) one of them is in shortage -- Asmanex; and they can just be really, really hard to find.

She was doing really well on Flovent until the discontinuation came and her insurance stopped covering the drug. Her doctor at Johns Hopkins, Christi Sadreameli, and her team had to sort of fight with insurance. It took six weeks, finally, for them to get a drug that worked.

This comes just a few weeks after President Biden publicly opposed the sale of U.S. steel to Japan, saying that it is vital that the company remain American-owned. Now, the president today will also highlight efforts by the administration to crack down on China's efforts to flood the market with cheap products -- essentially, making it more difficult for U.S. companies who are trying to sell higher quality products but at higher prices. Now, these announcements today come as the president is also seeking to insulate himself from GOP criticism, including from former President Donald Trump, that he is weak on China. Trump really made these tariffs on Chinese imports a key focal point of his global economic strategy in office. And he has also proposed increasing tariffs across the board if he is elected to a second term. Now, while Trump spent most of the start of the week in a New York City courtroom facing criminal trial, President Biden currently is on a three-day swing through the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania. His main argument to voters here has been trying to say that the two men fundamentally have differing views on how to approach the economy. Biden making the argument that he is looking out for the middle class, turning to his roots here in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, while arguing that Trump is on the side of the wealthy.

Not -- and even when he's on the campaign trail we don't really hear him talking about the people he's actually there to speak to. So I think that's a real contrast.",

We would be taking the word of those who are inside the courtroom on what took place and what happened.But I want to go back real quick to a word that Karen used -- unfair. And if you look at polling, especially an AP poll that came out yesterday, the American people see these prosecutions against Donald Trump -- a decent number -- plurality -- 44 percent think the New York prosecutors are being unfair to Donald Trump. Forty-two percent think the Georgia prosecutors are being unfair. Forty-five percent think federal prosecutors are being unfair. So I think some of that -- his anger in that courtroom -- he's channeling what a large segment of the American people feel about what's happening in that courtroom.",

New video shows the moment that the Coast Guard basically airlifted her. She was on a Disney ship near Puerto Rico. The 35-year- old was reportedly experiencing serious health complications.Newly unsealed court documents show that if New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez testifies in his upcoming trial on criminal bribery charges, he may blame his wife Nadine. According to the documents, Menendez says that -- may say that she withheld information leading him to believe nothing unlawful was taking place. Both Menendez and his wife have pleaded not guilty to the charges. So, this morning, we're hearing from the valedictorian from the University of Southern California who will not speak at her college graduation. The school says safety concerns for the ceremony led them to pull the plug. Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim, says they are trying to silence her. She met with university officials and joined CNN Abby Phillip to discuss the details of that meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASNA TABASSUM, 2024 VALEDICTORIAN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: I expressed an opinion through a link that I had on my Instagram. The hate and the vitriol that was unleashed towards me after I think was part of the reason that the university caved in. And so, when it comes to being a free speech issue, sure, maybe my valedictory speech is a privilege. But at the end of the day, my views -- the views that I have expressed and the views that USC has instilled within me as well were stifled and were subject to hate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
