It's not uncommon for business leaders to talk to the administration or even the president and then to have those kinds of conversations. That's happened a lot.

He's somebody who has stepped in, in the past to try to stabilize the situation in 2008, again in 2011. But he can also give them counsel that says, here's what it takes to make sure we don't make some of the same mistakes that have been made in the past. That's important too.",

He lived through 2008 and 2009, first as a Senator and then in 2009 when he was vice president. And he has a couple of things on his mind. One, is he's drawing a very clear distinction between, you know, quote, unquote, bailing out the banks. What you saw in 2008 that it was an effort to try to shore up banks that were in trouble.They're not doing right now -- they're not putting taxpayer money into it. We've heard them say this over and over again. They want to make sure that there is an understanding that the money that is being used in this case is coming from other banks. Or it's coming from insurance premiums that banks themselves have paid to shore up depositors. So, if he's drawing that distinction to say we are trying to protect people who put their money into these banks. But at the same time, they are calling for Congress to impose tougher rules on bank executives who mismanaged risks and makes mistakes. Try to claw back some of that income, maybe impose fines. So, there is a real effort to learn from the legacy of 2008 and not make the same mistakes politically that they have exposed Democrats the last time.",

And Sara, these sources say prosecutors believe this is not just a homegrown effort but one that extends outside state lines. What evidence are Georgia prosecutors working with here? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTof evidence they're sifting through. I mean, remember that special grand jury that was seated for months and months, heard from 75 witnesses, heard from a number of associates and allies of Donald Trump who were working not just in Georgia to push these claims of election fraud but were also working across a number of different states. We also know there are at least three recording where Donald Trump is on tape pressuring Georgia officials around the 2020 election results. But I think, you know, one of the things the district attorney there is looking at, is whether you can build a case, essentially that Donald Trump and his allies are part of this criminal enterprise. That would be the potential racketeering case and really make the argument that this is something that originated from the top down, not the bottom up. Again, no decisions have been made yet about who to bring charges against. Whether to bring charges against anyone. In January, the district attorney said those decisions were imminent. So, we're getting a sense of what imminent means, at least when it comes to a district attorney.",

And part of the reason why she's able to try for this right now and, look, her attorneys still have to petition a judge to get permission to exhume his body, is because of roughly $70,000 worth of donations she's been given through her GoFundMe. Much of them coming from the those who followed the Murdaugh double murder trial online. Millions of people watch that of course unfold.Alex Murdaugh was convicted in the murders of his wife and his son earlier this month. And look, there is no direct connection between Buster Murdaugh and Stephen Smith. Aside from the fact they went to high school together. But there's been a lot of innuendos, there are a lot rumors that have been included on documentaries and podcasts, on social media. And much of that stems from a 2021 announcement from the State Law Enforcement Division when they announced they were opening an investigation into Stephen Smith's 2015 death, quote, based upon information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh. Now, look, Smith's death remains unsolved. Investigators have never revealed what that information was that they gathered. But Buster Murdaugh speaking out for the very first time today saying that he had remained silent about -- in his words -- these vicious rumors because he was going through his father as trial and grieving the death of his mother and his brother. But said today: These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death and my heart goes out to the Smith family. Now, Stephen Smith's mother and attorneys speaking today about this new investigation -- private investigation -- going forward saying they're going to go wherever it leads them.",
