This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.Angry, defiant and emotional, those are just some of the few words being used to describe President Biden and how he reacted both behind doors, closed doors and in front of cameras after the final report on his classified documents probe dropped yesterday. The report questions his mental fitness and claimed that he couldn't remember when his son Beau died. Now GOP lawmakers are using this as a springboard to call for Biden's removal from office under the 25th Amendment. The House GOP leadership saying he is, quote, certainly unfit for the Oval Office. CNN's MJ Lee is with us from the White House. MJ, President Biden was livid reportedly that his son was brought into this the way he was and then put out for the public to see. What are you learning at this hour? Because one of the headlines here that we should mention is he was not charged in this case.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, this was as livid, I think, as we have seen the President recently making clear that he has serious issues with the way that this investigation was handled. And if you look at this lengthy report, it makes many, many references to alleged memory problems that the President has. It said at one point that the President has diminished faculties and faulty memory. At another point in the report, it said that he did not remember even within several years when his son, Beau, died. And as you saw last night, that probably more than anything else was what made the President angriest. We saw an emotional response to that from the President last night, as he basically said to Robert Hur, how dare he ask that question. And we're also learning this morning that in private yesterday, he really erupted in anger again about that issue related to his son. But he said in a private meeting with Democrats in Virginia, how would I effing forget that?Now, obviously, the issue here that we are talking about is not just narrowly about the White House taking issue with these unflattering and gratuitous, according to them, comments about his memory lapses and, you know, recall problems, it is that they do speak to this broader issue that voters have raised about his age and his mental acuity that is going to be a big issue heading into November. Here are some of the ways that the President answered a number of those questions last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The special counsel's report says that the President possessed multiple highly classified documents that were indeed marked as being highly classified documents, including some marked as top secret/SCI sensitive compartmented information. That is a very high level of classification. For example, Special Counsel Hur discussed two top secret documents about Afghanistan found in that open, unsealed damage box in the garage, one of which Hur said, contains highly sensitive info about military programs and another that contains info about sensitive intelligence and sources and methods.Now, it's not clear, John, if any of those Biden documents had those colored borders. We saw on classified docs that former President Trump had, which I think is what President Biden was referring to when he talked about red around the corners. But still, whatever coloring these documents had, the special counsel says they were clearly marked as highly classified. And then, I should add, Hur also said that investigators analysis of Biden's own handwritten notes from his time as vice president showed that these notebooks also contained highly classified info, though those were not marked. And Hur said a sampling of 37 excerpts found that, quote, eight are top secret with sensitive compartmented information, seven of which include information concerning human intelligence sources, plus six others that were top secret.",

Except, John, the special counsel did say that explicitly. Hur wrote, quote, Mr. Biden shared information, including some classified information from those notebooks with his ghostwriter. So there it is in black and white.Now, Hur did elaborate that Biden shared classified info with the ghostwriter by reading nearly verbatim from the notebooks on at least three occasions, including notes from meetings in the situation room. He did find that Biden, quote, at times tried to avoid sharing classified info, like by skipping over certain material as he was reading them to the ghostwriter. And Hur did write that the evidence does not show that Biden knew the info was classified. Nonetheless, even though the special counsel did clearly give him some material to defend himself with, this is not a factual defense. So he could cite the factual stuff, you know, Hur said, didn't know it was intentional, et cetera. But declaring the special counsel just did not say what he said, John, is not a factual defense.",

There's a Comeyesque feeling to this whole thing, you know, when James Comey basically chose not to bring charges against Hillary Clinton because of her mishandling classified material through her private server. But then he went on to indict her politically, saying she was careless and reckless in handling that material, so it kind of felt like that.But having said that, you know, the politics of this is just bad for Joe Biden. Look, Donald Trump behaved horribly with classified material and was uncooperative. But this issue now is kind of a wash politically because I'm not sure how Biden's going to be able to criticize Trump on this. And by the way, Trump is in real legal peril because of his horrible handling of these materials. So I think right now, politically, though, Biden doesn't have much to stand on. In fact, the bigger problem, though, is the issue of his memory, that the special prosecutor essentially reinforced the narrative out there that Joe Biden is too old and he's got diminished faculties, diminished capacity. So that's what really hurts the Biden people. And I understand why they're upset about it. But, hey, this is politics. It's a rough arena.",

He incited that violent mob, some of whom had plans to hang the vice president of the United States to try to steal the presidency.
