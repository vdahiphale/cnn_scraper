And the only case that took place during her administration was 4.6 grams of marijuana, a misdemeanor, which had nothing to do with this case. And for them so seize and exploit this -- these families' pain and misery, and avoid the real issue, and that is sane and responsible gun legislation in America, which we do not have. And we see those like DeSantis and those like Scott promoting -- I mean, they're talking about open carry laws now in Florida, which is only going to lead to more misery and death. And this is the face of - of the victims who get routinely murdered in the United States. What -- this doesn't happen anywhere else in the world. We've got to do something more than we're doing. And part of the reason that we're here is so that America can see the face of grieving families who have lost their loved ones.
