      "sentences": "And welcome back. It is top of the hour. I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us.Votes are still being counted in hotly contested races across the United States. On the line, the balance of power in Washington and the future of President Biden's agenda for the next two years. The important number, 218. That is what both Republicans and Democrats need to grab control of the House. In this moment, Republicans increasingly looking to flip the lower chamber, even fewer seats to hit the threshold. Both Democrats and Republicans lead the same number of competitive races at 20. But top Democratic leaders are expressing optimism this morning about their chances to hold on to the Senate. We're watching four tight races too close to call, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Both Democrats and Republicans currently hold 48 seats. They need 51 for an outright majority. Also this morning we're learning more about the mood at the White House. Advisers to President Biden say there's a feeling of vindication after predictions about Republican red waves never materialized. The president is expected to speak this afternoon. We'll bring that live. The Senate race in Nevada, we are waiting on an estimated 20 percent of votes to be reported. A lot of votes to be counted. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was considered the most vulnerable. Right now she's slightly behind her GOP challenger, Adam Laxalt. Laxalt helped former president Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 results in that state. CNN's Rosa Flores joins us live from Las Vegas. Has either campaign spoken this morning?",

What I can tell you is that they were tweeting yesterday, both campaigns, asking voters to go out to vote to the last minute, telling them that, so long as they were in line, their ballot could be counted.They could cast that ballot and they went before their supporters, rooms filled with their supporters, and they both expressed confidence. Catherine Cortez Masto saying that she felt confident, she felt good about the ground game. Adam Laxalt also saying that he could win. And actually overnight he took the lead by a slim margin but he took the lead. And that's exactly what we're expecting here in Nevada, for the margins to be razor thin. And that's exactly what we're seeing. Now Nevada has gone since 2020 into a universal mail ballot, Anderson. What that means is everybody gets a ballot, every registered voter. And we need to figure out how many are out there, how many people put them in the mail yesterday, because they can be counted until Saturday.",

And though we don't know exactly whether or not they are going to officially declare a runoff today, it seems that, for the second consecutive election cycle, Georgia feels like the center of the political universe.And we did check in with the secretary of state's office. We know there's a small number of ballots left to be counted, some including provisional ballots. We don't have an exact number. They did tell us last night, though, they are not so quietly already preparing for the likelihood of a runoff. Meanwhile, the Warnock and Walker campaigns, they aren't waiting for the official declaration. They are already making plans to prepare for campaigning this next month. One of the biggest takeaways, Anderson, from Tuesday were the ballot splitters. Republican governor Brian Kemp far outperformed Republican Senate challenger Herschel Walker by about 163,000 votes. That's a lot of votes here. And how that's going to factor into the likely runoff on December 6th I'm sure is concerning to Republicans, even though they're not voicing that just yet publicly. But at least for the next few weeks, Georgia is going to continue to see these political ads as we prepare for the likelihood of a December 6th runoff. Anderson.",

If you're a Democrat, you're thinking, hey, maybe there's more Democratic vote to come in in Arizona.Finally, we'll just mention quickly, Nick Valencia was in Georgia, the one remaining state we have not called; the issue here, as Nick pointed out. Raphael Warnock, who's ahead, is less than that 50 percent. If no one gets 50 percent of the vote plus 1, there will be a runoff. There is still some vote remaining. But, for instance, we heard from officials in Gwinnett County already. Gwinnett County reporting 91 percent. You can see Raphael Warnock with a lead. But what they told us in Gwinnett County, they told CNN all the Election Day vote is counted, all the mail-in vote is counted. All that's left is the provisional ballot and the overseas military votes. So unlikely to change. So you can see why the secretary of state's office in both campaigns believe there will be a runoff. We have yet to officially make that projection. But watch this space, because, Anderson, depending on how this all goes, if you show where everyone's ahead right now, Democrats would need to win a runoff in Georgia to maintain control of the U.S. Senate.",

Let's start in Michigan where, yes, a guaranteed constitutional right to abortion easily won with 56 percent of the vote.Let's go to a red state, though, Kentucky, where you'll be surprised perhaps to learn that here the no vote, which was, in fact, the pro abortion rights side, gets a little bit confusing, the no vote won with a little bit more than 52 percent of the vote. Let's go to another red state. Let's go to Montana. And what we see in Montana is -- we haven't called this yet and this is, again, a little bit confusing -- the no side is the pro abortion rights side. But it is leading right now with 52.4 percent of the vote. On marijuana, things were a little bit more split. Going to go to Missouri, a red state, and what do we see in Missouri? Legalize won with 53 percent of the vote. Let's go to another red state, South Dakota, we saw that recreational marijuana failed there. No one with 53 percent of the vote. On gun rights, the state of Oregon and what do we see in Oregon, require permit to buy firearms and ban high capacity magazines, right now we can't call it. And you can see how close it is. So when we think about all of these different ballot measures, I think we could sum it up as, abortion rights passed overwhelmingly pretty much in all states. Marijuana was more split. When it comes to gun rights, in Oregon, the verdict is still out.",

Johnson, you know, was seen as quite vulnerable in 2016. He had pledged not to run for a third term. He changed his mind in January of this year. Mandela Barnes is a 35-year-old young progressive, the daughter (sic) of a teacher and a union worker, the lieutenant governor. He had some popularity among the Democratic base. But he faced a relentless barrage of negative advertising, painting him as being soft on crime. His supporters accused Johnson and the Republicans of effectively putting on more racist ads. But you know, the two candidates were very, very close in this election. We have not yet heard from Barnes and we have not yet heard from Ron Johnson. It's not all bad news for Democrats.

Democrats are getting closer but unable to unseat this incumbent that they have wanted to for some time. As you heard from Lucy Kafanov, the Democrats did win the governor's race here. You can see the difference, Tony Evers won by 84,000 votes. But in the Senate race, it's Ron Johnson. I want to go to battle for control for the U.S. Senate now. You can see here, Wisconsin is now red. That gives Republicans 49 seats. They need 51 to control. We have been telling you about these three races. Well, Georgia looks like it's going to a runoff. We won't have any answer there. Right now, the Democrat Mark Kelly is leading in Arizona. And right now, the Republican Adam Laxalt is leading in Nevada. So that would mean that this state right here, Georgia, the runoff will determine control of the U.S. Senate. If these two races hold. I'll just show you obviously what happens if Nevada, if Catherine Cortez Masto is able to maintain control, and Mark Kelly in Arizona. The runoff wouldn't matter in Georgia in terms of control there. And just to state the obvious, if Republicans were able to win both Nevada and Arizona, which is still possible, anything is possible out there, they would control the U.S. Senate without the runoff in Georgia, which looks like it will take place, Anderson, one month from now.",
