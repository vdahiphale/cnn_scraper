It's also important that it appears to be taking steps to hold those responsible accountable. Even more important is making sure that steps are taken going forward to ensure that something like this can never happen again. Prime Minister Netanyahu indicated to President Biden that Israel would be making further changes to its procedures to make sure that those who are providing assistance to people who so desperately need it in Gaza are protected.

We know it's the initial report from the IDF and that there will be more details, more of a report coming in days, weeks, definitely not months is what she said. We also have had a separate briefing from the IDF that adds other details to this report. So what the IDF has in the report is a misidentification of the vehicles and a misclassification or clarification of what was happening on the ground. The IDF said that they spotted gunmen on -- or a gunman on the aid truck itself and then they saw another gunman. They followed the trucks or they saw the trucks going into a warehouse, and when they left or when the vehicles left the warehouse, the IDF thought that the SUVs, the three SUVs that contained those aid workers, they thought, because they couldn't clearly identify it because it was nighttime, these SUVs, this is what the IDF says in its report. They thought that the gunman might have been in one of those vehicles and that's why they targeted the vehicles. In the separate briefing, the IDF is saying that they believe that they saw somebody with something over their shoulder that could have been a weapon that they later identified as a bag in one of those vehicles. And they also say so they can see how when they hit the first vehicle, and this is very harrowing detail from the IDF in this briefing that's not in the report, that the survivors of the first strike got out of the first vehicle, ran to get safety in the second vehicle, and of course the second vehicle and then the third vehicle were hit as well.

But again, you know, what we're hearing from the prime minister's office spokesperson is that there will be more details to come.

But as we saw back in January around about the time of my reporting at Kerem Shalom there, the government had also OKed the use of Ashdod to bring food supplies in for Gaza. The United States flour was being bought to that port. And back then protesters came out and essentially blocked the convoys at least for a long period of time, blocked the convoys of flour getting out of the port. Now there's nothing to say that that can't happen again. We've heard from Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of security here, saying that, you know, that he's disappointed essentially with this announcement by the prime minister and it's his supporters that could potentially come out again and block off the port. Erez crossing itself is not really at the moment set up for large numbers of trucks to be crossing in the way that Kerem Shalom has been. So there's a lot that could still go wrong with what the prime minister has said has been agreed or decided. Then I think this is why we're hearing skepticism from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken coming from the White House as well. You know, and on another point about what the -- Itamar Ben-Gvir is also saying, he's also criticizing the division, the decision rather by the IDF to let these two senior officers go, to discipline them and fire them from their positions, a colonel, a reserve colonel and a major. They're saying that you don't do that to troops in the field. You don't leave them in the field, you don't take these decisions in a moment of war. It amounts to weakness.

We've got Elisa Raffa joining us now, meteorologist, that will give us a breakdown of what we've seen and the impact and what was felt. What more can you tell us?",

And I do know that New Yorkers have felt it. I'm actually from New York so my family has been calling and texting to tell me that they were able to feel this earthquake. I have family and friends that had some dishes and things that were, you know, kind of falling off of shelves. You know, definitely feeling it. Now this was a pretty shallow earthquake, which is why they were able to feel it. And yes, 4.7 magnitude on the Richter Scale is not huge for this area and we have been talking about this 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan this week. That was in an area that has seismic activity right on the ring of fire where they're used to earthquakes all the time and they do get these types of earthquakes. You know, New York City, you know, doesn't quite sit on classic seismic activity like places in California or, you know, in Southeast Asia. So, you know, for them, this is really, you know, waking up people in the Big Apple here today and, you know, many New Yorkers saying that they can feel the shake. Unclear right now, you know, of any other damage or impacts other than, you know, New Yorkers really just kind of visit physically, literally, emotionally being jolted by this. You know, again, unclear about any other impacts, but 4.7 on the Richter Scale right now in New Jersey.",

I want to bring in Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey to give us her perspective on why this happened, how it happened. We're just talking about the tectonic plates and the fault lines. This wasn't very deep, 4.7. What more do you know? SUSAN HOUGH, SEISMOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY: Well, so we don't know a lot, you know, at this point. We have the preliminary information. As we heard earthquakes in New York and New Jersey are not common. They're not unheard of. You know, the plates in the West, the Pacific plate and North America moving separately. So you have the San Andreas Fault, you have all of that activity. On the East Coast the North America and the Atlantic Ocean are glued together. So that you don't have an active plate boundary, active fault lines, but you do have stresses in that area. One of my colleagues called it a passive aggressive margin because we call it a passive margin. There's no active plate boundary, but there are stresses because you transition from the continent to the ocean. And so we have had earthquakes going back in time. There were earthquakes upwards of magnitude 5 that caused damage in New York City in the 1700s and the 1800s. So they're more common there than, say, Wisconsin, which is much more stable and away from (INAUDIBLE). Yes.",

I mean, everyone felt it. Can you imagine being in those high-rise buildings, for example, in Manhattan and feeling that? But I think it was mostly New Jersey.

For 4.7 we don't expect to see major damage if you're right on top of it. Maybe a few things would fall off of your shelves. Maybe a window would break. It's really too small to cause serious damage. The one thing we worry about in the east is that a few places aren't prepared. The construction, you have brick construction, things you wouldn't see in California. So for 4.7, we're not too concerned about damage potential, but there is the potential out there for larger earthquakes to strike and frequently and those are the ones that we worry about.",

      "sentences": "Sure. That's a great question. And 4.7 is big enough that we expect to have a few aftershocks that are big enough to be felt. So people,especially right in the area, shouldn't be surprised if they feel, you know, magnitude three-ish aftershocks. They won't necessarily happen. They could. There is always the chance that an earthquake could be followed by something bigger. We typically think within three days, but, you know, it could be within weeks. This could be a foreshock. There's no way to know unfortunately until a bigger earthquake happens. The odds are low. So it's not something that we can predict, you know, certainly, it's not. But it's something that people should be aware of when you feel an earthquake. There's always a chance, there's higher chances that you're going to feel more quakes.

But the most recent developments, the Federal Aviation Administration says flights to New York Philadelphia, Baltimore and Newark airports are being held. Air traffic control tower at New York Liberty Airport is being evacuated. A controller said in a radio transmission after the earthquake that they are being evacuated. That means the flights were being held while control is moved to an alternate location. The runways were in the process of being inspected for damage. Shortly after the earthquake controllers at LaGuardia were still clearing flights for departure there. This, of course, is preliminary information. We are waiting for more on this. Right. We've got Jason Carroll standing by in New York for more on this. What do we know right now, Jason?",
