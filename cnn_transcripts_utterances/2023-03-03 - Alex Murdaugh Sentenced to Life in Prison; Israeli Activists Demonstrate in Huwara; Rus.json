I've known you as a member of the bar. I know you and your family to be a beautiful family. I know you to have been a nice person. What happened? And then going back to the point that you made, Erica, which is compelling, that the judge talked about, which is that, yes, perhaps it wasn't you, but maybe it was that individual that was so strung up on these pills that had happened. You know, big picture, Erica, when you look at the sentencing issues, they're about punishment, rehabilitation and deterrence, right. And judges look for those things. And clearly, this is not a person who can be rehabilitated, so the judge then has to pivot to what's the appropriate punishment under these circumstances. Is there anything else that anyone would believe that would be appropriate other than multiple life sentences? And then the deterrent factor. No one else should be able to get away with this, whether you're a lawyer, whether you have a family that has a portrait hanging on the courthouse door or anyone else. So it'd seem to me that the judge was very reflective, very thoughtful. Had a number of things to say. Spoke to the sacrifices of the attorney general and the prosecutors and everyone who was there to mete out justice.

Therewas a dispute as to whether or not the judge should permit and allow evidence concerning his financial really misrepresentations, the lies and everything else to the clients. The defense saying, hey, number one, it's not relevant to murder, number two, it's so prejudicial. That's a term we lawyers use to say that, listen, even if the jury doesn't believe you murdered someone, given the fact that that put you and paint you in such a bad light and reflects on your character, they're liable to find you guilty anyway. So I think that is being all of the introduction concerning the financial crimes that he wasn't on trial for, it's fertile for an appeal. Last point, having said that, there was of course a firm legal basis for the judge to permit it. You can permit evidence which goes to show motive. Remember the whole essence of the prosecution's case in setting the foundation was that Alex Murdaugh did this because the world was crumbling in. His financial crimes were being exposed, his family was learning about that, so the prosecution says, hey, we should be permitted to put this before the jury because that's what we're showing what's his motivation to commit these murders.

But they failed to do that, and that's essentially because Ukraine was the issue of which there was a sharp divide. We've seen that on Thursday, we've seen that again on Friday. There was a Quad meeting today of the four foreign ministers. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, of Japan foreign minister, Australia foreign minister, as well as the Indian foreign minister. There wasn't a direct statement or a strong statement that came out condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and perhaps that's because India has had a very historic tie with Russia for decades now, and they haven't come out and directly condemned Russia for the war in Ukraine. But they did come out with a joint statement and they did emphasize that the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. Now Blinken, for a second day running, while in New Delhi, did send out a strong message to Moscow. Here's what he had to say Friday morning.

You heard the audience, the way they laughed when he tried to indicate, really, that Russia is the victim and not the aggressor when it comes to the war in Ukraine. And that's the response he got. Now the biggest takeaway for me, perhaps as a journalist here in New Delhi at the G20 Summit of the Foreign Ministers, would be that there's been no joint statement. That only goes on to indicate how sharp the divide is really, between the West and Russia over the issue of Ukraine. And also an indication that when the big summit, G20 Summit leaders, takes place in India in September, there might not be any consensus all over again, which will be highly unfortunate -- Becky.",

And the word from the paddock is people really, you know, don't quite know what to think about it becausethey want a race this campaign, but it seems Red Bull as things stands are very much out in front. Interestingly it was Max Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez who posted the fastest time in the first practice session. Max is ahead of Checo as things stands in session two. But the ones to watch, Aston Martin and the veteran two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, very much up there, giving people a run for their money as things stand.
