Protests took place in multiple cities in the United States over the weekend after the release of a video of a police encounterthat happened in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 7th. According to a police report, Tyree Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving. After an initial confrontation, Nichols fled. He was then arrested at a second location. But in the video, officers are seeing striking nickels repeatedly during the encounter in a manner that law enforcement analysts have described as well outside the limits of police training. Tyree Nichols died three days after the incident. The actions by these police officers have been widely criticized and rallies in cities across the nation, including New York, Atlanta, Boston and L.A. have called for the end of such abuses by authorities. All five police officers involved have been fired and charged with crimes and the police unit of which they were apart has been shut down. Lawyers for at least two of the officers say their clients will plead not guilty to the charges and that no one in ended for the 29-year-old Nichols to die. We`ll hear from CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval who has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Goodwill Games, Rugby World Cup, The X Games, or Winter X Games? The Winter X Games is your answer here and the 27th edition of the event was hosted this past weekend in Aspen, Colorado. Nineteen-year-old freestyle skiing phenom Eileen Gu from San Francisco won two World Cup events this past week, storming back into competition for the first time since the Beijing Winter Games, where she became the first free skier ever to win three medals at a single Olympics. Now an injury during practice knocked her out of the X Games this weekend but Eileen told me ahead of the games how she balances being a student at Stanford University, a pro-athlete and professional model. And she`s also telling us how she harnesses the power of her mind to help her shine. (BEGIN VIDEEO CLIP)",

I definitely propagate it out there. And at the end of the day, I think that so much of skiing is in your own head. It`s an individual sport which means that your biggest rival really is yourself and overcoming that fear being able to perform on the day, learning how to deal with pressure, these are all things that are practiced and they are behaviors that I`ve spent a long, long time learning about how I naturally cope with them and then trying to exacerbate my strengths.

I guess it`s just feeling as though you`re not alone, feeling that there`s a place for you in the community or in the sport that you want to participate in. For me, growing up, there weren`t that many girls in the ski industry. There were a couple and I looked up to them a bunch and they really, really inspired me. But I guess what I want to do is, you know, I`m young and I`m trying to do my best and I just want to be the person that a girl at home can see on TV or on their phone and say, hey, you know, if she can do that, then I want to try it, too. She looks like she`s having fun, when can I try? And really, that`s all I want to do. I just want to be out there. I want to reflect the population that`s interested in it and hopefully inspire someone to take it up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
