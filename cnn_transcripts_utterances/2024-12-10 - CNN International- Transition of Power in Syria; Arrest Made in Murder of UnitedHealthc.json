They are not letting anybody in and out.I believe we are some of the few who have managed to get in here, and they have taken pains again and again to keep telling us that the cars have not been touched, that the cars will not be moved, that the cars will not be stolen, because they see their lack of corruption as being a badge of honor and a real contrast to the behavior of the regime. There was in the presidential palace and parts evidence that in those initial hours or that first day after Assad fell, that people had come in and ransacked the palace. But again, the rebels were really stressing to us, this wasn't our group. We don't do this. Now, I will say one small detail that I found interesting, John, when we went into the palace, the rebels who were guarding it would not talk to me or look at me until I put my scarf on. And so, as much as they are making these moves and saying things such as people can wear what they want, this is a pluralistic society, we respect the rights of minorities.

As the week progressed, they started heading south towards the capital, Damascus. On Thursday, they captured the city of Hama. By Friday, they are still inching their way further south, reaching nearby the town of Talbiseh, just north of Homs. An airstrike hits nearby, but the fighters are undeterred, cheering after the strike hits. And now, they're not alone. To the south of Damascus, other rebel groups are also mobilizing. This is on the road outside Dara on Friday night where the revolution started back in 2011. The group filming call themselves the 'Southern Operations Room'. The next day, fighters from the Druze religious sect are also part of the rebels' progress, tearing down a statue of President Assad's father in a town just outside of Damascus. As the different groups of rebel forces continue to close in on Damascus, regime forces begin withdrawing. Here, they're fleeing on foot.

Kimberly Dozier, really appreciate you. Thank you so much.Well, Syrian communities across the globe are celebrating the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, as I've been saying, but the future of Syrian asylum seekers is now unclear. The U.K., Germany, and Austria announced that they are pausing asylum procedures as they assess the situation. And Austria's interior minister says they're also looking into deporting people back to Syria. Meanwhile, Turkey says it will take steps to allow Syrians to return home voluntarily.

Also making Vladimir Putin one of the most influential players in the Middle East. And Moscow maintains not just a major air base in Syria, but also its only port in the Mediterranean Sea, where Putin's navy conducted large scale exercises just last week. But the Russians acknowledge the future of their military presence in Syria is now uncertain and their capacity to influence Syria's future appears limited, Putin's foreign spy chief seemingly acknowledging. The situation is obviously complicated, he says. The thing is Syria is a country composed of many diverse parts and whether various factions represented in the opposition are able to reach an accord will in many ways define the fate of the Syrian people and Syria as a state. The Russians say they are in touch with the armed groups now controlling Syria. And while Moscow says it currently does not see the security of its bases here threatened, its forces have been placed on alert. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
