Nice to have you with us, I'm Erica Hill n this very busy Monday morning.Election Day, if you're not counting, we are, don't worry, just 15 days away, early voting though already breaking records in at least one battleground state. And this week, there will be a number of major debates in key matchups around the country. First up is Florida where Incumbent Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is set to square off with his Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, tonight. We'll have much more on that in just a moment. We're also following this unprecedented rise, a nationwide surge in RSV cases among children, why the respiratory illness is putting so much pressure on hospitals, some states even now in crisis mode. We're going to take you inside one Texas hospital that's been inundated. And happening right now, jury selection is underway here in New York City, the Trump Organization facing several felony charges. We're going to be live outside of the courthouse with an update on that for you. Let's start this hour though with reporter CNN Political Reporter Dan Merica. So, Dan, 15 days, as I know you know all too well, until Election Day. We are seeing some really impressive turnout numbers when it comes to early voting in several key states. What are you going to be watch in the next two weeks as we lead up to the official Election Day?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, this is a critical week, both because people are already voting, as you note. That is why all of these campaigns are investing tons in Get Out the Vote efforts, going to doors, standing on corners, making sure that their voters, the voters they think will back them, are getting to the polls. And then also, rhetorically, it really matters, because, as you noted, there's a lot of ads being playing all over the country, in markets all over the country. And so that's going to mean more people are plugged in. This is the time when they may be listening to your message and that is why this week is so central. And the debates also matter because people are paying attention. So, number of high-profile debates in governor's contests today, you have debates in Maine and Florida, as you mentioned, the Crist/DeSantis debate. Tuesday, you have Michigan and New York. Thursday, you, again, have Maine. And Friday, you have a debate in Minnesota.On the Senate side, Tuesday, you have Colorado and the key Senate debate in Pennsylvania. Thursday, you have a debate in Alaska and another key race in New Hampshire. And then Friday, again, in Colorado. I want to key in on that Pennsylvania debate because that is the match-up between Democrat Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz. As you've noted on this show many times before, Fetterman had a stroke in May, was off the campaign trail for a few months, and has returned kind of full swing campaigning. We've seen him get a lot the better. His speech got a lot better. He still has some auditory processing issues. That has put a lot of pressure on this debate. This is the one and only debate in this contest. And you've seen Republicans kind of seize on that, the fact that Fetterman has not debated more, putting a lot of pressure on this debate. Fetterman actually spoke about his recovery on Saturday in Chester County and focused on crime. Take a listen to how he framed the debate over crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  He literally doesn't have a plan, other than to talk, and that is been a hallmark of his campaign. Just not any plans, just cheap photo ops or just empty kinds of arguments.
