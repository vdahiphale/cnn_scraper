If you look at the triple stack, the NASDAQ is off five-and-a-quarter percent for the month so far. That's where the markets are looking. The events of the day: Sad news, very sad. Dianne Feinstein, the longest serving female senator in US history has died at the age of 90. The US is bracing for a potential government shutdown with 33 hours left to reach a budget deal. And the chief executive of Axel Springer joins me in the C-suite in the sky. Believing AI can be a journalist's friend, not the enemy. Tonight, I'm live in London. It's Friday, September 29th, the month is just about gone. I'm Richard Quest in London in September, I mean business. Good evening. Good day. We believe, we begin, I should say with two big stories from Washington, DC, the US nation's capital. Firstly, tributes for the late US Senator Dianne Feinstein are being paid, and at the same time showing the dysfunctionality of the US capital, last ditch efforts to keep the US government open seem to have failed. The reality, if lawmakers fail to reach a spending agreement, the US government, the federal government will shut down just after midnight on Sunday morning. Congress began their work today. However, on a more personal and a deeply somber note. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): May I ask that the Senate observe a moment of silence in honor of Senator Dianne Feinstein.

The reality is if that motion to vacate the chair is introduced, the House goes into immediate chaos. This isn't replacing a senator or a member of Congress. This is a constitutional office. The house will go into chaos if that happens. So, by trying to do this, it is may be the least bad option for McCarthy right now. If he vacates his speakership, the House will be plunged in chaos.

I think it's a -- there's two questions, sort of how long is this going to last and what -- how broad is the spending cuts on how long. Usually these things are pretty short in terms of once the pain goes up with the population, they start yelling at their representatives. The one that airlines lines at the airport are becoming too long, et cetera. So, it's usually pretty short. What's covered is this a little bit misguided I think in terms of the disaster looming. There's no, you know, standards. Mandatory spending is not being shut off. And that's 75 percent of the federal budget. 25 percent of discretionary spending is that what a steak essentially.
