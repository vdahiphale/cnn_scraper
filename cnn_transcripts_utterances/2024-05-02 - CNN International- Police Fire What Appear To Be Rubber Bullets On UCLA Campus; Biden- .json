Thank you very much indeed, a real sense of the moment there at UCLA after what were scenes of the significant use of force by authorities on protesters there on the UCLA campus. We are waiting for U.S. President Joe Biden to speak.CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us from the White House. We've just found out that this is about to happen. As we await to see the U.S. President, what can we expect to hear from him? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, President Biden has stayed relatively quiet when it relates to these protests across college campuses in the United States. Really, his last remarks on this topic was 10 days ago when he decried antisemitism but also said that there are people who don't understand the concerns of the Palestinians. What this episode has really highlighted is President Biden trying to strike a very delicate balance relating to the protests. We've really only heard from the White House spokespeople and written comments relating to the protests on these college campuses. The White House has tried to stress that Americans have the right to peacefully protest, but they have called out episodes of lawlessness that they have seen, including those student protesters who had stormed and barricaded themselves in that administrative building on Columbia University's campuses earlier in the week. Now, the White House has really stayed away from commenting on the law enforcement actions and also the actions of the university officials to try to disrupt and disperse these protests. But, what you've also heard the White House trying to stress is that Biden's focus has been on pushing back against antisemitism, which is what we heard him say in his very first comments relating to the protests. But, the President is facing enormous political pressure on several fronts. You have Republicans who are trying to portray these college campuses as signs of disorder that are happening under President Biden's watch. Former President Donald Trump, his GOP opponent, has said that the President has been silent on this issue and needs to do more to address the protests that have been unfolding. And then there is the pressure within President Biden's own Democratic Party. You have seen real discontent amongst Democrats, especially young voters relating to his handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.",

We also saw a moment where the President of the United States thought we were at time where a message from the President, from the White House, was required to reset the boundaries about lawful, peaceful protest versus anarchy, property damage, violence and violations of the law.Clearly, Joe Biden realized that this had not just become an issue for American colleges, but also a political issue for Joe Biden, as Donald Trump has started to harness these events and saying this is a symptom of a weak Joe Biden, as other Republicans have started to blast over these with the message that this is a byproduct of Democratic progressiveness where these things are let to go, let to go on, let to go on too long.

That went on probably for about an hour and a half without police intervention. That, of course, was footage that was played around the world as those two sides clashed. That became an embarrassment to the Governor's Office in California, which ultimately is in control of state schools like UCLA.And the orders came down very quickly that the college administration and the California Highway Patrol would have to come to an agreement and in a plan and execute that plan quickly and retake that territory, and try to resume some kind of normal university life on the grounds of UCLA.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. They're trying to draw in the President. But, it hasn't -- we haven't elicited that testimony right now. So, you're right, Paula. Stormy Daniels' lawyer Keith Davidson back on the stand. We last heard from him yesterday, where he was detailing how he also worked to broker a deal for Karen McDougal, who also claimed she had an affair with Trump.This morning, we've heard a focus on the logistics of the Stormy Daniels deal. Davidson really detailed how he worked with the editor at the National Enquirer, Dylan Howard, also with Michael Cohen to broker this deal, so that Stormy Daniels would stay quiet about her alleged affair with Donald Trump. But you did mention, Paula, that we really haven't drawn in Donald Trump or any direct involvement just yet. And it's possible that Davidson doesn't even know about it. So, Davidson right now, he is really talking about the panic to get the Stormy Daniels quieted because of all the allegations that swirled around Trump's -- Trump in the days and weeks before the election. He even talked about how Michael Cohen called him right after the election and was despondent that Donald Trump wasn't bringing him to Washington. After Trump won the presidency, Michael Cohen saying he had done so much for him. And now, what you're seeing is details about how Stormy Daniels story did get out into the press after the election and when Donald Trump was President and sort of the scramble all around that. So, it's likely that Davidson's testimony will go on for a while longer. And then, as a side note here, we had that gag order hearing this morning. It was actually quite interesting because Trump's attorneys were trying to say -- they're arguing that Trump has the right to respond to what they believe has been really a torrent of comments from Michael Cohen online. So, they're arguing that Donald Trump had the right to respond since Michael Cohen has just been so outspoken. So, the judge now considering their arguments. The judge did seem more inclined to find that Trump had violated the gag order when he made comments about the jury makeup. That was where Trump spoke out, claiming that 95 percent of the jury was Democrat. The judge says that the utmost importance here is to safeguard this jury since they're the core to this proceeding. They need to be protected throughout this especially, Paula, since some have already expressed their concerns about their identities being exposed. Now, the last time the judge ruled on the gag order was on Tuesday, and he took about a week to come up with his decision there, fining Trump $9,000 for these four alleged violations that were argued this morning. The prosecutors want Trump fined $1,000 each. So, if the judge found with them completely, it would be a $4,000 fine. So, we'll see. It could take a few more days for the judge to really come up with his decision. But, in the meantime, we move forward with this testimony, Keith Davidson giving very detailed testimony about the Stormy Daniels deal and then the fallout especially once Trump took office, and Stormy Daniels, her story got out there. But, like you said, Paula, there hasn't been that direct link to Donald Trump himself. That's likely something that may be Michael Cohen is probably the only one who can do that. And prosecutors have to lay the foundation here with these other witnesses because Michael Cohen is a difficult witness because of his past being convicted of lying. Paula.",

So, they're mincing words. But, the bottom line of this is, this was an agreement to cause her to not reveal the story because the fear of it impacting the election.So, I don't think that has negatively impacted the argument the defense -- the prosecution will make, but the jury may be lost in the weeds of all this woodsmanship (ph).

It's important to take a step back and remember why these protests are happening. The demonstrators want to put pressure on colleges to divest from companies linked to Israel's bombardment of Gaza. Within Gaza itself, Palestinian Civil Defense and hospitals officials in Rafah say two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike at the Al-Shaboura refugee camp on Tuesday night.CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Jerusalem.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, two weeks ago, we brought you this story of the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, a strike there that killed several children. There was a devastating image that we shared of the dead bodies of children splayed around a foosball table of which one of them was Shaheed (ph), a girl who was wearing pink pants, just impossible to miss in that horrendous scene. And over the course of the last two weeks, we have been following up on that report. We interviewed her mother to hear her devastation of losing her only child in that strike, her search for answers.And we've also been pressing the Israeli military for answers about this strike. And we've gathered evidence at the scene as well. Our -- a stringer in Gaza, Mohammad Al-Sawalhi, he went to the scene of this attack. He documented the crater the marks of shrapnel, as well as pieces of shrapnel, including a circuit board that was recovered at the scene by Shaheed's uncle. We submitted all of that evidence to three munitions experts who independently reached the conclusion that this was the result of a precision-guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. When we asked the Israeli military for comments on this, we gave them three days to respond. And all they could tell us was this, quote, \"The strike in question was carried out at a different time than described in the query.\" And they also said that the collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. So, basically, their response is to say that we did not carry out a strike as far as what we can see in our records at the time and place that you are describing to us. And they also say that the strike they carried out on Al-Maghazi, at a different time, apparently, did not cause any casualties. But, we have recovered metadata from two phones that took videos in the immediate aftermath of that attack, which is how we determined the timing that we provided to the IDF. And additionally, there is no record, according to journalists in Maghazi, of any other Israeli strike that day. So, the statement from the IDF frankly, Becky, just begs more answers than the questions that it may answer here, or begs more questions, rather, I should say. And what we also didn't see from the IDF in the statement was a commitment to investigate this incident, although, even though it is undeniable that these children, now 11 children, have died as a result of this one strike. And again, munitions experts agreeing here that it was very likely caused by an Israeli airstrike. Becky.",

And inside, there is plenty to tell you about. Happening right now, prosecutors are questioning a key witness, attorney Keith Davidson, who negotiated the hush money agreement for Stormy Daniels. Now, earlier the judge held another gag order hearing to consider for additional allegations against Trump. Prosecutors are asking for $1,000 maximum fine for each alleged violation. And they did indicate that they were not seeking jail time. The judge has not announced a decision and likely will consider what he heard in that hearing.Jeff Swartz joins us now. He is a former Miami-Dade County Court judge, and a law professor. So, just in terms of the testimony that we're hearing now, we are getting into the art of the deal. You will pardon me for quoting that. But, we are looking at exactly the nature of the agreement that is alleged here, the agreement that went on between Michael Cohen and Mr. Davidson regarding Stormy Daniels. I'm interested to hear from you, when Mr. Davidson says that he wouldn't characterize this as hush money, how problematic is this for the prosecution when everybody assumes that hush money means you're trying to cover this up, you're trying to cover up the payment to Stormy Daniels so that she denies or does not speak about any relationship with Donald Trump? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE, &amp; PROFESSOR, THOMAS M. COOLEY LAW SCHOOL: I don't think for Mr. Davidson right now that's really covering up what he did, because that's apparent. There is too many documents. There is too much testimony. What he is trying to do is put a, how can you put it, a lipstick on a sow's ear in a context that he wants to make his role in it sound better than it actually is. So, he is talking about it in terms of that this was just a payment for the story, whatever it may be. It's not hush money. It's compensation. He is basically dancing around the fact, things like he accepted service, or sent service to Michael Cohen under the name of David Dennison, which was a pseudonym for the President of the United States, where he talks about his conversations with Cohen about not going to D.C. after the election, and that everything was done on behalf of Donald Trump. So, he is trying to make himself sound better than it is. But, a rose by any other name is still a rose, and hush payment by any other name is a hush payment.",

And that's meant to present a picture that Michael Cohen may have been acting on his own. I think that they also will try to push the idea that it was Michael Cohen who was panicking to try to get this done. He did not see any other kind of panic coming from anyone else, certainly not from the National Enquirer editor who was involved in all of this.So, that's what they're going to try to push for, that this was all Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was stalling because he didn't want to pour out his own money. Why? Because it was his own money. It wasn't Donald Trump's money.

There are corporations like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and others who have relationships with universities that many students find to be an ethical and moral violation. And the dominance of these universities are going towards those corporations. And what's happening is, on many of these college campuses, these peaceful protests are occurring, but they're being suppressed.At UT Austin, before our protests even began, the governor, Greg Abbott, decided to send in state troopers to suppress the peaceful protest. It was supposed to be a sit-in on the UT lawn. But, when fellow students saw such suppression on campus, they might not have known that much about Gaza or Palestine, but they decided to join in on these protests because they saw the civil liberties of their fellow students being suppressed. And so, because we see such crackdowns, many more students who might otherwise not be the most knowledgeable on what's occurring on the ground in Israel and Palestine will join in, and that, I think, will be the spark that allows these protests to grow bigger than anyone would have ever imagined.

If anything, I've only seen support and love from my Palestinian brothers and sisters, because we're coming together in unity for a very noble cause.But, there might be individual actors from outside of campus who are coming in, who are not there necessarily, even for Palestinians who might want to wreak havoc, but those are individuals that does not reflect the wider movement.",
