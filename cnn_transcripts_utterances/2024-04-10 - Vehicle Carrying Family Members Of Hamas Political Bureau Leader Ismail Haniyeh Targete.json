We're learning that a vehicle carrying several members of the family of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas' political bureau, was reportedly targeted northwest of Gaza City. Haniyeh has told Al Jazeera that he's aware of reports that three of his sons have been killed in an airstrike. So, let's bring in International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, who's live in Jerusalem for us. Nic, this is someone that you have interviewed and you know from your interviews with him.

According to the interview with Al Jazeera, Ismail Haniyeh said that the Israelis are wrong if they think that this is going to cause us to change our positions. He said it's an honor that his three sons and some grandchildren were killed. He said his sons had stayed in Gaza. They hadn't left. Of course, he is outside of Gaza. He lives in Qatar, that's where they run the political operation, if you will, outside of Gaza, that's where it's run from in Doha and Qatar. So, his position is it's an honor to have shed this blood. He said so many families in Gaza have shed this blood. I think it's worth noting as well that this obviously is not just any targeting. This is the leader of the political bureau of Hamas. But it's not just that any time either. This is Eid when families would be getting together, when they would be meeting and celebrating with the children, with the whole families together. How the three sons came to be in a vehicle at the same time, which Hamas would know would potentially put them collectively in harm's way, isn't clear. Today, Eid would be a day where you might find them together, because typically this is how families are celebrating Eid as best they can in Gaza at the moment, but the message, very clear from Hamas. This will not change our negotiating position. It's hard to imagine, though, it won't make them dig in and hold fast.",

You think about what that means for the family members to hear that, whether that means that they're simply unable to locate the hostages.

And when you talk to American officials, they really do see this visit as a critical sort of turning point in this long alliance between the U.S. and Japan. And when you look at the list of so-called deliverables that will come out of this meeting, it's more than 70 items long and people say that that's the longest list they can remember for this kind of state visit. And that does give you a sense of the importance that the White House is placing on this relationship. It is really kind of the linchpin of President Biden's Indo-Pacific strategy. And when you see the things that they're planning to announce, whether it's this joint defense council trying to increase the interoperability of their two militaries, trying to boost Japan's defense exports, these are all items that they hope can help counter a rising China. And when you think about it in the broader context of Biden's Asia strategy, he's trying to do similar things with countries like South Korea, like Australia, like the Philippines, with whom he'll meet tomorrow alongside Japan. And this is all sort of an attempt to show China that the U.S. is serious about countering its rise in Asia. But I think the other sort of subtext to this meeting today is Donald Trump and the prospect that Trump could potentially return to the White House in January. American officials that we've been talking to are pretty candid that this is a source of anxiety in Tokyo and other capitals around the world. And part of what President Biden is doing with Prime Minister Kishida today is trying to make some of these items permanent, essentially trying to future-proof them so that if President Trump returns to the White House, if he brings with him a more isolationist approach to foreign policy, that some of these items will be permanent and that they will sort of outlast the shifting political winds in Washington. And so, that is sort of a big topic for them to discuss today. And it was interesting, earlier, we were out on the South Lawn watching this very ceremonial arrival. We saw Kishida come up and speak, President Biden speak. And one thing that they both sort of mentioned is the cherry blossoms in Washington. And you'll remember these were a gift from Japan to the United States about a hundred years ago. The National Park Service says some of them have to be chopped down, and Japan is announcing that it is donating 250 new cherry trees to Washington. And they both sort of tried to emphasize that as a symbol of the permanence of this long-standing alliance, of the importance, the steadfastness of this alliance. And certainly that is the message that they're trying to impart, both in the United States and to countries in Asia, as they continue this visit.",

Would you ever be willing to give up Ukrainian territory for peace? ZELENSKY (through translator): First and foremost, those signals were on certain media platforms.

If indeed he is elected president in November, which of course is very far from a certainty. One of the things I think that stood out to me as I spoke to him today was that he did seem very combative. He did say that he was, that the Ukrainians were in a position, he believed at some point, to bounce back, that they were going to collect their strength, that they did plan a counteroffensive against the Russians, even though right now we do see that the Russians certainly are pressing in many areas of the front lines, Bianna.",

I think that that's an archaic message to send out to women, and it's certainly not going to help Republicans who are constantly, you know, wanting a smaller government. They don't want big government coming in and telling them what they can and can't do. Well, then they need to really reframe how they message this. And again, I would go back to things like, you know, what are we doing to support women who are being forced to have these children? There's no set up in place for them, no programs in place to the cost, you know, the physical burden, the cost of going to doctor's appointments. Having a child is very expensive. And I think that we are only looking at it through one lens, and it's a religious lens, as opposed to taking a step back, taking your personal feelings out of it and recognizing that each individual, man or woman, should have their own personal freedom to decide what's best for their medical and mental and all encompassing health.",

We're not just seeing that in Asia. We're seeing it in Europe, for example. This talk of a massive fund to ensure that Ukraine gets the money and the ammunition it's going to need going forward, even if Trump gets back into the White House and tries to cut off USAID to Ukraine. So, you're seeing it around there. What world leaders really want is not necessarily one side or the other winning a U.S. presidential election. They want certainty. They want predictability. And those are the things -- the exact things that Donald Trump doesn't bring. For decades, the United States has been a force of stability internationally through its alliances in Europe, its alliances in Asia. Trump's raison d'etre is unpredictability. We saw that through his first term, and I think he would be even more volatile internationally in his second term because there would be fewer constraints on him in the White House. He's going to bring in foreign policy professionals, even generals in the Pentagon, who are going to do less to try and constrain him. So that's what world leaders are looking at right now. I'll never forget in the early days of the Trump term, reading that South Korean officials had actually put together a unit whose sole focus was to decipher Trump's tweets and make sense of that. So, clearly there's already anticipation and concern perhaps about what a second Trump term, and perhaps now Truth Social posts, will look like. But Stephen, I was also struck by a statement that the Japanese Prime Minister gave to \"The Economist\" magazine earlier this week, where he said if Russia's allowed to prevail in Ukraine, it will send the wrong signal to Asia. So, to your very point, there is a lot of focus on the war in Ukraine and what that could possibly mean vis-a-vis their own region, and as you said, China.",
