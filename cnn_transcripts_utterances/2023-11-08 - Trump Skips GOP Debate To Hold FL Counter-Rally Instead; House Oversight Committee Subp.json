It sort of goes to different churches and tries to push voters to the polls.And one of the issues that I think Republicans had last night, at least according to some Senate Republicans, had to do with the issue of abortion and messaging on that issue. The vice president, Kamala Harris, actually talked about this just moments ago from the White House. She said that, quote, \"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\" How big is the issue of abortion for Republicans right now when it comes to Latino voters?",

      "sentences": "I think that's a topic that Republicans need to have a better strategy and messaging on. Last night proved that.But that's exactly why I started Bienvenido. As a grandson of a preacher, I know that the Hispanic evangelical is very conservative voting bloc as well as very pro-life. However, the Hispanic evangelical church has been sidelined when it comes to civic participation for years. And now with Roe v. Wade overturning and going into the states, this is the perfect opportunity for the Hispanic evangelical church to make its way. Because we know, when the church votes, history is made. And I believe that it's this particular issue, that's going to give the Hispanic evangelical church involved. But based on last night, it's important to note a few things. Republicans lack messaging, strategy and tactics. They also lack investment. In Ohio, pro-abortion activists outperform in raising funds for ads by $112 million. It's not enough for Republicans just to say that Hispanics are conservatives and we believe in the sanctity of life. We have to put money in investing these campaigns, because Democrats do a really good job of grassroots work from the bottom up. As Republicans, we just kind of sit back and wait and hope that the message itself will get Hispanics out to vote, when we know that we have to put something behind that.",

He ended up flipping the state House and Democrats held on to the Senate.But I want to ask you about something else. You were actually alongside Donald Trump after his arraignment in Miami, helped lead a prayer with Trump at a well-known Cuban restaurant in Little Havana. And Trump there talked about political persecution, about Socialism. We know that's going to be part of his speech tonight, according to his team. I've spoken to Democrats who argue that part of Trump's success among Latinos is fearmongering about Communism to voters that have generational trauma, fleeing places like Cuba and Venezuela. What's your response to that?",

If President Biden were to call today and ask for prayer, we would be out on the next flight out to D.C. to pray for him. Prayer is very important.I disagree with this idea of fearmongering, whether it's Cubans and Venezuelans in south Florida that understand the danger of Socialism, or Mexican-Americans in Tucson, Arizona and Cameron County, south Texas, where we know the dangers of open border policies. President Trump is able to identify with Hispanics of all different backgrounds, whether you're Cuban, Venezuela, Puerto Rican, Ecuadorian, Mexican-American, and prove that there is no one topic that is just exclusive to the Hispanic voting bloc. We care about all issues. That's why you saw this organic trend. Too much emphasis is placed on south Florida, when we should be talking about Tucson, Arizona, Cameron County, Texas, areas that were under Democrat control for over a hundred years, Boris. And the last election cycle, were flipped to Republican. Why? Because the Democrats have chosen to turn a blind eye to open border policies and really embrace this idea that there is nothing going on at the border. And that's what's causing these local small counties in south Texas, predominantly dominated by Hispanics, to turn over organically to the Republican Party and, more importantly, President Trump.",

Doctors in Chicago used an unusual tool, large breast implants, to help save the life of a 34-year-old man who needed a double lung transplant.CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joins us now with details. Sanjay, this is fascinating. I have many questions. But first, how did this work? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the marvels of modern medicine, Boris. It really is an incredible story. So, the person we're talking about is 34 years old. His name is Davey Bower. Pretty healthy guy, snowboarder, skateboarder. He was a smoker since he was 21, switched to vaping at some point. And in April of this year, he got the flu, and it was a pretty bad case of the flu. Subsequently, got an infection in his lungs that was resistant to antibiotics. It was a bacterial infection. He got really sick, to the point where he needed a transplant, Boris, but the problem was that, with the infection, he could not have a transplant. So what the doctors did was they essentially removed his lungs. I don't know if you saw the x-ray of his lungs. You could see what normal lungs look like. And you could see what the diseased, infected lungs look like. On the right, you can see those lungs that are infected. They're whited out. They needed to come out. They built an artificial lung to sort of provide oxygen and remove gases from his body. And at the same time, Boris, what's really interesting is, without the lungs, his heart essentially was not anchored anymore. So they needed to use these breast implants, as you mentioned, essentially, they're very malleable and put them in there to basically hold his heart in place, because there was no lungs. And it allowed him to recover, allowed the infected lungs to be gone, and ultimately, he was a candidate for a lung transplant, got the transplant, and is recovering well. What I just described has never been done before. That was a medical first, and a pretty remarkable one.",

And you know, I think when we talk to the doctors, they basically said, look, it was a combination of things.Clearly, being a smoker, we have plenty of evidence on what smoking can do to your lungs. With vaping, it's newer, Boris. It took some 25, 30 years to get the cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and harm. Vaping will take some time. But I think the doctors are very concerned that the vaping did cause an inflammation of the lungs. And when he got the flu, he was more susceptible, and that led to the infection. So a combination of things probably in this case. But Boris, 34-year- old guy. Pretty healthy, otherwise.",
