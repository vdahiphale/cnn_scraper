Generally, the stocks are high in anticipation of events like this, the United States supplies more ammunition as required for Israel. I think it goes without saying at the moment that those -- that those flows of ammunition will be -- will be ready -- will be coming. That`s the commitment we heard from President Biden. The way the system works, the system works across the country. The Iron Domes, wherever they are on the ground, like the one we saw firing out there, interlocks with other Iron Dome firing systems throughout the country. Where missiles are fired from Gaza, the system reads, detects where the missiles are precisely coming from and where they`re calculated to be going. And the nearest and best available Iron Dome system fires off to intercept those Hamas rockets as they come into Israeli territory. That`s what we`re witnessing right now. This is the defensive missile system taking off. The sirens were going off around here. And you can see -- I can see black smoke rising just to the left of the Iron Dome. That`s new black smoke. Black smoke often indicates an impact. We don`t know that right now. But we have seen at least several dozens of these interceptor rockets, the Iron Dome, taking off here. The sirens have gone off. I`m looking down the highway. The traffic stopped here. Everyone is getting out of their vehicles to find a safe space to hide. And you`re hearing the booms there of the intercepts that are happening. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And if you`re here in the United States, we just may see what is called a Ring of Fire. The moon is going to pass between the earth and the sun starting around 9:13 a.m. Pacific Time on the west coast. It`ll end in the U.S. in Texas at 12:03 Central Time. Yes, astrologers can get that specific. The moon will cover 90% of the sun`s surface and create what could become some beautiful steely skies. The best viewing areas are shown on this map with the path with the yellow circles there. If you can`t catch that, if it`s cloudy or you`re busy, mark, April 8th on your calendars for what will be the total eclipse of our hearts, that`s when we`re expected to see the moon completely cover the sun, any total solar eclipse with best viewing in the path with these blue circles here. And if you plan on watching that, the sun will still be super bright enough to burn. So be sure to wear protective glasses. And if you miss that one, you`re going to have to find yourself a calendar that goes all the way to the year 2046 to market, because that`s when will next see a total eclipse of the sun in the contiguous, U.S. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Watching as the moon blocks out the light from the sun, it can be hard to imagine the amazing cosmic coincidence taking place.The sun`s diameter is some 400 times larger than the moons, but it`s just the right distance away to appear the same size. For a couple of minutes when the sun and moon are perfectly aligned, the moon completely covers the sun`s disc. The sun`s atmosphere or Corona can be seen in the dim light, along with stars and planets. This so-called totality only exists in a narrow band where the moon`s shadow falls on the earth. Outside the zone, some observers can see a partial eclipse where it looks like a chunk has been taken out of the sun. It`s not a phenomenon that will last forever. The moon is slowly moving away from the earth. And one day it will appear too small in the sky to cover the sun completely. If you are lucky enough to see this incredible spectacle, remember never look directly at the sun, even with everyday sunglasses, you risk causing permanent damage to your eyes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A city nation, and a state, Singapore is your correct answer here. Ding, ding, ding. Now some of you may already be working hard to save up for the day that you can buy it, your very own car. Well in Singapore, where we`re going to take you next, that`s going to cost you 104,000 Singapore dollars or 76,000 U.S. dollars. And guess what? That fee doesn`t even include the car. CNN`s Kristie Lu Stout explains the policy in one of the most expensive cities to live in, in the world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Owning a car, the tiny island nation of Singapore could burn a massive hole in your pocket. And that`s beforeyou get to the part, when you actually buy a car. Let me explain. And immensely space star Singapore runs on a quota system. So if you want to buy a car, you must first bid for a certificate of entitlement, basically a license just to own one. Now this is over and above a driving license and it costs $106,000. That amount could fit you not one, not two but four Toyota Camry hybrids in the U.S. And that makes Singapore the world`s most expensive city to buy a car in. But credit where it`s due, Singapore has an impressive local transport system catering to its 5.9 million citizens connecting all parts of the island that could be driven across in less than an hour. Out space is finite, which is why the quota system was brought in more than three decades ago. It limits car ownership to keep traffic in check and reduce emissions. So owning a car in Singapore, one of the world`s most expensive cities is not just a luxury. It`s almost out of reach for many. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
