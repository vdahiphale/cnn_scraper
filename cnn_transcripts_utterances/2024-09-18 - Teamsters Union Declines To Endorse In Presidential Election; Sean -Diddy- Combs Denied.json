Why Trump says it's an honor. And denied again, Diddy ordered to stay in jail until he stands trial. We're going to take you inside his new life, behind bars. And the new warning, tonight, from a woman, who was sexually assaulted at the age of 12. She got pregnant by her stepfather. But now says she had options that others don't, because of Donald Trump. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, a major presidential endorsement that both candidates have been angling to lockdown for weeks now. And it turns out, neither one of them is getting it. In an election that is marked by an all-out fight for blue-collar voters, the Teamsters' silence rings louder than really any endorsement could tonight. The leadership declaring that they're not backing Vice President Harris or former President Donald Trump. Though the Republican nominee, tonight, tried to claim otherwise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Earlier today, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the rank- and-file membership of the Teamsters.

And the Teamsters stand out, I should note, from what so far has been a clean sweep of major labor endorsements, for the Harris-Walz ticket. But their focus may be more on what's happening inside, the nearly 95,000 rank-and-file Teamsters, who are in the State of Pennsylvania. The problem for the Democratic ticket, the Teamsters' own figures, according to them, showed that a majority of their members prefer Trump. My lead source, tonight, is the head of an influential labor group, one that has endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket, I should note. United Auto Workers President, Shawn Fain. And it's great to have you here, Shawn. Because when you look at this, this is the first time the Teamsters have not endorsed a presidential candidate, since 1996.

And even though, you know, I'm not going to get into their leadership and their decision-making. But I mean, it was pretty apparent today, when the Michigan Teamsters Joint Council 43, 245,000 retired and active members endorsed Kamala Harris. The Joint Council 42 that includes Nevada, 300,000 members, endorsed Kamala Harris and Walz. And Local 237 in New York, which is their biggest local, also endorsed Harris-Walz team.

And the trade deals, NAFTA passed. Democrat -- you know, some Democrats supported it. All Republicans did. And so, it left working-class people scratching their heads of who's got our back. And so, I think it's important that we make them earn our endorsements. But, you look at Donald Trump. We have a track record with him. When he was president, he left workers behind. He didn't do a damn thing, when plants -- he claims that he cares about auto workers. And it's insulting that that man showed up in Flint, Michigan, of all places, yesterday, a city that's been devastated by the corporate-class, taking those jobs out, driving a race to the bottom over the decades they have. And doubly sickening is the fact that the Republican Party, in Michigan, poison the people, the citizens of Flint. So, that's a party that left working-class people behind long ago.

A contentious back-and-forth happened between prosecutors, and Combs' defense team, playing out inside that courtroom, as the judge ultimately ruled that there were no conditions that reduced his risk of witness tampering, or obstruction, and ultimately denied him bail. My legal sources on this, tonight are: Former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. And CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. Elie. They were basically -- and by they, I mean, the defense team, offering anything they could, to keep him out of jail. They were saying, No women will be at the home. He won't be able to be on the internet, when he's at home. The judge still said, I'm not -- I'm not going with that. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: This is something you see quite often, when your defendant has endless resources. They propose what prosecutors derisively called private prisons. And we prosecutors will stand up, and go, Judge, not any defendant can post $50 million, and an armed guard, to make sure he doesn't go anywhere. And judges used to actually grant that years ago, but they've really soured on it. And the most telling thing for me, in trying to guess what would happen, today, is if you look at this case, and you pull out the name, Sean Combs, and you just make it your average defendant, charged with RICO conspiracy, with firearms, drugs, guns found in the house, extortion, assault, plus forcible sex trafficking? That person is getting detained, in the Southern District of New York, 99 times out of a 100.",

That's because tomorrow, he can start selling off his shares, of Trump Media, which is the company that's behind Truth Social. This is all the more remarkable, given Trump has invested next to nothing in this venture. Yet it's nearly doubled his net worth, in just a few years.How this happened, all of it, is the focus of the new Forbes cover story that's out today. It reports on Trump's, quote, four year transformation, which made him \"The first American ever to create billions from his politics.\" My source, tonight, is the Forbes Senior Editor, Dan Alexander, who wrote that cover story. And Dan, it's great to have you back. Because you kind of describe this Catch-22 that Trump is in, where selling off 60 percent of the social media company, all or at once, or even in decent-sized chunks, could crater the share price, and leave him with less money, ultimately. I mean, how does he navigate this? DAN ALEXANDER, SENIOR EDITOR, FORBES, AUTHOR, \"WHITE HOUSE, INC.\": It's so tricky. And it's especially tricky with this company. It's always a bad look, when somebody who owns a company, is a big shareholder, or is the CEO, sells a bunch of shares. But this company is Trump. There's no underlying financial performance that can justify the valuation of the company, right now. All that investors are going on is the hope and dream that Donald Trump will somehow spin this thing into a multi-billion dollar company. If Trump's start selling, then that rationale starts to fall apart. But if there's one person who could pull off this high-wire act, it would be Donald Trump, who might be the greatest salesman in American history, particularly at selling things that don't have much intrinsic value.",

I mean, the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which is the parent company of Truth Social, this social media app, in the last 12 months, it's generated about $3.4 million of revenue, and it lost, on a net basis, $380 million. I mean, those are just atrocious financials.But what you've seen in the last four years is a transformation that has two parts to it. One is sort of the creation of the MAGA empire, in which Truth Social falls. The other is the transformation of Trump's previous real estate business. He now has much less value locked in, say, New York City real estate, or hotels, which had been the real core of his fortune for his entire life. And now, much more value trapped in golf courses and Mar-a-Lago. These are private clubs where people can pay enormous amounts of money to be right in the Trump orbit. In the Mar-a-Lago case, at his home. And so, profits of that business have surged, as the New York and hotel apart has fallen off. Those two dynamics happening simultaneously, has allowed Donald Trump to become billions of dollars richer, and this year, put himself back on the Forbes 400.",

Nothing, unless it's Donald Trump. And then, people are willing to pay, collectively, millions of dollars for it. His coffee table books are sourced from photos in the public domain. These are not presidential memoirs that have big revelations about his time in the presidency. The intrinsic value of these things, just as the shares, is almost zero.
