Today, the House January 6th committee issued criminal referrals for the former president, four of them to be exact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Anyone who incites others to engage in rebelling, assist them in doing so, or gives aid and comfort to those engaged in insurrection, is guilty of a federal crime.

On the other hand, when asking that question, remember, we are talking about a guy who was impeached not once but twice. That was certainly sui generis.

This is a guy who has been written off for decades. He was -- his casinos were bankrupted, but he was fine. He was dismissed in the 1990s. He was dismissed as an entertainer. He came back over and over and over again.And so I don't think you can say that he's done, especially because we don't know whether Ron DeSantis is running, we don't know whether he will be any good as a candidate. I think this all comes down to two questions. Does anyone actually indict Donald Trump? Which we still -- you know, nothing's changed today from yesterday realistically, to your point, there's no legal teeth there. And then what do voters do? When and if there were actual other choices, everything else is just filling in one side of the page. BERMAN:  You know, one of the points I was making is it's not just the indictments, even before the indictments, the referrals, even before the referrals, there was all this other stuff, there are these polls and there is a sense, even before you wrote it just a few hours ago, politically diminished --",

There are some advisers around him who acknowledge this is not an ideal fact set.I use the word diminished very specifically because he is shrunken, basically. And this is different now than, say, in 2016. And this is a point someone made to me in the analysis I posted tonight. In 2016, voters, they were familiar with the idea of Trump, that they had heard about for decades. They were not familiar with who he is, what he's like, the fact that there is a rolling drama around him at all times, and I think there is a sense of fatigue. What that adds up to depends on who he's running against and what else is happening. But I absolutely think that he is a smaller and certainly less powerful figure than he was before.",

That would just be a shame. The guy's supporters tried to kill you in the Capitol, Donald Trump did nothing to stop it, and you don't think he should face any consequences?

Here's testimony given that was favorable to him, maybe by Stephen Miller, a lot of people who were Trump sympathizers went in to testify. It looks like the committee hid from you. They're going to go through it and say, oh, look, Cassidy Hutchinson testified, and here's -- the way she said it's slightly differently, maybe when she had a prior lawyer, therefore, her testimony is not to be believed.

The other thing is, if I can cheat a little, in two days will be different when we get all the documents, DOJ is now going to have all the evidence.

That's absolutely true. And he never sounds as sort of engaged, as he does in recent days, when he's talking about wanting to take on Ron DeSantis. But that's the only time he really sounds engaged. And in 2015, he was enjoying himself. There were lot of people who are not enjoying his candidacy, to be clear. But his slash and burn stuff was so much fun for him.

What can the Department of Justice do that they couldn't? What can DOJ do that the committee didn't do? I'm going to ask a member of that committee. Stay with us for Congressman Adam Schiff, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:20:00] BERMAN:  A historic day on Capitol Hill, the bipartisan January 6th committee referring former President Trump to the Justice Department on for criminal charges, inciting, assisting or aiding an insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to make false statements. Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California, a member of the select committee. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. So, based on the information publicly available, which of your referrals do you think the Department of Justice is already the furthest along in? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  Well, this is speculation on my part, but I have to think that the issue the charges relating to the obstruction of the joint session, the interference with the joint session, the conspiracy to defraud the United States, those would be, I think, probably top of mind for the Justice Department. But they also need to look at the most serious charge, and that is the incitement of insurrection, the aid and comforting of people committing an act of rebellion or insurrection. That is, you know, certainly not a charge that's brought very often, never been brought before against a former president. But, nonetheless, the facts here are very much on point.

He was more than happy to have them march on the Capitol knowing they were armed. His only frustration and indignation was that he couldn't go with them. And when the violence began, he made it worse, by attacking his own vice president. All the people around him understood just how that was pouring gasoline on the fire. And I think he understood that as well.And then you have the extraordinary dereliction of duty where he sat by and did nothing while this mayhem was taking place.

I would want to ask about other potential coconspirators and what they were involved in. Many of those conversations are not covered by any privilege, depending on who is engaging in them and who else was in the room but we were not able to get answers, and I think the Justice Department can.",

So, John, that's quite a list there. Batons not, not the average thing that people carry around. This was the group of people that Donald Trump spoke to, riled up, and then, you know, basically said, let's march to the capitol. The question here is, is that illegal, or as I suspect that he will ultimately argue if it gets to a court of law, just reckless. And the reason this is interesting, particularly today, is Mike Pence did an interview where he said, I don't want to see President Trump charged. What he said was reckless.
