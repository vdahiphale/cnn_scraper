Here you can see the chaotic scene. Scores of security personnel in riot gear breaking into a window to get to Khan as he was submitting data in Islamabad's High Court.His party says the politician was whisked away by unknown people to an unknown location. Khan is accused of corruption. We'll come back to this when we can get hold of our correspondent. But meanwhile, Russia usually flexes its military might on Victory Day. But this year, it has been a more subdued affair. The annual military parade marked the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. This year, however, there was only one tank and no traditional flyover by Russian jets. While the day was dedicated to past victory, it was the current war with Ukraine that was on President Vladimir Putin's mind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): The Ukrainian nation has become hostage to a coup which led to a criminal regime led by its Western masters. It has become a pawn to their cruel and selfish plans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Clearly a big difference. This year, only one, and it was a T-34 tank, which is a World War II era tank. So really a museum piece in itself. Look, yes, they've deployed a lot of tanks, but we also know that a lot of tanks have been destroyed in Ukraine. One recent estimate, a conservative estimate, was that about half, at least half of their operational tank fleet has been destroyed in Ukraine. So they are experiencing something which, you know, really is not reflected in this display of military might. Look, they did also have an S-400 air defense system on display. They had an intercontinental ballistic missile. Russia at pains to make sure the world still knows that it's a nuclear power. But this event today, I think, really showed that, you know, almost 15 months into this war, Russia can no longer insulate even Victory Day, even the most important day in its calendar from this war. It is hitting home. People are feeling anxiety. They are feeling a sense of insecurity after that drone attack on the Kremlin. We've seen recent, you know, fires at fuel depots in western Russia, trained derailments, things like this. There is a sense that this war is reaching the Russian shores, that people are worried. And I think this was an opportunity for President Putin, who came out and railed against the west, all the normal talking points. But to exploit this moment to further try to rally Russian support, even if this war isn't showing much progress in Russia's favor.",

So that's according to state media, which quotes the deputy foreign minister as saying all requests for consular visits are being considered. Last month, Russia rejected a U.S. request to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter after the U.S. failed to provide visas to Russian journalists visiting the United Nations. Gershkovich was arrested in March on espionage charges. Israel launched a series of deadly airstrikes in Gaza overnight, targeting what it calls kingpin terrorists. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza says 13 people were killed, including at least four women, several children. Islamic Jihad confirms the attacks three of its commanders targeted. Israel says these strikes were a response to the group's incessant aggression. Hadas Gold is in southern Israel and joins us now. What more can you tell us, Hadas?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, here in southern Israel, there is a quiet tension in a sense because there is an expectation that there will be a response from Gaza, from the south of where I'm standing right now, whether that will be in the form of rockets. And the bigger question will be who will be involved in that response.These airstrikes came sort of as a surprise from Israel last night at around 02:00 a.m. in the middle of the night. Israeli military announcing that it was striking Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza, killing three of their commanders, including the commander in chief of the Al- Quds Brigade of the Iranian-backed Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. They also said that they targeted 10 other sites. These are things like weapons manufacturing sites, rocket launchers and the like. But we are also hearing from the Ministry of Health in Gaza that among those killed were some of the family members of these commanders and potentially another family that were potentially uninvolved. These included women and at least four children are among those dead. 13 total dead, and at least 20 others were wounded. The Israeli military saying that they tried to avoid collateral damage, as they said, but they are looking into those reports of civilians being killed as well. Israeli military saying that they were responding to more than 100 rockets that were fired last week by Islamic Jihad towards Israel. That was in response to the death of a prominent Islamic Jihad member who died after a prolonged hunger strike while in an Israeli prison. And the initial Israeli military response to those rockets, there was one, but it wasn't that big. It actually elicited some criticism from the right wing flank of this current Israeli government, who said they were even boycotting votes in the parliament because they said the security response was weak. That, of course, changed overnight. Now the big question will be, what will the response from Gaza be? It has been quiet so far. The funerals have been held for those that were killed. And the militant factions in Gaza, including Hamas, who runs the Gaza Strip, saying that there will be a joint response, saying that they will be holding Israel responsible. This will not go unanswered, but so far it's been quiet. There's been nothing yet from Gaza, but the expectation is that something will come and that Hamas may choose to get involved this time. If you keep in mind that in August there was that short sort of two to three daylong conflict between Islamic Jihad and the Israeli military. In those days, Hamas stood on the sidelines, and it was relatively a short-lived conflict. That may change this time. The Israeli military may be calculating that Hamas will try to stay out of it again. But Hamas is saying that there will be a joint response from Gaza. The Israeli military has called up reservists already and has notified residents here in the south, specifically around Gaza, to stay near their bomb shelters until at least tomorrow. Max?",

      "sentences": "Were police too heavy handed with protesters? London's Metropolitan Police has faced criticism for its handling of anti- monarchy protests during the coronation of King Charles III on Saturday in London. A total of 64 people were arrested for various offenses, according to the Met police, and six of them were detained under a controversial new law called the Public Order Act, which makes it illegal for demonstrators to use equipment to lock themselves to an object or a building.The Met later expressed regret for those six arrests, admitting that the investigation was unable to prove that the group intended to lock on and disrupt the protests. But some accused the force of trying to prevent the protest altogether. The Met police released a statement saying that those targeted were those it believed had an intention of disrupting the event. Now, the man sitting on the left of this video is the chief executive of Britain's largest anti-monarchy group, Republic. He was amongst those arrested. Graham Smith told the BBC he'd received a personal apology from police officers. He joins me now from Reading in England. Thanks so much for joining us, Graham. Just take us through what happened, because you were basically picking up placards, weren't you, at the time? GRAHAM SMITH, CEO OF ANTI-MONARCHY GROUP REPUBLIC: Yes. When you'll see on the footage of the van that we had hired, it was full of placards. We turned up fairly early in the morning. We had a couple of trolleys and our intention was to very quickly unload, get them down onto Trafalgar Square where the protest was, and get the van back up to North London where it could be parked and left out of everyone's way. So we were trying to be helpful and efficient so we didn't start to obstruct other people. My apologies, I think I just lost you there.",

I would guess 30 to 40 of them.They immediately instructed us to cease and desist unloading. They then detained us, searched us, searched the van and then arrested us and kept us in custody for 16 hours and haven't since said, you know, they had no grounds or they certainly said they had no grounds for going any further. In my view, they had absolutely no grounds for any of it, and that these were wholly unjustified.",

They certainly banned me from protesting and my colleagues and dozens of other people, you know, it's very difficult to protest from inside a police cell.You know, and they certainly disrupted and diminished our protest. We did have some of our people still there, but it was a rather disorganized and muted affair simply because of the action that they took. And we, you know, we had those meetings, and it wasn't simply that we said, look, we're going to be protesting. We had two sit down meetings with a senior police officer. We had numerous phone call conversations with other officers, and we went into great detail, including what equipment we would have for amplification, how many placards, how many people were likely to be there, where we would be. We gave them a map of where we would be and they repeatedly said until Friday that they had absolutely no concerns about any of that at all. And not only did their restless almost immediately on arrival, those that were on the square with amplification equipment were threatened with the rest if they used it. They confiscated the amplifiers that we had there for people making speeches and confiscated other items of equipment as well, including one of those large flags you may have seen in the footage. So, you know, this was a deliberate, concerted effort to diminish and disrupt the protest. And I would have very strong words for the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police if he thinks that my right to protest was in any way was not interrupted because I spent 16 hours in a police cell without any cause for suspicion or concern whatsoever.",
