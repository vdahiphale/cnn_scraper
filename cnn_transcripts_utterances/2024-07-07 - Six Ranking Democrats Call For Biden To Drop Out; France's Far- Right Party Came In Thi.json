This came during a call between ranking members and House Leader Hakeem Jeffries earlier today. And as President Biden hit the campaign trail on Pennsylvania today, telling supporters he's, quote, \"never been more optimistic\" about the future of America, insisting he's got the backing of his party.We're going to bring in CNN's Dana Bash in just a moment with what she's hearing from her sources. But first, CNN's Arlette Saenz is live outside the White House tracking all of these breaking developments. It's really quite incredible, this split-screen, Arlette, of a president digging in his heels and members of his own party telling him to step aside.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Pamela, you know, President Biden, when he was traveling today, said that he does believe that the Democratic Party is behind him, but you are consistently seeing the public and private pressure grow on President Biden to step aside in this race. The latest coming from CNN reporting that during a call with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries this afternoon, several top House Democrats said that they do believe it is time for President Biden to step aside.Sources have told CNN that there were about six of people who spoke up on this call saying that they do not think that the president should be the Democratic nominee. That includes people like Adam Smith, Susan Wild, Mark Takano, also Jerry Nadler, all calling in this private phone call we're told for the president to leave this race. Now, there were a few lawmakers on this call who spoke up in defense of this president. That included Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott. But sources said that the number of people speaking up for President Biden to step aside outweighed those speaking in support of him staying in this race. Now Hakeem Jeffries called this meeting with the ranking members on the Democratic side in order to really take the temperature of these leaders heading into this week. So much of the conversation around President Biden in the 2024 race has played out while Congress was away from Washington, D.C. That is about to change this week where lawmakers are set to return. They will be in front of reporters. They will be holding their own meetings. The likelihood is that there will be more calling for the president to step aside, more pressure growing on him at this moment. Now one thing sources said that was also notable from this call is that Jeffries himself has yet to publicly or even privately in these calls say which way he is leaning. He is really in a listening mode, trying to hear their members, believing that they have the ability and the right to make their voices heard. So we will see how this week plays out, but certainly this is all notable at a time when President Biden has been defiant saying that he is staying in this race through November. You saw that play out as he campaigned across Pennsylvania today. I will note that while he was in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, he was joined by some Pennsylvania elected officials, including Senator Bob Casey, Senator John Fetterman, as well as Congresswoman Madeleine Dean. He also made a stop with the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, in the campaign's view this is an opportunity to have him out there with his supporters to show that there are some lawmakers who are still behind the president remaining in this race. But certainly the pressure has been growing on him and we will see whether there are more calls to come as Congress is set to return here to Washington this week and how President Biden adapts to all of that at a time when he's insisting he is charging forward with his campaign, he is planning more battleground travel, heading to Michigan at the end of the week, and Nevada next week, even as some within his party are saying that it's time for the president to go in the 2024 race.",

My understanding is that he is clearly concerned. I mean, otherwise he wouldn't be having these calls in the first place, but he is acting as sort of a vessel for his members. But I do want to say one other thing, even though this is very significant, these are really important players in the House Democratic Caucus, people entrusted with really big positions in these really important committees.It's not just one sided. There are Democratic lawmakers who are saying absolutely do not go. I'm told that Maxine Waters, for example, veteran congresswoman from California, Bobby Scott also was saying, you know, this is the wrong thing. We cannot push Joe Biden out. And they're not alone. We are hearing that from other lawmakers and also from a lot of grassroots, organizers and people who have been home. I mean, remember, it's July 4th week, so all of these lawmakers have been home on July 4th. Most of them were out at parades or events. So they've really been interacting with their constituents. And it is not one-sided at all. Debbie Dingell was on \"STATE OF THE UNION\" with me this morning. She comes from the critical battleground state of Michigan and she said she heard just as much support for Joe Biden, pleading with her to tell him to stay in the race as people saying, please tell him to go.

And when the White House I think what, you know, and what you're probably hearing, too, Dana, is that when the members are back, when the leaders meet with their caucus both in the Senate and House, that is when we're going to get a much better sense, right, of where lawmakers are.But right now we have 11 defections at last count at least.

You know, a debate in June has never happened before. It happened because the Biden campaign realized that they were not on a trajectory to win. You know, I mean, they were the ones who are trailing and they needed to shake up the race. And if you look at Biden's position in '24 relative to 2020, what is his biggest problem?His biggest problem is declining performance among younger, non-white voters who are traditionally Democratic, and this debate, you know, really kind of reinforced and underscored their concerns that he's too old. 84 percent of people in that \"New York Times\"-Sienna poll under 45 said he's too old to be an effective president. So for those who are worried, it's not like this kind of drop -- you know, this is not the house dropping out of the sky in the \"Wizard of Oz.\" I mean, this was an existing problem that got worse, and at the least is an enormous opportunity lost and failing to put him on a better trajectory. So I think there's a lot of concern and I also think there's a surprising amount of willingness even among Democrats who have been skeptical of Kamala Harris to believe at this point that she is a better bet.",

Yes, under the rules, even his pledged delegates can vote against him on the first ballot. They changed those rules in the '80s after the fight over the so-called robot rule at the 1980 convention. But they are Biden delegates, they're not going anywhere unless he gets out of the race.If he does get out of the race, in theory, a whole bunch of candidates could get in. And as -- and you know, there is an audience for that in the Democratic Party, not only among the kind of the consultants and the political professionals, but also voters. There are voters who are dubious and they're professionals who were dubious that Harris is a better bet. I'm not sure that any the candidates who would be seen as a stronger general election candidate than Harris would actually get in the race against her if Biden steps aside. You know, whether Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or some of the others are willing to risk their long-term standing with black voters, with women's groups and others by taking on the first woman of color who's been on a national ticket, I'm not sure that really happens. And as a result, I think there are a surprising number of Democrats at least that I talked to who thinks that this could coalesce around Harris fairly quickly if Biden steps aside, and that in fact, at the least she can articulate the argument about Trump and the threat to rights, values, and democracy more crisply and effectively than Biden. All of which, you know, the gravity of all of which has been dramatically magnified by that Supreme Court decision, essentially giving him a green light to push against the boundaries of law if he's reelected.",

In a stunning reversal between the first and second rounds, the National Rally, which had come in first last week, now down to third. A huge victory for those left-wing parties who came together and that's what was being celebrated tonight, even if there have been scuffles now between the supporters of those left-wing parties and some of the police who'd come to try and keep order here, as these celebrations were underway. But for the National Rally, a massive moment of disappointment. They had hoped to become France's biggest party, first-party in the parliament. And that hasn't happened, Pam, because there's been a fair amount of tactical voting between the two rounds and because again this alliance has come together successfully to keep them out of power. The question now, what happens looking ahead, is that we will hear from the French prime minister, his resignation tomorrow morning, and we will wait to see whether that left-wing alliances can name and have appointed a prime minister. What's almost certain at this stage, Pam, is that we're looking ahead here in France to a period of great political deadlock, no doubt, because whatever the color of the next prime minister politically it is a prime minister who is going to have to work with Emmanuel Macron over the rest of his presidential term.

The facility that was attacked was actually a 99,000 square meter, almost a 100,000 square foot facility. So it was clearly a major transshipment point for the Russians and as you mentioned, it was here in Voronezh that this attack occurred.

It is basically the eastern part of Chasiv Yar. This is also the high ground, and what this means is that when you look at the big map, there is a highway that basically goes from here all the way straight up to Kharkiv.

Its why when Biden goes out to these Democratic rallies, he still gets thunderous applause. He is still well-liked by the majority of Democrats, even if there is a significant minority with this particular point want him to get out. But at this point, the Democratic voters are on Joe Biden's side and that's part of the reason why he is sticking in this race, at least for now.",

I don't know that the interview on Friday night did enough to answer those questions. And so I think this week is going to be absolutely critical. I think the president needs to do more.

A lot of his week here in DC will focus on the NATO Summit. They are set to assemble leaders from all around the world to talk about major foreign policy issues. Key among them, being Russia's war against Ukraine. So that will take up a lot of President Biden's attention here in Washington this week, but his campaign is already planning battleground state travel. He will be traveling to Michigan, I am told on Friday and then the Nevada at the beginning of the next week during the -- while the Republican National Convention is playing out. But one thing that you hear from Chris Murphy, you hear from other top allies like Senator Chris Coons, they want to see President Biden engage in these more unscripted impromptu moments, holding things like town halls and press conferences. Biden will hold a press conference with reporters on Thursday and today, at, at least two of his events, he was talking without a teleprompter, walking around the room. So you are seeing some changes being made as he is getting this advice from his allies.",

Now though, there are new signs of hope from hard science, on lifestyle interventions, to early detection and intervention. New tools are emerging to battle this horrible disease. This disease that also took my grandmother. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, spent five years investigating the breakthroughs in the documentary, \"The Last Alzheimer's Patient.\" DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: So Pamela, it is an incredible story and I think these are really hopeful times when it comes to dementia and that's what we really wanted to show there. Mike Carver was in his mid-60s when he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. Now, he is in his early 70s and his living a pretty normal life. What would have happened to him before is that he would have likely been told there is not much we can do, maybe we can slow down the progression, but there is really no hope for potentially reversing the signs of cognitive impairment. But in fact, that is what happened for him. And you can take a look, Pamela, at what the clinical trial entailed. It was a vegan diet. It is exercise daily. It is strength training three times a week, stress relief. There's group support sessions. For some people, that sounds like a lot, but also very doable for someone like Mike Carver. And I think what was most remarkable, Pamela, was that within five months, you saw these changes. It just speaks to how biodynamic the body and the brain can really be. These changes can happen and they can happen quickly. At the same time, Pamela, we also hear about new medications that are being made available. Donanemab was approved by the FDA. If you want to look at how well that works, it was about 29 percent slowing down of cognitive and functional decline, but there were also side effects. People had these brain bleeds more likely to happen in the donanemab group versus the placebo group. And then the cost of these drugs, astronomical. Pamela, we spend $4 trillion as a country every year on healthcare, those price tags that you see on the screen, they are obviously just going to add to that. And again, I think it is why when we talk about these lifestyle changes, we've seen what they can do for heart disease. We are now getting an idea of what these lifestyle changes can do for brain disease as well, such as Alzheimer's and about 40 percent probably of Alzheimer's cases according to these big trials around the world, 40 percent is preventable. These are big numbers worth paying attention to and that's why we are so excited about this documentary -- Pamela.",
