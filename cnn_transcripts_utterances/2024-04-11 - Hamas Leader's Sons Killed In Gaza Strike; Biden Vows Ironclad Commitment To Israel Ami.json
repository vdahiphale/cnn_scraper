Israel's military has claimed responsibility for an airstrike Wednesday that killed three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Hamas says several of Haniyeh's grandchildren and the driver were also killed. They'd been out visiting family during Eid al-Fitr marking the end of Ramadan when their vehicle was hit in a refugee camp.Israel says Haniyeh's sons were members of the Hamas military wing and had carried out terrorist activities but CNN cannot confirm that. Haniyeh who is based in Doha released a statement saying the killings would only strengthen Hamas's resolve and vowed never to compromise or surrender. He also said that anyone \"who thinks that by targeting my kids during negotiations before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands is delusional.\" However, Israeli officials stressed that the attack on Haniyeh's sons was not related to ceasefire and hostage release talks. Meanwhile, Hamas has told negotiators it can't identify and track down the 40 Israeli hostages that meet the criteria for a first phase of a -- of a potential ceasefire deal. And that's raising fears more hostages may be dead than previously known. The framework calls for the release of all women hostages as well as elderly or sick men in exchange for a six-week pause in the fighting and for many Palestinian prisoners to be freed. Meantime, the U.S. President says he's been very blunt and straightforward in talks with the Israeli Prime Minister about the need to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. And Israel's Defense Minister says there are now plans to flood the enclave with aid. The Israeli agency that handles the inspection and delivery of that aid is again blaming the U.N. for failing to distribute it. But the U.N. humanitarian affairs office accuses Israeli authorities of restricting access to many parts of the Palestinian territory.

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. remains iron clad and it's vowed to protect Israel from threats from Iran and its proxies. The U.S. has been actively preparing for Iran to target Israel or American assets in the region. An American official says there has been some communication between the U.S. and Iran this week with private messengers and warnings exchanged between the two sides. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden is hailing the relationship between the U.S. and Japan as a cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity as he hosts Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for an official visit in Washington.Just hours ago, the Biden administration held a state dinner to honor the key American ally with Mr. Biden again stressing the importance of the U.S. relationship with Japan saying it was \"stronger than it has ever been.\" A number of distinguished guests also took part in the Black Tie Event at the White House including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Bill and Hillary Clinton and actor Robert De Niro.

Diplomacy as well as more person-to-person contacts like student exchanges, efforts to fight climate change, space exploration, critical technologies like A.I. and defense. We have to underline defense. That was the key alliance takeaway here. In fact, 70 agreements on defense cooperation were made including moves to upgrade their military command structures.
