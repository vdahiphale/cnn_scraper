That charging state seeks to get the particular person who we're looking at there into their custody and jurisdiction. He's now in Pennsylvania.You have a right if you're a criminal defendant, to either waive extradition, meaning you're not going to fight, you're going to come back to the charging state or you're going to fight extradition. He has a right to do that. He's going to do that. But it's a very uphill battle, Kasie, here's why. Number one, all you have to show if you're the charging state New York, is that the actual warrant is facially sufficient. What that means in English is that there are no defects. It's written and drafted properly. Number two, in terms of what it says is probable cause to believe you wanted for specific crimes. And number three, that it is you, right? It's most probably you. And so, as long as you meet those standards, you're going. And so you have a right, no doubt to fight extradition. He's doing that. Now, it could be because he doesn't want to be at Rikers Island, right, right away. Rikers Island, of course, is the prison in New York City that is widely known. Or it just could be that he just intends to fight this tooth and nail. In any event, in that process, the judge has given him two weeks, his attorney, to put together a petition. And it takes generally about 30 days for the charging state to come get you after that's all said and done, so you can fight. But the realities are there are limited defenses, and he's coming to New York. The only question is when.",

So, definitely an element there as well.Max, we also just have this -- this just crossed here from us because were apparently hearing from the Syrian rebel leader now, and he seems to be trying to assure the international community that they won't engage in the kind of conflict that actually, you heard Benjamin Netanyahu warn about. So this is what he said, quote, the fear. And this is Mohammad al- Jolani, who is, of course, the leader of this group that's taken over. The U.S. does call them a terrorist group. There's no apparent intention to remove that designation, according -- according to John Kirby, in the last 24 hours or so. But here's what Jolani said: The fear was from the presence of the regime. The regime is now gone. The country is moving toward development and reconstruction. It's going towards stability, he says. People are exhausted from the war. The country is not ready for another one. It's not going to get into another one. And then he says this, quote, the source of our fears was from the Iranian militias, Hezbollah and the regime which committed the massacres we are seeing today. So he seems to be sending a message. I mean, you heard Netanyahu say there, you start arming Hezbollah and Iran, then we're going to have a problem. He seems to be trying to say that he doesn't want to have a problem.",

He's obviously the leader of the main rebel group, and he's become very much the face of this insurgence, really, in the country that ousted the regime.So it's just not, you know, how much of what he says is actually going to turn into truth. I mean, there's a huge amount of hope behind him. There's so many people that genuinely feel liberated in the country. But at some point, we expect there to be some sort of election. Will he emerge as the leader of that country, or will someone else emerge as the leader of that country? It's very difficult to see what's going to happen. I think were only going to really know in a few months time at the very earliest, how this government will shake out whether he does actually speak for the government. So I think this really speaks to partly what Israel is doing right now. They don't know what's going to come out of this, and they don't want any want to take any chances. And this is their opportunity to take out what they see as the threat.",
