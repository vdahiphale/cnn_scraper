But specifically for this, the concern are those demonstrations. As you mentioned, those protests have started in the city ever since the Israel-Hamas war started back in October. And they released some numbers yesterday and I just wanted to go through some of these with you. They have almost 500 protests that have happened in the city since the beginning of the war. They estimate just over 160,000 demonstrators have attended these protests. So, there's obviously a lot of deployment, a lot of manpower done by the NYPD. And there is precedent for this concern. If you remember, police had to make numerous arrests during the Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony because demonstrators had gone there to disrupt that event as well.And I asked Mayor Adams about this yesterday during a briefing and he told me that there were two main ways that they were going to really combat this. It was -- one was going to be technology and the other was going to be deployment of officers. The idea being that they were going to deploy the right amount of officers, no more and no less, but just enough so that they can address the situation without creating a vulnerability elsewhere. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: There's something that's known in policing, particularly when there's some type of terrorist action, of secondary devices and things like that. They want to draw attention from one area to go to a specific target area. We are really exercising our mental muscles to make sure that that does not happen. People have to maintain their locations and use minimum deployment from where a particular incident is happening so that we do not allow people to take us off our goal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
