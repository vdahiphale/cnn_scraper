That's not the way they do business.Now, I think what they're doing is trying to forcefully push back. They recognize this is a moment where they need to forcefully push back on some of what was in this report. And I think they did that by sending the president out last night to show some fire in the belly, to show some anger, which I actually think can be a good thing. That's actually something that combats this notion of age, or is he too old, when he shows that he's sparring with reporters, when he shows that he's fired up. So, I didn't think that was a bad thing, to be honest with you. But, you know, writ large, I think this question of age is certainly going to be one that is going to play out across the campaign. Now, I don't agree with Paul Begala that this is a bedwetting, hair on fire moment. I think it's a reminder that age is going to be one factor in this campaign, and it's something that the Biden campaign is going to have to deal with, and the Biden White House, and President Biden is going to have to take on directly. But, remember, there are going to be a lot of other factors in this campaign too, like people wanting to protect their right to have an abortion, like people not wanting a president in Donald Trump who's going to try to take away their right to vote, or overturn the results of a fairly contested election. So, I don't think that we should overcrank on the idea that this report is going to be the only thing that's going to matter in this election. And I think you've seen the White House push back forcefully today, and now the campaign needs to get on offense, and get back to talking about Donald Trump.",

So, he's calling on the army to give the cabinet, his cabinet, a plan of how the army is going to make sure the civilians are not in harm's way. It gives the impression of the prime minister feeling the political heat and pushing off the resolution or tamping down that heat, if you will, onto the military. But the military in the past has had a plan for trying to protect civilians. It's used it in Khan Younis, the military operation that has been going on for a number of months now. It calls for certain neighborhoods to be told by tax, by leaflets that are airdropped to take a certain route, leave at a certain time and go to a certain safe area. But what we've witnessed is that those routes are sometimes not safe, people get killed along the way. They're not safe in the safe area. Sometimes they get killed there and some people are too afraid to leave and don't leave, and they also have been killed.

The maximum they could have done to the people in the hospital would have been arrest and detain.

Well, we are just learning here that the House is going to bring up Mayorkas' impeachment articles again on Tuesday night. Of course, as you mentioned, the House failed to pass those impeachment articles this week with three House Republicans voting against it in what was a very embarrassing floor defeat for the leadership.

Now, the timing of this vote, Alex, is actually very notable because Tuesday night, there is a special election to replace the seat that was vacated by former Congressman George Santos.

Now, when it comes to that special counsel's report, even though Democrats, Republicans and President Biden himself have been focusing on that sentence that said that he was a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory, Donald Trump has not seized on that at all. Instead, he has focused on blurring the line between his special counsel case, Jack Smith, brought a mishandling class by documents as well as Biden's case saying that essentially it's a two-tiered justice system.

And if the Supreme Court does that, then the case will be on pause pending the big decision, which is, will the Supreme Court take the case? If the Supreme Court does not take the case, Alex, then I think we're going to very likely have a trial sometime around the summer. Obviously, that's a huge deal.

Residents now bracing for more bloodshed, more suffering.CNN's Nada Bashir has our report, and, again, some viewers may find some scenes disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over):  There are simply no words, this grandfather cradling the body of his seven-year-old granddaughter, Ataf (ph), beside the shallow grave, where she will soon be buried. I told her mother that Ataf is now above, in heaven, Ahmed (ph) says, with her aunt, her cousin and her grandmother, who are all waiting for her. You see, we have many martyrs in our family. Ahmed says his family had been taking shelter in a school in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit. It took hours, he says, to reach the nearest hospital still able to treat little Ataf, but it was too late. Across Gaza, more than 10,000 children have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-Ran Health Ministry. Many more left orphaned or facing life-changing injuries. In the central city of Deir al Balah, the airstrikes are near daily. Those who survive left to dig through the rubble with their bare hands in search of their loved ones. Meanwhile in Rafah, once deemed a safe zone, UNICEF estimates that there are now more than 600,000 children among the over a million people in the area, many taking shelter in these sprawling tent cities. The southern city has for weeks come under relentless airstrikes by the Israeli military who say they are targeting Hamas. But now a looming ground operation is stoking fears that Rafah could become, as one aid group has described it, a zone of bloodshed. If by some misfortune there's an invasion of Rafah, two-thirds of the population will die, Gabr says. We can't get out of Rafah. We have no other alternative. Israel says it is now calling for a mass evacuation of civilians in the southern city ahead of a planned ground offensive. But it is almost impossible to fathom where else these civilians can turn to. But Rafah has not only become a vital lifeline for the displaced, it is also a crucial gateway for humanitarian aid crossing over from Egypt, and many in the international community are now sounding alarm bells over Israel's warning. ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL:  And I am especially alarmed by reports that the Israeli military intends to focus next on Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been squeezed in a desperate search for safety.",
