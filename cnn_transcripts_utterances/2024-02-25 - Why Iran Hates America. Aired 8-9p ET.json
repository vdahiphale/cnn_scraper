To answer those questions, we need to go back decades and try to understand, WHY IRAN HATES AMERICA. (END VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (on-camera): Good evening. I'm Fareed Zakaria. Iran in the United States shared deep psychic and emotional scars going back years but none is remembered more by Americans than the hostage crisis of 1979. We watched what appeared to be an irrational, furious attack and wondered why or how anyone would act this way. But to Iran, taking the hostages was completely rational given the history that led up to that moment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): In November 1979 Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, turning it into a prison for American embassy staff. The young revolutionary spent months in the embassy's basement trying to piece together evidence of past American misdeeds. Why? Because decades earlier, that basement was where American and British spies had plotted a coup against what had long been a close ally.
