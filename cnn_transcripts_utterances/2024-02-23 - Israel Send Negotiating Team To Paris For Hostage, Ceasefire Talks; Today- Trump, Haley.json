      "sentences": "Well, actually, it's a public holiday here in Russia. And that's one of the reasons why there hasn't been a public response so far from the Kremlin that this latest wrath of U.S. sanctions. But I mean, there have been so many sanctions imposed by the United States and the E.U. and Britain and others over the course of the past several years.I think it's pretty clear what the response will be. It's that they regard these kinds of actions by the United States and others as illegal, and they say that it won't affect Russia's ability to do business. I mean, clearly, it increases the cost of Russia doing business. They have to pay third parties. They have to pay middlemen. And so that's something. But, you know, when they sanction individuals, for instance, who are senior in the Russian penitentiary service in response to the death of Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent critic. Well, within the context of Russia, it's almost like a badge of honor for an official to get sanctioned by the United States. And so that's something. The other issue, which I think is the most important one, is that despite the fact that Russia is the most sanctioned country in the world now, it's got more than 16,000 individual sanctions imposed against it by the United States, by the European Union, and by others. It doesn't appear to have done anything to divert it from its course of action. The conflict in Ukraine, what it calls its special military operation, is continuing. The crackdown on opponents and dissidents inside Russia as we've seen with the death of Alexei Navalny, that continues as well. And that must be, I think that is very frustrating for people around the world and for Russians that want to see the situation to be changed. Sara? SIDNER: Matthew Chance, as always, thank you so much for your reporting as well as you there, Priscilla Alvarez, waiting on comments from President Biden. That should happen very shortly. Kate?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And there's so much obviously, on the President's plate, including keeping an eye on what exactly is happening overseas with hostage negotiations. Israeli negotiators are heading to Paris right now to try and continue talks over securing the release of more hostages from Gaza, hostages who have now been held by Hamas for four months. They will be joining CIA Director Bill Burns and Egyptian and Qatari counterparts in Paris to get these talks going once again.The goal is to reach a deal ahead of Ramadan next month. Now in another significant step, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed a formal proposal for the first time, really, for post Hamas, a post Hamas future in Gaza, a day after plan, one that would include Israel maintaining security control in Gaza and at its entry and exit points. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following all of this. He's back with us now from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, let's start there. What does -- let's start with the meeting in Paris. What does the meeting in Paris at this point, in this moment, what does it say about the negotiations that have been long and hard and tough?",

      "sentences": "Yes, these images from Maxar satellite imagery, they say that this buffer zone that they can see is about 16.5 square kilometers over 6 square miles of area that has been bulldozed. And they've been doing this over the last several weeks. They actually began this bulldozing process on February 6th. So it just kind of gives you a sense of the scale of this project, not only clearing this entire six square mile area around the border, on the Egyptian side of the border, but also creating this border wall there.And all of this is because Egyptian officials are concerned that if Israel pushes into Rafah, where there are 1.5 million Palestinians currently sheltering, that that could provoke perhaps a mass exodus of Palestinians heading into Egypt. Israel has indicated that it is not their intention to send Palestinians into Egypt. They've said instead that they are working on plans to evacuate civilians further north in Gaza. But this, of course, raises enormous questions about that military offensive, the potential ramifications. And today, the Israeli prime minister, as he talked about his post war plans for Gaza, he very much envisions this very same area, the Egypt-Gaza border, being controlled by Israel for security purposes. And that would certainly be a key part of any potential Israeli offensive into Rafah.",

Donald Trump is heading there, Kristen. What are you -- Nikki Haley is making clear she's running hard. She's running through the tape and she is not quitting. What does that mean?

That has really been Nikki Haley's main message, that everything that surrounds Donald Trump, whether it's his legal issues or his political issues, ends in some sort of chaos. She's even created the slogan Make America Normal Again. But despite all of her efforts, despite the fact that she has completely outpaced him on the campaign trail, she has completely outspent him on the campaign trail.Those recent polls still show her up 30 points, but that's not stopping her from that last minute attempt, as you said, releasing this digital ad really linking Donald Trump to dictators and a highlight reel of every controversial and at times hateful thing that Donald Trump has ever said.
