He is 70 plus years old right now and he has dedicated his life to this moment.And he says, for the remaining part of my life, I want to be of service. I think what's extraordinary, also, is that, given what we are talking about, he has a completely different relationship 1,000 years ago up until today between people and monarchy. They've had to really thread the needle here to try to make it relevant. You keep hearing this word, relevance to the people today. Let's not forget that we are in an incredibly difficult time in history today in the United Kingdom. This, on one hand, gives a huge boost of patriotism, of connection, of community, of unity. But there is so much the new king knows and they all know has to be done to really make this monarchy continue to be relevant. The multifaith part of it is one of the parts. The slimmed down part of it is one of the parts. It won't be as expensive and extensive as Queen Elizabeth's 70 years ago. It won't be as long. It is extraordinary that it is multifaith. Charles himself said that I will no longer be called and I will not be called defender of the faith, because this was a Christian nation. But in respect to the fact that it is a multicultural nation now, defender of the faiths. There is a beautiful little anecdote about the chief rabbi, who was invited by King Charles to spend the night at the palace nearby, St. James' Palace, so that he could walk, because it is Saturday.

It is really an unprecedented collection of individuals and underscores the power and diplomatic import of an event like this. We are also hoping to see in the coming minutes the first arrivals of figures and heads of state and the U.K. prime minister, leading up to the arrival of the royal family and the king of the queen themselves.

King Charles I spent a lot of time in direct conflict with his parliament and eventually ended up in civil war. In 1649 he was beheaded.

But only by a few minutes.Obviously the pages, George, need to be there as well as the king's ready to step off, so they can join that procession. I will say this procession that we're about to see, going into the abbey, will say so much about today. He will have peers there but also members of other religions. You have Prince George walking behind. And we do have to know that the king's champion, who is a former accountant, who traces his lineage back to 1066.

So this is a quite spectacular moment and something that we haven't seen for 70 years. The queen's pages are there, holding the robe as you see them walking in there. They'll wear a different set of robes on the way out. These are robes of state. They wear the roads of estate on the way out. The king is waiting inside. He will be the last person obviously to enter the church, the most senior. COOPER:  And there's the king getting out of the carriage now.
