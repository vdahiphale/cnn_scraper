A protest organizer took to the stage not long ago and claimed that they have succeeded in blocking about six intersections of D.C. not far from here. They'll tend to block an intersection, get their message across, and then move along. That's the strategy that they're using. So that's been going on, as well as these central protests here at the foot of the Capitol. Some of the other images we can show you, some very distinctive images are -- I want to stick to feature of this is that there are a lot of protesters here of the Jewish faith. There's a group called Jewish Voice for Peace. They are several hundred strong. They have come down here. You can see their t-shirts here. Several of them were arrested yesterday afternoon in the rotunda of the Capitol. And we've talked to several of them as well. And I presented to them the question of, the potential ceasefire and how close we are possibly to getting a ceasefire. Well, several members of that group told us that they don't really believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is interested in a ceasefire. Some of them think it's an outright ruse by the prime minister. One of their central messages is they want the U.S. to stop funding Netanyahu's government. And that's what they're trying to get across. They are here today after being arrested, a couple of hundred of them in the Capitol rotunda yesterday. Again, you've got speeches going on over here, over my right shoulder. Jon is going to kind of -- maybe Jon can raise your camera a little bit and kind of see the breadth of the crowd, very dense crowd up there, and they promise to be here at least through the time that Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to Congress.

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly is telling that there are people in a democratic country, the United States, who can use their voice to protest a democratically elected leader in another country and do so in a way that doesn't get them arrested or maybe sometimes, if they're arrested, if they're not breaking -- if they are breaking the law, but not get hurt by the people they are protesting. Thank you so much. Appreciate that.Joining me now are two people who will be attending Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, Yael and Adi Alexander. Their 20-year-old son, Edan, is an Israeli American who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their barbaric October 7 attack on Israel. Thank you so much to both of you for being here. I mean, nobody can imagine -- fathom what you have been going through for the last 291 days. Also hard to imagine it's been that long. You know that there are some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, maybe even all Democrats who are going to boycott this speech, for the most part, not because they don't support the State of Israel, but because they don't support the way that Benjamin Netanyahu is prosecuting the war. You both will be attending. Why is it so important for you to be there? And what do you want to hear specifically from him? YAEL ALEXANDER, MOTHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE: Basically, I'm hoping to hear him to speak about the hostages and to say to everyone that a deal is coming and it's going to happen soon. Matter of days even, like it's 292 days since the last time I spoke with my son, with Edan, and it's been a torture for us, for the whole family. We are living in this nightmare. We are stuck in October 7 still, like we are doing whatever we can. But as a parent, we still feeling as a failure. Why? Because Edan is not home and we are hoping to hear Benjamin Netanyahu saying today that the deal is going to happen and we are going to start seeing it.",

I'm sure you have heard some other family members of hostages have said, like Aviva Siegel have said point blank, they believe that he's dragging his feet on a deal because he's worried that that will mean, ultimately, that he will lose power. Are you there?A. ALEXANDER: I hope it's a political posture and he is waiting for the right moment. One of those is actually that an Israeli parliament goes on recession tomorrow and they would not be able to shut down the government, so this is my hope. But again, we'll have the opportunity to meet him today and tomorrow after the meeting with President Biden. That will be more intimate meeting with him and with President Biden.

And I think we find ourselves in a different place right now.Yes, there are the protests that we've seen and yes, we have members of the Democratic Party boycotting Netanyahu's speech. I'm not sure it is quite as debilitating a moment for the Democrats as it had been previously around this issue, maybe due to the change of the ticket. Kamala Harris has sounded slightly different notes on this topic. What I find fascinating is Netanyahu's ability over decades to inject himself into American politics, into big American political moments. I mean, he's about to meet with Biden tomorrow after he addresses Congress, and Kamala Harris, and then go meet with Donald Trump, all in this one huge American political week. This is a man who understands how to sort of play the American political media game.
