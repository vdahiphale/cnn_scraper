The heat destroying crops and livestock, triggering wildfires, exacerbating water shortages and, sadly, killing people. \"Heat hell\" is how one scientist is describing it. Meteorologist Chad Myers is here with details on the report. And, Chad, you and I talk about this all the time. There's been some wild weather. I know weather is not climate, but there are weather patterns that the data shows and has for years are the result of the warming planet.

I know that there is not exactly day-to-day or month-to-month, because, like you said, that's weather, not climate.But we know that things are going to get more extreme. And we know that there's been extreme heat in the desert southwest the past three or four weeks. We know there's been pretty extreme weather across parts of New Hampshire, all the way up through Nova Scotia, all those areas that flooded significantly. And those extremes are becoming more normal than what they were. What would have happened every 20 or 30 years, now can happen every two or three. Now we're going to see this heat move into the northeast, where temperatures even in New York City are going to approach 96. So the heatwaves in 2023, here, 3.6 degrees above normal across the southwest, 4.5, and 1.8 across parts of China. This is what we're talking about when they said, this would virtually be impossible to get to these numbers, because we are so far above the records, we are so far above in breaking records day after day. So we should have heatwaves about every one to 15 years here, just like this. But with global warming going on, that may change a lot, because this is where normal used to be. Now we know that normal is farther to the right. [13:44:58] The bell curve has changed. The standard deviation has changed. We're now going to see three times more likelihood of those type of flash floods, those type of heatwaves, because of where we are now in this globally warming planet. We have been above the old record now since July 3rd, the record set back in 2016, right there. We've been above that and above all of the other Julys. So we're absolutely going to break July's records, no question about that. China has been over 50 degrees. They've never had a number like that ever, ever recorded. So, yes, places are hot. And 25 degrees in a row where the high temperature in Phoenix has been over 110. Patterns are stuck. If these things moved and we get two to three days like this, OK.

They called on him to end his blockade because they say it jeopardized national security and disrupts the lives of servicemembers and their families. The petition said, in part, quote, \"No matter your political beliefs, you must agree that servicemembers and military families will not be used as political leverage. \"It's time to end this political showmanship and recommit to respect the service and sacrifice of those who pledge to defend this nation.\" Tuberville has blocked nearly 300 nominations, including roles for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commandant of Marine Corps. He's doing it as a way to protest new Pentagon policies on reproductive health care. A spokesperson for the Senator sent CNN a statement defending his position say this, quote: \"Coach honors and is grateful for the service of all of our heroes in uniform. That is why he's working to get politics out of the military, using the tools he has as a United States Senator, including his hold.\" Let's get some perspective from Sarah Streyder. She's the executive director of the Secure Families Initial. She's also a military spouse herself. Sarah, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us and for all of the effort that your family's put into defending our nation. What is your response to Senator Tuberville's response to your statement? SARAH STEYDER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SECURE FAMILIES INITIATIVE &amp; MILITARY SPOUSE: Unfortunately, it reminds me of the kind of platitude I think military families are all too used to. Folks say that they honor our service and sacrifice, while simultaneously pushing for policies that undermine that service and that sacrifice. You know, if I got the chance to speak to the Senator in person, which, unfortunately, we were unable to do yesterday as he was at a fundraiser, what I would have explained to him is this is affecting every single one of us with a loved one in uniform. It's like pulling a football coach in the biggest game of the season and expecting that to not affect the players on the field. Please stop this.",

We've heard from spouses who have already quit their old jobs and can't move and get the new job so they're in some financial limbo as well. But I think the most alarming stories are from families who have military kids who are about to turn 18, who are taking one look at these political games being played with the military and strongly considering not joining because they don't want to put their careers at risk. Those are the stories I want us to pay most close attention because this is going to have ramification for recruitment in the future.",
