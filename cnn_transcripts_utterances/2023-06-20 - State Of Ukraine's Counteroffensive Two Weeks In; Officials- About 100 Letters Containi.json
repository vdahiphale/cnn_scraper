      "sentences": "New overnight, Ukraine says Russia launched another massive air attack on Kyiv using various Iranian drones. Now, this comes two weeks into Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia. President Zelenskyy says his troops have not lost any positions so far.A senior Ukrainian official says that Kyiv has recaptured eight southern settlements in the last few weeks but, still, the offensive operations have not yet gained the momentum that some were anticipating. CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton is with us now. Colonel, good to see you. Let's start with just framing the conversation and analyzing the effectiveness of the counteroffensive at this point. Can this analysis be as simple as succeeding-failing just a couple of weeks in? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF, PENTAGON:  Not really, Victor, and good morning to you. The real thing about this is that there is so much that's going on here that it's really hard to determine exactly who is winning and who is losing. And, you know, when you take a look at historical comparisons like, let's say, D-Day back in 1944, it took a long time for allied forces to actually go through all of France to actually conquer and reconquer that territory. So the Ukrainians have actually done pretty well in the last few weeks because what they've been able to do is not only capture these eight settlements that you talked about right here but they've also been able to expand some of their operations. And as President Zelenskyy mentioned, they have not lost any territory to the Russians. And that's in spite of some of the Russian's ability to move aircraft and artillery into areas and to really take a large piece of this front and turn it into an artillery zone -- a free fire zone if you will for them",

      "sentences": "So this is really interesting when you look at some of the different aspects of this, Victor.Let's compare things, first of all, with what things were like back last year when Ukraine very quickly captured this area around Kharkiv. So they captured around 3,400 square miles. They're not doing that right now. And one of the reasons that they really can't do that is because of the trenches and these things called dragon's teeth that the -- that the Russians have put in place right here. So this is an example of that. They are also right here on the other side of the road. But what these things are doing is they're preventing tanks from moving forward in these areas. And plus, what they also do is they force an advance only along these paths right here. And that, of course, can be blocked up. So the Russians are far readier than they were before to control these areas. That makes it very difficult for the Ukrainians to move forward in these cases.",

      "sentences": "So, yes, that's a really good point, Victor. Because when Ukraine gained its independence back in August of 1991 from the Soviet Union, it had a population of 52 million people. Right now, it's somewhere around 43-plus million and that's not including movements by refugees out of Ukraine, internally displaced people.So what this means is that they have a far fewer population pool to pull from -- far less of a pool to pull from than they had back when they first gained independence. So it's making it more difficult, in some ways, for them to really put their defensive forces together. They can obviously do it but they have a big demographic challenge, which is actually greater than Russia's demographic challenge at this point in time.",

So this is a measure that really looks at the population level, not at the individual level. And so, the American Medical Association is out now with a recommendation to try to move beyond this.
