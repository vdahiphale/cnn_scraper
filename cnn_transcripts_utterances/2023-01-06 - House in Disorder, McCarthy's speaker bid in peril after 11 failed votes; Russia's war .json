Negotiations have showed signs of progressing.  We are told at CNN that Kevin McCarthy did put pen to paper and made a concrete offer to the critics and to the holdouts that he hopes will give them enough concessions even more than he already has in order to get him the votes for speaker. Now, critics were hauled into his office and invited to review the offer.  However, leaving that meeting a number of the holdouts were very tight-lipped and have not said whether they changed their votes. So, it is likely we could see some movement today as people have time to process and digest what this offer actually is. But sources cautioning to CNN this could potentially only move around ten votes, 10 out of the 20 votes against Kevin McCarthy.  That still leaves Kevin McCarthy short of 218 votes he needs to become speaker and perhaps more problematically for Kevin McCarthy is that there could be anywhere between four and six Republicans who will not vote for Kevin McCarthy under any circumstances.  He can only afford to lose four votes. So, it could still be a tough road ahead for him and meanwhile senior Republicans are worried that he is giving away concession after concession and he might not get anything in return.  So, that's the state of play as we head into the next vote today.  Congress will adjourn at noon.  We'll see whether Kevin McCarthy can show some momentum.  Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.",

I know the term has been coined, it's the popcorn caucus, but we three are it right now.I was up for hours trying to follow what was going on here and yet nothing really happened.  In fact, things arguably got worse for Kevin McCarthy. John, the comments from the Republicans, you know, they were pretty serious.  Many of them criticizing the dissenters quite vocally and accused them of essentially burning down the house. I mean what's your opinion there.  Do you think that holds sway importantly with republican voters? JOHN PHILLIPS, KABC TALK RADIO HOST:  No, I don't.  I don't think republican voters are necessarily following the ins and outs of this internal caucus conflict.  I think largely the 20 votes or 20 similar votes that are not with Kevin McCarthy at this point are largely on the same page with Kevin McCarthy when you look at the big picture, the grand scheme of things. They may not like specific policy positions he's taken.  They may not like the way he counts votes.  They may not like the cut of his jib, but the reality is that the Democrats control the U.S. Senate. The Democrats control The White House.  So, if you're a republican, the role of the House of Representatives is to block a lot of what the Democrats are going to try to push through the United States Senate that the White House would like to sign. On that subject, which is what the House is going to be doing the next two years, those two sides are on the same page, McCarthy and the 20 votes that aren't with him.  So, I would imagine as they sit in a room staring at one another, yelling at one another, having the food fight, at a certain point, they're going to have to iron these things out because they want to block that agenda and they can't do it unless they reach kumbaya.",

Look, the reality is that Kevin McCarthy has very small margins in the House. He doesn't have control over his caucus the way that Nancy Pelosi did over hers, which she ruled with an iron fist in a Gucci glove. He is going to have to bring back to his committee chairmen and subcommittee chairmen and make the House run like it used to when all of the power wasn't in the speaker's office, but it rested in the committees.

You know, a lot of republicans who are very anxious to turn the page from Donald Trump controlling the party would tell you that it's-- it is his failing essentially support within the Republican Party that it's dwindling, but I actually don't think that it was a full-throated support.I don't think he's done everything that he can to support Kevin McCarthy, I think for obviously reasons.  And I think probably he's enjoying this.  You know, Kevin McCarthy is somebody that at the-- right when the insurrection happened, he came out against Donald Trump, essentially put the blame on him and then we know that he did a complete 180 going down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring. So, Kevin McCarthy has shown that he will twist in the wind and he will go with whatever direction the wind is blowing.  Donald Trump knows that and so I think at the end of the day there are people who still, still have a lot of support for and still really like Donald Trump within Republican Party and all of this may not be about Donald Trump, but it's about Trumpism. It's about what he put in place. It's about what he started and it is about what happened two years ago and the fact that so many of those people are still within the Republican caucus and they are the ones who are in control right now, they are wagging the dog and that is I think the ultimate problem that anyone, if Kevin McCarthy gets their Speaker and again, I don't see a path for him to get there, but whoever becomes Speaker is going to have a huge problem in actually doing the business of the people. Like John said, what they were elected to do, I don't see them having the ability to do that if Kevin McCarthy gives into all the concessions and one person can call for his downfall.

So, it seems, you know, in those conditions have you have a unilateral ceasefire?  Maybe, we'll see a diminution in the amount of shooting and shelling going along the frontlines briefly, maybe. Maybe, that's what's going to happen. But I think President Zelenskyy is right to be skeptical.  He said that he thinks that Russia will just use the time to reequip, rearm.

But there's nothing really in the middle ground that he can work with when he told Putin yesterday according to his readout of their phone call that he should call a unilateral ceasefire and accept some more real terms of what a lasting peace could look like.  Putin came back with his version of that which is 'I'm going to keep the territory I've already annexed, those four regions, and that's not going to fly at all with Ukraine.So, you know, Erdogan's trying to get in there to be a middle man, but there's nothing to hold on in the middle ground as nothing there at all. President Zelenskyy said very clearly I've got this ten-point peace plan and tried to reiterate this again yesterday said look, 'I put it out in November.  Russia had lost 82,000 troops by that point.' He said, 'We put forward a Christmas ceasefire option in the middle of December. By then Russia had lost 95,000 troops and now he says Russia finally wants an orthodox Christmas ceasefire, they've lost 110,000 troops.' Reality is that this ceasefire does-- it plays better for Putin at home than anywhere else because the war is unpopular.  So, no middle ground, an unpopular war in Russia, Putin tries to gain something at home.  Nothing changes in the battlefield.",

The story that you just relayed about visiting a psychic who also told the story about how Princess Diana was supposedly present at Christmas time when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie broke a Christmas ornament of Queen Elizabeth II. We're hearing more about Harry's partying days and admissions of drug taking, cocaine, magic mushrooms. And about his time in the army which a former national security adviser to the U.K. said he would have advised against. He talks about having killed 25 people, about how he did that. Seeing those on the battlefield as chess pieces rather than human beings. Some in the military community wondering if that can present a security threat to his family. And we're also learning three pre- recorded interviews that accompany the release of this (inaudible) about Prince Harry's own view of how he used to approach the press in the United Kingdom and how he learned through the treatment of his wife Meghan Markle more disappointing details, he believes, about the way that they approach what they do.
