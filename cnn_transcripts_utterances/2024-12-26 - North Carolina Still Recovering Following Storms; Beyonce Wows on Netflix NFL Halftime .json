      "sentences": "A very good morning to you. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, D.C. Pamela Brown is off.And we begin this hour with breaking news and disturbing allegations in the deadly Christmas morning crash of a passenger plane in Kazakstan. Reuters is reporting multiple unnamed sources in Azerbaijan with knowledge of this investigation now believe that passenger jet was downed by a Russian air defense system. Russia initially claiming a bird strike forcing the emergency landing, but holes seen in the wreckage are raising some suspicions. We also have new video this morning aboard the plane just moments before that crash. You hear that man apparently recording himself reciting a prayer as that plane was in distress. CNN has not been able to verify the man's identity or if he survived the crash. Let's bring in CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz. He's a former managing director of the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, of course. And, Peter, it's nice to see you today. This video, though, is pretty heart-wrenching to listen to and see. You hear this man praying in what must have been very terrifying moments for him. And you have to think that clearly the passengers at that point knew something was wrong.",

In 2014, MH270 -- or MH17 was flying over Ukraine, and Russian-controlled separatists launched a missile that took that plane out and 298 people were killed. There was -- this speculation yesterday all didn't make much sense, the idea of a bird strike and then the plane diverting across the Caspian Sea. Something was up.

They have understood marketing for years. This is our national halftime, the NFL, obviously, football. Americans love it. They can't get enough of it. And we thought about Super Bowl Sunday, of course, which is like a national holiday. We certainly know that the NFL has a game of the week, right? They have a day of the week, basically, Sunday, that is theirs. They have moved into Saturday, Thursday night. But now this, just a super smart move by the National Football League. Everyone's home. Everyone wants to do something other than eat or open presents after a while. And what do they want to do? They want to watch sports. This is the United States. This is what we love. So the NBA kind of had Christmas. In fact, LeBron James even said, hey, NFL, the NBA, Christmas is ours. Well, not so much anymore. And I think that we're going to see, in addition to 200 countries -- according to Netflix, that the game was watched in about 200 countries.

That's -- you're in the United States, right, and you're watching it because you're an American sports fan. Well, the NFL has made forays over the last, what, couple decades in terms of playing internationally, especially London, but other European nations as well. Well, now you can reach those fans who love American football. They may not understand it. They always say, why is it stopping and starting and stopping and starting?

So what we were watching, even though those games were actually not close, what fans were watching were some of the greatest names in the sport, not just right now, Jessica, but throughout history, with these records, Patrick Mahomes doing crazy Patrick Mahomes things, again, as I said, Lamar Jackson with Baltimore. Kansas City, Baltimore, these are two marquee teams, as well, of course, is the Steelers and Houston. So that's what they gave us. These were not duds, other than the score.
