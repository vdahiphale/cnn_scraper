The U.S. owes trillions of dollars in debt to several different countries because the government spends more than it brings in in taxes. The U.S. borrows money from other countries to cover its expenses. Becoming financially stable can be a very complicated process, but in the end, it comes down to basic math. Did you earn more than you spent? If so, then things should be OK. Well, when put into those terms, the U.S. government is not in the best shape. It`s expensive to run the government. And in order to pay for social services like Medicare, which is healthcare partially paid for by the government for people over the age of 65, the government needs to collect taxes to cover the cost and the thousands of other costs like it for which the government pays. For the last several years, for both Democratic and Republican administrations, the U.S. government has been spending more than it collects in taxes. Our Matt Egan breaks down the financial terms for us and makes sense, if you will, of the country`s current financial predicament. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It`s going to affect rates on getting a loan to purchase a vehicle. Credit card loans. Any borrowing we need to do, it`s just going to be more costly to do it. The interest payments on the debt is starting to add up and starting to crowd out the kind of things we want our government to do. I mean, the interest payments now are over a trillion dollars.
