Israel agrees to day-long pauses in fighting, but only if Hamas releases 10 hostages each day. A pause in fighting reveals utter destruction across Gaza by Israel's military offensive, described by the UN as the deadliest urban campaign since World War II.And CNN's third annual Call to Earth Day. This year, our shared home, raising environmental awareness worldwide. Hamas and Israel have agreed to extend a 4-day-long truce for another two days in return for the release of 20 more hostages being held in Gaza. On Monday, 11 Israelis with dual citizenship, 9 children and two women, were released by Hamas. All were taken to a medical center in Tel Aviv and then reunited with family. They were all taken hostage from the same kibbutz in southern Israel on October 7 by Hamas militants. For families of those Israelis who were set free, the past seven weeks have been a rollercoaster of emotion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we also have a list of potential Palestinian prisoners that we have agreed to release as part of the outline. And you stated correctly, as CNN reported, that we said that for every extra 10 hostages that Hamas would release, we would agree to another extra day of humanitarian pause in the fighting. We want to see more hostages coming out of the Gaza Strip. We want to see all of the hostages returning to their homes. Keep in mind that the hostages, the 11 that returned today and the ones, a total of 50 overall that were released over the course of the past four days, returned to a very, very difficult reality. Some of them have fathers, husbands, who are still being held captive in the Gaza Strip, or brothers, and some of them lost loved ones. So, and also keep in mind that they didn't really return home, because what is home? These communities were completely shattered. They don't have a home. Hamas, in some cases, burnt their homes. And we had to evacuate these southern communities, as we did with some communities up in the north. More than 200,000 Israelis have been evacuated due to the war.",

They were believed to be among the initial 50 women and children hostages to be released by Hamas during a 4-day truce period. Abigail Edan was one of them. She, of course, was released on Sunday. And then two additional American women, but day four of the truce, coming and going without those two women being released.We can't say anything at this point about the condition of those women, their whereabouts, or if and when they may end up being released. But this is a part of the big reason why the White House has been pushing for this truce to be extended beyond those initial four days. The longer the truce obviously means that more hostages can hopefully get out. And what we are told is that senior White House officials on Monday made a whole bunch of phone calls to the Qatari prime minister to work on getting this truce extended. CIA Director Bill Burns, we are told, was also intimately involved. And National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was keeping the president apprised the entire time. So we are about to learn, probably in the next 48 hours or so, whether these two American women will end up being released as a part of the next group of 20 or so women and children hostages to be released over the course of two days. And then after that, the question, of course, for this White House very much turns to the 7 other hostages. For the White House, as you know, they are men. We are told that they are unaccounted for Americans. We know that they are men, according to the White House. But we, again, don't know anything about their condition as well.

Obviously, if you're talking to Netanyahu and his cabinet and the IDF, the ceasefire was a very strong, powerful win for Hamas. And this extension over four days that has been -- surprisingly gone well, considering the tinderbox situation we have. But it's a victory for Hamas. Every day that the ceasefire continues, is an ultimately victory for Hamas. They're getting 3 to 1 of their citizens back that have been held in Israeli jails. But if you ask the average Israeli on the streets, especially one who had a family member taken hostage, they're going to say today they came out on top. No easy answer, to be honest.",

O'SHEA: Well, a collection of reports, even from the young children, will give an indication on what the conditions are of the rest of the hostages. And more importantly, most importantly, the fact that they hope we can get an accounting of other hostages and their conditions and their status. So it will be valuable information, but you know, the bottom line is that we know they were held, presumably, all in the tunnels. They're not going to have a lot of, quote, \"actual intelligence,\" because they were probably completely disoriented the entire time. Probably in darkness for most of it, and they had no natural light. So their sense of perspective, where they might have been held, maybe they'll give information on how close the IDF airstrikes or if they heard tanks and whatnot.

The U.S. administration, in particular, has made a very public statement about the president himself getting involved, and the emir of Qatar as we all know. Qatar has turned out to be the Switzerland of the Middle East these days doing all the coordination behind the scenes negotiating and whatnot. But that's dangerous, and when Kirby makes a statement about, We're hoping Americans are going to be released, you're raising expectations for those families in America. And more importantly, you're raising the value of these hostages to Hamas directly, which actually makes it -- them more likely to hold on. Because the moment they give up these reportedly nine remaining American hostages, there will be no more leverage on Netanyahu from the international community coming down on him as the pressure he's felt. So that -- I do not agree with the emphasis and the constant reporting of senior level involvement from the U.S. administration. I think that puts -- extends the plot (ph), because Hamas, their survivability is maintained on holding onto these hostages. And there will be a countenance (ph) on holding onto the ones that are more important those arrival, and right now those Americans are key to that.",

But it gets them, again, as you said, two more days to rearm, rethink, and prepare for the next wave of the IDF offensive. That arguably they've secured the North, from what, you know, they're reporting, on and the next phase will be going into the South, which will be even more challenging because, as we know, the refugees from the North, a million-plus Hamas, Gazan residents, have moved now South to the South of Gaza.
