We're going to see both President Biden and Vice President Harris travel to Ground Zero, to Shanksville, to the Pentagon, as we Mark and remember those lives. But we do also want to start here with the historic night last night. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us. Democrats are waking up this morning thrilled about last night and asking, Hey, when can Kamala Harris debate Donald Trump again? Last night's debate was the first time that Harris and Trump had ever met in person. And the tone was set before either had spoken. Harris crossed the stage, extended her hand, and insisted on a handshake. She introduced herself: \"I'm Kamala Harris,\" she said. The vice president did seem nervous at first when she started talking behind the podium, but she found her footing pretty quickly after the moderators asked about abortion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, she made him look angry, defensive, weak. She, as Mark was saying, she looked calm. She looked in control. And so, you know, not only did she manage to draw out kind of the worst of him and his worst impulses and kind of show the country, you want the guy who's shouting about how they're eating dogs? Is that -- you know, is that what you want in your leader? You know, she managed to get it at that. But she also, I think, undermined his, you know, perceived sense of strength. And that was a critically important thing for her to do, and not easy. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A couple of things. I mean, look, I think was the story of missed opportunities for Trump last night. I mean, he didn't lose his cool, but he did lose his train of thought, right, in a lot of respects. And look, I -- I don't think -- she went into some prosecution, overpower him. She played it safe, played it scripted. But what she did do is she chummed the waters. And he took the bait over and over again. What I'm interested to see, though, in the polling, I think -- I think, you know, certainly, there were some red lights with her with this \"New York Times\" and Siena poll earlier in the week, and it gave her a bit of a roadmap. But I think both candidates, a little bit of a road map of what each needed to do. She obviously needed to make herself in the more of the change agent. But one thing I think she didn't do. And look, that's probably not the story of the debate is she didn't really go into specific policies that we saw a lot of folks in the poll say we want to hear more from.

Yes, right now, Francine has sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, gusting up to 115.The real question becomes, how much more does it intensify before it finally makes landfall late this afternoon and early evening. We are forecasting that it gets up to around 100 miles per hour, which would make it a Category 2 storm. And then it will continue to spread its way inland, taking with it the potential for very heavy rain, strong winds, and also the storm surge. Already some impressive rainfall totals coming in from Texas, specifically Brownsville, Texas, picking up over seven inches of rain. For some perspective, that's more than they would normally see in the entire month of September, getting that in just the last 48 hours. Some of those rain bands already starting to spread inland across Louisiana. We also have the potential for tornadoes, waterspouts, and damaging winds, even as far East as the Panhandle of Florida.",
