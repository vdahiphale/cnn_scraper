And finally, Barbie fever hits the Gulf and it shows a big reversal for Saudi Arabia. Less than 10 years ago, Saudis had to travel to neighboring countries go to the cinema but now fans heading in the opposite direction. Well, we start our second hour with what has so far been an incident free journey of cargo ship left Odessa heading to its final destination in Turkey. It has now moved beyond what was a potential danger zone in the Black Sea and into Romanian waters. This ship, as we've been reporting on this program, was the first to leave the port of Odessa since Russia pulled out of the grain deal last month and threatened to attack Ukrainian shipping interests in the Black Sea. Well, it's happening as Ukraine's military announces it will not get delivery of American F-16 fighter jets this year. Ukraine says it desperately needs those jets to counter Russian missile and drone attacks. Nick Paton Walsh back with us this hour from Dnipro. Let's just start with that news that there are no expectations at least on the Ukrainian side that they'll be getting F-16s any time soon. Why is that significant?",

Firstly, to defend ordinary civilians like those around me here we just had air raid sirens from Russian attack, but more importantly for the counter offensive on the front line to give Ukraine a chance of knocking back the Russian air superiority that makes it so hard for their troops to advance. They could get a half a metric ton bomb dropped on them at any moment. And in the place we went to yesterday, one of the first villages captured for weeks by Ukraine Urozhaine this is a place where that air superiority is clearly in Russia's favor. And today, we're learning that the troops who advanced there are still under Russian attack. This is a slow grind forward, but it's one that Ukraine says is so far in their favor. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice over): There may be ruin around them but that direction is forwards. We're with the 35th Ukrainian Marines. The first report is to get to the outskirts of Urozhaine. Yet another village announced liberated Wednesday. The victories may be small. But a constant so just down here Urozhaine yet another town taken as the counter offensive does move forward.

(END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera): Becky, just to give you context as to what these villages really mean. Urozhaine was the place from which we essentially heard that the Ukrainians were being shelled heavily when they advanced a couple of weeks ago, into the village across the river, called Staromaiorske. Now they have moved forward and taken that obstacle out of the way. Yes, each time they move forwards the Russians shell them heavily from their rear positions. But there is essentially a clock ticking here. And some hope within the Ukrainians that eventually they will push the Russians back past their more fortified positions and into the open space, as you can see there, where they might begin to lose some of their structure.

So that's a given when you then go on to say, well, yes, some of the weapons that have been sent by NATO, we've heard complaints on the front lines about how they haven't performed in the way that they'd hoped or they simply weren't up to scratch when up to NATO standards, when they were delivered. And of course, you heard there when it comes to how fast are you moving? Well, if you're talking to a soldier who's been up all night, hearing their friends die on the radio, and then they don't really have much truck with somebody in an armchair on the other side of the planet telling them they should be going faster. Is there a fear of fatigue? Yes, certainly, absolutely. But it's a secondary concern here. There are sirens in major cities. The frontline fight is exceptionally brutal. And the Ukrainians are losing money, day by day, but they're doing it in order to prevent the Russians who've made it quite clear in occupied territories how brutal, their continued presence here can be, don't occupy their daily lives. And I think that's part of what's lost in international dialogue about whether Ukraine should go to the peace tables, or how they should function. Russia has made it clear; it's in this for the long term. It's pushing exceptionally hard and its population to keep its troop levels up to continue military manufactures cars. There's a war against all of NATO. There's no suggestion that Putin is about to turn down the volume on this, but instead, it's Ukraine who are coming under intermittent background sort of chatter as it were pressure to think about what sacrifices they might be willing to make territorially.

But they don't also want escalation. The United States really does not want to be dealing with a major Iran nuclear crisis until after the presidential elections. And the Iranians also want to see de-escalation in the region, they want to be able to sell oil, access some of their funds, and build on what on this opening with Saudi Arabia, but also with UAE. Now, the fact that the prisoner exchange happened, and the fact that we have not seen an escalation on Iran's nuclear file, suggests that that kind of an understanding between de-escalation understanding between Washington and Tehran is afoot. And the Saudi Iranian deal both supports this and feeds on this, because it's an important part of, of a U.S. Iran understanding is that tensions in the Gulf would abate, that the price of oil would not hike that Iran and Saudi Arabia will find a way to arrive at a cold piece. And we're seeing this happen. And another big thing that is also on the table is this talk of a long term Saudi security deal with the United States and its normalization with Israel. And one could say that the visit of the Iranian foreign minister to Saudi Arabia announcing that Iranian president will be going there, shows that the Saudis want to make clear that their deal with the United States and possible normalization with Israel is not creating, again, access against Iran, that they will obviously want to separate these two things out. They want that deal and normalization with Israel at the right price. But they want to continue on this process with Iran as well. They want to be standing much more in that gray area. For now, this is fine with Washington, because Washington really does not want any drama in the Middle East for until after the presidential elections. And so the more the Saudis and Iranians talk, the more that what they agree to grows roots, the more calm there is in the Gulf is actually suits what U.S. is also trying to achieve with Iran, which is some kind of a de- escalation.",

But what I can say is that first of all, the talks petered out,even before the Mahsa Amini protest in Iran started, essentially in August when Iran was not willing to sign the deal, where it had arrived. And then, you know, a lot of time lapsed, and the closer we got to the elections in the United States, the more difficult it was for the Biden Administration to do a major event with Iran, which does not have bipartisan support in the United States during a presidential election. But the current de-escalation talks with Iran, this prisoner exchange suggests that, that the United States still has the mechanisms to manage this and to manage this very directly, except it's not done with Rob Malley since he's on leave. It's done now much more directly through the White House. We know that the main person in charge of the Middle East in the White House spread -- visited Oman, as these some of these understandings were being worked out that the Omanis and the Qataris are playing a very active role. They obviously are working with the United States, and then you're working on the other side with the Iranians. So, on the U.S. side, if you would, I would say that the personalities have changed since Rob is on leave. But the United States determination to actually have a Middle East policy between Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, that gives the United States the ability to focus on China and Ukraine and not deal with Iran or any other Middle East crisis, at least for another year, is very much effort.",

And once the protests started around Mahsa Amini's death in September, of course, there was a real sort of freezing of relations. If despite the fact there were no sort of direct talks going on anyway. It's good to have you sir, it's always good to have your insight and analysis, as I always say, is hugely important.

      "sentences": "Well, pink is a new color in Riyadh. Fans of the Barbie film have throng to cinemas across the city, the global blockbuster opened in SaudiArabia this week to popular acclaim. It's an ironic twist for Saudi Arabia where until only a few years ago, cinemas were banned altogether. This is a sign of the kingdom swift strides into liberalization, while Barbie faces bands and criticism elsewhere in the region. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice over): Scenes like these were unthinkable just a few years back, Saudi women packing cinemas to watch Barbie and empowering movie with feminist themes. But Barbie mania is alive in the kingdom, which only ended its decade's long ban on cinemas in 2017 as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has plans to transform the country.",

So I thought to book for me and the children to watch it. And they were happy about it and advancements we are witnessing every day. We can now see movies and a lot of things that we didn't see here before. ANDERSON (voice over): However, the film will not be delighting audiences in every nation across the region. Despite showing Barbie at cinemas for several weeks, Algeria took the decision to remove the blockbuster from screens for promoting homosexuality. Oil rich Kuwait also banned Barbie to preserve public ethics and social traditions. Social media awash with Kuwaitis joking about driving to Saudi Arabia to see the film and some even posting guides on the theatres closest to the border. The irony of the reversal in cultural norms, not lost on Kuwaitis who've been used to Saudis making that journey in the past. And in Lebanon, a country generally regarded as being more progressive towards the LGBTQ community. But Culture Minister moved in to ban the movie from theaters saying it \"Promotes homosexuality\".",
