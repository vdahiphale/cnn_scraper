So it's not like -- I mean, sure, it would be great if everyone decided right now to stop fighting.But everything we see on the ground and everything we know indicates the opposite is going to happen. These operations are intensifying, not the other way around. And when the Israelis say they want total victory, well, that's not what they have. So all wars end in diplomacy, but only when one or both sides is exhausted enough to sue for peace. And neither side seems to be doing that right now. And it's -- Harris is stuck because she wants to appeal to Arab and Muslim-Americans, especially in Michigan, by saying that she's for Palestinian peace in in the Middle East. But the administration is not willing to do anything to pressure the Israelis to move towards that goa. And that's a terrible political situation for her, but also terrible for the Palestinians and Israelis caught in the crossfire. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's just kind of interesting when you look at all the different -- different aspects of this. Because from a strategic perspective, this is actually to both Israel's and the U.S. advantage to basically break the ring of encirclement that the -- Iran and it's proxies have actually exercised around Israel during this period. So now that Israel has moved into -- you know, has done this, has basically killed two major leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah and, of course, the echelons below that, there's been a lot of movement in that way. So the Israelis are basically broadening the area that they actually control. They are creating a -- more of a safety zone. And from a purely military perspective, this makes a lot of sense. And it's also in the U.S.'s interest that Israel be secure that way. And so it's a fine line that they have to work because they're looking at it -- the administration and the Harris campaign, they're looking at it in a way where they -- as you said, they want to make sure that they get some advantage out of this and that have helped them. And it is -- the key thing is, when Harris said that Iran was the most important threat to the United States, what she was talking about was this particular moment in time, that right now Iran is that threat and this helps the U.S. with that particular argument.",

Whether you agree or disagree with his election, nobody liked what happened on January 6th. Nobody wants anything like that to ever happen again. And J.D. Vance's defense of Trump on January 6th, and the unwillingness to acknowledge that Trump lost the election and Joe Biden won it, continues to weigh down the possibility of some voters switching from Harris to Trump or undecided to Trump.

So it just depends on which side of the coin you want to look at. In the end, I actually think they're going to be divorces. I actually think it's going to cause a lot of strife over Thanksgiving, Christmas, as men lineup on one side and women lineup on the other. But in the end, the key is going to be turnout. And whether young women come to the polls or older men come to the polls because that -- it doesn't matter where you stand right now. And it doesn't matter who you say you're voting for. The only thing that matters is voter participation. And what have we seen? Georgia is setting record numbers in early votes. I think this is going to end up being a very high turnout election.
