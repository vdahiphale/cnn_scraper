This as fierce fighting between the Sudanese army and its rival the RSF continues despite another attempted ceasefire. This hour we explore international involvement in the conflict. But first, terrible scenes in Yemen's Capital as a crowd search at a charity event has left dozens dead, nearly 80 people were killed and dozens more injured in a stampede at a school. NATO's Chief makes a surprise appearance in Kyiv his first since the Russian invasion began. Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine's membership in the alliance will be high on the agenda at July's NATO Summit. No decision has been announced yet as to whether Uganda's anti-LGBTQ Plus bill will be signed into law. The President was expected to by the veto or signs a widely condemned bill in meetings with lawmakers on Thursday, but it was not discussed. And SpaceX starship the most powerful rocket ever built, took off from its launch pad, but exploded in a dramatic cloud minutes later. After two failed ceasefires in as many days the prospects of any quick end to the fighting and Sudan appear slim. Sudan's Army Leader tells Al Jazeera there is no current path to negotiating with the rival leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Abdel Fattah Al Burhan says the RSF is intent on destroying the Sudanese army and ruling Sudan. His comments come as fighting rioters for a sixth day causing more fear, chaos and hardship. Sudan's Doctors Union says 70 percent of Khartoum's hospitals are now out of service. Many countries have long -- have a long history of supporting various sides in Sudan. Russia is believed to have provided training and weaponry to both of Sudan's military leaders. The United States suspended critical aid to Sudan following the military coup that ousted Prime Minister Hamdok in 2021. Egypt has been a key backer of Sudan's armed forces and conducted military exercises with its army. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have provided financial support, and Sudan deployed troops to fight in Yemen. Well, my next guest says while the blame ultimately rests with the two generals, no autocrat in the region wanted a successful democratic Sudan. Since the revolution Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE and even Russia have allied themselves with anti-democratic Sudanese factions. Will Brown is a Senior Reporter at Tortoise Media and he joins me now. Will, great to see you. I just want to pick up on that last point I just made about the fact that it's not just the two generals here who are to blame for this conflict. What would a democratic Sudan have spelt for autocrats in neighboring regions? Why is it they want to avoid this possibility so badly?",

I think first of all, it's important to tell your -- tell your viewersthat Sudan for decades competed with Saudi Arabia for the crown of the ultra-Islamic ultra-conservative world. And so what -- so up until very recently, in Sudan, women were flogged in the streets if they dared to wear trousers. Now, what happened in 2018 and 2019 students, young Sudanese students, got up and said enough is enough and they went out on the streets and started demanding liberty and democracy. This is a frontline state. I know in the West, we often don't see it as such. Sudan is often too seems to African too complicated. But this is a frontline state in the war, in the conflict in the fight between liberal democracy and autocracy. Obviously, no one, none of the autocrats in the region want to have a country 45 million people, the second most populous in the Arab world, with those kind of democratic values with a sick, they don't want it to be a success. And so what you've seen since the 2019 revolution, is different factions from around the region. So we can point to the principal factions like the UAE, to Saudi Arabia, to Egypt, we can point to them. But we can also point to other smaller actors, Ethiopia, for example, Eritrea, and they've all kind of allied themselves in certain degrees with different anti-democratic.",

And you've also got reports of Egypt as sending pretty solid reports. And I've heard similar things from sources of my own sources, sending fighter jets to help the south. So what this means is, we're already seeing just in a few days, how this conflict is becoming international. And what's so scary about this is OK, we always look at the unknown, those big principal players, you know, the Saudi Arabia's the UAE is Egypt, because they're big, they're important, we think about them. But there are lots of other players, which we often ignore in the West. We often don't think about, OK, so, such as Eritrea, the small totalitarian state, right next door, such as South Sudan, such as Central African Republic, such as Chad, they all have their own interests in Sudan, and all of them have armed factions or kind of armed services, which they could potentially send in.

Again, two thirds of people there rely on humanitarian aid to make ends meet to be able to feed their families.

And when she was discovered to be brain stem death, dead, this turned out to be from a Jewish perspective, a clear-cut case where one can give organs. And so therefore, we sat around and discussed as a family. It's something which I discussed really with Lucy in the past. And we, we decided that she would have wanted her organs to be donated, she saved five lives. And in fact, Christina, one of the Israeli politicians pointed out that whilst my wife saved five lives for free, effectively, the terrorists, those two men in the car are being paid a million dollars each by the Palestinian Authority, which is funded by the Iranian regime. So, the Iranian regime, I point my finger at and say they are the source of world terror, they fund Hamas, they fund Hezbollah, they fund the personal authority, and they're paying for these people to take clash, the cost of the pump 20 bullets into innocent women. And I think Christina, one of the reasons that it has become such a well story is because even my Palestinian friends from the villages over here, and my Arab Israeli friends who live in Jerusalem, understand that this, these terrorists pointed the gun at these women without really knowing that there were even Jewish women. Because Arab Israeli women of which there are 2 million who live in Israel, and drive a similar type of car with the same number plate, could have been driving on that road with a similar head addresses my wife, and they could have been the victims of this attack. So, it was absolutely indiscriminate. And of course, we point the finger at Iran. And one of the things I would request from Christina, from world governments and from the media at this point, is to condemn Iran, and to be absolutely unequivocal in the way that they condemn Iran.

Tomorrow is Eid that is the end of the holy month of Ramadan. And that's supposed to be a time when families get together and celebrate the end of this holy month. And yet, still, there could be violence unless these two men can agree to a ceasefire. And in that Al Jazeera interview, al-Burhan one thing he was open to choose, he also said there'll be no truth, unless as long as rapid support forces are still deployed in residential areas. And we're hearing even more escalation the two men's words, calling each other criminals, and al-Burhan saying that Hemeti tried to destroy the Sudanese army. So, they're still further apart, there's some distance between their positions and the likelihood of them coming together and agreeing to truth even on those religious grounds as so many people badly need when they're running out of food and water and medicines. 70 percent of hospitals in Khartoum are not operating a third of the entire medical system in Sudan on the verge of completely taken out already for the World Health Organization.

Especially as a filmmaker, I think my main goal is to create something that helps take that edge away and just gives people a greater understanding of what it means to be Palestinian, on the ground in the diaspora, you know, what have you.",

There's no you know, filmmakers, doctors, architects, people who just want to hang out.

ANDERSON (on camera): Anwar, you come from a really high-profile family, the family happens to be very vocal about the Palestinian issue. Your sister, model Bella said that while it doesn't deter her, you know, her outspoken advocacy, has really cost her career opportunities and, and even relationships.

So, it's hard to say at this point, but there were clearly some issues with some of the engines onboard as it was taking flight. And I can tell you is this, the rocket ship had launched, we could see this long smoke trail, and then about three minutes in about the moment we thought the booster was supposed to be separating from the rocket ship. We heard another loud rumbling thunderous explosion in the sky in bright orange lighting up. At first, I thought that might be what the separation would look like.
