Are you concerned that the U.S. scrambled fighter jets to shoot down objects that it apparently doesn't know much about? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Well, not really, Brianna. Now, I am concerned that this is not going to be a long-term solution to every piece of atmospheric garbage that we find up there. And I should note that we had a briefing today at noon. It was unclassified, it was by phone by the House, and what I heard in that briefing has been substantiating some speculative theories I've had for a couple days now, which is that we have recalibrated our radars that were calibrated, as one might imagine, to pick up things that are very fast moving, you know, at certain altitudes. And now that we're actually looking because we've recalibrated those radars, lo and behold, we're finding a lot of stuff. And I'll take you back to the hearings that we did about a year ago, last year, on unidentified aerial phenomena, what most people call UFOs. And what we learned in those hearings was there's just a lot of stuff up there. There are weather balloons. There are academic research balloons. There are balloons that are designed to try to provide Wi-Fi in rural areas. And so, what I heard today sort reinforced my belief that these are, in fact, benign, but of course the White House, the government can't confirm that until they can get to some very remote areas and actually look at the wreckage.",

The Department of Defense can determine whether it has navigation systems, whether it has propulsion.

You saw that line that Kylie included in her piece from her video highlighting the fact that Republicans have lost seven of the eight popular votes in the presidential election, the seven of the last eight presidential elections, that they lost the popular vote. That was a clear indication that she's putting herself forward as somebody that can broaden the appeal of the Republican brand, right? It also obviously was he's not to settle reminder that Donald Trump lost the popular vote and he's the only guy in the field right now.But in addition to this generational argument that Haley is going to make, she's making this a broadening the appeal of Republicans argument that she believes she can be the one to get a majority of Americans behind a GOP candidate. We'll see if she can do that. She's got conservative credentials as a former successful governor in South Carolina. She's got the foreign policy credentials. There's certainly a role for her in this race, but there are two heavy hitters at the outset and she's going to have a lot of work to do ahead of her. KEILAR:  Yes. Nia, to David's point, you can't ignore that when she's mentioning in her announcement that Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the last presidential elections. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's right. It's a shot at Trump at the end to that. She talks about stand up to bullies. That seems to also be a shot at Trump. She talks about the fact that if you hit back at a bully, it hurts more if you're wearing high heels. So, she's embracing the fact which she will likely be the only woman in this race. She hasn't run for office since 2014 or so and the landscape has changed quite a bit. I was sort of struck by how conventional this ad seemed. Like for somebody who's saying she represents a new generation, the ad was sort of kind bland and cookie cutter to look at it. We'll see what he says in her announcement tomorrow. She's making, I think, arguments that are much more sort of logical and driven by sort of the head rather than the heart. And what you find in primaries, I think, is these are emotional appeals really that successful candidates make to primary audiences. So, it's not about sort of I'm a better general election candidate. Those candidates who make that argument tend to not do so well because these primary audiences, they really are moved by their guts and their emotion. So, we'll see how she does. We'll see what she has to say tomorrow.",

It doesn't mean she wants to be president, she really does.But I think what you're going to see on the Republican side is people sitting back, either jumping on Donald Trump right away, jumping on Ron DeSantis right away, or if they don't jump on either those bandwagons immediately, seen how the field shakes out. Because if you're not going to be in one of those two camps, I can speak as a former politician in this, you want to get on the winning team.

That attorney is Evan Corcoran. He's already testified before the grand jury for about four hours or so, I'm told. But they actually want him to come back, and this time they're tryingto overcome that attorney-client privilege that protects what he and Trump had talked about privately. In doing so they've written to the judge alleging that they believe Trump used Evan Corcoran in furtherance of a crime or fraud. That is that fraud-crime exception prosecutors are trying to make the argument to judge to overcome attorney-client privilege basically so they can get him back in there and have him answer questions. It's an incredibly aggressive move, probably one of the most aggressive we've seen so far from the special counsel overseeing this investigation, Jack Smith.
