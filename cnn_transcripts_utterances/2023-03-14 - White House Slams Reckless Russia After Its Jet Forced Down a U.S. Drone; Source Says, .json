This as a top U.S. credit rating firm is downgrading the outlook for the U.S. banking system to negative.And an exclusive new CNN poll of Republicans shows Donald Trump narrowly leading Ron DeSantis ahead of their expected 2024 primary showdown. The early presidential race heating up right now as Trump escalates his attacks on DeSantis and other potential opponents. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to the very dramatic developments over the black sea today. A Russian fighter jet forcing down a U.S. drone during an incident the U.S. Air Force is calling reckless and unprofessional. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann is joining us. Oren, so how did all of this unfold and how are U.S. officials responding tonight?",

According to the Pentagon, for 30 or 40 minutes over international waters, two Russian SU-22 fighter jets flew right near the drone, cutting it off, flying in front of it, even dumping fuel in front of it. Then the Pentagon says and U.S.-European Command says one of those jets struck the drone in such a way as to damage the propeller. The U.S. viewing this with severity. Here is Pentagon Press Secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY:  On the actions of the Russian pilots, it's clear that it was unsafe, unprofessional. What we saw, again, were fighter aircraft dumping fuel in front of this UAV and then getting so close to the aircraft that it actually damaged the propeller on the MQ-9. We assess that it likely caused some damage to the Russian aircraft as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia releasing a statement saying that the Russian jets did not shoot at the drone and there was no contact with the drone, accusing the U.S., in fact, of being in airspace it had designated for its special military operation in Ukraine. Although it's unclear how or to whom that designation was made.At this point, the State Department summoned the Russian ambassador to the U.S. for a meeting, that meeting last at just over 30 minutes at the State Department. Afterwards the Russian ambassador came out and said Russia was not looking for any confrontation with the U.S. at this point and that's where it stands right now. Certainly a tense time and a very tense situation, the Pentagon viewing this with severity and saying this is potentially escalatory but right now keeping that response in the diplomatic lane, Wolf.",

General Clark, this is the first time that I know of that Russian and U.S. military aircraft had actually come into direct contact since Putin invaded Ukraine just more than a year ago. How alarming is this Russian aggression? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Look, this is -- there are different ways to interpret this, Wolf. I mean, the most benign is a couple of Russian pilots played cowboy at it and tried to screw it up, or it was directed to try to interfere with its collection, or most damaging would be deliberate ploy to bring it down, recover it, get the secret intelligence assets that are inside the drone. Now, we have been very, very careful with these drones. We don't want the Ukrainians to have them. We say they're really full of classified information. We don't know what this one has in it exactly.

But if you had to stop one system, could you totally compensate for the loss of collection? Probably not without putting other assets in, manned aircraft and so forth. So, I would say it's important.Look, we've been able to manage the conflict, to support the Ukrainians, avoid escalation, and hopefully wear out Putin's forces without direct confrontation. And we've done it because we have superior intelligence. So, this drone is part of that intelligence superiority.

The National Security Council said earlier today that's absolutely the plan, they'll keep doing it as they are entitled to, and Russia can keep flying there as well because it's international airspace.Right now, the Pentagon doesn't seem to have indicated there will be a military response of any sort.

Among those with no college degree, 48 percent choose Trump, 34 percent picked DeSantis. But among those with a college degree, it flips, 41 percent favor DeSantis to Trump's 23 percent. What does that say to you?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, listen, I think it says what we know from 2016, which is that Trump has really kind of remade the Republican Party. His strength is amongst sort of blue collar Republicans, and in 2016, you saw sort of the more standard issue Chamber of Commerce Republicans split the vote between all of those other Republicans that were on stage. If you see in that poll, for instance, Pence and Haley are also doing well with college graduates. The question is do other people get into the race, do they split that more. But I think if you're DeSantis, you feel pretty good that you're doing good with college graduates. Can you grow that? It doesn't seem like if you are Donald Trump, you have much more room to grow if you are a college graduate. You've obviously witnessed the Trump candidacy in 2016, his presidency. It's not clear to me that he has much more room to grow with those college graduates but he certainly has a monopoly and a really strong showing among those non- college Republicans. I mean, you heard the gentleman there said it's Trump or die. So, if you are DeSantis, there's a real challenge, I think, that you have in trying to eat into that base of Republican voters that are strongly for Donald Trump. BLITZER:  Adam, it's interesting, and this new poll also shows that your fellow Republicans are more interested in a nominee who shares their positions rather than someone they think will beat Joe Biden. As a Republican, does that concern you?",

There's no doubt about it. But at this moment, that's not the popularity DeSantis is experiencing or that Donald Trump is talking about. At this moment, his popularity is based on a dissatisfaction with Trump at a new level inside the Republican Party, even though, as our poll shows, he remains the clear frontrunner in this case.",

You got to make up your mind because you raised this much money, you're going to have to make a decision.So, he has formally declared that. Now, interesting the he is allowed by House Ethics rules generally to use that money to pay for legal fees. So, that could come in handy he's under local and federal investigations. He's lied about his resume, his background, his family. They're also looking into exactly where all this money came from. Remember he had that $700,000 personal loan and then it was questionable, did it come from him? Did it come from somewhere else? Where did it come from?
