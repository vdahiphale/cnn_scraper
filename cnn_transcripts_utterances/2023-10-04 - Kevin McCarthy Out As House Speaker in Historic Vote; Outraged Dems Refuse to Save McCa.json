It is Wednesday, October 4th, a historic day.Five a.m. here in Washington, with Congress in utter chaos this morning after the dramatic removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. Right now, there is no clear replacement. No House business is scheduled until at least Tuesday. It is the first time in history that a speaker has been ousted in the middle of a congressional term. An overwhelming majority of Republicans did actually vote to keep McCarthy in power, but it was still not enough to block the efforts of the Republican hard-liners, who wanted McCarthy gone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR):  On this vote, the yeas are 216, the nays are 210. The resolution is adopted. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table. The Office of Speaker of the House of the United States of House of Representatives, is hereby declared vacant. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
