      "sentences": "Good morning. Thank you for being up early with us. It is just before 5The big story we have been following -- a massive manhunt expanding this morning for the suspect in a mass shooting that killed 18 people and injured 13 others at the bowling alley and restaurant in Lewiston, Maine. Police say 40-year-old Robert Card should be considered armed and dangerous. With the suspect still at large for a second day, parts of two counties remain under shelter-in-place orders. Schools and offices also closed. An Army Reservist who serves with Card -- served with Card says he's a skilled marksman -- one of the best shooters in his unit. And law enforcement say -- sources say Card recently started showing psychiatric symptoms, speaking of hearing voices and threatening to shoot up a National Guard facility. We are now going to bring in Chris Rucker to talk -- Chris Swecker, excuse me -- the former FBI assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division. Chris, thank you very much for being with us this morning. I want to talk a little bit about the search for this man and what happened overnight because we saw, last night, law enforcement assets basically surrounded the gunman's home, the fields. There were people shouting. It seemed to be that he was possibly in the house. That did not turn out to be the case. They are also now tracking a boat that was registered to him, searching in the river. What does this day -- full day two of this manhunt look like?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think we're going to see a search warrant actually executed at the compound -- the house or houses at the compound. That's what they went there for -- law enforcement did -- yesterday. And, of course, that place has been under surveillance since they learned the identity of the shooter.So, they -- I think they have been watching the house all day and hoping that he would show up. And at some point, they decided to just go in or -- and that's when they threw the flashbangs. Those are anti- personnel mini grenades designed to stun people in the house and give the entry team time to take them out of if they have to. So they intended to either arrest him or serve the search warrant. Something happened that spooked them. They backed out. They even left and came back, based on a report by a neighbor. And I think when darkness -- when they -- when they realized that they -- you know, that he wasn't coming out if he was in there or they had -- you know, he just wasn't in there, they decided to back off the night. There's no point in trying to execute the search warrant and do an entry in the middle of the night. So that's where we are. They've been holding their positions all night. Meanwhile, I think there's a large group -- or people who think that he is in the woods somewhere. He was at the boat landing for a reason. He got into his boat and found a remote location -- probably a prepositioned location and probably pre-supplied like the Olympic bomber did up in the North Carolina mountains -- and he's hiding out. So those are two possibilities here. Actually, the second possibility is he had a switch car and he's hours and hours and hours away, and that would be I think the worst-case scenario.",

He -- you know, he is a, as many people are in that part of Maine, an outdoorsman. And military -- he has training -- military training, of course, as well.So the educated guess here is that he is somewhere in that -- in those woods. Police and law enforcement will have to set up and have set up a perimeter around that general area. And that's the tough part right there. Where do you set up your perimeter? How large -- how widespread should it be? And then it's going to be just a laborious task of trying to tighten down that perimeter until you find him or he gets so cold and miserable and starving that he gives himself up. I don't take this guy as someone who is going to give himself up. I think it's going to -- it's not going to end well. So that's -- you know, that's probably one of the most difficult law enforcement manhunts there is. It took us five years to find Eric Rudolph. He never moved eight miles -- more than eight miles from the original place where he was last seen. So he knows the area better than law enforcement. The only people that -- you know, the people that are really the most effective resource right now are fish and wildlife -- game warden-type law enforcement officers. They know the area.",

This is something that's affecting approximately 100,000 residents.And that fear is palpable. You can -- you can feel that from just talking to people in the community as they see armored trucks go through the neighborhoods. As they see police go door-to-door on their checks. That fear -- it continues to rise. Now, just a few hours ago, we saw law enforcement descend on the -- on the -- what's believed to be the most recent home of the -- of the shooter. This is what they're calling due diligence and part of their latest strategy. They're executing search warrants. They're looking for any evidence that they can collect in these homes. Yesterday, we saw dozens of police officers, they had bullhorns, they had drones. They had their armored vehicles. After a few hours, they gave it the all-clear. They're expected to do this again today and look at another property and execute a search warrant there. And that kind of leads us to how they're actually doing these searches. We've seen them yesterday as they were going through. It's very localized. They close -- they get a tip and they close down a street and they do their searches.

Video published by the IDF shows moving tanks and armored vehicles, as well as strikes on buildings and in open areas. All this happening as tensions in the region escalate. The Pentagon says that the U.S. carried out airstrikes in Syria targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias. Defense officials say this was in retaliation for attacks against U.S. forces in the region over the last 10 days. Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin said the strikes were, quote, \"narrowly targeted in self-defense\" emphasizing that they were separate from the war in Israel and Gaza. Austin also promised further strikes if the attacks by Iran on U.S. forces continue. Jim Sciutto is in the Golan Heights for us. And Kim Dozier, CNN global affairs analyst also joins us.

It's just a reminder that in the northern part of Israel and when you get into the Golan you have, in effect, two international borders that Israel is directing its tension at. Certainly, Lebanon where Hezbollah is based; but also Syria, where you have Iranian-backed militias as well. And the significance of these U.S. strikes overnight is that it appears to be retaliation for strikes on U.S. forces by Iran-back forces in both Syria and Iraq. But notably, this is a base that doesn't just have, at times, Iranian-backed militias. It has actual Iranian forces from the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps -- the IRGC. And it's not clear that the U.S., prior to these strikes, was certain that there were no Iranian personnel there. In other words, a risk there that these U.S. strikes could have impacted Iranian forces on the ground. That shows the seriousness with which the U.S. is responding to strikes on its own forces in the region. I'll tell you, where we are this morning, the border area looks calm. But there is certainly, like in the northern part of Israel near Lebanon, a large Israeli military presence. They are on alert. They are watching very closely.",

When you attack bases in this way you could very easily kill U.S. forces and, of course, that could conceivably level up the U.S. response. We've seen deadly attacks by Iranian-backed forces, militias in the past on U.S. forces in the region.And that just shows what a tinderbox this region is right now. The chances of escalation, right, is that a small thing that perhaps whether it's Iran or the U.S. intends to be limited to some degree, it's not clear that they can enforce those limits, right? If you drop enough rockets on a base you might kill U.S. forces or contractors. If the U.S. drops enough bombs and strikes on an Iranian base inside Syria you might very well kill Iranian forces. And that presents the danger then, of course, of further escalation. It's just another reminder that you have many fronts in this conflict right now and many players with real dangers of things moving beyond where any of the parties want it to move, right?

The U.S. is moving in a couple of carrier strike groups because of what's happening in Gaza -- because of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.And the U.S. is increasingly siding with Israel's point of view on things in that prior to this, the U.S. and other international bodies have considered Palestinian health figures out of Gaza pretty reliable. But, of course, the White House had an answer to this. They said until this conflict, perhaps. But when the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital was attacked, the Palestinian Health Authority said within an hour of the attack that something like 500 people were killed. And the U.S. intelligence assessment was that it was more like 100 to 300. So that is part of their argument of saying that the Palestinian Health Authority has become a mouthpiece for Hamas which, of course, the Palestinian Health Authority inside Gaza refuted by putting out a 200-plus page list with the names of those that they say they tabulated as dead, not including bodies that haven't already been counted, as a previous correspondent was saying.
