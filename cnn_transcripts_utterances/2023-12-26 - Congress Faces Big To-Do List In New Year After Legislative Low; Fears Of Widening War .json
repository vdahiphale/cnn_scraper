That's tonight on a special two- hour edition of Lara Coates Live.All right, Congress, pull the parkers (ph) out of the closet. Strap on the snowshoes. There's a legislative blizzard heading straight for Washington, D.C. If you're one of the 535 lawmakers who serve we the people, you're in store for a very long winter. Why? Well, Congress has a lot, and I do mean a lot to do. The headlines, they are unanimous. Lawmakers fear January mess, brutal January reality bites, urgent to do list. Now, it would be one thing if Congress just had to say, get the groceries or put the Christmas tree out on the curb for trash pickup. But lawmakers are staring down some of the most politically polarizing issues confronting this entire nation, things like border security and aid for Ukraine, funding the government twice. Now, the first shutdown deadline is when? It's January 19th. The second one is February 2nd. And, by the way, not for nothing, that's the actual Groundhog Day. So, back to the movie for just a moment. It's a 1993 classic. You know, I love a good movie reference. And in it, Bill Murray's character goes from a jaded newsman who kidnaps Punxsutawney Phil to a doer of good deeds who wants to live in Punxsutawney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, there were speaker fights. There were more speaker fights. There were near misses on shutdowns and expulsions, censures. You know what there wasn't much of, though? Actual legislating. And, of course, that's exactly what they have to do now, actually legislate. And they only have days to pull it all off. And how? So, will Congress get stuck in a kind of a time loop and spend another year figuring out all the ways to look busy or will 2024 be the year it clicks?

I guess what I'm interested in knowing about the apology is like, what is there to learn? When he says he's looking forward to learning, what is there to learn? Hitler killed 12 million people and started World War II in which three percent of the world's population died. I think the book has been written on Hitler and I think people are getting a little bit tired and exhausted about the Kanye West, wash, rinse, repeat, cycle of offense and disgustingness and whatever he's going to learn, I think it's high time that you start to learn it you know.",

And that's true in all different forms of discrimination, certainly racism and anti-Semitic included. And yet, you know, it takes a different kind of relationship to get a little more wise. And that's why, you know, I'm not really optimistic, but if I believe this statement had anything to do with anything Kanye ever said, you know, I just hope that there's folks, again, in his circle who can have the kind of long conversations, because he clearly has absorbed a number of anti-Semitic motifs that are just have been right? And he's gotten this from someplace. And it takes a process to kind of deprogram that in a way. And I think there's not a sort of simple way to do it. And kowtowing and writing apology notes is not certainly not the way to do it. You know, I think there has to be hopefully there's somebody in there who can have those long conversations and he can get to know some Jewish folks in reality as opposed to the dark, twisted fantasy.",

In light of what she is facing, has that changed your opinion of her personally or what you're hearing from your fellow student body members? It hasn't changed my opinion of her personally because ultimately I know who she is. I haven't been able to speak with her recently before she's been busy. But I really don't have any more information on the ongoing plagiarism investigation than anyone else would.
