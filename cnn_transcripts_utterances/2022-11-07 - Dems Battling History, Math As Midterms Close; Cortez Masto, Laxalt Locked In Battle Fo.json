The final count will determine which party controls the House, which party controls the Senate, also which party controls the governor's office, including and a half dozen key 2024 battleground states, which view of the 2020 vote count and future election counts. Well, that also carries the day up and down the midterm ballot.Presidents Biden's approval rating is historically low. Inflation is running near historic highs. To keep power in Congress, Democrats simply need to turn history on its head. Republicans are confident that won't happen. They are confident, you want big change. Let's look at just some of the stakes. As I do, so let me just flip back. It's most important for the Republicans as they believe they will take power in the House of Representatives. Let's bring up the map and take a look at it right now. We have identified 435 races in all, many of them likely to go Democrat or Republican based on the lines, but 82 competitive races we have identified with our friends at inside elections. Guess what, in more than 50 of those, Democrats are on defense. So, Democrats back on their heels in an election year where we already have Republicans favored in 216. House races it takes 218 to get the majority. So, Democrats need to defy history, defy that math. Turn some of these light red blue, if it's going to happen. Right now, Republicans poised when it comes to the House of Representatives, but we count the votes tomorrow. Then you look over at the Senate battle for control. And this one here, the Democrats can't lose anything. This is the current Senate 50-50. Only a Democratic majority because the vice president breaks the tie. Look at the map right now. Republicans want to hold Pennsylvania. Democrats hope to pick it up. There are some Democratic targets, they hope in North Carolina, they hope in Ohio, they hope in Wisconsin, but midterm history says those would be heavy lifts. What a Republican's think? Republicans think they have a shot in several including, in New Hampshire, in Georgia, out in Arizona, out in Nevada. There are some Republicans thinking they could even have hopes in Washington state or in Colorado. But without a doubt, without a doubt, it is advantage Republicans. If you look at the data and its advances Republicans. If you look at history, Democrats now though trying to define that map. Let's bring up this map. As we now go back out. CNN spread across this country, tracking all the big races that will decide which party ends up in power come January. Let's go to Nevada first, CNN's Gary Tuchman. Gary is there - Gary, a key race for Senate, could be the decisive race, a key race for governor, a battle for secretary of state involving an election denier. You are in one of the great midterm laboratories.",

It's the most expensive Senate race in the country. And that's why they really think a lot of it hinges here.We have closing messages from the Democrat John Fetterman, who's really pitching himself as a man of the people. He suffered a stroke back in May. He said, he's gotten knocked down. He can get back up. He's really attacking his opponent, Republican Mehmet Oz for being a phony, saying that he is just doing whatever he can to get power for his partner. Oz is really striking this tone as an independent, really trying to sell himself as an independent voice, a moderate. He's going after the swing votes here. This is a very, very purple state, as you well know, John, from the map and it can swing in both directions. They both are trying to get any edge they possibly can.

It is possible, you talk to some Republicans who say, you know, some of them think 2025 in terms of gains in the House. One or two when it comes to the Senate. We could be here a week from now. And by history standards, the Democrats perform \"well\", and yet that will change because the margins are so close. 50-50 Senate, five seat majority in the House, Biden can't afford to lose anything really. CALDWELL: No, he can't. But one thing that I'm really going to be watching and that's really - that could be the story of the night is that Democrats don't do well in blue states. The states that there's already a Democratic governor, there's already democratic control. And they do, do better in these red states, Republican states. And my sources are telling me they are concerned because the abortion issue that is not resonating as much in states where the right to abortion is not currently restricted.
