I'm Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi.This hour, we'll be bringing you a detailed look at the deadly and daily struggle to find food in Gaza. But first your headlines this hour. Efforts continue to recover the bodies of 45 people killed in South Africa after a bus fell off a 50-meter cliff. The \"Wall Street Journal\" marks a grim anniversary exactly one year since its reporter Evan Gershkovich was detained in Russia. And in Baltimore, the largest floating crane on the East Coast is brought in to help clear up after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. There are new warnings today of a potential catastrophe if Israel goes ahead with its planned ground operation in Rafah. But airstrikes have been happening there repeatedly through the war. And I want to warn you the images that you're about to see of the latest strikes are disturbing. Now these are pictures of the aftermath of airstrikes today and a hospital official in Rafah reports 12 Palestinians were killed in an airstrike on a house on Thursday. Women and children, among the dead. Dozens more Palestinians have been reported killed in Gaza over the past day with a death toll now topping 32,000 since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. This, as Israel responds to a new order from the International Court of Justice to allow more aid into Gaza. The court warns famine is setting in. Israel calls the ruling cynical and says Hamas is to blame for conditions in the enclave. Senior international correspondent Melissa Bell joins us now from Tel Aviv. Melissa, great to have you on. I want to talk about this new ICJ provisional measures that they've put in place. What that means realistically, whether Israel has legal responsibilities to adhere to these additional measures.",

Take a listen (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNELLE SHELINE, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICER: Hamas is a terrorist organization. I just think that the way Israel and as well as the United States have been involved in conducting this war, it could have been done in a very different manner. The levels of the casualties that we're seeing, the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The fact that the United States isn't using its leverage to insist that aid get in and that a ceasefire be put in place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So in this interview and also in an op-ed for CNN, this State Departmentemployee, she was only at the State Department for a year, but she really painted the picture of her efforts to try and push the Biden administration, push the U.S. government to change their approach to the Israel-Gaza-Hamas war by doing so from inside the building. But she said that eventually after trying to talk to her supervisors, talk to her peers, put forward dissent cables, she really just wasn't able to do that. And so she felt that stepping down from her position was the way to actually make a powerful statement about her perception that the U.S. credibility when it comes to defending human rights in her words has almost entirely vanished since the war began. Now one interesting thing that she told Christiane Amanpour is that there are other State Department officials who agree with her. They are frustrated by the fact that the U.S. isn't using their leverage to push for humanitarian support, that necessary critical humanitarian support to get into Gaza. And that there isn't more that is being done by the U.S. government to demonstrate a willingness to withhold those offensive weapons from Israel to try and bring down the conflict that we're seeing in Gaza right now. But those other folks who agree with her at the State Department, she said many of them have been there for their entire career. Because she had only been there for a year, it was a little bit easier for her to step out. So it's interesting to hear her talk about that. We'll have to watch and see if there are any other State Department officials, U.S. government officials who step away from their jobs in objection to this policy. But for now, we have seen a bit of a change of tone from the Biden administration in, you know, recent months talking about pushing Israel towards allowing in this humanitarian aid, and we'll have to watch and see what kind of leverage they're willing to use to push Israel against going forward with this ground operation that they say they're going to go forward with in Rafah.",

There's almost 1.5 million people who are displaced in Rafah at the moment, who have gone there for their last refuge and option for safety, but they've lost hope in the international community. And this is why, as aid agencies, we are pleading with the international community, especially the U.S. government, to put a stop to this offensive because it would be absolutely catastrophic for the civilian population and would lead to more killings of civilians and mass casualties. This would be a complete disaster for the aid response as well because aid comes through Rafah, and that would come to a complete halt.

It's very important that we understand what is happening in Russia. It's crucial what we do, not only as journalist, but I think as a country and foreign policymakers.
