What happened in Bucks? Do you agree with extending that window? AL SCHMIDT, PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH:  Pennsylvania doesn't have early voting the way that many other states do. So voters have the option to show up to a local Board of Elections office, apply for a mail ballot in person, receive that ballot, complete that ballot, and return it all in one visit. So it's essentially over-the- counter mail ballot voting. There was a lot of interest this last election in voting -- or this current election in voting that way. Some of our counties really struggled with staffing to make sure that they could process long lines of people voting this way, which is a somewhat more labor intensive process, and Bucks County was one of those.",
