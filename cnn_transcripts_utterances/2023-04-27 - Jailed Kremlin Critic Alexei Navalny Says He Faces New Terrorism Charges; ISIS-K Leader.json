Included in the filing are chilling pictures from the search warrant executed on Teixeira's bedroom showing a gun locker next to his bed containing multiple weapons, including an AK-style high-capacity weapon, handguns, shotguns, rifles, and a gas mask. Prosecutors say law enforcement also found a smashed tablet, laptop, and a gaming console in a dumpster at the house. The alleged leaker has also obstructed justice, according to prosecutors, by telling those he was communicating with online to delete all messages and, if anyone comes looking, don't tell them -- expletive. Also alleging he, quote, deleted the social media server where he posted government information and procured a new phone number and email address. Prosecutors say his history surrounding guns raises questions as to why he was a candidate for the Air National Guard. The court document states in 2018 Teixeira was suspended while still in high school after a classmate allegedly overheard him make remarks about guns and make racial threats. That same year, prosecutors say, he applied for a firearms I.D. card but was denied due to the concerns of the local police department over the defendant's remarks at his high school. Court documents mention his social media posts reviewed by the FBI. One post from last November reads, \"I hope ISIS goes through with their attack plan and creates a massacre at the World Cup,\" further writing, \"If I had my way, I'd kill a ton of people. Seriously, I would be forcibly culling the weak-minded.\" Prosecutors say the defense is indicating they may ask the judge to release Teixeira to his father's home, warning the defendant has been proven to be nothing short of deceptive and coercive, exposing others to peril in pursuit of his own freedom. (END VIDEO TAPE) CARROLL (on camera):  And Poppy, as we were looking through the court filing from late last night, this is something else that we found. Another disturbing allegation. Apparently, back in February when Teixeira was speaking with a Discord user he talked about converting a minivan into what he called an assassination van where he talked about wanting to carry out a mass shooting in an urban area or in a suburb. These are just some of the things that will be taken under conversation when this detention hearing gets underway at 1:00. Poppy?",

Remember, Republicans have a very slim majority in the House. Everybody matters. And it passed the house yesterday with overwhelming support. We had four members who wanted more, had other things that they were interested in, but they are not against the policy. Look, Republicans have provided a solution to the debt ceiling. It's over in the Senate. And if the president is being sincere, which he said he was going to veto things so far in the first three months that he reversed himself on, maybe he will do that on this one. But bottom line is, if he is sincere, then Chuck Schumer and the Democrats leading the Senate have a solution to the debt ceiling problem with some historic spending reforms, almost $4.8 trillion in savings over the next 10 years.

Well, she says that she was frightened, she was fearful of retaliation, and she was ashamed.She also insisted she's not doing this to settle political scores.
