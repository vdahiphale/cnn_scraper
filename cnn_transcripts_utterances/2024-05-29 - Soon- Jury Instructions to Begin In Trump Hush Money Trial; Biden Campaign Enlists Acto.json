      "sentences": "Attorney Todd Blanche telling the jury, \"His words cannot be trusted. He came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison.\" The prosecution objected to this comment and the judge sustained before Blanche rephrased. \"You cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.\"The assistant Manhattan D.A. Joshua Steinglass pushed back, arguing that there was plenty of corroboration for Cohen's testimony and urging the jury to focus, saying, \"You have to put aside the distractions, the press, the politics, the noise. Focus on the evidence and the logical inference that can be drawn from that evidence. Use your common sense.\" Joining me now to discuss, CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning to you. So we heard very long closing arguments yesterday -- nearly three hours for the defense and nearly five for the prosecution. One moment that really stood out to me was that place where Todd Blanche, near the end of his closing arguments, said you can't send someone to prison, which the judge admonished him for. What were your kind of big-picture takeaways here, but also your specific thoughts on that moment? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie. Good morning to you. And so, I think in terms of big takeaways it's going to come down to what everyone was talking about -- both sides -- very long, as you noted, by the way -- and that's Michael Cohen. And I believe that if the defense is successful in creating the narrative, which they have, that Michael Cohen is a liar, that he can't be trusted, that he is -- you remember what they said, Kasie -- the GLOAT -- the Greatest Liar of all Time, and penning this to him exclusively, right, meaning that this case hinges upon his word -- he's the one that directly connects the president to any illegality with respect to the business records and their falsification with regard to the plot -- with regard to the conspiracy and the coverup -- you're basing it on his word -- not guilty if the jury buys that narrative, right? However -- so that's my takeaway with respect to that. From the prosecution's side, if the prosecution can be successful, as they tried for five hours, to distance themselves from Michael Cohen and to suggest that it's not about Michael Cohen exclusively, it's about all of -- first of all, the corroboration with respect to his testimony because everybody else tells you he's telling the truth but there are other things based upon your common sense and good judgment that you would find and believe that the former president was guilty of doing this -- the motivation being Stormy Daniels. The motivation being the impact that would have on his campaign. The motivation being hiding it from voters. The motivation being to interfere with the election. Then the prosecution takes the ground. So those are the big takeaways. It comes down to Michael Cohen, right? And in the event that the jury gets one of those narratives, they'll go on that side. Last point, Kasie. In terms of the issue regarding prison, you can't say that, right? The jurors are not sentencing anybody. The jurors are there to make a determination as to facts. The judge does sentencing. The judge will instruct the law in a few brief hours with regard to what you can consider and what you can't, jurors, and a motion and sentencing is not one of them. And that's why the judge went semi- ballistic, saying that it was an outrageous statement from a lawyer who certainly knew better.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, sure, Kasie.So in terms of the mistrial, I think the reason that that's a victory and that's what you shoot for -- a mistrial, in essence, is when one or more jurors refuse to convict. You need a unanimous jury of 12 to render a conclusion and when one or more say no, it's over. That's a mistrial and he has to be tried again. The reason that would be a victory is for the following reason. Number one, if Trump gets elected, the trial, because of DOJ guidance, right -- a mistrial means you have to retry it all over again before a new jury. He would have to -- it would be delayed for four years. They're not going to do that. I think it would be certainly remote to think that after his presidency, should he be elected, that he would be retried. If he loses the election, I think the interest of the prosecutors in doing this again would certainly not be there. What's the point? In terms of the Allen charge, that would be a victory. In terms of the Allen charge, they call it the dynamite charge -- and that's a little premature to get to. And what that means, Kasie, is when a jury is out and they're having trouble rendering a conclusion and they're just not getting there, they'll send a note to the judge. Judge, we're hopelessly deadlocked. Judge, we can't get through this. Judge, we're not going to make a decision. The judge will say come on in here and he'll read them a charge that says listen, we're not asking you to subject your conscientious views -- to disregard your conscientious views. What I'm saying is that there's no jury that could be better than you. There's no other jury that can view and evaluate the case as closely as you have and could be as good as you are. Go back into that room and if you have a belief that could be shifted -- I'm not asking you to shift it, but if it could be moved based on the opinion of another, listen to that opinion and be fair and reasonable in opening up your mind about changing your view if you feel like it. So that's what the dynamite charge is. And Trump's concern is by saying that other jurors would be compelled to change their view. The Allen charge has been around for a long time. It's certainly constitutionally proper when a jury can't reach a conclusion for judges to instruct them to do that. But it is a concern because what you're doing, in essence, is telling the jury make a decision. Come out here and give me a verdict. Sometimes the juries do; sometimes jurors say Judge, we can't do it. We're hopelessly deadlocked. We've got to go.",
