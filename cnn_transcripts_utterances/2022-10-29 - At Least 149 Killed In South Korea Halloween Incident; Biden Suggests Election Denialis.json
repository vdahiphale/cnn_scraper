The top stories for you tonight, parts of a busy Seoul neighborhood are closed off after more than 140 people are killed and many more than that are injured tonight during Halloween festivities.The husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi remains in the hospital recovering from a violent attack inside his home as police say this was not a random attack. Plus, record early voting continues across the country. In Georgia, almost a million and a half ballots have already been cast. And an eight-year-old has accomplished what no other kid his age has ever done before, climb to the top of El Capitan. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And we begin tonight in the South Korean capital, Seoul, where a Halloween celebration went terribly wrong. The death toll is now up to 149 and many others are injured. Some of the video we're going to show you, it is very disturbing. Many of the victims, they are young adults who were looking forward to their first big Halloween party since COVID restrictions were lifted and it appears they were trapped in a crowd crush in a packed popular nightclub district. Investigators are trying to piece together how this tragedy happened. South Korea's President is ordering authorities to rapidly identify the victims for the sake of frantic families, and thousands of emergency workers have been on the scene, and so is our Will Ripley, who comes to us live from Seoul. Will, tell us what's known about the victims?",

Well, President Biden is offering an update this evening on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. As you know, he was badly beat with a hammer at their San Francisco home early yesterday morning while the Speaker was in Washington, and the President is also making clear his view that the suspect was radicalized by political rhetoric.

It was sent from the House Sergeant-at-Arms and head of the Capitol Police to all members and staff of the House, reminding them of the resources that are available to them to protect themselves, as well as recommendations. These officials describe what happened here in San Francisco at the Pelosi residence as a somber reminder of the threats that elected officials face. I'll read you part of this memo, it says: \"Across the country, the Capitol Police is working around-the-clock to stop thousands of potential threats in their tracks. Despite that work, it is critical that we urge you all to take advantage of additional resources that could help protect you and your families.\" The memo then goes on to identify some of those resources and recommendations. For example, these officials are recommending home security systems for members and staff. They also advise members to coordinate with local law enforcement, particularly if they are out in public events. They also indicate they're providing security awareness briefings so that members and their staff know what to do in case of an emergency. And then finally, they recommend that Members of Congress work with law enforcement in their home areas to ensure that police are doing regular drive-bys of their residences in order to help try to detect potential threats. Of course, this comes as we've been hearing from many Members of Congress who don't believe that the resources available now are sufficient to ensure their own safety, particularly in light of this incident here in San Francisco that happened yesterday morning, when a 42-year-old man stands accused of breaking into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, brutally assaulting her husband. Our colleague, Jamie Gangel has been reporting that it appears that the potential target was the House Speaker herself. She wasn't here at the time, but the suspect was allegedly yelling \"Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?\" Of course that eerily reminiscent of the videos that we saw from the January 6 insurrection when these rioters were going through the Capitol in search of Nancy Pelosi. Finally, the suspect, he was taken into custody by responding officers. He stands ready to be charged with a multitude of offenses, prosecutors say. That includes attempted homicide, assault, threatening the family member of a Member of Congress, as well as elder abuse. At this hour Mr. Pelosi remains in the hospital. He received serious injuries, including a skull fracture -- Pam.",

So, I get why people are anxious. I understand why you might be worried about the course of the country. I understand why you might sometimes just want to tune out, just watch football, or HGTV, or \"The Great British Baking Show,\" which is a cute show. \"National Parks,\" that's a good show. But I'm here to tell you that tuning out, Milwaukee, is not enough. Just moping is not an option, because the only way to make this economy fair, to make it work for everybody is if we all fight for it. The only way to make our democracy stronger is if we nurture it and work for it and that starts with electing people who know you, who see you, who care about you, who know what you're going through.

In fact, where we are right now, in the latest Gallup poll, just 21 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S.If you look back at first midterms, all the way back since 1982, that is the lowest percentage, right nearby, of course, you were hinting at it, Pam 22 percent back in October of 2010. Recall Barack Obama's Democratic Party suffered a major seat lost in the House of Representatives. They lost 63 seats, even in the Senate where they had more room to sort of lose, they still lost six seats in the United States Senate. So the fact of the matter is this comparison between October of 2010 and September of 2022 is not the type of comparisons that Democrats necessarily want.

So Pamela, one might ask, what does one do when they reach the summit and go into the history books? Well, we have photo evidence. They celebrate with a disco ball. A party at the summit.

Chief among them, how an eight-year-old managed to expand the frontiers of cuteness and courage all in a single climb and to that point of courage. His dad, Joe, was able to speak with our colleague Erica Hill not too long ago over the phone about sleeping of all things, attaching their cots (ph) to the rock face with nothing, Pamela, thousands of feet underneath them, just listen.
