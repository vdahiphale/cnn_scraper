We're getting new reaction to the president's outreach to Democratic lawmakers and donors and his defiant insistence that he will beat Donald Trump.Also tonight, White House records reveal a Parkinson's disease specialist met with the president's physician this year, the top Biden spokesperson declining to directly answer questions about that during a very combative briefing. All of this as Donald Trump is trying to reclaim the spotlight amid his opponent's troubles exactly one week before the Republican National Convention begins in Milwaukee.

So, stand by for that as well.I want to dig deeper right now into the unanswered questions about why a Parkinson's disease specialist met with the White House physician earlier this year. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner of George Washington University is joining us right now. Dr. Reiner, thanks so much for joining us. What do you make of this New York Times report that an expert on Parkinson's disease visited the White House eight times over the course of the past eight months? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, Wolf, we've known since the president's position, Kevin O'Connor, released his yearly summary of the president's current medical status that the president did meet and was examined by a neurologist who specialized in movement disorders. And I think the, you know, the reason why the White House did that was that the president exhibits, you know, a very, very stiff gait, short steps, doesn't swing his arms. And some of those symptoms are symptoms that are seen in people with Parkinson's disease. But in Dr. O'Connor's note, he said that the evaluation ruled out the presence of Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, or ALS. So that's reassuring. So, I'm not surprised to see that a movement specialist from Walter Reed saw the president this year. What's a little surprising is that he visited the White House eight times. Now, I will say that the White House medical unit treats not just the president, but other senior members of the White House staff, and it is certainly very possible that a neurologist was coming to see not just the president but other people, but it is certainly curious.",

And when these nerves die, a specific neurotransmitter called dopamine is lost, and that's necessary for movement.Patients can have a variety of symptoms, a lot of the symptoms that I mentioned to you earlier, a stiff gait, the classic symptom, which the president does not appear to have, which is a specific tremor of the hand. It's sometimes called a pill rolling tremor, because it looks like you're rolling a pill between your thumb and forefinger. As I said, stiff gate, sometimes people will get what's called a mask- like face, sort of loss of expression in the face, what we call bradykinesia, very slow movements. And the president does exhibit some of these symptoms. Now, you can have these symptoms in the absence of Parkinson's disease, but I think this is what has heightened everyone's attention about the presence of a Parkinson's expert at the White House.",

They've been hearing from grassroots leaders who are also hearing this from their membership and that is that they are sticking with President Biden. And they are sticking with President Biden because, and I've heard them say this, on President Biden's worst day, they prefer to back somebody like him than to back somebody like Donald Trump, who represents an existential threat to so many communities in this country.

I expect the map to be much bigger than they anticipated it being.And right now, if the national polling holds up from CNN and other news outlets, I expect Joe Biden to be on the -- losing in a landslide and his legacy becoming that he left Donald Trump at a much stronger position than he found him. It'll be quite a failure for someone who ran to try to rid our politics of Trump, to leave him in a much, much stronger position.

I'm sure he's going to point out the differences between where he sits today and where Joe Biden sits today and all the divisions that are going on in the Democratic Party.But at this point, Wolf, the Republicans have the tiger by the tail. Trump has got a pretty substantial lead in the national polls. He's got a lead in the swing states. The map is expanding. So, they don't have to throw too many long passes down the field here. I think it's going to be a lot of handoffs straight up the middle and just keep moving the football methodically until they get to their convention next week and then on past that, if Trump continues to lead, you don't have to take too many chances or too many risks in your strategy.",

He's going to go back to his message of retribution and vengeance and the politics of resentment. He's going to go back to re-litigating the 2020 election. He's going to complain about the government. He's going to -- who knows what kind of craziness he's going to talk about. And that's going to let Democrats remind the American people that as bad as the debate night President Biden had that Thursday, it was not all that much better for Donald Trump. The fact is just the focus was not on him. He told over 50 lies. He talked gibberish about what he wanted to do when he was president. It scared a lot of people. The people who heard that debate through translators, who could focus on the substance thought that President Biden won because they focused on the substance, not how things were said. And at the end of the day, that is going to be the important thing for Democrats to remind people is the stark contrast between somebody who has been decent and accomplished and wants to do so much more for the country versus somebody like Donald Trump, a convicted felon, who is only in this to stay out of prison and for himself.",
