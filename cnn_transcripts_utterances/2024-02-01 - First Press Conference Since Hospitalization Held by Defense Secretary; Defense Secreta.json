And if you are going to retaliate at the time and place that you're choosing, is that not an escalation, particularly given all the rhetoric with Iran? And a question on your recovery, sir.

In terms of, escalation in the Middle East, you know, our goal was to make sure that we contain this crisis in Gaza and that we prevented things from spreading to a wider, wider conflict.Now, there's a lot of activity in the region, but there's always been a lot of activity in the region. And you know well that Iranian proxy groups have been attacking our troops even well before October 7th. And you can go -- we can go back and count the numbers of attacks before October 7th and they're not insignificant. There are things that are ongoing now -- well, things are not ongoing. You know, we don't see a conflict, an all-out conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah. And so, I think managing that I think is -- has been artfully done. And so, you know, we remain in contact with our Israeli counterparts and make sure that that doesn't blossom into a war on the other front. We don't see Israel engaged in a conflict with other countries in the region. We're not at war with Iran. And yes, the Houthis, continue to do some things that are very irresponsible and illegal. And so, our goal is to make sure that we take away -- we continue to take away capability from the Houthis to do what they have been doing. And this is not a U.S. issue. This is an international issue. You know, we're going to either be serious about the freedom of navigation and -- or we're not. And so, as we look at partners like the U.K. and so many others that have joined us in this effort, this is about freedom of navigation. There are others in the world that are watching this to see how serious we are about this, and we are serious. And again, our partners and allies are serious about it as well. This is costing countries and companies significant amounts of money as they have had to redirect commercial traffic around. But the Houthis -- I mean, their activity needs to come to a halt and we will call upon Iran to quit or to cease supplying the Houthis with these advanced conventional weapons that they have used to attack ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab.",
