Ken Griffin, a hedge fund manager who's very wealthy and has previously suggested that he liked Ron DeSantis, he's now saying he's still waiting to see who emerges as a viable alternative to Donald Trump.But that is also creating somewhat of a catch 22 for these candidates. You know, it's the donors want to see someone break out. But as you know, Phil, you need money and resources to project strength, to get your message out, and to have that moment so you can catch lightning in a bottle if you have a strong debate performance. So, that is why there is so much emphasis on next Wednesday's second debate because it's not just an audition for potential Republican primary voters and caucus goers, it's also an audition for these donors who remain on the sidelines, Phil.",

Well, joining us now, \"Bloomberg\" White House and politics editor, Mario Parker, \"Semafor\" politics reporter Shelby Talcott, and John Avlon is back with us. You would note that Steve's story, donors still think that there's a possibility to coalesce behind somebody, so they back your perspective that the race isn't over. But before we get to that, real quick, I want to swing back to the auto strike, Mario, because you know White House officials quite well. You cover the building. We were in the Briefing Room together quite often. The decision not to send Julie Su, the acting labor secretary, and Gene Sperling, who's been running point for them on this issue, at the same time Trump and his team are kind of going all in, trying to peel off rank and file union officials, why? MARIO PARKER, WHITE HOUSE AND POLITICS EDITOR, \"BLOOMBERG\": Well, you see for the Biden White House an air of responsibility, right? We saw some of this earlier this year with the East Palestine, Ohio, trail derailment where President Biden was being asked in the Briefing Room about whether he'd visit, right, the optics around it. And the message that we got from the White House at the time was that, no, we'll stay on the sidelines, it's not responsible for us to bring the presidential apparatus into that town. The White House has taken that same tact with this, right, with Julie Su and Gene Sperling, saying that they'll just wait on the sidelines in Washington, D.C., as the UAW and the big three automakers continue to hold discussions. They'll swoop in to destroy at the necessary time. Now, on the other side, there's former President Donald Trump, a former reality TV star, who does understand the optics, who doesn't care as much about the responsibility of the infrastructure or injecting himself into that moment as well, and so you're seeing him kind of, in some ways, box Biden in because, again, we've seen like Bernie Sanders last month talk about the Democrats problem with working class voters. Donald Trump has no qualms about swooping in and injecting himself into that argument.",

And when they actually dug into the data, not just the union bosses who often back Democrats, but the actual workers. In the last election, four in ten backed Trump, right?

But there are a lot of coalitions that have been traditionally pretty powerful inside the Republican Party that don't feel like they have a champion yet and they haven't coalesced behind an alternative to Donald Trump.I will say, there's another side to the successful accomplishment of overturning Roe v. Wade, which is that Democrats keep winning local races. We don't pay a lot of attention to them, but that backlash is continuing to brew on the ground in state legislatures and local races.
