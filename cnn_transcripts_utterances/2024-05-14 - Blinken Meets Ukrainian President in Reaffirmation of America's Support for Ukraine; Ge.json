It comes after Russia launched an intense cross-border assault on northern Ukraine over the weekend. This is Blinken's fourth visit to the Ukrainian capital since the war began and his first since the U.S. approved billions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine late last month.Blinken will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as other officials. The U.S. says some of the new aid has reached the front lines, but Blinken acknowledged the delay in getting that aid approved has been costly for Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are now warning that ammunition and spare parts for foreign-made tanks are running low, adding another obstacle on the battlefield. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is promising to ramp up the delivery of aid and says a new package of weapons will be announced this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The delay put Ukraine in a hole and we're trying to help them dig out of that hole as rapidly as possible. And so at the highest levels in our government we are engaged with the highest levels of theirs to be able to ensure that we're doing everything humanly possible both ourselves and our allies who are searching equipment as well to get it there to the front lines.

That's all that matters.The counterpoint to that of course is that there's a 21st century form of war here in terms of long-range missile strikes and drone warfare and electronic warfare that the Russians are now employing very effectively.

I think he's probably thinking that if Donald Trump wins then the pressure goes off because Trump will pull any support for Ukraine and that will then enable the Russians to advance much more rapidly. But I think that protracted war is one aspect. The second aspect I think is that Putin is deadly serious when he talks about Russia being at war with the West. So therefore he's actually preparing for Russia to be in open conflict with NATO. And what he needs therefore is an economist and a technocrat to modernize and streamline the Russian defense industrial base so that they can produce advanced technology weapons much more efficiently and rapidly than has been happening in the past.",

In which case Ukrainians confronted by not only Russian advances in the Donetsk oblast but also now in the Kharkiv oblast would have to split their forces between those two fronts and the Russians could then break through and make significant advances.

It's an area that they believed that they had controlled. And yet we are seeing this in other areas around central and northern Gaza as well that the Israeli military is now finding it needs to move back and carry out more operations there it says because Hamas is starting to regroup. And this really goes to the wider military strategy which has been criticized quite roundly recently, especially by the Biden administration, that Israel does not have a plan beyond the military plan, that there is no political plan. We've also heard from the chief of staff in Israel saying that there needs to be a political plan to complement the military plan. Otherwise, the military is just going to have to continually fight against Hamas as they regroup. So in this particular area in Jabalia, for example, once the Israeli military had withdrawn, there was no governance, there was a vacuum of power. And this has happened across the Gaza Strip. And that is when we are seeing the militant groups move back into those areas. And so this is one thing that the Biden administration is warning Israel about, that there has to be a political plan to complement the military plan. Otherwise, within this vacuum, Hamas will regroup and they will be able to attack Israel again in the future. Rosemary.",

And of course, the final reading of a bill which is expected to happen soon. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENTAnd we've seen these protests for a number of weeks. They really ramped up again over the weekend. We saw a huge protest on Saturday as Georgia marked Europe Day. And then Sunday into Monday, we saw protesters massing outside Parliament, the standoff with police on Monday as lawmakers tried to undergo the third reading at committee level. Today, we see the third reading at the full chamber of the Georgian Parliament. This is sort of the last procedural step. It doesn't immediately become law. After this, the president, who is pro- European, has said she will veto Parliament, then says it has enough votes to override that veto. So this is a moment where I think the government will say that it has de facto passed this if it passes the third reading. But as you saw there, the protesters say that they will not back down either. So Georgia really finds itself at a crossroads here. As I said, it is now an E.U. candidate. The E.U. has said that this law would negatively affect its bid for membership. The government, though, denies that it runs counter to E.U. ambitions. But we have heard, of course, from the United States as well, Jake Sullivan saying that this is democratic backsliding. So this is really a sort of crossroads between East and West. The protesters on the streets worry that this is a sign of growing Russian influence over this more post-Soviet state. They say that this law is modeled on a Russian foreign agent still, which we have seen has, over the years since it's been passed in 2012, become really the cornerstone of Russia's repression of civil society and freedom of speech. So that is the big concern here. So the plenary session of the Parliament set to start in about just under an hour from now. The protesters, as I say, not backing down, confident that they will be able to force change as they have in the past.",

And of course, Cohen testified that Trump instructed him to pay Stormy Daniels that $130,000 and then Cohen called Trump just before paying the hush money and testified that Trump then approved the plan to pay Cohen back. So how does the defense overcome testimony like this that directly ties Trump to the alleged illegal scheme?",

This was a really big day for the prosecution and a horrible day, quite frankly, for the defense team.The only thing the defense team can do in a case like this, when such damning testimony has been provided by such a key witness, is to attack this witness credibility. And we've heard that Trump's team plans to keep Michael Cohen on the witness stand for hours. And that's all to show every inconsistent statement he's ever made, to go into the felony conviction that he had, to go into the inconsistent stories that Michael Cohen has told. And this is a guy that's been on television a lot talking about this case. So there are lots of statements out there by Michael Cohen. I suspect pretty much everything he's ever said about this case is going to be a part of that cross-examination, because Trump's team, they have one job. And that job is to make Michael Cohen appear to be a liar.",

Because Cohen is, of course, the only person who can testify what's at the heart of this case, which is Trump's direct involvement in the alleged conspiracy to falsify the business records in order to pay Stormy Daniels. But he does have this credibility problem, doesn't he? So how does the prosecution overcome that challenge? Of course, they've put the other witnesses up before we're hearing from Cohen. That would make a big difference too, no doubt.",

What the prosecution has done is try to build its case independent of the testimony of Michael Cohen, doing that through Stormy Daniels to a certain extent, doing it through whole pigs, through the business employees, through those employees that work for the Trump organization, making their case through the documents, through the text messages, through the emails, through the actual signed checks.What the prosecution has tried to do is, and I'm sure they will argue at closing argument, even if you don't believe Michael Cohen. Look at all of the evidence that has been put forth in this trial, and based on that evidence alone, you can find that Donald Trump engaged in this conduct. And one of the things I think that's been surprising, Rosemary, too, is the demeanor of Michael Cohen. We expected him to be very erratic. We expected him to be abrasive. And he was quite calm and quite composed throughout his entire testimony. That was shocking, given all the negative comments that we heard from other witnesses and the kind of persona that was painted with respect to him. So it's going to be interesting to see if the defense can break him down, if they can cause him to get frustrated and irritated and cause him to present himself in a way differently than what he has done so far on the witness stand.",

One wildfire in British Columbia more than tripled in size over the weekend to nearly 5,300 hectares. And in Manitoba, a massive fire has scorched more than 34,000 hectares.The huge container ship that's been stuck under a collapsed bridge in Baltimore for seven weeks could be moving again within days. This controlled explosion was set off Monday to dislodge wreckage from the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Officials say the blast removed a tremendous amount of steel. Now they'll figure out how to remove the remaining debris that's on the bow of the ship. The controlled explosion was originally planned for Saturday, but it was delayed because of bad weather. The ship hit the bridge in the middle of the night in March, causing the span to collapse and killing six construction workers. Still to come, it's no longer the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation after a major shake-up at one of the world's biggest charitable organizations. We'll explain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Welcome back everyone. Shares of video game retailer GameStop have soared after an infamous trader posted on X for the first time in three years. The trader known as Roaring Kitty helped ignite the so- called meme stock frenzy of 2021, during which troubled stocks went viral due to online chatter and social media activity. [03:55:03] Roaring Kitty recently posted this cartoon depicting a man leaning forward in a chair holding a video game controller. That caused GameStop shares to surge more than 110 percent on Monday before settling at 74 percent. To be clear, this huge jump had nothing to do with the company's fundamentals. You can see how far the stock has fallen over the past year, down to about $10 a share before skyrocketing up to more than $30. Well one of the world's biggest charitable organizations is losing one of its founders. Melinda French Gates will soon be stepping down as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. CNN's Anna Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Three years after they announced their intention to divorce, Melinda French Gates is now leaving the foundation she started with her former husband.Over the last 25 years, it's made nearly $78 billion in grant payments around the world. In a statement posted on X, she said it wasn't a decision she took lightly, but it was time for the next chapter in her philanthropy. And she has plenty of money to get it going. Under the terms of her separation agreement, she has $12.5 billion to spend on charitable works. And while there isn't much detail on exactly what comes next, whether she will launch a new foundation, it is clear where her focus will be. She said this is a critical moment for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support. Meanwhile, Bill Gates also took to X, thanking his former wife for her work, adding that he was sorry to see her leave, and assuring followers that he remained committed to the foundation of which he will now be the sole chairman. The name of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be changed to the Gates Foundation. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
