And tonight, the spotlight is on Governor Tim Walz.Here in the coming hours, Walz will face a major test when he takes the stage to introduce himself as the Party's vice presidential nominee. It's a moment that caps off a whirlwind month for Walz who is relatively unknown until Kamala Harris rose to the top of the ticket and picked him as her running mate. And he's got a lot of work to do here. He has to prove himself on the national stage. He has to help the Party convert this newfound energy and momentum into votes. It's going to be a PAC night with other powerhouse speakers. You'll see former President Bill Clinton take the stage, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Let's go to CNN's MJ Lee. MJ, a big night ahead for Walz. What are you expecting?",

And that's what you're hearing behind us. It's very fun.So as Walz is getting ready to take the stage tonight, he is facing some criticism for past statements in his political career.

      "sentences": "Look, Governor Walz, as MJ was saying, is just very new on the national scene. And a few of his pieces of his biography have been really highlighted by Republican, J.D. Vance in particular, on his military record. We know that he served in the National Guard for 24 years or so, starting in Nebraska, then transferring to Minnesota.But some of his time near the end when he decided to leave and retired and run for Congress has been picked apart a bit. But it's a comment he made about the weapons of war when he was talking about gun control legislation. He sort of inferred that he used the guns in war. And he did not serve directly in combat theater, as we've talked about. So that's one piece of things. The latest controversy, he talked a lot about IVF, how he and his wife used the method of IVF to have their two children. He actually did not use IVF. It was IUI, a different type of fertility treatment. Look, his spokesperson said Governor Walz likes to talk like the people talk. So I'm not sure that that specifically is of huge concern to voters, which specific form of fertility treatment he and his wife use. The reality is anyone who rockets into public life, there are going to be a few biography things that will be looked at. But so far, I think in the first month of him roaring on the national stage, we have certainly seen many indications over the years of far bigger, bigger controversy.",

It's just -- it gets a little crazy loud here in the arena. But I do want to ask you, because we have heard Tim Walz be inexact multiple times about some things. Does he need to address that, his military record, for instance, because you have a bunch of Republicans in your colleagues in the House, also Senators out today attacking his military record.REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA): I find that so beneath J.D. Vance as a military veteran to pick apart the service, 24 years of service to this country by the vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz. I find it beneath a fellow service member to have done this. Remember, he could have retired at 20 years. 911 happened, he re-upped. And he only stepped back and retired when he was pushed and eager to run for Congress, to continue service to this country. So no, he doesn't need to address it. His service speaks for itself. And on the personal issue of IVF versus ICI, I have a son and daughter-in-law who are doing IVF right now. And I've been allowed to say that it is terrible that people would pick into when families are having a struggle, having a family. Mister Walz doesn't need to explain anything about his service and his love of family.",

Abortion and abortion services are legal in Pennsylvania, but that doesn't mean they haven't been constricted. Access to abortion providers has been constricted. The number of places, clinics, planned parenthoods has shrunk. So Pennsylvanians don't take this for granted. They get what Project 2025 wants. They want a national abortion ban. That is what Donald Trump wants. That is what J.D. Vance wants.He called rape and pregnancy as a result of rape and inconvenience. Trust me, in Pennsylvania, women and men, especially the men who love women, get this, and they are pushing back on it.

That's why it's so quiet right now.But it's an outdoor rally with a lot of people, both in the event space itself, but also outside in the parking lot, hundreds of cars, thousands of people out here to not even get in to the rally, but just to watch the rally. It's his first major outdoor event since the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. If you can see behind me on the stage, he is now surrounded by bulletproof glass. And this is a marketable market moment for the former President, getting back outside doing an outdoor event. The crowd, it's interesting, Brianna. I was talking to some of them, not really paying much attention to what's going on in Chicago. Didn't tell them John Legend was playing, but now (inaudible) a ton of attention. What they are focused on right now is the former President. This is a stronghold part of North Carolina for the former President, second time he's been in the state in the last week, underscoring the importance of this state. He's won it twice.
