His response is due later this week. I think it's fair to say he's going to want later, maybe never, certainly after the election. And then the judge who is holding the hearing to decide the trial date and other scheduling issues on August 28th, a week from Monday. Now, the other Jack Smith federal case, now we're talking about the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, they are going through how are we going to handle classified documents. Now, remember, DOJ returned a superseding indictment, a sort of version 2.0, where they added this third defendant, Mr. De Oliveira, and added three charges against Donald Trump. And so the question is, is that going to compromise the May 2024 trial date? Again, the dynamic, Trump is going to want to push back. DOJ is going to want to say, let's keep it.

He's a political candidate. He should have a fair amount of leeway because of that. And she was suggesting there are going to be limits despite that because the laws of the court have to come first. He went within a short time of that hearing and began posting on Truth Social, his social media website, other people's posts, I guess we'd call them truths, about Judge Chutkan, adding some of his own commentary. Generally, it was other people's, one included a very large picture of her. And so he is very clearly testing the terms of his release, both in that case and, I would say, with these attacks on prosecutors in others. Poppy, some lawyers say, and we talk about this in the piece, other defendants, if they were doing similar things, would be in jail.

Why?JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I would disagree with that, Phil. The president was -- when I was with him in Utah and he was out there to talk about the PACT Act, as you know, an incredibly historic, important piece of legislation. When he was out there, at the top of his remarks, he talked about what was going on in Hawaii and how we were moving forward with the federal whole of government response. So, he has been talking about this. You saw the FEMA administrator in the briefing room yesterday, actually zoomed in the briefing room on Monday, and I shouldn't say yesterday, while she was in Hawaii talking about the efforts, what we're doing, the federal government, I just listed out all the things that we have been doing since day one. Day one, we have had dozens of federal agencies and departments working with the folks on the ground, doing everything that we can to be helpful. And it doesn't stop there. Again, this is a long-term effort. And so, look, you're going to continue to hear from the president. Obviously, he's eager to head out to Maui to see for himself. And you see the president. If you know this president, you know how much he cares about people. You know how much he cares about folks who have lost so much. You have covered him, Phil. You know how he deals with these types of unfortunate situations. So, of course, he's eager to go out there.

The thing that I think, and this has been an issue for you guys for the last two-plus years, connecting that to how the public feels or what the public knows, if you look at poll after poll after poll, continues to be an issue. And yet there seems to be a sense inside the White House, it's going to turn. People are starting to figure it out. How do you know that? Why? JEAN-PIERE:  So, look, if you think about the Inflation Reduction Act, yes, it's a one-year anniversary, and it's a key part of Bidenomics. That's also important to note. And, look, we're talking about investing in America. We're talking about a fair tax code. We're talking about the biggest, largest climate action investment ever, as we were just talking about what's going on in Maui and the extreme weather. These are all incredibly important things here. Here's an example of, as I'll provide to you. The president was in Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin yesterday. He went directly to the American people, in Milwaukee, right? He talked about how the Inflation Reduction Act and also the bipartisan infrastructure legislation and also the Chips and Science Act, all of these important historic pieces of legislation are creating a manufacturing boom. He went to Ingle Team (ph), a manufacturing company that is now, because of the Inflation Reduction Act, is going to double their efforts when you think about the wind turbine generators, when you think about the bipartisan infrastructure law, it's going to now manufacturing E.V. charging stations. All of these things are important. And you look at Wisconsin, just specifically, looking at Wisconsin, $3 billion of companies are investing -- $3 billion in Wisconsin. 150,000, more than 150,000 jobs were creating in the last two years because of the president's Bidenomics, right, because of his economic plan. All of these things are important, 2.5 percent unemployment in Wisconsin. And you think about the national unemployment level, which is under 4 percent. So, this is what the president's going to continue to do, talking about how his plan is investing in America, how we're lowering costs for the American people. And that's what they want to see. So, we're going to continue to have those conversations. You're going to hear from the president, you're going to hear from the vice president, you're going to hear from his cabinet secretaries, and we're going to continue to talk, speak directly to the American people.
