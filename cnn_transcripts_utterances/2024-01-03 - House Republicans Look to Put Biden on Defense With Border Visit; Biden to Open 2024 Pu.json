And President Biden will use this speech on January 6th, the three years since that insurrection at the Capitol, to really sharpen his argument in warning that Former President Trump poses a direct threat to democracy.Now, this speech is really setting up one of the first real political campaign split screens between Biden and Trump of this year. President Biden will deliver these remarks near Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. It is there, a Revolutionary War site where George Washington commanded his troops, where President Biden will try to make this contrast argument. Meanwhile, Former President Donald Trump will be hitting the campaign trail in Iowa as he's working to try to secure the GOP nomination. But Biden campaign officials have been quite eager to really ramp up their pressure and contrast with the former president at a time when some polls have shown Biden trailing his predecessor in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. But campaign officials are telling voters that they believe they need to look at what Former President Donald Trump did in office and take him at his word. And that is the message the campaign plans to stress throughout the next year.",

Thanks so much for joining me, Senator. Let's start with what Arlette was just talking about, the strategy of the Biden campaign looking forward. I'm going to simplify it. Less about Joe Biden, more about Donald Trump. Good idea? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, Joe Biden has got a very strong record of accomplishments to run on, and he and many of us who are campaign surrogates are going to continue to remind the American people of just how much he's gotten accomplished over the last three years, how strongly we have come out of the pandemic and the economic challenges that that created. But it's also important to remind the American people how much chaos there was during the Trump presidency, what his leadership was like, and how January 6th three years ago was the culmination of that in which the former president literally mobilized a mob to go attack the American Capitol. It is worth focusing on the ways in which Former President Trump is clearly signaling that if he were re-elected, he would continue and extend and expand the chaos we all experienced during his four years as president.",

It is making our sustained close alliance and partnership more and more difficult.

But continuing to send forceful messages, both publicly and privately, about critical policy matters, I think is an important way, even with close allies, that we deliver important messages. Two members of Netanyahu's cabinet have -- Ben Gvir and Smotrich -- two ministers have recently made public remarks that suggest that removing the Palestinians from Gaza is part of their ultimate objective.And I maybe mischaracterizing it, but in a quick review of recent comments and exchanges back and forth between the administration, that is something where because it is so sharply contrary to our policy positions as a country, in Congress, that there was a sharp denunciation of those particular positions. Similarly, when there was settler violence in the West Bank, there was clear and sharp comments made both by the administration and that I support, calling for an end to settler violence that was seeking to change the facts on the ground and to impose more and more needless civilian deaths on Palestinians and to further inflame the conflict. President Biden is doing the right thing in trying to deter a broader regional fight and that's becoming harder and harder as developments in the region make it more difficult. We have deployed significant assets to intercept Houthi attacks, to prevent Hezbollah from further expanding, to prevent Iran from further expanding this conflict. But that becomes difficult if we have a partner who is pulling in different directions than we are.",
