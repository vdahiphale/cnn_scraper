Because that's the question that will be front and center on Monday when jury selection begins and Trump becomes the first former president to ever face criminal prosecution. Said differently said more simplistically, can trump get a fair trial in Manhattan? That's today's poll question at smerconish.com.Here's what he said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No jury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It's very unfair that I'm having a trial there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't think it was quite as long as this one that I saw in the current case, but I think questions 29 and 30 were something like, do you have strong opinions about the former president and that was 29. And 30 was, if so, would they affect your ability to be fair.And we have one prospective juror, and I've been picking juries, really since the late 80s, a long, long time, and you know, you think you have some intuitive skill set develop them, but I saw a female juror probably in her 40s casually dressed, she had an Irish brogue, she worked at Irish bar, normally my type a juror in a criminal case, and she had checked off 29 and 30. And it was late in the day and I asked her, I see you've checked these off, with those strong feelings be positive or negative. And she says, I despised that man. And I guess I just maybe was beat up from the long day. But I said, well, look, you don't have to sugarcoat it for me, speak your mind. She said, I speak my mind, I hate him. And, you know, I've never experienced that. And I looked at Judge Merchan and, you know, I just kind of assumed that he would meet my gaze and we would dismiss her. But Judge Mmerchan who was a very smart and capable judge and he ran a tight ship, he said, well, wait a minute. He said, if I told you what the law was, and instructed you on the law, could you put those feelings aside and deliver a fair verdict? And she said, yes. And it's been my experience. And I suspect it was your experience when you're actively practicing law that when a prospective juror is in the courtroom, and there's the pomp and circumstance and the judge is in his or her black robe, most people do say yes. So, he kept her for the next round, which really meant he was going to keep her. And we came up with a different strategy, she had a parental health issue she was dealing with, and we got her out that way. But Michael, the problem was not that prospective juror, it was like rows of shark teeth. Once she went there were 50 More behind her. So, you know, we got rid of her, did not use a (inaudible) but they're difficult.",

      "sentences": "The consumer price index rose 3.5 percent in March. The CPI measures the price of a typical American consumer's basket of goods and services, everything from groceries to haircuts to appliances. And the 3.5 percent increase reinforces just how big a problem inflation is for President Biden as he seeks reelection. In a recent Fox News poll the economy topped the list of voter concerns beating out election integrity, the border, health care, abortion, a whopping 61 percent said the issue was extremely important another 28 percent said very important. That's 89 percent.While inflation has fallen from the highs of the mid 2022 era, many families aren't feeling the relief. Food prices are still up 21 percent compared with when Biden took office in January of 2021. And just in the last year alone car insurance up 22 percent, eldercare up 14 percent, motor vehicle repair up 12 percent, baby formula and formula 10 percent, outpatient hospital services 8 percent, rent of primary residence up close to 6 percent. Anxious consumers trying to outpace prices are now buying up gold, which often happens in times of economic turmoil. Costco began selling $2,000 gold bars in September. In the fourth quarter sold more than $100 million worth. And now Wells Fargo estimates that Costco was selling up to 200 million worth of gold and silver each month. Yet my next guest says that for many people inflation feels higher than it actually is. He put forth this thesis in the New York Times essay under the headline, \"Why are voters so upset? Consider the Snickers bar. Joining me now is Paul Donovan, Chief Economist of UBS Global Wealth Management. He's also the author of several books, including \"The Truth About Inflation.\" Mr. Donovan, thanks for being here. What does the price of a Snickers bar say about our perception of inflation?",

So you are starting to see what economists call deflation. So, price levels coming down in about a third of American cities today. But what we've got is an issue here that you're actually because the United States is a relatively advanced economy, relatively high income economy, food is not actually a very important part of the household budget, lots of other things are more important. And you spend typically, somewhere between 10 percent and 20 percent, depending on your income bracket on food.So, it's not actually a huge part of your everyday spend other things, your mortgage, your health insurance, that kind of thing, that's where you're putting your money, but you focus on the thing that you're buying on a regular basis. And that's why it's perhaps a little bit irrational to put so much emphasis on there, not saying ignore food prices, but they're not actually the dominant part of your monthly outgoings.",

And the insurance cost is something that I don't think gets enough attention or discussion. I guess what I'm saying is I get your point, you know, I'm buying that Snickers far too often, frankly, but what can I look to say, there's light at the end of the tunnel, there's promise because as in my setup, we were fair, we presented a broad stroke of everything, it's all going up.",

So, we've had falling prices for durable goods, you know, that's furniture and cars and electronics, they've been falling for over a year and a half, absolutely coming down. And I'm afraid to say the way that you guys over in the United States calculate housing costs and inflation is just downright weird. So the largest part of inflation in the United States is a price called owners' equivalent rent, it's a call for the calculation. And it's a price absolutely no human being has ever, ever paid in their life.It's completely made up number. And this is a big distortion. If the United States calculated inflation the same way that Europe calculates inflation, U.S. inflation today would be 2.4 percent. European inflation is also 2.4 percent. So the United States has got exactly the same inflation rate as Europe has at the moment. But because you calculate housing in a really weird way, which nobody actually pays, that's distorting your overall number. Insurance is a big deal. But you mentioned motor insurance in the introduction, there's a lot of confusion about what motor insurance is, consumer price inflation says motor insurance is rising 22 percent a year. But if you look at the personal consumer expenditure deflator, another way of measuring inflation, and in fact, the one that the Federal Reserve looks at, it's well below 10 percent inflation, still very high, but nothing like the CPI number. Honestly, to be to be frank, America doesn't spend enough money on its statistical agencies, and you've got poor quality statistics. So we're not entirely sure what's going on a lot of the time.",

      "sentences": "Is this the new normal? The pandemic may be over, but American public schools are still struggling with chronic absenteeism, which is typically defined as missing about 18 days of school for any reason.Nationally, an estimated 26 percent of public school students were considered chronically absent last year. That number surged from 15 percent in 2018 to 28 percent in 2021, this according to data from the American Enterprise Institute. Eighteen missed days a year? It sounds insanely high, at least to me. It caused me to dig in the attic for a quick comparison. I found three of my old report cards. One was from the seventh grade. I missed a total of three days for the year. One was from ninth grade. I missed one day. By the way, that was a suspension. That wasn't even sickness. And midway through my senior year, I didn't miss any days. Educational experts, they say chronic absenteeism is a leading factor in the nation's slow recovery from pandemic learning losses since students can't learn if they're not in school. And the problem it cuts across all demographics, district size, income, race. For example, the richest school districts saw chronic absenteeism rates nearly double from 10 percent before the pandemic to 19 percent in 2022 and 2023. The poorest districts, which already faced higher rates of student absenteeism, saw an alarming jump from 19 to 32 percent since the pandemic. The New York Times says, \"The trends suggest that something fundamental has shifted in American childhood and the culture of school, in ways that may be long lasting. What was once a deeply ingrained habit, wake up, catch the bus, report to class, is now something more tenuous.\" Joining me now is Nat Malkus, senior fellow and deputy director of Education Policy at the American Enterprise Institute.

I mean, this jumped about 90 percent for everyone sort of across the board. And so, it's something that changed broadly over the pandemic.
