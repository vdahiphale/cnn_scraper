She believes that Donald Trump is a clear and present threat to democracy. And she has made that very clear overnight.Earlier this morning, she also responded to those comments and she said that this is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. So she is also perhaps going to say more as the day goes on. Vice President Harris could as well. But, Sara, the closing days of this campaign could not be more stark. The messages could not be more different, and the rhetoric could not be a darker from the former President by talking not just about foreign policy differences. That is common in an election, but talking about a firing squad for a fellow Republican, fellow American, out of bounds of the norms of politics. The question is politically, will that matter? Does that guide any votes? At this point, it is very unclear. But I can say the January 6th attack is a part of this election, not the last election. Voters we've been talking to here in Wisconsin, some of them, at least as they've been casting their ballots, they say they're doing it with January 6th in mind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Remember, she directed a lot of her comments to women when she was touring with the vice president. Listen, John, generally speaking, and I'm interested in what Matt hasto say about this. I don't think anybody, rational person in the Trump headquarters was thinking this would be a swell way to finish the campaign, suggesting that we'll put Liz Cheney in front of a firing squad. I don't think that's their strategy. That's Donald Trump and that's in some ways a microcosm of this whole campaign. They've run a pretty rational campaign. He is an irrational candidate and now the spotlight is on him. And all these unforced errors are going to in some ways define the end of this campaign. So, and I do think that women are going -- if the gender gap is larger on her side of the ledger than his, she will win this election because women vote in larger numbers. And if, you know, she -- if she beats him more by a larger margin among women, then Trump beats her among men, I think she's going to be the next president.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I'll just point out that it was just about what, two, three weeks ago when Vice President Harris was on the campaign trail with Liz Cheney in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan. And I'll say is that the polls seem to tighten up in Donald Trump's favor around the same time. So I'm not saying correlation equals causation, but what I will say is that I believe Liz Cheney being on the campaign trail despite the fact that, you know, folks around Kamala Harris clearly think this makes it about democracy and everything else. What it really does is becomes about foreign policy. If you ask your average American, especially the very few undecided folks out there still, what do you think of Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney? They think of Iraq, they think of Afghanistan, and they think of the wars of the 2000s.And so I do think we have to cover Donald Trump's comments responsibly. And point out the fact that he was making not really a dissimilar comment from what Democrats said about George Bush in 2004, from what folks were saying in 2008 about if you're going to send troops into war, how would it be if it was you or your family that was the one who was actually going out there and serving? And so was a little clunky in the final few days? Of course. But if you actually look at the context of it, it actually illuminates a point which resonates with a lot of voters as among the reason Donald Trump has had unique appeal as a Republican candidate is because he is actually changing a lot of that neoconservative war hawk viewpoint that I think most folks attribute to a Cheney like Republican Party.",

It was an active principle and patriotism and that's why she's a powerful messenger. To the gender gap, I think one of the great opportunities still really even now in these waning days is for Kamala and or Tim Walz to go on Joe Rogan. His conversation with Donald Trump got something like 40 million plus views and those are a lot of folks that haven't really heard from Kamala and Tim.
