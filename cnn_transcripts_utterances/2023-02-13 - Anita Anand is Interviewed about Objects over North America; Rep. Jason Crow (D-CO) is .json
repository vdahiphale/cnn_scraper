It was shot down near Lake Huron.And you're looking at now -- this is new video shot just into CNN. And it may be hard to see, but it shows fighter jets flying over Michigan. And on Sunday, U.S. jets took down an object that was being tracked over northern Canada. The Biden administration has been cautious, describing the unidentified object over Canada. But at least two high- ranking officials have made reference to balloons, as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): You can be sure that if any - any American interests or people are at risk, they'll take appropriate action. Until they get that comprehensive analysis, however, we have to look at each balloon individually and see what this (INAUDIBLE).",

He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and previously served as a U.S. Army Ranger in Afghanistan.Good morning, Congressman. My first question for you is, what have you heard from the administration about what's happened here? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Hi. Well, good morning. Well, Kaitlan, first of all, this is not a new issue. This is an issue that the House Intelligence Committee and the Department of Defense and administrations have actually been tracking for many years. And there's kind of three different categories of what we call UAPs, unidentified areal phenomenon. First are radar anomalies. These are things that pop up on the radar and are later determined not to be actual objects. The second are objects that are later identified as errant weather balloons or maybe flocks of birds or something. Then the third \"r\" (ph), kind of what we're dealing with right now, and that is objects that have been identified, visually on radar as well, but are on - are of an unknown origin and we're not really sure what they are. So, what's happening now is, we're actually looking for these with extra vigilance. We're looking for them in different ways. We're starting to see them in different ways. And President Biden has now made the decision that we are going to not allow those over our U.S. territory. We're going to defend the sovereignty of our air space, so to speak, and we're now shooting them down. So, that's kind of the change. But the Intel Committee actually declassified a report last year, and we held an open hearing, where we talked about this issue.",

And if something comes into our sovereign territory or U.S. sovereign territory, it's unidentifiable and it poses a threat to commercial air travel, that we're going to shoot it down. That's the current criteria and that's obviously happened in four different instances over the last week, including the most recent one over Lake Huron.And as Minister Anand, as the Department of Defense has explained to me, we actually don't know what this object is.

We can't spend years or months producing this stuff. We have to get it immediately to the battlefield, which is actually the right answer.So, really what this becomes is our ability to replenish and restockpile that, working with the manufacturers, which we're working to do.
