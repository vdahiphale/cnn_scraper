The focus is grown now on helping the millions of survivors in Turkey and Syria impacted by the devastating earthquake. Syrian state media reports the government has approved aid deliveries into rebel held areas of Northwestern Syria. Aid organizations say the need for additional help there is immense and can't come soon enough. The death toll in both countries is now over 22,000. Time is running out to rescue survivors. But the search goes on and there are some success stories. Here's a video of a rescue that happened earlier Friday in the Southeastern suburb of Turkey. That's a teenage girl pulled out alive after spending 107 hours trapped under rubble. It's one of several rescues across Turkey on Friday. Jomana Karadsheh has been covering all this since the start and she joins us now from Iskenderun along Turkey's Mediterranean Coast. Jomana, of course hopes beginning to fade now at finding people alive. What have you been seeing there in these last desperate few hours?",

A lot of family members going through this agonizing way trying to figure out what happened to their loved ones, so as you can see, the rescuers are going down there. I think we were told that this is in the lower floors of the building where they were getting signs of life. We're just call for quiet; I'm just going to be silent for a few moments here. Just to give the rescue crews ability to focus on what's going on there. And the quiet they need. Can you ask something for an update, and to try and get an update? I mean, Christina, these sort of missions as you know, they had been going on now for days. And even once they actually locate someone this can go on for hours and hours and hours if they want to. It's kind of a surgical sort of procedure where they need to go in there very carefully, and to try and pull them out because obviously, they're going to need medical treatment after this. We don't know what their condition is. So they have to be very, very careful when they do this.

And they spent days and all day yesterday, going through the building and they were hopeful that they were getting to the bottom floor maybe that they would be able to locate him. We had his family and his friends at the scene and they really were still holding on to the hope that maybe he would emerge alive. And then by end of the day, the tragic news came that they pulled his body and you know his mother, his sister and other family members there just broke down absolutely heartbreaking scenes. And we've been seeing this all across the city. Just now before we rushed over to this scene we were seeing caskets driving past us, people walking past us crying.

And also, those construction companies that have been building all those buildings, thousands of buildings, and many of them are on fault lines. And for instance, the Hatay airport that was again built by one of Erdogan's closest associates was built on a fault line. So, there's a lot of anger. And I think that will have an impact on his prospects. And the other implication is the opposition Erdogan has been blessed with a weakened divided opposition.

He apparently drove the car straight into a crowded bus stop and remote which is in north east Jerusalem. And as you noted, a six-year-old child was killed as well as a 20-year-old man. Several others were injured among them another child who is reportedly in critical or serious condition police saying that actually was an off-duty officer who shot and killed the man shortly after he rammed into that bus stop. And as you noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already saying calling for the suspects home to be sealed and demolish this is something Israeli authorities often do to the homes of suspected attackers. We're also seeing videos from the suspects' neighborhood in East Jerusalem, very heavy police presence. And we're also hearing that several of his family members have been detained but not much more information beyond why they are being detained. Now, no militant group has claimed responsibility for this attack, although Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza has praised it. As you noted, it's been already a very deadly first month and a half of the year for both Palestinians and Israelis. It was exactly two weeks ago actually not far from in the neighborhood not far from this attack earlier today, where there was that attack on the synagogue that killed seven people. The attacker in that situation also was from East Jerusalem. We're also hearing from the Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir. He says and he's in charge of Israeli police. He says he is calling on police to put up barriers all across the neighborhood where this suspect was from. He wants everybody coming in and out of this neighborhood to be checked. And he's also calling for even a further operation in East Jerusalem. He says he, as he was saying, and I'm going to quote him saying he wants to reach the terrorists homes and to stop terrorism before it comes to carry out attacks. But I can tell you, Christina that barriers in East Jerusalem would be a very drastic step that will likely already even further inflame what's already been an incredibly tense and violent few weeks here. We know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was just here about a week ago, I've seen your staff to stay on to continue consultations conversations between Israelis and Palestinians to try to keep the calm in some sense, but it's clear that there's a lot of work left to do, Christina.",

Joe Biden and Brazil's LuizInacio Lula da Silva have more in common than the title of president that each defeated right wing populists in contentious elections, elections that ended with opposition supporters, resorting to violence as they refuse to accept the vote count. 77-year-old Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva or Lula was sworn in for a third presidential term last month, his journey back to the office was complicated. Six years after the end of his second term, Lula was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to nearly a decade in jail. Consequently, Lula was banned from running for office. But in 2021, all convictions against him were annulled, clearing the way for a third term as president. Well heads of his White House visit, Lula sat down for an exclusive conversation with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, who joins us now live from the White House lawn. Good to see you, Christiane.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday; the Turkish Government will cover one year's rent assistants who have been displaced. And now to a major development, the Syrian government has just approved humanitarian aid delivered in rebel held territory in north-western Syria. That's where their White Helmets group says tens of thousands of families have been left homeless. Today in a second UN aid convoy crossed into the region from Turkey. There is only one humanitarian corridor between the two countries and that was blocked for a time due to the damage of an access road.

I heard some European politicians say that the crossings are closed. This is not the case. I checked it with myself also. I checked it myself. The crossing also to Abyad to Turkey is open, some aid is coming in but it's not much needed. Here it's much more needed to towns in towns more in the west.
