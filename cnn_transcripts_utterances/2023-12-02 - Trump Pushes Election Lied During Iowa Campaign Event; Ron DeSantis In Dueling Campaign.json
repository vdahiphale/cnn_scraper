I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.With less than six weeks until the Iowa caucuses, former President Donald Trump is campaigning in the key battleground state of Iowa, and he's back to pushing his lies about the 2020 election. The former president told supporters he hopes judges will let the 2020 election be prosecuted in court. The GOP frontrunner even encouraged his supporters to go into vote counting facilities in 2024, where ballots will be tabulated saying they need to watch the votes. Let's go live to Kristen Holmes in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Kristen, you're there with the former president. Looks like he'll be talking there shortly. What can you tell us?",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The most important part of what's coming up is to guard the vote. And you should go into Detroit and you should go into Philadelphia and you should go into some of these places, Atlanta, and you should go into some of these places and we got to watch those votes when they come in, when they're being, you know, shoved around in wheelbarrows and dumped on the floor.

While they didn't tell us exactly what he is going to say, they did have these signs made that they're passing out. I think we have a picture of them here that say \"Biden Attacks Democracy.\" Now, obviously, this has been a big argument of Biden's against Donald Trump, particularly pointing to Donald Trump's work to try and overturn the results of the 2020 election. Clearly looks as though former President Trump is going to try and flip the narrative there. This is also coming at a time when the Biden campaign has really ramped up its criticism of the former president. We know last week there was mention of Donald Trump really fixating on overturning Obamacare, something that he failed to do when he was in office. That gave a lot of ammunition to Democrats, a lot of ammunition to the Biden campaign. They have released ads on that, talking about how Trump is planning on taking away health care for millions of Americans. Obviously, Jim, we are in a different position now than when we were back in 2016 when Trump was elected to the White House. ACA, the Affordable Care Act, is actually increasingly popular, so this has given new ammunition to Democrats.",

I don't know if you heard the report, but she was just showing some of the signs that are being handed out at this Trump rally in Iowa, and one of the signs says \"Biden Attacks Democracy.\" Just want to get your reaction to that. REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Yes, when you said that we were living in the upside down, I was like, oh, thank goodness, it's not just me. Absolutely. That's every day in Congress for me, though, unfortunately right now. You know, there is only one team that has fought for democracy, and this isn't just in words, but this is action. We know that we don't have a strong Voting Rights Act right now, simply because the twice impeached former president made sure that he installed three very far-right Supreme Court justices that gutted that. That was one of the many steps that he took as it relates to democracy. In addition to his own legal troubles that he has right now, that have him in hot water, as it relates to January 6th, as it relates to, honestly, you know, his phone calls that he wanted to make about overturning the election and calling down to Georgia.

So Kevin McCarthy said that it was good enough, that he as speaker decided that there was going to be a formal impeachment inquiry. My chairman, Chairman Comer, has made it clear that he had gotten all the documents that he had requested.And speaking of documents, we know that there has been over 30,000 pages worth of banking documents that have been turned into this committee, and what's so interesting to me is that they started by going after Hunter Biden. They've been going after Hunter Biden since the Trump administration. And we've still not really gotten very far. We have not gotten to the point that they feel like they can connect the dots to say that Hunter has done something wrong and that wrong has also implicated the president. What is funny about this, though, is that they collected tons of documents on George Santos, and they were able to decide that there was enough there. Not only in the House, but they were able to decide that when it came down to prosecuting George Santos. This is much to do about nothing. They have been embarrassed over and over and over. Hunter, just this past week, said, hey, I will come in, I will testify in a transparent way. We know that Comer had invited him to testify publicly before. He just didn't realize that Hunter would take him up on it. And so therefore he said, never mind, I don't want to do that. This is a bad move for them. It has messed up their PR, and it has messed them up, and honestly the American people are still saying what we want is lower gas prices, what we want is lower food prices, what we want is access to health care.

The difference between Trump and Santos is that Trump has a lot more power, and so they wanted to say, hey, we took the high road. We got rid of the bad guy. But to be honest, Santos was the low man on the totem pole. So they'rereally just trying to score a few points, hopefully save some of those Republicans in New York that are in Biden seats, in fact, there's Republicans, I believe, in 18 Biden seats, not just in New York, but throughout this country, and right now, they don't -- they know that they can't hold onto the majority unless those in Biden seats win as well. So this was one of those things, like, hey, we've got to do it, but only because they're looking out for their own hind parts, not because it was necessarily the right thing to do. In fact, the speaker at the last minute said, hey, vote no. Initially, he said vote your conscience.

And it's important to note, and I wish the vice president had noted, that we're dealing with an enemy who's hiding behind these civilians all the time and using them as human shields. Even as Palestinians have fled the combat zones, Hamas has fled with them and continues to use them as human shields. So Israel will continue to exercise extreme caution. I think it's further than probably any army on earth, whether it be sending text messages, leafletting, urging these Palestinians to get out of the way of fire. It is extremely difficult. They are literally, for Hamas, they're moving targets.

So they won't come out and tell about the rapes. And that's going to be very, very painful.Israel has to maintain the pressure on Hamas. These negotiations happen to begin with only for one reason, and that's because Israel ramped up the pressure, the military pressure on Hamas. So we've been able to get these hostages out so far successfully because of that pressure. We have to continue it, and meanwhile, we're witnessing these surreal situations, you know, the rockets that you just saw, have just been several of more than 10,000 rockets that have been fired at Israel. Many of those rockets in Tel Aviv go literally over my house in southern Tel Aviv. We have an Iron Dome just to the east of us. Those batteries take out those rockets right over our heads. Iron Dome is 90 percent effective. That means every 100 rockets that go through, 10 break through that net, and they land. They knocked out an entire apartment building next to my house a while ago.

There was an interesting report, and having been in government in a long time and the military a long time, I know that military intelligence is an imperfect science. There are many, many estimates. I'll never forget in 2011, our intelligence and American intelligence said that Bashar al-Assad would only remain two months in power and he's still around today, 12 years later, or when America recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, all the estimates was that the Middle East would go up in flames, and in fact nothing happened.So it's an imperfect science. And it is very important to check and certainly investigate later who was the highest-ranking officer to read this report? And if it wasn't passed on, why it wasn't passed on? It could be that people said, well, this is an interesting report, we really don't think Hamas has this type of capability to mount this, this is -- as they say it's aspirational, it's a dream. I think what's more disturbing for me reading it is why it was leaked and who leaked it. And already we're seeing the beginnings of political struggles in Israel about who was responsible for October 7th, whether it be the government, particularly the prime minister, and/or the army. And I asked myself, OK, whose interest was it to leak this document? Who's it trying to make look bad? And I haven't come to a conclusive answer about that.

A federal appeals court ruled Trump can be sued in civil court over the January 6th capitol riots and in the separate criminal case for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election.A judge ruled that Trump may not claim presidential immunity, because the president is not a king. Judge Tanya Chutkan in that case writing, \"Trump's four-year service as commander-n-chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.\" CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us along national security attorney, Bradley Moss. First to you, Marshall. If you can lay out what the judge had to say. She didn't hold back. MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: No, she did not. And she knows that everyone is going to be reading this ruling. You, me, journalists, historians, law students, and, very likely, the Supreme Court one day, as this thing moves its way through all of the expected appeals. But a very notable ruling. The former president was making the case that because everything in this indictment covers things that happened while he was president, he can't be prosecuted. The only problem with that theory, Jim, was that the judge completely disagreed with it. She said, it's not supported by the text of the Constitution. It's not what our founding fathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution. She quoted George Washington's Farewell Address and Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Papers. And she said there's no Supreme Court precedent for it. So in addition to that divine right of kings quote, I've got another one for you from Judge Chutkan. She said, quote, \"Whatever immunities a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time, and that position does not confer a life-long get-out-of-jail-free pass. So, no free pass for the president. But he will appeal. And the trial is scheduled for March, so, he will probably try to get this before the Supreme Court at some point before that.",

But we all knew, every competent legal analyst knew these arguments weren't going to fly. But they take time to resolve. And that's why I think Judge Chutkan, recognizing the circuit and the Supreme Court are going to have to look at what she did, took the time she did to craft this ruling. It's very well done. As Marshall said, it went back to what the founders were saying when they were crafting the Constitution and addressing these issues, that the idea of the president is not a king.

After the vote, the locks on his office door were changed. The name plate there by his door was taken down. CNN's Polo Sandoval is live in Santos' home district in Douglaston, New York.

Eleven states, plus New York City and Puerto Rico are seeing high or very high levels of respiratory illness activity, which can include Covid, flu and other viruses.Here to talk about the spike, CNN medical analyst, Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen, great to see you. I hope we're just talking about your garden variety cases of the flu and maybe some Covid mixed in. But what is different about this flu season? What's your sense of it right now? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, Jim, it's important for us to reset and say that it's actually not out of the ordinary. So, normally at this time, we have a confluence of viruses. We have the common viruses that cause the common cold. And you also have influenza, the flu, and also RSV, the respiratory virus, which is also very common. Nearly every child gets RSV before they turn two. On top of that, we now also have Covid. And so, we're seeing this confluence of viruses. Not out of the ordinary, though. And actually compared to last year at this time, exactly one year ago, pediatric hospitals were so overwhelmed that the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association were calling for President Biden to declare a state of emergency, because the hospitals were so full. We are not at that level. And so, what we're seeing is expected. It doesn't look like there's a new pathogen. And we just have to get through the winter, as we get through all winters.",

I don't know why people don't get these shots. I wish they would. It would certainly tamp down on things. Is it too late at this point to get vaccinated on those fronts? WEN: It's not too late. I also have my Covid booster, as well as the flu vaccine. My husband does. People that we know, our patients do. And I would highly recommend that people go and get it. Ideally, you have gotten those shots by now. But we know the uptick of the Covid booster is still pretty low, even for nursing home residents. Only 25 percent of nursing home residents have gotten the updated Covid shots. So, especially if you are 65 and older, if you are somebody with chronic medical conditions, if you live in assisted living, a nursing home, you need to have your flu vaccine and your Covid booster. And you should also, if you are in -- if you are an older individual, also consider getting the RSV vaccine, because we need every protection we can get. You don't want to get sick. You don't want to end up in the hospital. And vaccination helps to prevent that.",

What's going on in Ohio appears to be probably due to what we always see.So pneumonia could be due to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. It's very common for there to be pneumonia due to these substances, due to these organisms. And so I think it's important for parents to watch for concerning signs, for example, a cough that just doesn't go away, a persistent fever for more than five days, a -- if a child starts developing shortness of breath. Young kids in particular, kids under the age of 2, especially newborns who are particularly susceptible to having ill effects from pneumonia. They should contact their provider as soon as possible. But know that this is something that we see every respiratory season, even before Covid. And so, it's something that we can manage. What we're seeing also in China, also appears to not be a new pathogen, but due to an increase in viruses and bacteria.
