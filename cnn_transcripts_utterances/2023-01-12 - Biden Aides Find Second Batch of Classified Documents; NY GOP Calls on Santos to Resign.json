The latest revelation fueling Republicans' claims that the -- that Donald Trump is being targeted, receiving unfair treatment as he's being investigated by a special counsel for classified material found at Mar-a-Lago.

And part of that is because the White House is making a strategic decision not to get out in front of this matter, and as you saw at the briefing there. not to answer questions, and instead, to let things leak out through the media.Now, here's what we've learned from our reporting. And that is that Biden attorneys have found a second set of documents that include classified information at a second location. The first location, of course, was an office here in D.C. As we reported, Biden's lawyers were clearing out that office back in November and uncovered what we've learned were ten classified documents, including information about Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom, and those included top-secret documents. Now we've learned that was only known by a small group of advisers. But after once they made that discovery, that prompted them to search other locations. But at this point, we have so many questions about this new batch. What is in them? How many were they -- were there? Where were they located? And the biggest question right now: is this it? The White House has been very careful not to say definitively that that first batch that was discovered was all there was. But also, another big question right now -- not for us but for Attorney General Merrick Garland: whether or not to appoint a special counsel to just take this on. But the fact that we now have documents in more than one location, that seems to strongly lean in favor of appointing a special counsel. But that's a decision for him, and who knows when we'll get that answer?",

It actually says he graduated college with a nearly perfect GPA from Baruch. That also never happened. Same with the MBA that he claims he has; also not real. So let's bring in CNN's Jessica Dean this morning. She is live on Capitol Hill, where you just saw George Santos facing those questions about whether or not he's going to resign.

So that's what leadership is saying. They've also said they want to deal with this internally. But the facts are that the calls this morning for his resignation continue to grow. And as you just laid out, these aren't just Democrats. And just to give everyone the big picture right now, here's what we know. Federal prosecutors are looking into George Santos's finances. We know that in the nation of Brazil, they have reopened a fraud case against him. Two House Democrats from New York have filed a formal House ethics complaint against him. We know that there's been an FEC complaint filed against him. So there is more and more of this coming out every day.

So first of all, any member can call a motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Freedom Caucus representatives, many of whom are on that page, increased representation on key committees. This is the debt ceiling we've been talking so much about, right? This is a sign of coming attractions. We're going to have a collision course. Discretionary spending at '22 levels.

Court documents show he was involved in a bitter legal battle over his father, Thomas Walshe's estate. Friends, as well as Walshe's nephew, alleging in signed affidavits the elder Walshe and his son had been estranged for years after Brian Walshe absconded with almost $1 million from Dr. Thomas Walshe.

I want nothing to do with him.\" These allegations surfaced years before Walshe pleaded guilty to federal charges of selling fake Andy Warhol paintings, the victim of the fake sale saying Walshe was very convincing.
