Tonight, fears of an expanding conflict in theMiddle East as Israel's Foreign Minister warns Hezbollah will be destroyed if all out-war breaks out. Then pageantry and politics in Pyongyang as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un sign a mutual defense pact against outside aggression. We'll have all the details on the Russian President's visit to North Korea. Plus, record heat is gripping the United States, causing raging wildfires as well as forcing residents to flee from their homes. We'll have that of course, and much more ahead this hour. But we begin tonight with a growing rift between Israel and its strongest allies. The fallout deepens over Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations against the Biden administration. The Israeli Prime Minister released a video, saying the U.S. is withholding weapons from Israel as it presses ahead with the Gaza war. He demanded the U.S., quote, \"give us the tools and we'll finish the job.\" And that led the White House to cancel a high-level meeting with Israel on Iran, according to a CNN contributor reporting for \"Axios\". Here's more of what Mr. Netanyahu had to say. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The White House says only one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs was withheld over concerns they could be used in Rafah. Meantime, today, the U.N. human rights office condemned Israel's repeated use of 2,000-pound bombs in densely-populated areas of Gaza. It isolated six attacks targeting residential buildings, the school, a refugee camp as well as market, accusing Israel of systematically failing to comply with international law. Israel strongly rejects that.

But first, let me go to Ben because, Ben, in the last ten or so minutes, we've heard from the IDF chief basically saying that Israel has many forces against Hezbollah, engage in offensive against Hezbollah. Also saying that the IDF is preparing and coming up with solutions to deal with these and other capabilities, these and other capabilities, referring of course, to that nine-minute drone video that we saw from Hezbollah.

Turkey, of course, occupying northern Cyprus since 1975. And what we know is that in 2014, there were the first joint military exercises between Cyprus in Israel, and as late as May of 2023, they had another set of exercises.

But if we do have this new agreement between North Korea and Russia, does that mean that both of these countries begin to have military drills? Sort of like a mirror image of what the United States does with South Korea south of the DMZ. If that happens, certainly that would reset, that would cause a re- evaluation of the security posture here on the Korean Peninsula. And on that point, Russian President Vladimir Putin at the lectern said that the Russian federation, quote, \"does not rule out developing military grade cooperation with North Korea.\" But again, a lot of this is vague.

Ukraine has both being grateful as well as frustrated as it watched the U.S. offer bigger weapons packages, but at a slower pace. And of course, then it has needed for a touch on that at next month's NATO Summit in Washington. The question is going to be about Ukraine's membership and whether they can secure that, make sure that's center stage. Joining us on set here is a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, and former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Kurt Volker, thank you very much, great to have you on the show, ambassador. Let me pick up with the discussions among NATO allies ahead of the NATO Summit that's happening in Washington. And there is -- there does seem to be a point of tension -- point of tension that I don't think has shifted too much between those central and European allies, including the U.K., who want the communique in Washington to be around the word \"irreversible\" in terms of NATO's -- Ukraine's position. The U.S. doesn't want to go there. Why not? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE NEGOTIATIONS AND SENIOR ADVISER, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  Right, so, this all goes back to last year in Vilnius when we had a NATO Summit then. And several allies and Ukraine all seeking stronger language about inviting Ukraine to join NATO as soon as possible. Stronger than the language we've had for the last 16 years since 2008, somewhere in Bucharest. Washington and Berlin do not want to do this. They feel that it would draw NATO into a direct confrontation with Russia. Now, Article 5, if you know, the collective defense commitment would apply, we'd have to go fight Russia against Ukraine. So, they don't want to do that. There's a lot of room in-between the position of saying, get things started and we're at war today.

There's a perception that we've been consistently sending a signal of weakness, that despite all of the arms and all the aid we've given to Ukraine, we always set limits. We always come in later. We just had this six-month delay in aid from the United States because we couldn't agree in Congress. So, this is sending a signal to Putin, keep fighting, wait it out, he believes he can win. So, the goal here, it's less about Trump or Biden, it's more about what do we need to do as an alliance to start setting this on the right trajectory. I think that's where that's coming from. Now, that's for U.S. politics, what I heard when I was in Ukraine just a few days ago is that there is a certainty, a predictability about where we are today with the Biden administration and others, which is, yes, support, grateful for that support, but it's never enough, never on time, never enough to win, and there's no strategy to help Ukraine win. President Biden is re-elected, that's what they anticipate the continuation to be. If President Trump is re-elected, then it's an unknown. And so, we don't know what he would do. There are examples of things he did in his first term, like lift the arms embargo on Ukraine that had been in place until he took office, closed down the Russian consulate in San Francisco, tried to shut down Nord Stream 2. So, a lot of things that were in the right direction. But it's still very unclear what he would actually do as president.",

Second, it is to try to maintain peace and security in Europe through whatever means. And here, NATO, I think, needs to step up a bit more. Some of this will happen at the Washington Summit. For instance, moving the assistance coordination to Ukraine into NATO as a clearinghouse mechanism. This is something NATO's good at. It should have been done two years ago. We're finally doing it. This is a very good step. Putting in place a program to help Ukraine with its defense modernization, training, equipping, procurement, that's a good thing, but then the ultimate question of are we bringing Ukraine closer to NATO, I think we need to do more there, too.",

Now, we are seeing its devastating impact across the globe in the form ofrepeated heat waves, massive wildfires and hyperactive hurricane season. In the U.S. State of New Mexico, the governor has declared a state of emergency. Growing wildfires have led to evacuations there. At least one person has died and more than 1,400 structures have burned. Record heat is gripping the United States from Ohio to the Northeast. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 80 million people. And South Texas is being slabbed by flooding from the heavy rain ahead of the expected arrival of Tropical Storm Alberto. And for more now on the wildfires in New Mexico, here's our Ed Lavandera. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The City of Ruidoso, New Mexico is essentially a ghost town, it feels like at this point. Less than 48 hours after these fires started in this mountainous region of New Mexico, more than 8,000 people have evacuated. As I mentioned, there's two different fires that are -- that have consumed so far about 20,000 acres, almost none of it has been contained here at this point. And the visibility, because of the smoke from these fires, is just really in -- cut down dramatically. The smoke is intense. This is a roadway that leads out to the northern edge of town. This is an area where people were scrambling Monday night to get out of this area, as one resident described us, ash was falling from the sky. And as you look at it, everywhere you look here, visibility is cut down dramatically. Very difficult to breathe, and it really kind of gets into your eyes as well. You can imagine what the firefighters on the front lines are battling in this canyonous mountainous area, fighting these fires are extremely difficult. As I mentioned, about 1,400 structures have been destroyed or lost so far in these fires. More than 8,000 people have evacuated. And one resident says they're lucky to get out alive.",

So, that relief can't come soon enough because there are thousands of people who have evacuated this area.

It'll be fascinating to see whether or not -- and Mr. Netanyahu may well be among the small minority of Israeliprime ministers, not just at the White House, not in -- just in his first year, but perhaps not at all. We're going to wait to see exactly whether or not the president, the administration -- the president will see Netanyahu. We saw him in New York but no White House visit. Look, I think Mr. Netanyahu's court domestic constituency, it's not the Republican Party, it's certainly not the Biden administration, it's survival. And survival means maintaining the right-wing coalition that he has. And that's, I think, the real problem for the prime minister. I mean, on trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust three years now in the Jerusalem District Court. If he doesn't maintain himself on power, and I mean, remain prime minister, prospects are pretty grim. He could be convicted or if not, he may have to cut a plea deal that would drive him from politics. So, I think, again, I don't say this lightly, I think Mr. Netanyahu may well be the worst Israeli prime minister at the worst possible time, and during the worst possible circumstances for this country. And I think it's negatively affecting U.S.-Israeli relationship for sure despite the Biden administration's efforts, I think, want to continue to work with Netanyahu. Because the only way the Biden administration is going to de-escalate this conflict is through possibly in an Israeli-Hamas negotiation and a deal. Those don't look -- those talks don't look very promising at the moment, but I don't see much in the way of hope for an alternative right now.",

So, Wednesday night in Stuttgart, the Germans up against Hungary in Group A. As you say, they beat them by two goals to nil. The opening goal coming midway through the first half. There was all this chaos of the Hungarian defense, but Jamal Musiala wasn't complaining as he dispatched his second goal of the tournament, and this in his hometown, too. Musiala was exceptional throughout the game. He is already being hailed as one of the tournament stars. In the second half, Germany making it 2-nil. Musiala, again, involved. Good finish there from Ilkay Gundogan. Germany know that the opposition will soon get tougher, but they couldn't really ask for much more right now. And the seven goals that they've scored are the most they've ever scored in a Euro's group stage. And there is still one game to go. Albania had already given the defending champions Italy a scare in their opening game. Today, they took an early lead against the 2018 World Cup finalists, Croatia. That's Qazim Laci with the opening goal. They then defended superbly for over an hour, keeping Croatia at bay until Andrej Kramaric drove in an equalizer. And just two minutes later, they were ahead, thanks to a very unfortunate own goal from Klaus Gjasula. But Albania never dropped their heads and believe it or not, it was Gjasula who had the last word, making amends by side footing home a dramatic equalizer in the 95th minute. 2-all the final score. What a result for Albania, but that could be really problematic for Croatia. We'll soon see. Great action so far, Isa, and it has been a really fun tournament with some brilliant performances and some amazing goals.",
