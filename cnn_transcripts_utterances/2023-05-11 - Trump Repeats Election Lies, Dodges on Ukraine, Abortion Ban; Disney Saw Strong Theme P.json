      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to have you with us this Thursday and just ahead this hour, the Trumpa town hall, the Former U.S. President taking an array of questions before a live CNN audience. He refused to admit defeat in the 2020 election. He also declined to say if he wanted Ukraine to win the war. He didn't say he wanted Russia to win, though, but he did emphasize the need for a settlement to save lives in the conflict. And on the debt ceiling, Trump's saying he does not think a default will happen because the Democrats will \"cave\" to Republican demands for massive spending cuts. And if not, he says do a default. All the details right ahead and speaking of the debt drama, President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sounding the alarm again warning of the dangers to the global economy and the hit to American credibility too. If the U.S. effectively sleepwalk my words, not theirs into a debt default to Janet Yellen, speaking at the G7 summit in Japan. Plus, inflation nation, this time, it's the Bank of England raising interest rates for the 12th meeting in succession. With inflations still above 10 percent, that's five times higher than Central Bank's targets. The Bank of England raising rates another quarter of a percentage point, and hinting of more rate hikes to come. Just compare and contrast that 10 percent plus U.K. inflation rate to the U.S. Consumer Price Index. That's now below 5 percent. Of course, it's still stubbornly high, but low enough for the Federal Reserve to hit the pause button on hikes at least we think so. Now just released data backing up that pause scenario too prices at the factory gate rising 2.3 percent in April that's down from the previous month levels and below expectations. The market response let me give you a look. Well kind of muted U.S. stock market futures and European shares as you can see, they're mixed. But tilted to the downside fresh weakness in U.S. Regional Banks weighing once again on sentiment and Disney also pressuring the U.S. blue chips too an earnings report filled with both Disney pluses and some minuses. It shares had to fall some 5 percent there as you can see in early trade. Tim Nollen, Senior Media Tech Analyst at Macquarie will join us shortly to explain all the details. And also today exact a close over across Asia, keeping with the inflation theme, the Chinese consumer price index falling to its lowest level in more than two years. That's up a muted 10th of a percent rise last month and well below expectations. If you kept up with that you're doing better than me. We've got a lot to get to this hour and we do begin in New Hampshire, and the Trump Town Hall in which the Former President refused to admit as I mentioned that he lost the 2020 election. He also declined to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war with Russia. Though he did say he wanted the conflict to end and to save lives. Jeff Zeleny has all the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Former President Donald Trump picked off right where he left off lying about the 2020 election.

Now legally, that would mean that he is being released, but we will have to confirm whether those orders have been issued. What has happened in the past couple of days is that Imran Khan was taken by forcefully by paramilitary troops while he was getting his biometric -- with another court hearing at Islamabad High Court on Tuesday afternoon. He was kept in custody with the National accountability bureau. Many protests happened across the country Imran Khan's own party has issued an order preventing any of Imran Khan Supporters to come out towards the Supreme Court. There are attempts being made for some semblance of calm in the country after two days of cities burning of military installments being set on fire the homes of military officers being set on fire. The military has been called in for security purposes in the federal government as well as in different provinces of the country. We're still waiting to see whether Imran Khan will be shown to the media we have. We did know that about two hours ago, the Supreme Court heard an appeal by Imran Khan's lawyers about whether it was legal for Imran Khan to be apprehended in the way that he was rather forcefully by hundreds of paramilitary troops. We do know that the three member jury had said even before Imran Khan was summoned to the Supreme Court that the way that Imran Khan was arrested was highly problematic. And we're now just going to have to wait to see whether this will bring some calm to a fraught political situation here in Pakistan, or will it complicate things further, Julia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, it was, as you said, I think it was a mixed report. I think subscriber losses for thesecond quarter in a row is obviously not a good thing. Part of that was on the price increase, which led to a little bit of churn. I think part of it was also just the content slate, which should get better into the second half of the year. But Disney is talking about U.S. and Canada direct to consumer subscribers being again, you know, perhaps down in the next quarter, before they pick up after that. So this is a key metric that investors look for is the subscriber numbers. Now, the ARPU or you know, the revenue that they're generating per user is going up and that's certainly positive. And the advertising tier that they've launched is beginning to work. It's beginning to attract more users, and even said that it's a net positive to their revenue versus the ad free tier. And they're going to be rolling out an ad supported tier in Europe later this year. So you know, really quite mixed results, I would say, you know, the losses are a key metric that investors are looking at as well. This is the second straight quarter of much less bad losses, so -650 million in operating income in the quarter. Next quarter will be down a little bit from that, again, it's not a linear progression upward. But, you know, I think you kind of mentioned that the key items here, it's the subscriber numbers, and then it's the operating losses, which are getting better, but are still down. So it's, it's like you said a very mixed quarter for Disney.",

And we're more sensitive, I think, more sensitive than ever, actually about key metrics like profitability, which is a good thing. I just wanted more broadly about the profit plan, you know, when you read that accompany saying that they're going to cut back on content, they're going to sell more ads in a market that you could argue is saturated. Although they said they're just scratching the surface there and charge high subscriptions. I still wonder if whether, if that's the right plan is that perhaps the only plan that they have here the only option.",

I think subscriber numbers can increase again, a lot of it depends on the content slate, andyou'll have things like you know, the Avatar 2 film hitting the Disney plus streaming service in a matter of months. And so that alone can help boost subscribers, more content coming out. There being smarter about their content investments after doing what you know, all of their competitors did over the last several years, which is just create tons and tons of content to attract subscribers. Now the focus shifts more toward generating a profit they've been pretty firm in stating they will get to break even in the direct to consumer business by the end of fiscal 24. So it's about six quarters from now, they've got a big cost savings plan going on, they actually indicated last night, they may exceed their 5.5 billion dollars' worth of cost savings. And the advertising tier I think is very important for Disney. We don't have a lot of detail on it yet. But it's using smarter data using automated ad buying processes. It allows Disney to generate a lot more advertising revenue on that subscriber base. So for Disney plus subscribers, you can get an advertising tier, which is probably going to stay at a lower price, certainly relative to the ad free price, which is going to go up. I think they indicated quite a bit more into the back half of this year in the next year. So there are ways that they can you know, manipulate their subscribers to sign on to the right types of services, generate the right types of advertising revenue. I think there is upside for Disney over time. But the next quarter still next quarters in not so great.",

Operating income was up, I believe, was 23percent, if I remember correctly, so that's good, strong growth. Now we're coming out of, you know, the COVID, you know, rebound that began maybe last summer. So the growth should moderate from here. But that's still very, very strong growth. And they particularly highlighted the international parks, with new attractions opening and many parks still many more to open, and with the COVID restrictions easing in a number of their park locations. So the park is still very important driver for Disney. I mean, it's a mid to high 20s EBITDA margin business for them. And they're very confident in the long term ongoing growth of this business. So basically, you know, it does work into the valuation, you know, you can apply some of the parts metric to Disney, you get plenty of upside. Our target is $125 so 25 or so percent upside from here. We just think, you know, Disney is a virtuous circle of the IP that content, the consumer engagement, the parks, obviously, the streaming business that people are signing up for, so everything sort of rolls together. This has always been Disney's business model. They're moving through some transitions. Now, parks are fortunately through those TV transitions.

And part of that is because the fuel in Africa is a lot dirtier. And because of that they require more maintenance, more service. Also, it's the fuel is more expensive. And the flip side of that and part of the reason why this collaboration with just sprung in Africa is a perfect fit for electrification is because they also actually have a cleaner energy grid than we do here in California where we're located because of the hydro dam power that they have.",

Softbank had promised better returns for its once high flying investment arm but for now, the blurry vision continues. Clare Sebastian joins me now. Good news is Clare you never have blurry vision. But I think the emphasis has to be on what I just mentioned there. It's fascinating that the Vision Fund continues to lose money when the broader tech markets rising, it sort of suggests to me that they hadn't written down a lot of those private investments to the level perhaps that they should have done and are still doing it?",

If you look at the reporting period,tech stocks as a whole sort of continue to fall over that period, even though for the most part of this year, they've been on the rebound. So the reporting period, didn't really capture the full extent of the tech rebound that we've seen in recent months. So that is one thing that hasn't been so good for them. And you can see it in the numbers 2 billion was the loss for the Vision Funds, or just over 2 billion in the fourth quarter but for the full year it was 39 billion, so you definitely get some sense of improvement towards the end of the reporting period. If you drill down into some of the biggest sort of contributors to those losses, that they admitted in their filings some of them are already showing signs of rebounding things like Sense Time, the Chinese AI Company DoorDash, all of those look like they're coming back up, that they could show up for the company in the future. But we do still see in there vestiges of that past strategy, the sort of Hallmark Masayoshi Son feeding, bubble investing type strategy, one of the biggest contributors to the last for the second Vision Fund, Vision Fund II was WeWork. So I think that sort of tells you that sort of hangover is still ongoing for Softbank, but overall, the company trying today to make the point that you know, their loss is narrowing that the worst may be over. And I think if the market continues in this direction, they may potentially be right.",

They are clearly now doubling down on that in particular generative AI as a result of ChatGPT, the CFO saying that has really pushed it into the mainstream. That Masayoshi Son, who he quoted directly, is saying that he's just as excited about that, as he was about the sort of dawn of the internet. So you get a sense of what's going on. They have said that they're in defense mode, that they want to be very careful with their investments. But he did say that their cash position has improved, they have enough cash on hand, he said, to go on offense for the right opportunity. And clearly, that is going to be an AI. So I think with the landscape here like they managed to reduce their loss by coming out partially of Ali Baba other stakes like Uber, the past investments, the previous landscape, for Softbank, and I think the future will definitely be moving towards in particular generative AI.",
