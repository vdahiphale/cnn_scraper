Those four charges, of course, that you -- that you just read right there are what he is facing. The prosecution made it clear in this 45- page indictment that the former president had the right to challenge the election results, he had the right to even lie about fraud. What he did not have the right to do, they say, is to engage in these multiple conspiracies, one to defraud the United States and the government from the ability to count the votes, defrauding -- obstructing the process of Congress to certify the election results, and, of course, denying the right of millions of Americans of their -- having their vote counted.

Now, as the bounds of a First Amendment defense, if the president were charged with just his speech on January 6, with saying, \"We're going to March down to the Capitol and fight like hell,\" I think he'd have a really strong First Amendment case there. He's a candidate for office making aggressive claims, but certainly nothing that is a slam dunk for saying that he incited people to violence. What the amendment does, though, is lay out a series of acts over a period of months around trying to subvert the will of the American voters and talking about conduct in seven states with fake electors and so on that goes far beyond simply the words that the president uttered on January 6. So, I think they're -- look, it's a sound strategy from a defense attorney. It's probably what I would do if I were defending him.

Despite the unprecedented nature of these charges, Donald Trump is still the leading candidate for the Republican nomination. He is polling ahead of his 2024 rivals, and his base and his supporters are very much with him.
