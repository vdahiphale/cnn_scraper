      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.With just days left to pay a $464 million bond, a self-proclaimed billionaire is asking his grassroots donors to help foot the bill. Former President Donald Trump reportedly in panic mode is issuing a fundraising appeal to his supporters in which he tells Democrats to, quote, keep your filthy hands off of Trump Tower. That's after the New York attorney general suggested he turn over his prized properties if he can't cover the judgment in his civil fraud case. Now, Letitia James is demanding that Trump explain to the appeals court why he can't find anyone to underwrite that bond. All raising the question why can't a man who constantly brags about his wealth pony up that payment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now here's the good news, I'm very rich. I started off with a million dollar loan. I built a net worth of over $10 billion. I would say that I'm worth more than $5 billion. I'm very rich. Hey, I'm rich. This is really taxing the rich by a very rich guy. The money you're talking about is a lot, but it's peanuts for me. I built a very big net worth. It's a lot of money, but I have fun. (END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA:  Now, even Trump's fundraising machine is struggling to keep up with his soaring legal bills. A new filing shows that last month, his leadership PAC spent more on legal expenses than it managed to raise. CNN's Kara Scannell joins us now from New York. Kara, the clock is ticking for Donald Trump. What options does he have at this point?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So, Donald Trump has said that he has tried to get bonds from 30 underwriters. No insurers will secure the bond for him. So, he can continue to try to see if he can find someone to step into that position.Also, he could look for someone who has a deep pocket who's willing to give him some money. But, you know, he also you can talk to banks and see if he can take out a mortgage on some of his properties. But, you know, Donald Trump has not been able to access the banking system from the largest banks in the world because most of them stopped doing business with him years ago. And another factor here is that part of the issue in this case is a question of what is the actual value of his properties. The judge found that he had inflated the value of those properties on financial statements. You know, these are all conditions and factors that a bank would consider in deciding whether to extend credit. And they might want to take steps and do additional due diligence to understand the value of a property. Of course, this is all within a really condensed time frame now with this being, you know, just the final four days that Trump has to come up with this money unless the appeals court steps in. And Trump could also sell a property, although that also does take some time. And he's pushing hard against that. He doesn't want to give up any of these properties, some of which his family has called their Mona Lisas. So, he is still fighting this very hard to try to get an appeals court to say he only has to post a fraction of the $464 million total bond that his family owes or get the appeals court to say he doesn't have to post any money until the appeal is over, which could be, you know, one or two years from now. You know, the attorney general's office has been pushing back on this. They are opposing it. You know, they're saying with the court they now want to officially respond in writing to Trump's new claims that he can't get a bond. And they want to make that argument to the court. You know, this is going to be a continuous back and forth up until we get to Monday, Jim.",

I mean, that was sort of his brand for running for president back in 2016. And now, all of a sudden, he's saying he doesn't have the money or he doesn't want to have to sell these properties.

If you want it delay it for years, they want to make sure the money will still be there at the end of the process. The real difference between Donald Trump and other people who are in this situation is that most people plan for this in advance. They sell properties in advance. They refinance if they really have the money. Donald Trump either doesn't have money or he just has not planned.",

They had to do short-term extension after short-term extension.That first short time extension led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy. So, this has been an incredibly messy process that has led this point. And they even bailed this massive $1.2 trillion bill to fund major federal agencies, more than 1,000 pages at length at about 3:00 in the morning this morning, and they need to pass it by 11.59 P.M. tomorrow night to avoid a government shutdown. That has caused a lot of anger within the ranks, because most members of Congress have not seen this. This is a cut between the leadership on both sides, the Appropriations Committees, as well as the White House. Now, the members have to try to pore over the details and vote on this. It is still expected to past, but there is a lot of grumbling, there's a of members, especially on the right side of Speaker Johnson's conference who believed that this deal was simply insufficient and they're also very critical of the process.

And, Jim, this is something you've never seen in the history of Congress, you've never seen in the history of any parliament across the world, where the minority party continuously provides the majority votes to keep government functioning. We've done this to pay our bills and lift the debt ceiling. We've done this every time we've come close to a shutdown.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, is expected to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress about the war in Gaza. What's your response to that?

As president, his daughter received 22 patents and trademarks from the Chinese government. His son-in-law was working on a $2 billion deal with the Saudi government right as he exited the White House. And, of course, the president owned and operated a hotel just across the street from the White House, where he took millions of dollars from foreign nationals who stayed at that hotel while he was president.

The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has said she will take steps to seize assets in this new filing. Trump's lawyers also pushed back on several suggestions made by the New York attorney general on Wednesday, including that Trump could get several underwriters to secure bonds totaling that judgment. Of course, we're going to stay on all of that as it develops. But in the meantime, some other breaking news to tell you about just happening this morning, we're following sources, they're telling us that the Department of Justice will file a blockbuster anti-trust lawsuit against Apple, this after years of allegations that Apple's app store policies have given an unfair advantage and hurt its rivals.

And this, of course, is the last main major tech giant to be sued by the Biden administration or the U.S. government since, you know, companies including Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon were all named in a House investigation about their alleged monopolistic behavior.

So, there are deep constitutional questions if both the vice president and the president could be from Florida. We remember back in the 2000 campaign, of course, Dick Cheney had to change his Texas registration to Wyoming, where he was actually from, well, he was born in Nebraska, so, he would not be in same state as George W. Bush.",
