But I guarantee you that Putin is now sitting there and saying OK, how do we get control over the situation? And he can use this situation to organize and justify a massive crackdown, and it wouldn't be unusual.We saw the same thing with Erdogan in Turkey where there was a coup attempt made against him. What did he do with that? He arrested everybody in sight. I mean, like, literally -- like, 50,000 people went to jail in Turkey -- people who he didn't trust. And I -- I'm almost certain that Putin will do that. And if he does do that -- if he -- if he takes this coup as his -- as a sort of impetus to even crack down further, then he may very well end up even with more control over the Russian situation than he had before. But it could also go the other way and that -- and that's why we're in this period of really dramatic uncertainty.",

Investigators accuse him of stabbing the students to death in an off-campus home in November. Kohberger has pleaded not guilty.

Quote, \"The FAA frankly failed us this weekend. It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position, and that put everyone behind the eight ball.\" Now, Kirby says he plans to meet with the FAA and the Department of Transportation to try to prevent this from happening again. The FAA, in response, has said they will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.",
