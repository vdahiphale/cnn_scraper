So, President Biden here who's going to do a ribbon cutting ceremony and give a speech at Ulster University here, and it's expected to focus on education and employment and jobs in the economy. And that is hugely important here because the Good Friday Agreement brought peace, but of course, everyone looked for the peace, dividend, the economic benefits and some of that has come. But the real -- when you talk to businesspeople here -- and a lot of people on the street -- they want to look forward and they want to look forward to that better economic environment.

He asks him for a hug and the Dalai Lama calls him on stage.

And just moments later the Dalai Lama says, quote, and suck my tongue, unquote. That's what he says to the child. Now this entire exchange between that minor and the Dalai Lama has led to furor among certain sections on social media that have gone ahead and condemned the actions of the Dalai Lama. What's interesting here, Bianca, is that this exchange is from February like you and I have just pointed out. But the apology comes today. Weeks later after the criticism the Dalai Lama has faced online from people who have actually been surprised and taken aback by the actions of the spiritual leader. Let me just read out the apology that has come out in the form of a statement from the Dalai Lama's office. It says: A video clip has been circulating that shows a recent meeting with a young boy asked -- when a young boy asked his Holiness the Dalai Lama if he could give him a hug. His Holiness wishes to apologize for the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused. His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras. He regrets the incident. So, clearly, from the statement what one can infer is that this was a way of teasing that young boy of playful conversation.
