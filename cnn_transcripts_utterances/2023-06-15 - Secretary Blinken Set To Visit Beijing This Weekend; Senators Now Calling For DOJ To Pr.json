Daniel Penny faces second-degree murder charges. Closing arguments set to begin today in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial. Federal prosecutors rested their case Wednesday as did the defense, which called no witnesses. President Biden set to announce today that Live Nation and Ticketmaster will show all fees upfront. It's an effort to minimize the frustration of fees adding up late in the checkout process. All right, feeling stressed at work? You are not alone. Gallup released its new state of the global workplace report on Tuesday. It found globally, 59 percent of employees surveyed say they are quiet quitting, meaning they're not engaged at work. Twenty-three percent say they are thriving at work -- that is engaged. And 18 percent are loud quitting. That's being actively disengaged and letting everybody know about it, I guess. Let's bring in Jessica Kriegel, chief scientist of workplace culture at Culture Partners. So glad to have you here, especially with all of this amazing new polling. The polling also showed that the U.S. and Canada have the second-most engaged workers, right, but also the most stressed workers, which I think kind of makes sense in the years after the pandemic. What do you make of it?",

A lot has been made about this.The PGA Tour shocking the world last week by announcing this partnership. LIV Golf, as many people know, is owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. And in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and other senior DOJ officials, Warren and Wyden argue that the merger will allow Saudi Arabia to sportswash its humans rights record, saying, \"The PGA-LIV deal would make a U.S. organization complicit and force American golfers and their fans to join this complicity in the Saudi regime's latest attempt to sanitize its abuses by pouring funds into major sports leagues.\" Now, the letter comes after Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal announced a permanent subcommittee on investigations had launched a probe into the deal, so more to come on this.

But he is looking at the core inflation and still concerned? RACHEL SIEGEL, ECONOMICS REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  He's looking at core inflation and still concerned about some of those sources of price increases that can be the most difficult to root out of the economy. Earlier this week we had the Consumer Price Index. And even though that isn't the main inflation gauge that the Fed pays attention to it really echoed this message that some of these sticky sources of inflation that don't have to do with really volatile categories like food or energy really are just now showing much ground. That's part of the reason the Fed expects to have to continue to raise rates this year.
