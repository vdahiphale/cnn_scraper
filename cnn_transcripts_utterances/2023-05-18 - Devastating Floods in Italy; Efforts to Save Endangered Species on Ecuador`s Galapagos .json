And rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety and rubber dinghies on flooded streets. More than 5000 people are under evacuation, according to the civil protection, the region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the river Po a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they are only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by 5 feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more, but it is still well below average. Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions from Venice, where the MOSE floodgates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily, where heavy storms down trees and flooded homes.

An Ecuadorian archipelago, the Galapagos Islands inspired the theory of evolution following Darwin`s trip there in 1835. The Galapagos Islands are known for their rich biodiversity and stunning wildlife with endangered species. But many of the species on the islands are now in need of protection. Our Lynda Kinkade reports on how Ecuador has started a new program called Debt-For-Nature to help fund conservation efforts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The small bird species native to Ecuador`s Galapagos Island chain is dwindling in number. On the island of Santa Cruz, just 15 adult pears remain. Yet scientists see a glimmer of hope in the past year, 12 new chicks were hatched, a sign that the species will live on to fight another day. For now, this tiny comeback is helping to spur efforts to protect the rich biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands. These islands are at a perilous crossroads. According to researchers, a million plants and animals worldwide are at risk of extinction from habitat destruction, rising carbon emissions and overfishing. As biodiversity declines worldwide, the Galapagos Islands are a litmus test. To protect this precious ecosystem, Ecuador announced a record setting deal to convert $1.6 billion of its debt into a loan it says would channel at least $12 million a year to conserving the Galapagos. JOSE ANTONIO DAVALOS, ECUADORIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER (through translator): Not only will it allow us to protect 2500 marine species, of which 38 are migratory, but it will also allow us to move towards a sustainable fishery.",

ELIZABETH SALINAS, TRADER (through translator): It seems to me that we must help maintain the flora and fauna and thus attract tourism, which is what keeps the country alive.",

The audio is then sped up and edited so we can hear it. Researchers are unsure why plants make these sounds, but we do know that plants can detect certain sounds as well.",
