So, national GOP frontrunners who won Iowa and then lost New Hampshire, which perhaps could happen to Donald Trump, Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000. Both of them won the nomination. So, Nikki Haley has a long hill to climb. She'll have to do something historic. But the fact is, at this point, she's in a better position certainly than she was a month or two months ago.",

And I think it's important to note, she's still down by a lot of points in the state where she's targeting as a kind of must-win to bounce up in and have a real shot here. So, this is my question. The number of Republican people -- Republicans I heard from yesterday, when the CBS poll came out, saying, see, told you, this is happening, it's moving, this is real. Is it real?",

I think Harry's really right, that the reason we see this movement in New Hampshire is because it's a nice kind of connection between Haley's kind of platform and what we see in terms of a state that has a history of moderation, a history of independence.But to that - to your kind of point about the broader point here, the same things that make Nikki Haley more acceptable to that slice of the party makes it harder for her to coalesce the rest of the Republican Party. And when we look at Iowa as the state that's going to, obviously, go before, we see the challenges really laid out bare there. You know, I was at a Nikki Haley debate watch party and you hear people talk about her stances on abortion, or her ability to bring in Democrats and independents to the party, as why she'll be a good general election candidate. In Iowa, those are the same things a lot of those evangelical voters are holding against her. And even the people who don't want Trump are preferring other options, mainly a Ron DeSantis, partially because there's a mismatch between the type of things that make someone electable to moderates and the way that Donald Trump has changed the party, so that a lot of those people view those same qualities as even part of Nikki Haley's problem, as viewing her as somewhat inauthentic.",

The question would be is, what happens next, right, because then you turn to Nevada, then you turn to South Carolina, and those are places that still have kind of Donald Trump written all over for it.So, you know, New Hampshire has to be a starting point, but it not only -- but it can - but it can't just be that because where we -- there's a lot of a higher ceiling for Donald Trump when we look at those kind of other states and where it's going. And you really -- it's really difficult to see that for the Haleys of the world. I mean when the kind of - when Americans for Prosperity, the kind of Koch unit comes and backs her on this front, that gives her a much- needed boost for the race in the short-term. But those are the exact kind of people who a lot of the grassroots members of the Republican Party have oriented to revolt against.

And this is how Donald Trump has really taken over Republicans.I think it's really underrated fact of his 2024 campaign. There are loyalists and kind of state party positions.

We've only seen, I think, one or two documented suicide attacks so far. So, again, the most difficult context imaginable, and yet they have not yet, by any means, destroyed Hamas. The major leaders are still at large. They're still pursuing them.
