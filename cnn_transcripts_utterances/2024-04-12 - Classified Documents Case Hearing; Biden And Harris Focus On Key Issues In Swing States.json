So we'll see what the judge does. We're not expecting a ruling today, but every time there's a hearing before Judge Eileen Cannon in Florida, it's important and, of course, have to mention, still no trial date in this Mar-a-Lago documents case.

At this stage of the proceedings, the motion to dismiss stage, you have to assume that all of the factual allegations in the indictment are proven, are true. So the judge's only question really is, if the indictment is, you know, if they prove what is said in the indictment, is there a legal reason why that doesn't constitute the violation of the statute at issue. And the indictment alleges that they had reason to know there was an investigation going on, that they moved these boxes at Trump's behest, and that that was with the intent of obstructing or in some way impeding this investigation that they knew was going on.That Evan Corcoran was about to search through these boxes looking for responsive documents to a subpoena. So there's really nowhere to go for Judge Cannon other than to deny this motion. What I'm watching for is whether she does it swiftly or whether she delays. That's been an ongoing thing with Judge Cannon to delay, delay, delay, and not set a trial date, as you were just speaking to Caitlin about. So I'm looking really not so much for the answer, but for how long it takes to get there.",

This could be the only criminal case against Trump that actually goes to trial before the presidential election. Trump's lawyers have called it politically motivated. They've denied any wrongdoing on his part. Bragg had campaigned for Manhattan DA on his experience taking on Trump.

He is the Republican in the House who, stick with me here, brought up a Democratic-authored bill in the House, in an attempt to repeal that 1864-era abortion ban before his fellow Republicans scuttled his attempt. Sir, thank you for taking time to be with us today. I do wonder, have you talked to Representative Livingston, who led the effort to put the House into recess?MATT GRESS, (R) ARIZONA STATE HOUSE: I have talked to him, and I think that the feeling among him and many others in the Republican caucus is that they wanted time to kind of process, you know, what this bill means in terms of the legal implications. You know, the ruling happened 24 hours prior to us convening in session. So I think lawmakers wanted a little bit more time to consider it. In my personal view, I think that we need to repeal the territorial law as quickly as possible, because I don't believe that women or doctors should be locked up for abortions. That's what the territorial law does.",

So those conversations continue to happen and in the legislative process, it's continuing to reach out and talk to members and walk through any of their concerns.

There is, as you know, already expected to be one, which I know that you have some issues with. But he's saying, basically, Governor Katie Hobbs is not going to sign into law something similar to the now-repealed 15-week ban that was passed in 2022. Talk to us a little bit about whether you'd like to see an alternative to the initiative that we already know is in the works because of that mental health exception, and why in particular you have an issue with that.",
