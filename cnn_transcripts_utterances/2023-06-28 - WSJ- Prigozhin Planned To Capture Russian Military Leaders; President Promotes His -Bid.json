A European intelligence official I've spoken to says that they're aware of hints that there may have been prior knowledge amongst the Russian security or military establishment that perhaps people knew, perhaps they kept it to themselves, didn't pass it on, wondering if it would indeed succeed and there may be some people who are looking for the dent in Putin's prestige that this essentially generated.But it is still early. That official said there's still a lot of fog around these matters. And Wall Street Journal's reporting talks about part of this plan being to capture the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Ukrainian Chief of Staff, Valery Gerasimov, as part of an opening phase of this plan. And indeed, we've also heard from the National Guard head, Viktor Zolotov, saying that there were leaks from the Prigozhin camp ahead of this mutiny. All of this adds to the possibility that because we know Sergei Shoigu was in the southern city of Rostov, that Prigozhin advanced upon, they may have hoped to try and capture him. We know according to Prigozhin that Shoigu fled that city, he says, as a coward \"on the late parts of Friday.\" So these things beginning to fit together, perhaps, but no evidence in the Wall Street Journal reports or that I've heard of this specific plot to capture. But frankly, if they're going to take down the Putin administration, detaining some key officials as sort of byproduct, Boris?",

So that's not to say that the Ukrainians or that others couldn't try to spin the situation to increase the problems that are in Moscow. But if this reporting is accurate, I think we're going to see more reporting coming out, outlining what actually happened over the coming weeks. It does sort of validate what I had thought previously, which is that Prigozhin didn't just wake up in the morning and say, I'm going to head to Moscow and head north on the M4. He must have at least had, one would imagine, tried to obtain a wink and a nod from key people inside the Kremlin to say, look, at least we'll look the other way.

I think Putin is now weaker than he's been at any time in his career there, if you can it that. But yes, he may indeed push back and try to identify who was doing what, during that coup attempt. The FSB, the Internal Security Service which has primary responsibility has a very busy couple of weeks and months ahead as they begin to sort this out. But also keep in mind that in the western context - so we don't think of each other as usually trying to manipulate and try to find out whose side people are on. In Russia, that is - that's almost at the genetic level that happens. So yes, there's going to be a lot of testing and a lot of trying to figure out who's supporting who.

He touted the significant progress, but he said there's more work to be done.

So they're trying to brand it to kind of remind people of everything that he's done. There was no new policy here today at all. They're just trying to remind people of the infrastructure law, the broadband that comes with that, the bridges, other things you'll see.

Because usually, history will show that how people feel about the economy going into the summer before the general election, that is sort of what their views are.But I'm actually struck to the minimal degree that I hear voters talking about the economy as much as social issues. That's one of the things that's really driving the Republican campaign. So as the economy continues to slightly improve, inflation sort of stays down. Unemployment is low, the stock market is up. The Republican campaign is driven by something else. Of course, during a general election campaign, the economy will be front and center. But the White House is trying to make the bet that there will not be a recession next year, still an open question, and that prices will continue to come down.

One of the worst places I could find in the country right now is Granger Township in - around Cleveland, Cuyahoga Falls, 328 parts per million is your number right now. That is certainly hazardous for you to be breathing out there.  And I had one of those little meters last time we did this. And the meter here in Atlanta was only 80. The number was 80 parts per million outside, but it was six on the inside. So a 12 fold better air quality on the inside than on the outside. That's why they say stay inside if you absolutely can.

I'm going to move this ahead until tomorrow. You'll notice some of the orange begins to go away, but we're still left with all of the yellow here. It begins to mix around again and we see some thunderstorms in the mix on the west side. Those thunderstorms will absorb some of those smoke particles and rain them out, that's helpful.
