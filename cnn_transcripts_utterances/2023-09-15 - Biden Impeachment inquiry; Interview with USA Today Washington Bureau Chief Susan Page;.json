Look at this, historically well was how the Democrats did. You very rarely see that the president's party gained seats in the House in midterm. It's only happened less than times in the last century and a half. And you this, Democrats, in fact, gained five seats. And in the Senate, there's no change. There was a backlash and I think that's what Republicans are worried about.Was this ball sort of gets rolling down the hill? If in fact there's a backlash against them, we do see that often times or at least this one, the Democrats were able to benefit from that and I think a lot of Republicans are saying, well, Joe Biden is unpopular as it is, why, perhaps, throw in another variable, because if you do, you don't know what might necessarily happen.",

And Susan, you were actually at an event with Bill Clinton in 1998 as this whole impeachment thing was happening. What was his reaction to it, and what can be learned from that apply to now? SUSAN PAGE, WASHING TO BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY:  Well, inexplicably, my husband I were invited to a White House dinner two days after the midterms in 1998. And I was seated next to Bill Clinton, and I think the reason I was seated, although there were much more interesting and intelligent people at this dinner was because he wanted to talk about politics. He was delighted and surprised by the findings -- by the outcome of those midterm election. It was the first time in decades that in a midterm election, the president's party had gained seats in the House. He thought this would prompt Republicans to pullback on following through with impeachment in the impeachment trial. Of course, they went ahead.

In this case, the permanent subcommittee on investigations for the DHS which usually keeps these investigations under wraps. But given the gravity of this, it is making this investigation into the Coast Guard public.Now, CNN first reported a Coast Guard investigation that substantiated dozens of rapes at the Coast Guard Academy was kept hidden for years. It was dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, and it found some of the accused had moved into top roles at the Coast Guard and other military branches or even retired with full pensions and benefits. So, that was what we found and we reported over the summer. Victims were discouraged from pursuing the allegations. They still had to go back to class and work with the person who allegedly assaulted them. Some victims ended up dropping out of the academy. The assault, the investigation was never reported to Congress or made public until CNN started asking questions. And now as we're seeing, the Senate wants answers. So, they released a letter and this letter sent to the head of the Coast Guard. Senator Richard Blumenthal cited CNN's reporting and said, \"The leaders who oversaw or perhaps created the environment where a misconduct occurred and did nothing must be held accountable.\" He goes on to say, the public deserves to know why so many reported cases of sexual assault and harassment were allowed to go uninvestigated for so many. Senator Blumenthal told us this was the most shameful incident of a cover-up of sexual assault that he's ever seen in the U.S. Military. And the letter is asking for a long list of documents from the Coast Guard, including information on every sexual assault at the academy from 2006 to present. Kate.",
