And Israeli official tells CNN that in 17 hours in Israel, the truce between Israel and Hamas will take effect. It would involve a four-day pause in fighting, during which initial 50 hostages taken by Hamas six weeks ago would be freed. And a number of Palestinian prisoners would also be released from Israeli jails. The deal was approved by Israel last night. The delay is to allow Israeli judges to review  potential legal challenges. And then today we saw fresh explosions in Gaza and Israel's prime minister says that the agreement does not mean the war is over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator):  And I would like to make it clear here again, the war continues. The war will continue until we achieve all of our goals to eliminate Hamas, to return all our hostages, to ensure that the day after Hamas, Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel.

It provides mostly adequate protections to children. Palestinian children, on the other hand, are arrested for the very same offenses -- throwing stones, writing graffiti -- are tried under a draconian military system. That allows soldiers to arrest them in the middle of the night using unnecessary force, terrifying them and their families, without access to parents or a lawyer during interrogation. And many children confess and take a plea deal because the maximum sentence that they could get for the crimes that they are accused of is actually shorter than the amount of time they spent in pretrial detention. And so I'm glad some of the children will be able to come home. I also would hope that there would be massive changes in that system, because it is not delivering justice to Palestinian children.",

I mean I think the broader point here is that, since October 7th, what we have seen is just a complete deterioration of very basic principles of protecting civilians, of keeping them out of the fight.

We have been witnessing over the last several hours as there have been numerous explosions, large scale plumes of smoke and illumination rounds being fired into the Gaza Strip. In fact, just moments ago, we had some flares ongoing. You can see in some of the footage earlier in the day, this is very much still an active war zone, in which the Israeli military is continuing to operate and will likely continue to operate right up until that pause in hostilities takes effect. It is scheduled to happen at 10 am local time tomorrow. What the Israeli prime minister has also made clear -- and I think you just saw a pretty large explosion happening right behind me -- what the Israeli prime minister has also made clear is that this pause in hostilities is simply that. It is not a cease-fire and Israel's military will resume its military operation, its campaign to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip after the pause in hostilities ends. I've also been speaking with Israeli officials over the last 24 hours, who have made it very clear that this initial release of 50 hostages in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting could simply be the beginning, that they intend to get all of the hostages back. And if Hamas chooses to release 10 additional hostages after that, they could get an additional day of pause in hostilities in exchange for those 10 and that could continue for some days. But all of that, of course, depends on the ability of both parties to maintain that pause in the fighting, the mechanisms for the release of the hostages, for all of that to go smoothly.

We also asked about the fact that the military, the soldiers who have been taken hostage, are not included in this. He hopes for a wider deal going forward. We know that Hamas will treat those soldiers as strategic assets, as leverage in any negotiations going forward. And I think it would be fair to say, do not expect to see soldiers released at any time soon. But certainly in principle, on the hostage file, the negotiators here in Hamas have written a deal, which has now been agreed upon by both sides, which should effect the release of all those civilian hostages who are being held, the women and children in the first instance. But hopefully that will be expanded in Gaza by Hamas. And then on the Palestinian front, the women and children who are not high-risk prisoners as far as the Israelis are concerned. We talked this time yesterday about a deal is not a deal until the deal is done. That deal is done now. Whether this deal will hold, the mediators explained to me just how difficult things have been with the escalation in violence. I asked him specifically whether the raid, the Israeli raid on Al-Shifa Hospital, which lasted a week, which ended ostensibly on Monday this week, whether that is a spanner in the works. He said look, any escalation in this conflict makes the conversations, the negotiations, the talks so much more difficult.

Anna Stewart joins me on this. The power of people, in this case -- you know, I was thinking to myself earlier after we chatted, I wonder if ChatGPT was consulted on any of this by the board?

It's a mix of fresh ideas and a little bit of chaos. But Sam knows the drill at OpenAI, so he might just steady the ship and keep things on track.\" How all this plays out, though?
