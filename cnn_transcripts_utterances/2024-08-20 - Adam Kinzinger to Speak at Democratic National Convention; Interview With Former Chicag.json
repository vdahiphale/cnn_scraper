So the idea that there is some coup under way is just -- it goes to show to me, Jim, just a real desperation by Donald Trump and how he's trying to get his footing.

All they talk about is, World War III is coming, it's on the horizon. They have been saying that for six years now. And a smaller government. All they want to do is expand it and divide the country and step on people. And Donald Trump constantly punches down and not across or up. He's just constantly a small man pretending to be big. And so I think the party would have to change. I'm going to hold on to the title. I'm not letting them kick me out of the party, but I will also say that this can't go on forever. If this party continues to embrace nationalism, continues to embrace division and anger and hate and the past, then there might be a day when I finally say, OK, I'm gone. But, no, I spent 12 years as a Republican congressman. They're not going to win that easily.",
