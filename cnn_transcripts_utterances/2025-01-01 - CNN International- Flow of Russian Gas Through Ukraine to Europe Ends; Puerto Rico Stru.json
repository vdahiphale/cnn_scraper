You're looking at live pictures there over the strip in Vegas, Nevada, where the clock has just struck midnight and the skies are lighting up.We also want to show you live pictures of New Year celebrations at the Seattle Space Needle that's in Washington State, of course, glorious scenes from the top of that iconic structure. And in California here's the scene over San Francisco Bay. Cities around the globe have been marking the New Year with parties for nearly an entire day now, the skies above Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong were lit up with fireworks launched from barges with an impressive laser light show there in the background. Meanwhile, the famous Kiss Cam came out in New York as Times Square attendees took part in this New Year's tradition. London -- was center stage as fireworks illuminated the skies here in the UK, likewise, in Dubai, the Burj Khalifa was the main attraction there for a spectacular projection show with fireworks stepping up that wow factor. But we also have some news today, coming into a decades old deal that brought Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine coming to an end. The contract expired today. Ukraine's government and Russia state run export a gas problem confirmed deliveries have indeed stopped. European countries have turned instead to the U.S., Qatar and Norway for liquefied natural gas. It will be more expensive, and analysts predict the market impact on Europe will be pretty minimal overall. They don't expect a repeat of the 2022 EU gas rally. Russia stands to lose $5 billion in annual sales, and Ukraine will be out of pocket by about 800 million a year in transit fees. Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, a not so festive and bright lead up to the New Year, a critical failure in the island's power grid caused a massive black out at least well, at one point, nearly 90 percent of customers were without power on New Year's Day. Luma Energy, the Canadian American power company that took over management from the government in 2021 still investigating the exact cause of that outage. CNN Espanol spoke with residents who were left with no choice but to deal with the unreliable power system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Luma Energy, which supplies power to Puerto Rico, said that crews would try to get the power grid back on in phases, and that could take anywhere between 24 to 48 hours. As of one o'clock on Tuesday, about 3 percent of customers out of the 1.3 million users impacted had their power restored.The International Airport in San Juan and hospitals around the island are running on power generators. Now power outages have long been a running source of frustration on the island since the collapse of the power grid in 2017 after Hurricane Maria. Luma and a second private company have long come under criticism for failing to improve the electric system there. Now, in a statement, Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Pierluisi said, quote, we are demanding answers and solutions from both Luma and Genera, who must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the island. Luma said that an issue with a faulty underground line was to blame. Carlos Suarez, CNN, Miami.",

They'll soon be able to hear the last moments recorded on the cockpit from the voice recorder there, but the flight data recorder is posing bigger issues. It was damaged in the crash and will be sent to the U.S. for analysis. We're going to turn to the Middle East now, where the U.S. military says American forces carried out new attacks on Yemen's Houthi rebels. The U.S. Central Command says it launched multiple precision strikes over the past two days against Houthi targets that house missiles and drones used in recent attacks against the U.S. in the Red Sea. Washington says the strikes were meant to deter Houthi threats to America's partners and the trade ships that passed through the region vital to the global economy. A Houthi spokesperson says Yemen will continue to defend itself against attacks. Meanwhile, France has carried out its first air strikes on ISIS sites in Syria since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad's Regime.

Northern Gaza's last remain -- remaining major hospital is now out of service after Israeli forces raid it on Friday and arrested its director.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY LAURENCE, SPOKESPERSON, OFFICE OF THE U.N. HIGH COMMISSION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The protection of hospitals during warfare is paramount and must be respected by all sides at all times. In essence, if the relentless bombing and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza were not enough, the one sanctuary where Palestinians should have felt safe, in fact, became a death trap. Under circumstance, certain circumstances that deliberate destruction of health care facilities may amount to a form of collective punishment, which is also a war crime. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

GUPTA: Genetically edited pigs designed by scientists to be compatible with the human body, reducing the possibility of rejection. Scientists have started to make progress testing this type of organ transplant. It's known as xenotransplantation. They're doing this into patients who have no other alternatives. As temperatures around the world keep climbing, it's taking a clear toll on our health testing the limits even of human survivability. This year, people hiking, attending concerts, just being in their own homes, they have died from heat. In fact, heat is the deadliest type of extreme weather, and climate change is making those heat waves longer and more severe. Heat also means warmer oceans, leading to these super charge hurricanes like the ones that we saw this year, and that comes with their own health consequences as well. Imagine using a computer by only using your mind. That's just the beginning of what brain computer interface, or BCI technology combined with artificial intelligence is now hoping to do companies like Synchrony and Elon Musk's Neuralink. They have begun implanting BCI devices into people's brains to help people who are losing motor function still be able to perform daily tasks. Earlier this year, I met Mark. He's an ALS patient who has mostly lost the ability to use his arms, and we saw first-hand how Synchron Stentrode device helped send messages on his computer and even play a game like Pong.

It's so, secret that diet plays a major role in our health. And while we know the benefits of healthy food, the harms of ultra processed food are now coming into clear focus. Ultra processed foods make up nearly 70 percent of our country's food supply. Numerous studies have found that consuming higher amounts of these foods raises the risk of obesity, but also the development of chronic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes, depression. It probably even shortens life span. Researchers are now trying to figure out if ultra process ingredients are all created equal.
