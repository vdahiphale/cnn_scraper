So, we're trying to figure out, as I mentioned, if it's a weather issue, or if it's a technical issue that they are dealing with at this point.But, as I mentioned, as we've been monitoring this for the last 30 minutes, SpaceX officials have been saying everything was on track, that there were no issues. They have been going through the process of loading 10 million pounds of liquid methane and liquid oxygen into the heavy booster, which is the bottom part of the rocket, and then the spacecraft rocket itself was all - was almost -- was already done as well. And they were also going through the process of cooling the entire system down. And all of that started happening about three minutes -- t minus three minutes to this launch. So, they've been saying that everything was on track. But here, just about 40 seconds away from the launch is when they put it on hold. And, John, we continue to kind of wait and see if there's any other indication -- I'm not hearing anything right now. So, I would imagine they're in the process of gathering that and seeing if we can hear any other update to what the issues is with this morning's rocket launch.",

I think they said that final pressurization was a little low is what I think I heard him say, and that the second stage they're working on doing some purging.For more on what that is going to mean, I'm going to bring Miles O'Brien back in. Miles, they just said that they can hold for 15 minutes and still be within the window and lift off.  We'll jump in as they give us updates, but what do you hear in this? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: Well, in this business you have to be able to operate under pressure, shall we say. And that's quite literal. It's -- you know, if you'll recall, it's scrubbed a few days ago, for lack of backfill kind of pressure. Imagine like when you're drinking water out of a plastic water bottle and you kind of - it crinkles if you don't get air back in it. Well, you don't want a rocket to crinkle. And so what they do is they - they take the gaseous methane and oxygen and kind of pump it back in the tanks so it doesn't crinkle. So, in this case, they had to fully pressurize all these fuel lines for 33 rockets. And it took a little longer than they expected. And so they went into a hold for now. They've got in total a 62 minute window. So, we've got some more time here to play around. As you can see, as that - you see that -- what appears to be steam venting off the rocket.",

You could feel it in your -- in your chest and you were kind of shaking. That's how powerful it was. And it was -- it was really, really breathtaking. So, that was - and the crazy thing is, is like I - I think I knew that was going to happen, and it was still stunning to experience. And it was almost moving like in slow motion from our vantage point. I know it's not moving in slow motion, but from our vantage point it seemed very slow. And at one point I was wondering, is it -- like, is it really going to get up there? And so now that's kind of the experience. And the cheering here, we talked to one gentleman a couple days ago who had driven in from Georgia to be here for this week. You can almost tell he had like tears in his eyes as this was happening. And then we saw it kind of go off to the east, leaving this large cloud trail. And even from there you could still hear and feel the rumbling sound. And then it was that -- what the SpaceX officials describe as the unplanned disassembly, which is just a technical way of saying that it all went terribly wrong. You could hear the rumbling from that from our vantage point. And just so you know, we are five miles from the launch pad, and we are many more miles from where this rocket ship disassembled over the Gulf of Mexico. But, clearly, everybody here on the ground leaves here feeling like they've just witnessed one of the most historic events -- space travel events in their lifetime. Many people we've talked to here, guys, you know, they equate this to, you know, where they were when astronauts landed on the moon and orbited the moon for the -- for the first time. They view all of this kind of in those historic space travel terms. So, an unbelievable day to be able to witness this here this morning.",

There are 33 engines. And there were some dark holes in the bottom where you can sort of see the rocket going up. It is the largest, heaviest rocket that has ever been launched. And the reason why people were cheering is because it worked partially, but definitely, Ed, You had the situation where this was supposed to be reused, and that's a whole lot of money crashing down there in South Padre Island isn't it?",

      "sentences": "Well, yes, exactly. So, you know, this is unscrewed from a safety standpoint. Obviously, not ready to put humans on board this rocket. And it was at that three minute mark into the launch where the heavy booster, which is about 230 feet long, was supposed to separate from the Starship rocket. And then the Starship rocket was supposed to continue eastward around the planet, almost a full orbit, crashing into the Pacific Ocean around the state of Hawaii. That clearly hasn't happened. This wreckage is now somewhere in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico this morning.So, clearly, still not -- a lot of work left to be done. But I think when you -- from the pros and the experts that know much more about space travel and this kind of technical work, you know, they view this as a success. On Monday, and Sunday night, Elon Musk was talking about -- he had lowered expectations to the point where, you know, we thought we might be on the verge of seeing is spectacular epic fireworks show on the launch pad. That's what he says he was most concerned about is just some sort of technical mishap on the launch pad that would cause him to have to rebuild the entire launchpad, which is a costly and really kind of slows things down. But, so, I think, from SpaceX's perspective, clearing the launchpad, getting out over to the Gulf of Mexico, having it travel for as long as it did is probably considered a very remarkable achievement here this morning.",

And you saw the entire spacecraft in a way, Miles, doing these flips, but it's supposed to do some of those, but it's supposed to separate in the process?

So - and they - you know, the - these rapture engines are -- they can relight them. I believe they relit them a little bit. But clearly that that affects the stability of the rocket and maybe they couldn't, you know, they had enough loss of rocket motors that they had a stability problem. You know, when you're -- when you're trying to get 33 rocket engines to all work in perfect synchronicity, that's -- that's a lot of things that have to go right, not just electronically, but also just sheer plumbing. And pressurization, as we were talking about, is very important. And so this is, you know, this is exactly why they do these tests, to get the data they need to make it better the next time, presumably. So, you know, this is -- you know, Elon Musk has successfully set the bar at a good place, saying, hey, at least if the launch pad is intact, we'll call this a success. That's what I call defining -- putting the bar exactly where you want to put it, or maybe a little lower. But, you know, this will tell them a little bit more about how to make sure you lit 33 engines at the same time and keep them going. Now, whether it blew up because of some sort of aerodynamic stress on it as it tumbled, quite possible. Or if somebody actually pushed the self-destruct button or maybe some combination, we should find out pretty soon.",

Widespread flooding caused disruptions to operations of fuel terminals in Port Everglades. Officials are pleading that there is no need to panic.

But, yes, like you mentioned, according to Gas Buddy, about 60 percent still don't have fuel. I mean, look right behind me, you see those pumps, they are covered right now in a lot of the gas stations down here.Now the state, for its part, sent about half a million gallons of fuel down to southeast Florida. They even had law enforcement escorting some of those fuel tanks. I have seen them myself coming and distributing some of that supply. But as you mentioned, John, you know, part of the problem here is that Port Everglades, which is a petroleum terminal, was inundated last week, and that is what caused some of the delays in distribution. And as I have visited multiple stations over the last few days, I have seen the frustration, seen and heard it, because there's a lot of honking sometimes out here.
