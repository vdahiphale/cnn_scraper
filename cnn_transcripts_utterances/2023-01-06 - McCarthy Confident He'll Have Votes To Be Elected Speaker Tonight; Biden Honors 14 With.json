I'm Jake Tapper.It is day four of this protracted and dysfunctional standoff over the House speakership and for the first time this week, we are getting signals that we may, in fact, be nearing the finish line. Right now, the House is adjourned until 10:00 p.m. Eastern tonight. Just moments ago, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy confidently told CNN he will, will have the votes, to be elected speaker tonight. That prediction coming following a remarkable turnaround today for the Republican leader. McCarthy promised progress. He promised it Tuesday and he promised it Wednesday, promised it Thursday. Today, we finally saw it, even as he failed on his 13th ballot. Fifteen rebel holdouts today switched their votes in favor of McCarthy, giving him for the first time this whole week more votes than the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, but despite this break in the Republican resistance, six hardliners remain, Congress people Matt Gaetz, Bob Good, Andy Harris, Eli Crane, Matt Rosendale. Andy Harris is not actually one of them. They had the wrong -- Andy Harris is not one of them. It's a different individual. In any case, the six are keeping McCarthy two votes short of the magic number needing -- needed to realize his dream of clinching the speaker's gavel. Let's go straight to CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju live for us on Capitol Hill. Manu, McCarthy won over much of the Republican opposition today. He's still short of enough votes to win. How does he get the final two votes he needs?",

They are trying to figure out their final push here to lock down those couple of votes. I talked to Steve Scalise, who's the number two Republican on the wayinto that meeting asking about two individuals who are central to the effort, Eli Crane, who is a -- Eli Crane, who's an incoming Republican member from Arizona and also Matt Rosendale, who is a Republican from Montana. Both of them seen as essential to flipping here as McCarthy's push to get to 218. But there is a belief among McCarthy in particular that he has the votes. He told me yes, he has the votes. He said he will count the votes, he can count, he knows he's confident. I asked about these two members specifically, he would not comment about them, but they have been concerned about the politics of supporting McCarthy in their individual situations. One, Crane, potentially facing a prime challenger and in the next cycle as well as Rosendale himself eyeing a possible Senate run in 2024. All those issues need to be sorted out tonight. And also, the House is adjourned because they want two absent members who have attended to various medical family issues to return in time, Ken Buck, one of them from Colorado, flying back at 9:00 p.m. tonight. So they expect to have the votes by 10:00 p.m. So, the next several hours here, essential to locking down everything that they have been working over the last several days. And, Jake, this deal that has been cut in order to get the holdouts to flip today is still being finalized. It has not been publicly released. We have some sense of what it includes, including giving them more power, more say over the legislative process, some key committee assignments and one major issue, allowing -- ensuring that a debt ceiling increase, to avoid a national default, must be included, must include spending cuts. That is a demand that the hardliners have made. That is going to set up a huge fight with the White House and Senate Democrats in the New Year, a potential default fight that has never happened with the U.S. economy, but this is part of this agreement that was essentially was sealed in order to clinch McCarthy the speakership. So, that is a major issue that will play out in the months ahead. McCarthy now confident he will get there.",

But I think we're talking to them now about something that's more than that. I think there's honestly probably an element of pride in this, in the sense you have to give people an off ramp, you got to give them a way to save face and not humiliate them. I think a couple of them, maybe even more, are actually at the point where they'll say yes. I think that I can support Kevin.

Of course, everyone understand that makes more sense than being thrown a 2,000 page bill and told to vote on it in 15 minutes.

I just think I accept it's going to be difficult to be the speaker of the House with the four- seat majority, and particularly with the Republican majority. I mean, you have to give Nancy Pelosi credit, one way or another she kept her caucus in line. I don't know how she did it.I mean, I genuinely have sat down with some of my Democratic colleagues in the last few days and asked how did she do it? For whatever reason, Republicans are more political entrepreneurs, and more willing to take a stand against their own party, against their own leadership, and I think we all recognize that. We saw that under John Boehner and we saw that under Paul Ryan, and it's certainly going to be true under Kevin McCarthy. The question you have though, Jake, have we weakened the speakership to the point where what is an already difficult job is impossible and that's something many of us have worried about. I got to tell you, I don't think that we have. Honestly, take the one thing that people focused on or at least one of the things, is the motion to vacate the chair. Whether that's one individual or five, in a practical way, it hardly matters. If there's one person that feels that way, there's almost certainly five. So, for Kevin to say I won't have five required, we'll go down to one, it was a bit of a concession, but probable doesn't make much difference. The important considerations are, does everyone in the conference feel like we were all treated fairly or do they feel like maybe some of these holdouts were treated with preference, and that's the one thing that Kevin has had had to be very careful of and hasn't stepped over that line. Because if he would have stepped over the line and made it appear like some of these individuals were given preferential treatment or preferential assignments that would have made others angry. Fortunately, I don't think that he's done that.",

Some might never be able to cast a vote for Kevin McCarthy.

These men have known nearly a year of grinding war, with no end in sight. This service, led by the head of the orthodox church of Ukraine metropolitan, to pray for Ukraine's victory, this Christmas more than most, they need all the prayers they can get. Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked Christianity when he said he would go along with an appeal for a Christmas cease-fire from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, a man openly supportive of the invasion. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, rejected the ceasefire declaration as pure deception. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Now they want to use Christmas as a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guys in Donbas and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized men closer to our positions.

Putin said the cease-fire will take place only on the front line, and unfortunately we have to expect missiles in the rest of the country. Midway through the prayer service, air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv and the rest of Ukraine. We don't trust their statements, the leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine says. The air raid sirens just went off during the service. They want to use the so-called cease-fire for their own reinforcement. We are aiming for peace and want a just peace, but this will come only when Ukraine wins. In rejecting Moscow's cease-fire, Russia's former president, Medvedev, accused Ukraine of rejecting the hand of Christian mercy. Can we say Russia's war against Ukraine is mercy? Any talks of mercy from the aggressor are nothing but a lie. In Ukraine, there is nothing Christian about Russia's bloody invasion. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on camera):  And, Jake, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed, who was in Kyiv just as the White House announced a new round of military aid which includes the Bradley fighting vehicle.
