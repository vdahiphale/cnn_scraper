      "sentences": "One for the history books tonight. Former Vice President Mike Pence testified today before the federal grand jury investigating the former president's action surrounding the January 6th riot and attempts to overturn the 2020 election.I'm John Berman in for Anderson. Just pause and listen to that, again. A former vice president just testified in an investigation about whether a president, hist running mate, illegally tried to overturn an election. So much has happened the last few years, it's easy to get numb to the mind-bending historical explosions taking place. It is the first time in modern history a vice president has been compelled to testify about the president he served beside. And add to that, he might run against Trump in 2024. It's also the first time that this vice president has testified under oath about the day where rioters were seeing yelling \"Hang Mike Pence\" at the Capitol, as well as perhaps personal interactions with Trump and the events leading up to that day. He previously declined to testify before the House Select Committee that investigated the riots. A source says Pence testified for more than five hours putting the investigation one step closer to a big decision for special counsel, Jack Smith, whether to charge the former president or others around him. Sara Murray joins us now with the latest. Sara, what do we know about the circumstances surrounding the testimony today and the blanks that the special counsel might wanted to fill in?",

You know, we know that Mike Pence has talked publicly about standing up to Donald Trump about not doing his bidding on January 6th. We know he wrote about it in his book, but this is the first time he is appearing. He is testifying under oath, and was poised to answer questions from prosecutors about his direct conversations with Donald Trump in the run up to January 6th. And you know, as you pointed out, this lasted for five hours. So, it gives you an indication of the painstaking detail that prosecutors likely wanted to get into with Pence perhaps a couple of things they heard from other witnesses, but also just events that were playing out between Pence and the former president that perhaps only he could speak to, only he could provide in firsthand detail.",

He, as you pointed out, was the target of many of the rioters who were chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence\" and prosecutors had to go into this knowing that it was going to be a fight to get his testimony. You know, we saw both Donald Trump, as well as Pence try to block this testimony unsuccessfully. Pence got a carve out where he would not have to answer questions about the time he was serving as president of the Senate. But in so many ways, this is a crucial witness and really setting the stage about what happened in the run up to January 6, and how you know, important and historic the aftermath was -- John.",

Donald Trump is not going to be going into the grand jury. They're not going to subpoena him. He's not going into the grand jury. So it's really all on Pence's own recollection and testimony about it. And I do have some questions about, frankly, just how forthcoming he will be. There is no tape of these conversations that we know of to keep him in check, and if we look at his public stance about Donald Trump and January 6th, Pence has not been willing to forcefully condemn Donald Trump. He has given us this wishy washy stuff, we don't see eye to eye, and so I think as a prosecutor, I'd be very wary of that when I question him.",

I think he is pretty, pretty fully in the witness category. The one other person that I would say, John, who is really the remaining outlier here that we're wondering (AUDIO GAP) yet, or when he will, is Mark Meadows and Meadows, you know, we could sit around and argue all night as to who could be the more significant witness, Pence or Meadows? There are good arguments on both sides. The bottom line is I'm sure Jack Smith wants to get Meadows in front of that grand jury. He won a motion in front of the court a week or so ago that blew out some of the obstacles to getting Meadows in there.

If prosecutors disagree, they can then take it to a judge and say, force him to answer this. So we'll learn I believe in the next couple of days whether he tried to invoke that. Also, just picking up on a point Andy made, Jack Smith deserves credit here, because he has aimed right at the top of the power structure in stark contrast to Merrick Garland who never went anywhere near subpoenaing and fighting for testimony from people like Mark Meadows, never mind, the vice president. And as a result of Jack Smith's much more aggressive approach, I think we're seeing this investigation proceed much more, much more quickly, much more aggressively in a much more directed way.",

Most of us don't think January 6th was a good thing. We may like the Trump policies, or some of them, but we don't want Trump, the character, and that is the lane he needs to run it.

Aiming at Russian positions, within 30 seconds the Ukrainian unit has moved away. It may be a precise operation, but the Russian response is not, slamming into the nearby town, edging closer to us. WALSH (on camera): Impossible to tell what the Russians are trying to hit, but another example of the intense bombardment their bid to stop the counteroffensive from starting. WALSH (voice over): It is ordinary civilians caught in the rising dust behind us who bear the brunt of Russia's frustrated rage. Along and around the brutalized towns where Ukraine says it may launch its attack, there are more signs it is underway lurking in the foliage than Ukraine has given publicly. That's because Ukraine has said nothing at all about when, where, or how it will attack. But among machine gun fire in the nearby trenches are drone operators hidden in the rubble. The detailed intimate picture they have of their enemy just two fields away is startling, watching and trying to kill each other every hour, they've noticed the Russians pulling back.

Obviously, the Ukrainian people, I think probably their morale could do with a lift over this particular summer in a city like this, always exposed to air sirens going off with a potential for airstrikes, would obviously desperately love to have the Russians pushed further back away from his territory.But Ukraine's friends have been training, planning a potential offensive in the summer, providing a lot of weaponry, which it seems 90 percent or so in play or already in the country. It is always unclear to know where exactly is what and what's been deployed. And I think there are concerns amongst analysts that we may over the year ahead possibly see electoral or economic changes in Ukraine's western allies that can't guarantee the same kind of support next year or even by winter, indeed. So there was some, I think, you know, urgency for a quick win in that regard. And Ukraine's enemies, well, Russia is at a pretty weak position right now. It struggled to take Bakhmut after expending endless resources there and its defenses are pretty dated, frankly, substantial trench networks defended with dragon's teeth, bits of concrete, whatever they can put in place. But the troops, they seem to have, a lot of them are newly recruited conscript, some professional soldiers perhaps, too, but I think many analysts think Moscow could do with a slow war of attrition here. They don't really have the sophistication or the weaponry to hold back a fast- moving combined attack by Ukraine. So I think they're hoping that Ukraine's move forwards will be slow, will be plodding and will end up, frankly, in a war of attrition along the very long frontline, certainly we're seeing here potentially, in the south of Ukraine. But really, Ukraine looking to push through and separate Crimea from the rest of occupied Ukraine. Many think that's the goal we're going to see. It just depends with what we're seeing so far here and the change of tempo, it is the prelude to this counteroffensive, beginning Ukraine, has been clear, it is not going to announce that start -- John.",

But you'll remember there are certain aspects of a trauma that will be seared in your brain forever. And it's a well-known phenomenon when it comes to sexual assault that there will be types of information that never varies, never changes, and is truly steered in your brain forever. But other things, like what year it was or the exact date, what other people were on the 6th floor, that was I know that was something that Joe Tacopina was trying to say. Oh, you didn't notice other people there. Why would she notice other people there, right? She was highly uber-focused, you know, highly-focused on her attacker.

What does he do? 2000, puts out a book, \"The America We Deserve.\" What does he call Social Security? He calls it a Ponzi scheme. And he says the answer to fix it is to privatize it and to raise the age all the way up to 70. Now that's one. Actually both of the positions that he's attacking Ron DeSantis for taking in 2012, when he first ran for Congress. Now let's fast forward now to 2011, 2012, Trump again is flirting with a run for the presidency. Around that same time, Paul Ryan is putting out that Ryan budget that Democrats are saying is going to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Trump was very, very critical of Ryan for putting this budget out, but he wasn't actually critical of the policy. He was critical that Ryan was putting it out before an election, before the midterm election, before the presidential election. And then when Ryan gets selected by Mitt Romney to be his running inmate, Trump actually praises Ryan pretty effusively on Medicare. Take a listen to what he told Sean Hannity in October of 2012.
