Oil prices fell as the meeting closed with no official agreement on cuts. Instead, some members individually announced voluntary cuts.Largest producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, agreed to extend its voluntary cost of 1 million barrels a day until the end of the first quarter of next year, saying it was doing so with the coordination with the Some OPEC Plus participating countries. All prices have slumped in recent months, a barrel of Brent costs more than $90 a barrel in September. But in the last month, it's been hovering around the $80 handle, largely on a weak global economic outlook heading into 2024. Now, this OPEC Plus meeting took place on day one of COP28, where dignitaries are discussing ways to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. The OPEC secretary general was keen to defend OPEC's place in a world that's transitioning away from oil, saying in a statement, one such myth is that the oil and renewables industries are competitors locked in a zero-sum game that the success of one represents a mortal threat to the other. Instead, he said, petroleum products are integral to creating renewable energy products, and OPEC members also invest in cleaner energy. Some more than others. And that is an issue that will no doubt be discussed at length at COP28. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
