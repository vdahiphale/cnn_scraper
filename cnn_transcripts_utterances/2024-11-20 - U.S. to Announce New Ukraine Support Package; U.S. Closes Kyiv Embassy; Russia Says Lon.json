Many warned to shelter in place because of the fear, they say, of an air assault. Very untypical, this kind of warning to Americans and their diplomats, to essentially take cover. And not something that Kyiv itself would find that abnormal. Look in the streets around me here. There's no signs of life really changing at all, despite the specific nature of this warning indeed. But it is a sign of the escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow since Ukraine has started using, in the last 48 hours, U.S.-made and supplied ATACMS, longer range missiles, to hit targets inside of Russia. Is it likely that there will be a direct attack on this building? Well, that would be an extraordinary escalatory move by Russia in just the closing months of the Biden administration. And I'm sure Vladimir Putin, frankly, would not want to take a move like that when he knows presidents like Donald Trump may engage in more favorable discussions with him. But other European embassies, we're hearing, are at least restricting their services, some closed to visitors. And it may be, I think, a reflection of how there's increased anxiety in all of NATO's ranks about what may follow the stark move by President Joe Biden to allow the ATACMS to be used. Overnight, we're hearing that Ukraine's defense intelligence says it's hit further targets inside of Russia. But still, it's Russia on the front foot across the eastern battle zone here, making incremental progress over the past months. But you do get a real sense here in Kyiv of the heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow because warnings like this are just so rare -- Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.

The president-elect, Donald Trump, has also said, without providing an example of how, that he could probably get Jimmy Lai released very quickly. It's a question of whether or not or how that could actually happen. I have to say, that as a longtime resident of Hong Kong, journalist based here, seeing Lai, hearing his words today and on Tuesday seeing 45 pro- democracy defendants, who were all sentenced to a combined total of some 245 years in prison, for their alleged national security crimes, it's almost like a blast from a former Hong Kong. A Hong Kong that did have newspapers and TV stations that reflected different political views, that criticized the authorities; a Hong Kong that used to have street protests and demonstrations. That's all gone over the course of the crackdown of the past four years, a crackdown that was denounced at the time by the U.S. government, by other Western Democracies as well. And that continues to be criticized by those governments. The responses from the Hong Kong government as well as the Chinese government are similar to four or five years ago. They call this criticism \"meddling\" in Hong Kong's internal affairs. The Chinese foreign ministry says this kind of criticism is basically blasphemy, that they're doing nothing more than upholding the rule of law and ensuring stability in this city. But you are right to raise the big question here. With an incoming Donald Trump, who has always held a very tough line against Beijing, could some of these questions rise up again in the coming years? And that's something we'll watch closely.",

But Lynda McMahon was a small business administrator. She was very successful in helping her husband, Vince McMahon, build the World Wrestling Entertainment company. Now the question is, does she have the background to go and to basically dismantle the Department of Education as Trump and his loyalists are saying they want to do. That remains to be seen. But what she has been doing, though, is that she has helped to lead a think tank that has been working on these issues in the leadup to the election in the event that Donald Trump was elected. So I think that she probably has her thumb on some of the things that they want to do. But we're talking about a major overhaul of an agency that, what they would do is to break it down, spread it across other government agencies and then take the main core and try to put it out in middle America.

But unfortunately, it was ended in that running field after she was just going out for a jog. And then we were told part of her clothing was also pulled up. So she was wearing running tights and her chest was exposed and it looked like the pants were pulled down as well. Sheila Ross is talking to Judge Haggard as we speak. We thought we would hear more from the defense but their testimony and their rebuttal to all this evidence really lasted less than half of a day. We really got no reason for Jose Ibarra to be in that area at the time or for some of the things they caught him on video doing afterwards, which was dumping stuff in a Dumpster, having those scratches, trying to evade people on the way out. And we looked at some of that surveillance video. So this case is quite damning in terms of the amount of evidence, in terms of the DNA and in terms of the physical evidence that they now have. It'll be interesting to see how long this judge, who's a no nonsense judge, by the way, takes to make this decision. But once again, this is not a jury trial.

Security Council Resolution 1701 that you just referenced calls for that, it's very interesting to actually go through the text that has been leaked now of the proposed -- the U.S. proposal. The enforcement mechanisms deal with Hezbollah south of the Litani. The mechanism that's been put in place, chaired by the U.S. and France, the U.N. also being part of that and the Lebanese armed forces, all are focused on Hezbollah pushing off the Israel border south of the Litani River. There are references to 1701 and the need for Hezbollah to disarm, the need for the Lebanese state to expand its authority. However, those are not part -- are not mentioned in the enforcement mechanism. So I think what we're talking about here is a deal that is mainly focused on south Lebanon in terms of realistic enforcement. And let's be honest, there's a 60-day enforcement period. That really is going to be the test. So even if we do see an agreement emerging from Tel Aviv today, that 60-day period is going to be crucial.

The close relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was once again on full display Tuesday as the president-elect traveled to Texas for the latest test flight by SpaceX, which Musk owns. But the coziness between the two is already raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest when it comes to Musk's businesses. Our Stephen Collinson argues that Trump's friendship with Musk bought him a lot of credibility. And he writes, quote, \"All of this helped improve Trump's standing in the election with young male voters, a constituency that Democrats are struggling to reach. Trump has rarely seemed as at ease or authentic as he does in these venues, talking about authority and with authority about wrestling, football and conspiracy theories.\" And Stephen joins me now. You know, we're watching these images, frankly, of Elon Musk and the president-elect. And you know, many people -- I mean, some people have even called it a sort of bromance that is playing out.

What the problem is, is that this potentially gives Musk the chance to get rid of regulations that are very important in governing the operations, for example, of SpaceX, of Tesla, of some of his internet businesses. And there are also conflicts that you see internationally. For example, Musk has certain kinds of relationships with the Chinese government, for example. But every sign we get is that the foreign policy apparatus of the Trump team is going to be very hostile to China. So the interests of Musk, the interests of the United States do not always coincide.

I mean, is Elon Musk have -- does he does he have the clout and the ability to sway Donald Trump on certain policy issues when it relates to tariffs and how that could ultimately hurt certain sectors in the U.S. economy?",

The new Commerce Secretary pick, who was unveiled on Tuesday, Howard Lutnick, has talked about tariffs. He's in favor of increasing tariffs. But he's also talked about them as a threat to try and change the behavior of U.S. trade adversaries. So I think there is a lot of negotiation and a lot of wiggle room in exactly how and what sectors these tariffs will be applied. But one question I think we should ask about Trump and Musk is, is the president-elect prepared to pay the political price for some of the things that Musk might want to happen? If he tries to water down tariffs, if Musk recommends the wholesale firing of thousands of government servants, that's going to boost unemployment in the United States. It could really provide complications to basic services that a lot of Trump's voters like. So there's a lot we don't know about exactly how effective and how deep this relationship will be in terms of policy.",

It came after U.S. President Joe Biden gave the OK for Ukraine to use U.S.-made longer-range weapons to strike deep inside of Russia. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says that Moscow views that as a new phase of war. Putin's decision sends a clear and threatening message to the West, including the newest members of NATO, Finland and Sweden. Both countries just sent out updated civil preparedness guides with instructions on how to survive in war. The Swedish guide advises people on what to do in the event of a nuclear, chemical or biological attack. Joining me now is Carl-Oskar Bohlin. He is Sweden's civil defense minister, who has recently visited Ukraine. Minister, good to have you with us. Thanks so much for joining us. You know, we're seeing images of this pamphlet on how to survive an expansion of war, perhaps nuclear threats and so forth. I want to start off with this. it's pretty significant. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the last time a pamphlet of this, like this was created, I think was, you know, during World War II. Tell me what it contains. And tell me about the timing and whether you see the probabilities increasing dramatically. CARL-OSKAR BOHLIN, SWEDISH CIVIL DEFENSE MINISTER:  Well, unfortunately, you are wrong. The last iteration of this folder was sent out back in 2018. So it's been six years ago. And the new edition is updated to reflect the dire security situation that we find ourselves in. And that is in no way done to intimidate people or to make people scared in any way but to give people the agency or he ability  to handle a crisis or, in the worst case scenario, an armed attack against Sweden.",

We saw that happening just yesterday. We're seeing various other policy shifts. And I wonder what you make of these moves by the United States, whether you think it's the right decision or whether you believe that this is creating a bigger environment for potential escalation.",

We should always remember what started this. This was started single handedly by Russia, trying to convert, subjugate an independent country to bend to Russia's will. And that is, of course, unlawful and unjust. And Russia thought that this would be a swift campaign that would be over  in three days. But we're now counting 1,001 day. And that is due to the stamina and the heroism of the Ukrainian people, who is now fighting for the rules-based world order. And I think it's our obligation to show them our relentless support in this fight.",
