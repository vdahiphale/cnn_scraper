For example, the recent major attack on Dnipro that killed almost 45 people, it was the services of internal ministry, emergency services that were the first to dig people out of the rebels and perform all the necessary steps to rescue them. So their Minister of Interior Affairs was the one who was almost always there to help his people to boost the morale, but also to control what was going on. And he did his job very well.
