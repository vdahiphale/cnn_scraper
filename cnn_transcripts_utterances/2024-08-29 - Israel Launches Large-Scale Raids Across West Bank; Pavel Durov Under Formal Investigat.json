The IDF says it has launched its largest operation in the occupied territory in months. Palestinian officials report at least 11 people have been killed in the raids, which included drones, helicopters, and bulldozers digging up the streets. Israel claims it's going after terrorist infrastructure and a systematic strategy by Iran of smuggling weapons and explosives into the West Bank. Palestinian officials condemned the operation, accusing Israel of blocking access to hospitals and obstructing ambulances. Well, more now from CNN International diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Before dawn, the biggest Israeli raid into the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began. October 7th. Air strikes near a cluster of Northern towns, Tulkarem, Jenin and Tubas. Backed by hundreds of troops and border police on the ground, the IDF says it's a counter terrorism operation, intended to thwart what they claim is a systematic strategy in Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank. Outside Jenin, a drone strike killing three men in a vehicle, whom the IDF claimed were terrorists, and seriously wounding another. Near Tubas, the IDF says another airstrike killed four terrorists. This resident caught in a blast. MASOUD NAAJA, TWO CHILDREN KILLED (through translator): In seconds, very fast. We felt like something came down on us from the sky, and there was an explosion. When I put my hand on my chest, it was all shrapnel and in blood. ROBERTSON (voice over): The IDF also arresting people and surrounding hospitals, including Jenin's main hospital, Ibn Sina, they said, to prevent terrorists using it as a base. Palestinian ambulances also appearing to be targeted by the IDF, amid claims staff were beaten. DR. YOUNIS AL KHATIB, DIRECTOR, PALESTINIAN RED CRESCENT IN THE WEST BANK (through translator): The occupation army is clearly targeting medical crews and ambulances. The latest example is today at the Al- Faraa refugee camp. The staff were forced to come out of the car, and the director of our center in Tubas was beaten. ROBERTSON (voice over): As they have done in previous West Bank raids, the IDF using armored diggers to rip up streets they claim searching for roadside bombs. In part, the IDF says the operation connected to this failed backpack bomb attack that only killed the bomber in Tel Aviv 10 days ago. It was the first of its kind in decades. Hamas, however, reacting to the raid, calling Palestinians to restart a suicide bombing campaign abandoned almost two decades ago, unclear how long the operation will last. But by late Wednesday, Palestinian official saying 10 people dead and more than 20 injured, making it one of the most deadly days in the West Bank since the Gaza war began October 7th.

He is one of the world's richest men. He is the founder of Telegram, which is one of the world's most popular social media platforms, particularly in the former Soviet Union, Europe, and to some extent in the United States as well. It's sort of prided itself Telegram has for its lack of moderation, compared to, for instance, Facebook or X, which are much more judicious in what they allow to be -- to be broadcast on their platform used for. But, you know, Telegram has been used by autocratic governments like Russia in the Middle East, China, the Ukrainian government uses it as well as the Russians as well. You have criminal gangs that use it. You have, you know, groups of pedophiles or neo-Nazis or anti-Semites. They use it to sort of propagate their sort of hate speech as well. But you also get libertarians, you know, people who are strong believers in the freedom of speech, who value Telegram as an essential asset in the sort of media landscape. And so, it's this extraordinary sort of coalition of, you know, sort of disparate groups that have come together in support of Pavel Durov, as he -- as he is sorts of scrutinized by the French authorities in this way. The Russians have been very outspoken, of course. He is a -- he is originally a Russian citizen, and they called this an attack on freedom of speech, which is, you know, ironic, given that there's been a huge crackdown in Russia on free media over the course of the past several, several years. But of course, it's about a much broader concept as well of, you know, the extent to which social media platforms should obey the laws, and should be held accountable, and their owners should be held accountable for the -- for the content that goes inside them, and that's something that the French authorities, now, with Pavel Durov, are currently exploring.

So, the fact that you see Kamala Harris, the vice president of the United States of America, and Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, kicking off a bus tour in Savannah, Georgia, which is Southeast Georgia, which is one of the fastest growing areas of our state, shows you that they believe that the rural votes are there. They believe that these rural voters in Southeast Georgia want to hear from her. They want to hear her economic message. They want to hear her message around affordability. And this is area that has really seen a lot of growth in manufacturing jobs, and a lot of that is due to the Biden-Harris administration sending federal money to this area. I think you also see them directly focused on HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities. They will talk about minority participation as far as entrepreneurship, and they will have a higher learning education message, because we have a great sort of group of schools that are HBCUs, but also four-year college state schools in the area as well.",

Brian Kemp, Rosemary, as you reported, came out right away on X and said, hey, leave my family, you know, out of your mouth when he talked about the First Lady Marty Kemp, sort of begging Trump to help him out with his campaign in 2018, which Brian Kemp went on to win that race. And so, for Governor Brian Kemp to come out and say, look, I'm going to put these personal attacks aside. And it's basically, I want, you know, a message around winning. And it's really sort of a, my team versus their team, sort of strategy. And Governor Brian Kemp has made it very clear that he wants to win. Only thing I would say is that Brian Kemp doesn't need Donald Trump, and say to Georgia, Donald Trump means Brian Kemp, and that's why you saw the Trump campaign come out right away, embrace this endorsement. Because previously, the governor and the first lady were very, very hesitant to say they were going to vote for Donald Trump.

Now, one of the only three U.S. companies valued at more than $3 trillion with a T. But some experts wonder how long reality can keep beating expectations.

So, that's just not enough to impress the market.So, after report, Nvidia shares traded lower. Let's bring up the number for you. With shares dipping down 6.9 percent after hours. Now, Nvidia is the A.I. chip giant. It accounts for around 70 percent for all A.I. chip sales. And as the tech giants build out their A.I. infrastructure, they have been relying on Nvidia, spending big on the company's processors that power A.I., and that includes generative A.I., of course, that's the underlying tech behind applications like ChatGPT. Look, Nvidia has been breaking in the billions, you know, with its unparalleled processors, but it's also facing a number of challenges. Let's show this graphic for you. These are sort of the headwinds that's up against. First off, production delays for its next generation Rockwell chips. Also, the potential for rising production costs. There is also antitrust concerns. You got U.S. regulators probing Nvidia and its business practices, not to mention rising competition.

The storm slammed the country's southernmost island with heavy rains, winds, and storm surge. Officials issued emergency warnings for flash flooding and landslides across most of the area. Authorities also warned of an imminent life threatening situation, and called on 57,000 more people to evacuate. Wind gusts of up to 185 kilometers per hour were reported east of where Shanshan came ashore.

MALEHASHIM MOHAMED, FARMER, SUDAN (through translator): We lost everything, and we could barely rescue our families. The water washed away our farms, vehicles, livestock, and crops. It's the worst water flows I've seen in my life. NEWTON (voice over): Locals are burying their neighbors as more than 100 people are found dead due to severe floods. According to government officials, flash floods in the country caused a dam in eastern Sudan burst. It swept through villages, destroying more than 12,000 homes. The U.N. says the death toll could still be higher. Many people are still missing under the rubble. ABU ALI AHMED, RESIDENT, ARBAAT, SUDAN (through translator): The situation is catastrophic to be honest. We have children, families, and elderly, and others that need continuous medication, and this is the fourth day. The water came on to them and destroyed all the villages, and we don't know the circumstances they are going through now. NEWTON (voice over): The aftermath of these floods could be more fatal still in Sudan, a country already plagued by civil war. A new independent report found that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Sudan since the start of the conflict in April 2023. The country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis. According to the U.N. more than half of the population faces acute hunger. The growing crisis affects the education of millions of children as well, with schools in Sudan either destroyed or shut down.

NEWTON (voice over): The arrival of aid, complicated by a civil war that continues to ravage the country. As peace talks in Switzerland, led by the U.S. and Egypt are ramping up, so too are diplomatic efforts to secure food and medicine. For the first time in six months, humanitarian aid resumed in Sudan's famine-threatened Darfur region. The convoy of food is a short but much needed relief to the thousands of people at the brink of this tragedy. Now, in the eastern part of the country, thousands are reeling with the aftermath of floods. People are cut off from the capital, Port Sudan, and many are searching for the bodies of their loved ones. Paula Newton, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We also have all of these other things happening too, urbanization, so people in closer conditions, maybe people living further and further also into areas that might be swampy, lot of water on the ground.There are so many reasons, including also, we have mosquitoes becoming resistant to the kinds of insecticides that are currently being used.
