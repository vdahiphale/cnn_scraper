      "sentences": "We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens.My administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis. And when Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners. This is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America. We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas. I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts. Because, as president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world. The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the \"USS Gerald R. Ford\" carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed. Let me say again to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation. I have one word. Don't. Don't. Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and U.K. to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response. This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region. We're also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America police departments have stepped up, security around centers of Jewish life. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks. This is a moment for the United States to come together, to grieve with those who are mourning. Let's be real clear. There is no place for hate in America. Not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. We reject, we reject. What we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil just as we've always done. That's what America stands for. You know, just over 50 years ago -- I was thinking about it this morning, talking to the secretary of state and the vice president in my office. Over 50 years ago, as a young Senator, I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected Senator. And I had a long, long trip, meeting with Golda Meir in her office, just before the Yom Kippur War. And I guess she could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced -- they were facing. We walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photos. She looked at me and -- all of a sudden said, \"Would you like to have a federal?\" And so I got up and followed her out. We're standing there silent looking at the press. She could tell, I guess, I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me. She said, \"Don't worry, Senator Biden. We have a secret rep here in Israel.\" My word is what she said. \"We have no place else to go. We have no place else to go.\" For 75 years, Israel has stood as the only guarantor of the security of Jewish people around the world. So the atrocities of the past could never happen again. And let there be no doubt. The United States has Israel's back. We will make sure the Jewish and Democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. It's as simple as that. These atrocities are sickening. We're with Israel. Let's make no mistake. Thank you.",

We heard a very, very staunch and solemn commitment by the U.S. to stand with its Israeli partners. We heard specifics about where those efforts may lie going forward. He talked about supplying more ammunition, more interceptors to keep those Iron Domes running well. He talked about collaborating closely with Israeli intelligence to try to do whatever can possibly be done to bring some of those hostages safely out of Gaza. Of course, he also said that there are, as we know, Americans among those being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. But I also think, Anderson, that this was a speech for Americans too. Right? And he talked about the importance of coming together, both sides of the aisle in Congress. There's no place for hate in America.

And there was also a warning to -- a pointed warning to Iran, without naming Iran, that anyone thinking of interfering in what's going to happen next, don't. So I think this is a message that we're going to see a tough Israeli ground incursion into Gaza. There may be civilian casualties.

Sir (sic) Mayor, I'm wondering what you thought of what you heard from President Biden. FLEUR HASSEN-NAHOUM, JERUSALEM DEPUTY MAYOR: Well, we're very, very pleased with this type of support. It's completely unequivocal. I think that President Biden has made clear what moral clarity is. And that is when you see a general genocidal regime that came into this country through a border that we have with them -- because people forget, Israel left Gaza in 2005. We left Gaza, and we pulled out 7,000 Jewish settlements from Gaza so that the Palestinians could start being autonomous, building their country. And this is what we did almost 20 years ago. Originally, it was ruled by Fatah. And then a year and a half later, Hamas came into power, elected into power. And they had a choice. They all had a choice. They could have turned the Gaza Strip into Dubai or they could have turned it into Beirut. And they chose to turn it into Beirut. Everybody knows that Hamas is the long arm of Iran, as is Hezbollah in the north. And the massacre and the incredibly cruel humanitarian, you know, disaster that's occurred over the last few days. Anderson, two hours ago, we got a report that the Israeli army found 40 decapitated babies. We're talking about ISIS here. We're talking about scenes that we saw in Afghanistan 10, 15 years ago. We saw the same thing. Boko Haram in Africa. This is what we're talking about. We're talking about people who have zero value for life. Not ours and not even their own.",

We just want to let you know we are monitoring a White House briefing that is set to begin soon.Jake Sullivan will be taking questions from reporters at the podium. We will be monitoring that and bring you highlights as they happen. In the meantime, President Biden delivered remarks just moments ago on the crisis in Israel, saying Congress must take urgent action to provide security funding for Israel, what he called a critical partner. Before anything gets passed in Congress, though, the House needs a new speaker. Republican Congressman Andy Barr, from Kentucky, is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And he joins us now. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. First, I want to get your reaction to the confirmation that we got from the president, at least 14 Americans killed in these attacks. American citizens, apparently, also among the hostages being held by Hamas. REP. ANDY BARR (R-KY): Yes, this is exactly why this is in the national security interest of the United States to stand with Israel in their fight against Islamic terrorism, against these Iranian terrorist proxies, Hamas. And others like Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which also threatens Israel at the time on their borders. Not only are Americans among the victims and among the hostages that Hamas has taken into Gaza, but the United States is also the target here. (CROSSTALK)",

We will work, hour by hour, both to determine whether we can account for any of those Americans or to confirm exactly what the number of Americans being held hostage.  And we will come back to you with that information as soon as we have it. As you know, very sadly and tragically, the number of dead has risen with each passing hour.
