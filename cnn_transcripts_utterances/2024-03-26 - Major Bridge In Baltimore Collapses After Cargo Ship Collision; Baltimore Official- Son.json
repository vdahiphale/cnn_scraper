So who knows what we're going to do? We have two other, like, two other funnels that connect the parts of the area to the water. This area of Eastern Baltimore County, again, is where Bethlehem Steel. There's a large center really called Trade Point Atlanta, and they have tremendous amount of people and development, and it's $1 billion project, and that would be impacted too. We'll work it out.",

And that's -- this is something that amazes me, bridges and that we haven't had more of these issues. But this we had everybody -- from what I see first, we had bay pilots there. We had everyone that we needed. We had a full ship. And then all of a sudden we lost control right before, and that's where this occurred. And thank God, it was at 1:30 in the morning.

The urgent search and rescue operation underway after a cargo ship slammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore overnight, causing it to collapse in the Patapsco River below it. Officials say six people are thought to still be in the water, and of course a person can only survive very sadly in those conditions for so long.So for more on that, meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins me now. Derek, what does 48 degree water do to a person?",

We can start to see our breathing rise rapidly. And we can lose consciousness very quickly.Hypothermia, cold shock sets in. It is a very dangerous water temperature to be succumb to. And just zooming in a little bit closer, you can see we've got the Chesapeake Bay to my east and the Patapsco River coming out of the Baltimore Harbor here. And this is right where the key bridge actually collapsed earlier this morning. So we are going on over 12 hours. So when we talk about human survivability within these types of water temperatures, you can see from this graph, 40 to 50 degree temperatures. That human survivability limit is roughly one to three hours before those physiological effects that I talked to you about a moment ago start to set in. Now, complicating the efforts not only below the water but also at the surface of the water and above for the search and rescue operations that are currently ongoing is this tidal swing that we have right now. This is an exaggerated, we have a full moon, spring tide, so we have coastal flood advisories dotting the Chesapeake Bay, the Delmarva Peninsula, for instance. You can see this wording here, dangerous rip currents. And this is just compounded by the fact that the Patapsco River is flowing out of the Baltimore Harbor. And we've got the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic coastal waters flowing out of this region as we approach low tide at 3:10 this afternoon, Eastern Standard Time, and then we'll see that reversal in the tides as we head towards a high tide peak later this evening. So that could make conditions difficult for the search and rescue operations of the boats, particularly on the surface of the water. Manu?",
