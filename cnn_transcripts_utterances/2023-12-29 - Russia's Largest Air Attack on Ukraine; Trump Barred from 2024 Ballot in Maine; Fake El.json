We've seen video of a man who had a really lucky escape in the northeastern city of Kharkiv that was struck by multiple surface. A fairly crude and rudimentary system really designed for taking down aircraft. President Zelensky, who was touring the front lines today, said that Russia had thrown pretty much every different type of armament it had.And I think that, you know, when you look at the map, Lviv in the west getting hit, Odessa in the south, cities in the centre of the country getting hit but then examine and take apart just how Russia perpetrated this attack. It began in the early hours overnight. The Ukrainians, say, first of all, there were 36 Russian drones, the shaheed drones. And this was something a pattern that they've seen before. The drones come in from the north they come in from the from the southeast. But then everything got mixed up. The Russians put up strategic bombers. They put up long-range bombers. They put up fighter jets in the air. So, there's always multiple, multiple bombs. And this is potential hostile enemy activity around Ukraine. And then Russia starts firing in the missiles, the hypersonic missiles coming from the fighter jets, the strategic bombers launching long range cruise missiles. And then these other strategic bombers, there were 18 of those. Together, they launched 90 cruise missiles, but they've been loitering in the air for hours just to kind of try to overrun, if you will, Ukraine's air defense capabilities. And of course, that is a potential weakness for Ukraine in the future. You know, can its air defense capabilities, which defend all the civilians in these major cities, can they continue to sustain that if they don't have the support from the West?",

A lot of our perception was colored by that fumbling effort at Kyiv in the first few days. They looked like idiots, bumbling idiots. But they're not. And they're adapting. They're building up their systems. And they have a plan. And we have to beat that plan. And it starts at the top with telling Mr. Putin, no more.And then it starts with the mobilization of the U.S. industrial base, putting that $60 billion of effort into Ukraine and taking off some of the handcuffs. So, we need to give them better intelligence. We need to give them better logistics support. We need to consider putting some American logisticians, contractors into Ukraine to help them repair Western equipment.

The Europeans will give some and it will falter and fail, and eventually there'll be a breakthrough on the ground. Ukrainian forces will suffer a significant defeat on the ground and basically it will collapse. At that point, then the the finger-pointing starts inside NATO. Did Germany do enough? Did France do enough? Did the United States really lead? And these four nations that are facing directly the Russians, the Baltic states, Romania, and especially Poland, will be looking to their own devices.And so it'll be the end of a 70-year era of American leadership in Europe. And this is why we have to reach American lawmakers and the American public and explain to them the enormous stakes that are riding on Ukraine's defense. They're not fighting just for themselves. They're fighting for democracy. They're fighting for America. They're fighting for all of our values. So, we've got to move forward. This is like 1915-16, 1939-40, when America stood by as Europe was at war. In both those cases, we intervened, but, only after there was tremendous suffering and almost too late. But we got there in time. There's no time to waste any longer. We need to pull American leadership together and demonstrate it more forcefully in the support of Ukraine.",

And there is still growing pressure on international aid agencies to get aid into the Gaza strip. The amount of aid crossing the border at this current point in time is simply a drop in the bucket in comparison to what is actually needed.But, of course, there is also mounting concern around the security situation facing these aid agencies. The U.N.'s own secretary general has previously accused Israel of placing massive obstacles in the way of aid agencies distributing that much-needed aid to civilians in Gaza. And now, of course, we are seeing more worrying developments. The U.N.'s own agency for Palestinian refugees on Friday reporting that a UN convoy of seven vehicles which they say were clearly labeled was reportedly fired at by Israeli troops as it made its way from northern Gaza into southern Gaza in a route designated by the Israeli military. Now no one is said to have been injured but the UN has reiterated that aid workers should never be a target. The is looking into the incident but of course this has raised concern over the security situation and brought into question the security guarantees that aid agencies and UN agencies alike have repeatedly sought from the Israeli military and of course the need to get aid into Gaza is growing more desperate by the day. Just on Friday we have seen that dramatic video circulating showing desperate crowds clamoring around aid trucks desperate to grab whatever food aid has made it into the Gaza. And of course, as we know the UN has reported that some 2.2 million people in Gaza are now facing an acute hunger crisis with the imminent risk of famine and of course we are also seeing a massive displacement crisis inside Gaza. Some 150,000 people according to the UN simply have nowhere to go following Israel's evacuation orders targeting central Gaza. We have seen now of course the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million population now internally displaced many of them taking shelter around the south. But there are fears that people in the south now could also become a target. We have seen the Israeli military expanding its operation both in the air and on the ground. The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas and has accused Hamas of embedding itself amongst civilians, but we have seen the targeting of residential areas and of course airstrikes near hospitals near schools and of course near aid centers as well. And there are fears that for the millions of Palestinians now sheltering in southern Gaza thought to be a safe zone they will now no longer find any place of safety there. The UN of course repeatedly calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, but this is something that the Israeli government has outrightly rejected. Nada Bashir, CNN in London.",

But look, we've had different outcomes in different states, huge victories for the challengers against Trump, who filed these cases in Maine and Colorado. But Trump prevailed largely on procedural grounds that never reached the questions about January 6th in other places like Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and the next state we're all going to be talking about is Oregon.

So, take a listen to Chesebro in his own words, describing what Trump campaign operatives were doing. How they kind of jumped into action on the eve of January 6th, when they realized that those ballots, those fake ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CHESEBRO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY: The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time. So, the general counsel of the campaign was alarmed and was chartering -- they didn't have to charter a jet, but this is like, yeah, so this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there.
