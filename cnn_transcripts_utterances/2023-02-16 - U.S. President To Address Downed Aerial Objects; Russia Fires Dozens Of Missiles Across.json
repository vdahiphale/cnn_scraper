Tonight, we are waiting for the U.S. President tospeak any moment, really, on the Chinese spy balloon controversy as well as the other aerial objects the Air Force, if you remember, shot down. We will bring you that as soon as it happens, as soon as it gets underway. But for now, let's get to the other international stories we are focused on this hour. Civilians killed in their beds as they slept, workers injured by airstrikes as they rushed to repair damaged power lines. That is the grim scene in Ukraine after rather terrible night in Russia's grinding war. Russian forces fired 36 missiles across the country overnight, from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the northeast. Ukrainian forces say they shot down 16 of those, but many hit their marks. Missiles demolished houses like this one in central Ukraine, a 79-year old woman died there, her husband survived. We are also hearing that Ukraine and Russia have conducted a prisoner swap with 101 people returning home to each side. David McKenzie joins me this hour from Kyiv. And David, we are awaiting from President Biden, so if he does appear, I will have to interrupt you. But let's start first of all on this prisoner swap. What are you learning? What more can you tell us, David?",

He was the deputy mayor in Nodar(ph), the town, the industrial town attached to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. He was held for more than 330 days. So he was released as well as those soldiers. The majority of them were involved in the defense of Mariupol and the very intense stand that they took in the Azovstal -- excuse me, steel plant in that area in the early months of the war. So, this will be some good news, also 101 soldiers from Russia were swapped in a like for like swap. There is also this new news emerging from Bakhmut and some very intense video coming from Ukrainian forces in very intense firefight with the Russians that are trying to advance on the edges of that town. And now, the Ukrainian officials speaking on Ukrainian television saying that those forces for the Russians, which are made up, he said, of private military contractors from Wagner and Russian forces are just doing very intense attacks on that town. And they are in the process, according to that commander, of replenishing those forces pretty regularly, because of the heavy losses that they are taking. They are certainly a -- there's very much a very -- you know, an intense increase in the attacks and the artillery fire on Bakhmut. And you get the sense, this is a key goal of Vladimir Putin and his generals to try have some kind of a win as we run up to a week to this one year anniversary of this conflict. Bakhmut has been the scene of heavy fighting for many months now. And the Russians, according to both Ukrainian and U.S. officials, have taken extremely high losses in trying to take that area.

There were fewer people on the streets today than there have beenin previous protests certainly here in Paris, Isa, according to the official figures, the strike action was more limited than it was for instance on that very first day on January 19th. But this is kind of on purpose. The trade unions are walking this tightrope, well, of course, they want to keep the pressure on the government up, but they don't want to get the public on the wrong side of them. And I think what's been so interesting about the opinion polls these last few weeks is that they show that a majority of French people, more than 70 percent are opposed to this change in the law. They do not want the retirement age raised from 62 to 64. But perhaps, more than that, what the opinion polls are showing is that, if anything, the anger about it or the opposition to it is hardening, and people in fact, when you look at the next big protest, which will be the 7th of March, and that day, Isa, they really are intending to bring France to a standstill. Private sector, public sector with another big march. It is six out of ten that have been asked   in opinion polls whether they support this action or not, they say that they do. And of course, that gives you an idea of just how unhappy people are about the proposed reform and how prepared they are either to go on the street and protest or to accept a day and perhaps more over the coming weeks of strikes that will see the country grind to a standstill. It gives you an idea of how strong the public feels about this particular issue, Isa.",

He basically said -- I can give you a brief outline of what he said. He said, we don't have any evidence of increasing objects in the sky. He said the military were closely scrutinizing the airspace after that Intelligence balloon from China. They tracked it, they gave order to take it down, but he said, he acted on an abundance of caution. They are seeking to recover the debris from the other balloons that were taken -- the other objects, I should say, that were taken down. And they're assessing all three instances. But he said, we don't know what these three objects were. Most likely said, balloons tied to private companies or tied to research. He went on to say, make no mistake, if these objects presented a threat to Americans, I will take it down. He did go on to say, there has been no evidence -- there has been definitely an increase in balloons, in objects in the sky. But let's get more on all of this and also what this means for U.S.-China relations, because we heard, of course, him saying that he will continue to engage with China, and he said, I make no apologies. Let's bring in Kevin - - from the White House, reporter Kevin Liptak, and CNN Intelligence security analyst and former CIA operative, Bob Baer. Bob, great to have you on the show.

And if it landed on a school, with a lot of children, it would be unacceptable loss. I think the president was right -- and by the way, this is a military decision, what to shoot down and what's not. I've been in the situation room where you offer the president of the United States a choice, is -- are these things a danger to American people? And the military response, yes.

So, if it was truly a military balloon, once that's established, we need to confront the Chinese, and say, this is a waste of time, get your Intelligence somewhere else. And let's just sort of back off this escalation right now. As for the other three objects, I think an important point is, these balloons are supposed to have transponders that the Air Force can pick up, and they know they're civilian balloons. But nonetheless, as the president said, they are a danger to civil aviation, and they should be shot down. I mean, a plane running into these on a bad weather, it goes down.",

Zoe Billingham, formerly a lead inspector for a U.K. police watchdog, says, she's deeply troubled. Such sensitive information has been released and she joins me now. Zoe, great to have you on the show. So I mean, I'm surprised they released that. What were they thinking? ZOE BILLINGHAM, FORMER LEAD INSPECTOR FOR U.K. POLICE WATCHDOG:  It's very confusing, isn't it? Not only is this information deeply personal, it's not immediately evident that releasing it now is going to help the police to bring Nikki home. And that's what we all want to see. We want to see a really lovely outcome to this, where she's found safe and well and returns to her family. But why release this information in the way that we've seen over the last two days? And if it is relevant to the investigation, to find her as a missing person, why has it taken nearly three weeks of this information to be made public? Personally, I'm not sure why this information is relevant. And I think it sets a very dangerous precedent for U.K. policing, because it will no doubt raise the question in the minds of people whose loved ones do go missing, well, am I going to be subject to this? And this is really a gross intrusion of a family's privacy.",

Although we know that Nikki would not have wanted this, there are people out there speculating and threatening to sell stories about her. This is appalling and needs to stop.\" So clearly, would this put an end to the speculation, coming out and talking about these vulnerabilities?

I think now really is the time for the police to get on with the investigation, to listen to the family's wishes, that they're able to get on with the investigation and I hope bring Nikki home. But I think the conversation for a later date is, why didn't the police do more to control the messaging to the public, so there weren't these vacuums created, so that the public and the media did get the information that they needed, to be able to report on this in an appropriate way? And again, why, at this very late stage, three weeks on from Nikki going missing, was this really sensitive information about her reproductive status and so on, why was it felt necessary to put this into the public domain now?",

I suspect it might be because the police also yesterday revealed that they'd had previouscontact with Nikki a few weeks before she went missing. So it would be fairly automatic that the police should refer on, then, to the watchdog in similar circumstances. I also understand that our ministers have been asking for the police force to explain why they've chosen this particular moment to put this information into the public domain. And, quite frankly, I don't think anyone's yet heard an explanation as to why that might be. Going back to my point, I feel very conflicted about talking about this case. The family clearly want the attention to be diverted on to finding Nikki and quite rightly so. But if the police's action in this case is going to stop other families coming forward when their loved ones go missing because of fear that this is repeated again, I do think that senior police leaders need to be stepping forward to give the public -- and particularly women who've lost lots of trust in the police over the last 18 months. Because there is a series of really catastrophic cases involving serving police officers, that they give the women the assurance that they are safe to come forward and report crimes relating to them or their loved ones, so that they can be solved.",

Some people have been talking about it smacking of victim blaming even, not a view that I personally subscribe to but I can understand why people feel that. And it does nothing to restore trust in competence that women have in police, in order to step forward and report their crimes. That said -- and I would always say this, the vast majority of police officers in England and Wales are absolutely excellent individuals, who do a very difficult job in tough circumstances and whose only wish every day is to get up and do their very best for the public. We must remember that. But again, cases like this and judgments like Lancashire police, in terms of this information, not only serve to rock that confidence further, I'm afraid.",
