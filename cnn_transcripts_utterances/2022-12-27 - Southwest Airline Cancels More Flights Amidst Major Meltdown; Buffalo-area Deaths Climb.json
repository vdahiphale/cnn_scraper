It's still cold, but the warm air is on its way. A little bit of help. The warm air is in the West right now, getting pushed to the East by another storm system that's coming onshore there. Now, this warm air is going to warm things back up into the 40s and 50s. And yesterday at my apartment, temperatures were about 34, and we were doing very well. Hey, it's warming up. Guess what, though? The pipes were already frozen, and the pipes were already cracked. And that weather that warmed things up made those pipes melt. And all of a sudden that little plug that was a little plug of ice is no longer there, and the water was pouring out. Ice everywhere this morning as temperatures went back down. This freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw thing is going to go on now for days and days and days. So just because you're warming up doesn't mean you're out of the woods. We could see significant amounts of those pipe-burst problems across the East Coast. Could be millions or billions of dollars' worth of problems here with that flooding. There's the next storm for the West Coast. The European model over the next ten days in places in the Sierra puts it down -- I'm not stuttering -- 20 feet of snow in the highest elevations.
