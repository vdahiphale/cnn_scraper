It's 09:00 a.m. there in Washington, it is 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\" and wherever you are watching, it is good to have you on board. Coming up over our next two hours of coverage, the President-Elect has a lengthy to do list. We'll take a look at what he is promising. Plus, what a second Trump presidency could mean for Russia's war on Ukraine. And Kamala Harris concedes defeat, but she says the fight for Democratic ideals isn't over. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, Futures indicating that the post-election rally may continue into a second session after a surge in share prices on Wednesday, following Trump's decisive victory. Traders also waiting on the Federal Reserve's decision on rates. Consensus is that interest rates will be cut by how much and whether that easing will continue, is what the markets are watching for more at 09:30 a.m. local time there in New York. Right, two days after a history making election, speculation is rife over who will fill the key roles in Donald Trump's return to the White House. Sources telling CNN that the President-Elect is mulling over staff picks and getting ready to enforce a host of executive orders on day one in office. Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, an electoral thumping.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: We're excited to have so many people, so many people excited to be part of this administration and unifying the country. So, I think what you're going to see from this transition is going to be a unified front. And President Trump and Kamala Harris spoke a little bit earlier. It was a very gracious phone call that the vice president gave, and president was very clear she thought she ran a strong campaign, and she was very tenacious in the process. And she also mentioned she wanted to work with the president to unify the country. So, I think from the transition who wants to display a unified front, and also from the relationship that he has with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. We're looking to have a unified relationship with the country in January. Let's be clear Anderson, it's not a legal requirement for the assignment, for the campaign or the transition, to sign anything with the government. We're working on cooperating in unison to make sure we cross the necessary thresholds so that our people can be briefed properly with national security background information, and so that we can hit the ground running. But let's be clear, it is not a legal requirement to sign a memorandum of understanding with the government for this transition. What we expect to see for the first 100 days is this people focused on affordability. The American people want to do something with respect to affordability. They've been wiped out. They've suffered from tremendously through the pop -- through the policies of the previous administration. And we're going to focus on that. We're also going to focus on securing the border. That's very common sense to the common people. Once we understand how step one moves forward, will understand will move to the next layer. But let's be clear to the American people, we are going to deport illegal aliens who've broken our laws and who've been violent to our people. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They campaigned very hard in every battleground state, and ultimately, they came up short. She ran on unifying the country, restoring reproductive rights. You know, what she said on the campaign trail is that one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban.

Right, Americans are fed upwith high prices on everything from car insurance to groceries. And in CNN exit polls, we saw that about two thirds of voters, they described the U.S. economy as not good or poor. Just 1/3 said it was excellent or good, and among those voters who gave the economy poor marks, they broke heavily in favor of Trump. Now we know that the rate of inflation is down, and that's what the Fed looks at. That's what economists pay attention to, but Americans and consumers around the world, they pay attention to the level of prices, and those are not down. Right, the typical U.S. household every month is spending about $1,100 more, than they did in January 2021 when Biden took office for the same goods and services. Now wages are up too, but often not by enough. Trump has promised to attack the cost of living. He has laid out aggressive plans for tax cuts, mass deportations, massive tariffs, and, yes, cutting red tape. The problem is that a lot of the mainstream economists that I talk to, they are worried that the Trump agenda is inflationary, perhaps very inflationary. They're worried about deportations, depriving industries of workers they need. And they're worried about tariffs, because tariffs are taxes on U.S. imports. There's a recent study out from the Peterson Institute that found that the typical U.S. household is going to be spending about $2,600 more per year because of these Trump tariffs. But Becky, the question is, how many of these campaign promises become a reality? Because maybe Trump doesn't plan to tariff all $3 trillion of U.S. imports. Maybe that's just a negotiating tactic. But what happens next, and how all of this gets implemented is going to really play out in a big way for consumers, investors around the world, because we know inflation really haunted Biden and Vice President Harris, and it could become a problem for Trump too, if he's not careful.",

A tariff is basically a tax on products, and Trump wants to put them on everything that comes into the U.S. That's $3 trillion worth of goods a year. In order to cover the higher tariffs, companies will have to raise prices, and that cost ultimately gets passed down to you, the consumer. So, here's his plan, a 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports and up to 20 percent on imports from other countries. Trump says it will protect working class jobs and punish countries making goods with cheap labor in unsafe conditions. The self-proclaimed tariff man is hoping the tariffs will incentivize Americans to buy more Made in America products and the tariffs could, in theory, raise trillions of dollars to help fund tax cuts. But economists at Goldman Sachs warn the tariffs could backfire. Instead raising prices on American families, killing jobs and setting off another trade war, countries could then retaliate, putting their own tariffs on U.S. goods that they buy.

Imagine if he has an even narrower swing than that. Right now, House Republicans and Senate Republicans say that they have been meeting for months to discuss, potentially, what their agenda would be if Donald Trump won and they maintained the House majority and took back the United States Senate. If indeed that is what happens, they say that they will attack first a massive tax bill. That is because major provisions that were part of the tax cuts and Jobs Act that passed back in 2017 when Donald Trump was in the White House. Some of those provisions are set to expire, many of them at the end of 2025. And a lot of Republicans did not want a repeat of what they saw back in 2017 where many Republicans were surprised that Donald Trump won, and they sort of hit the ground with flat feet when it came to trying to repeal and replace Obamacare. Instead, they say that they want to be ready with an agenda. They want to talk through what's working with the tax cuts and Jobs Act, what's not working, what they want to improve on. And some Republicans told me that they also want to look at repealing parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, a major accomplishment of the Biden Administration as part of that first tax package. Of course, they are going to have other routine things they have to do, like funding the government, dealing with the debt ceiling. But taxes are going to be the major priority in the first couple of months, if Republicans maintain majority of the House, as we expect that they could do in the days ahead.",

At first, they had chocolate cake together at Mar-a-Lago. Then things turned a bit frosty when it came to China's response to COVID, and then this ongoing issue of trade. This is an issue that is weighing heavily on Chinese people. We see discussion about a potential trade war opening up.
