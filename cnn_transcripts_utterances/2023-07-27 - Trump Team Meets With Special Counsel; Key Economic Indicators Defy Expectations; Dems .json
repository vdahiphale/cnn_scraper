And the man who could now be prepping a second indictment -- federal indictment tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.The grand jury in that probe is meeting as we speak. Sources tell us that Trump's attorneys hope today's meeting would delay any potential indictment. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the federal courthouse in Washington, DC for us. And also with us, Republican Election Lawyer Ben Ginsberg. Katelyn, first to you. What did we learn about this meeting between Trump's attorneys and Special Counsel Jack Smith? KATELYN POLANTZ, SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, we're getting a little bit more detail about what happened in that meeting. And according to Kaitlan Collins, the attorneys for Donald Trump who went to that meeting after receiving that warning from the Justice Department that Donald Trump was very likely to be indicted, they went in there not to argue with the special counsel, Jack Smith about the facts that he has gathered or to learn about the facts or to argue the case itself, but rather a broader idea of presenting an argument about indicting a former president of the United States. Someone that they believe if he is facing an indictment now could cause turmoil in the political environment across the country. And so, that is one of the things that was coming out of this meeting. Another thing coming out of this meeting was that there wasn't a clear indication given to the Trump defense lawyers about exactly what was going to happen next. If there was going to be an indictment, what the potential timing of that would be? All of that is in flux. But we are here at the federal courthouse because we are closely watching a grand jury that has worked for months and months, not just with Special Counsel Jack Smith's prosecutors, but generally on what happened after the 2020 election, what happened on and leading up to January 6. They've heard from witnesses from inside the White House. People as high up as Vice President Mike Pence, who had those direct conversations with Donald Trump. And all of this is something that the Justice Department could potentially bring together into a case if they are still planning on going to the grand jury and asking them to approve an indictment.",

So, going in and arguing at the facts at this point would probably not be productive. The chaos theory seems to be one that Trump mentioned earlier this week, and that his attorneys are coming back to. So, it's a little bit of you're going to unleash the furies if you indict me.I think they probably also made the case that Donald Trump has defenses like the First Amendment. And that overall, there is no precedent for indicting a former president who also happens to be a presidential candidate.

So, that wasn't the president. That was all these other people around him who are actually sort of freelancing things and that you can't blame the president for it. And if you do try and blame the president, then in fact, that's when you get people in the streets.

And it could become public quite soon after that.There is a way to do it that way. But the other option is that the Justice Department could want to keep things confidential for various reasons.

So, it seems that Prigozhin still has some currency with Putin because he controls some of the levers to these interests in Africa. Now, how long he controls them? We don't know. We don't know what kind of deal he got caught in or strictures were put on him entirely by Putin. So, it does seem bizarre. I mean, this major push against Putin, a mutiny.

Now, you have a sense that Ukraine is committing more of its forces in to this. How significant is that move, because there had been some sense that until now, Ukraine has held many of its forces back? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, I think you've got to talk about the Ukrainian plan at first. They've got a 600-mile defense line that they bet to try to break through. So, for the last couple of weeks, I think the Ukrainians have been probing for the soft spots along that 600-meter line. It would appear that they may have found a soft spot down in the Zaporizhzhia region. And if they are able to do that and they're able to break through that very, very expensive obstacle belt, that's where the commander is going to consider deploying those eight brigades in reserve.",

Anyway, the message from the economic numbers today is the same as what you're hearing from Wall Street, which is that this economy is holding up really well. It's actually heating up. GDP out today. That's the broadest measure of the economy. It showed that the economy unexpectedly accelerated in the second quarter, 2.4 percent, beating expectations. That's pretty solid, especially given the fact that the Fed is trying so hard to slow this economy down. They also got some good numbers on the jobs front. Initial jobless claims, that's a proxy for layoffs, that unexpectedly fell sharply in the latest week. That is a good sign. It signals that the pace of layoffs is slowing. You can see layoffs did pick up earlier this year. But that is really starting to unwind. So, Boris, if you put this together, it paints the picture of an economy that is pretty healthy.
