We have yet to hear from the Russian president himself about this terrifyingly deadly attack what his take on it is, and it'll be really important to see how the Kremlin will try to frame this, who they will blame for this.

That was on the 7th, the information that came out on the 7th of March was that there was a 48-hour window on this, but that was a public announcement.So, it's entirely possible that whoever, whatever terrorist group was responsible for this, got access to that and said, we might have to adjust and back it off a little bit in terms of time. Two weeks later, now we have this particular attack. And you know, what we have seen is in this very large mall, that's just on the outskirts of Moscow, you have all of these casualties, apparently, the shot by men with assault rifles, the numbers I think are about four right now, as well as incendiary devices, which, you know, cause the whole thing to catch fire, and then even more casualties resulting.

He said, in recent weeks, she has been subjected to intense scrutiny and has been unfairly treated by certain sections of the media around the world and on social media when it comes to matters of health like everyone else, she must be afforded the privacy to focus on her treatment and be with her loving family. Now, of course, this is a personal matter for the Princess of Wales despite the fact this has captured the attention of many in the country and of course indeed, across the globe, and she did speak about having to take the time to ensure that she was able to explain her treatment and diagnosis to her three young children. And of course, the timing around when this message was delivered is important too.

So those are cancer cells. But as you mentioned, hair cells are fast replicating the lining of our stomach and gut is really fast replicating so that's where you get nausea, vomiting, you also get immune compromised. So your blood cells and blood line cells will decrease.And so that's why you may not see someone who is undergoing chemotherapy out in the public because you want to keep them away from all types of viruses and bacteria out there.

      "sentences": "Well, a deal has been reached to avoid a government shutdown. The House earlier on Friday passed a massive spending package that would fund the remaining six government agencies that have yet to be funded. And then they sent it over to the Senate. But over in the Senate, it requires cooperation from every single senator in order to be able to move quickly on bills, and Republicans were refusing to give their consent unless they got their desired amendment vote.So that led to a standoff between Democrats and Republicans for hours they went back and forth. But they finally came to an agreement just minutes before the midnight deadline. It has been such a tortured process to get to this point. Because Congress was supposed to have funded the government back in October, but instead they kicked the can down the road. They passed temporary patch after temporary patch and they finally released a massive government funding package at 3:00 in the morning on Thursday, leaving themselves not a whole lot of time to let lawmakers read the bill and get them through both chambers. So, this has been a long and tortured process. There's been a lot of drama over the last few months. But it looks like Congress is finally on track to avoid a government shutdown and put this funding saga behind them. Melanie Zanona, Capitol Hill, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
