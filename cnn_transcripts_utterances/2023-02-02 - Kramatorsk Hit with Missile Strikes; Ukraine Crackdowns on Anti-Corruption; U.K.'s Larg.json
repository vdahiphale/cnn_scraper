We'll take a look at what workers are demanding.And Popes Francis is drawing huge crowds on his visit to Africa. We're going to have a live report on his call for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is 10:00 in the morning in eastern Ukraine where a rescue operation is ongoing in the city of Kramatorsk after a Russian missile slammed into a residential area, killing at least three people. Eight others were wounded in the attack. And one official says at least two people may still be trapped under the rubble. At least eight apartment buildings were damaged and one of them completely destroyed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is condemning the strike, saying his country is bordering, quote, \"absolute evil.\" Meantime, in nearby Bakhmut, Ukraine reports heavy fighting while pro- Russian forces claim to be close to encircling the key Ukrainian city. This, as a top Ukrainian official warns Russia is now preparing for a maximum escalation of the war within 2 to 3 months. Ukraine's defense intelligence is offering a similar assessment saying February and March will be very active. And CNN's Scott McLean is following developments for us.

It is also pretty difficult to imagine how anyone could have survived an attack like that, given the destruction there. But officials say that they believe that there could be at least two people still trapped underneath of that rubble. And time, really here, is of the essence because it has been now more than 12 hours since this missile strike actually took place.And so, if you imagine that there are in fact two people, hopefully alive, still under the rubble. They are very likely to be injured. They're also dealing with the gas and the smoke from the actual missile strike. And on top of that, the temperatures right now in Kramatorsk are below freezing. So, it is unlikely that someone could survive for an extended period of time in those kinds of conditions. President Zelenskyy says that strikes like this are part of daily life in Ukraine and it certainly is familiar. It seems like we see these all the time. Last month, there was a very similar strike in Dnipro, killing more than 40 people in a direct hit on an apartment building. Apparently, the target was some kind of military facility that was across the river. It's not clear in this case whether there was a military target or what that military target in the area might have actually been. And all of this comes just as Ukrainian officials, Rosemary, say that things are about to get worse, that the spring offensive that they've been warning about now for some time is going to be coming in the next two or three months.

One of the hearts of his message is, hands off Africa, as he put it. The idea of Africa being viewed, especially by the west, by what he calls ideological colonists, is nothing more than a mine to be stripped and a fertile territory to be plundered.He is very concerned about the impact of strip mining, devastation of natural resources and impact that is having, on poverty in the country and the lack of development there. So, he's trying to highlight, I think, those concerns in Africa and at the same time also calling for peace in Africa and what has been a bitterly and war-torn country in the Congo.",

We have seen the devastation of civil war in Congo. We've seen a similar strife in South Sudan. He spent some time, for example, listening to the harrowing stories of the victims of violence and bloodshed and rape and murder in whole parts of Congo, especially in the eastern regions. So, I think he's trying to push for peace in the country, unity in the country that has, I think, about 250 dialects, different languages. But above all, I think he's very concerned about the interference in the development of Congo and its ultimate prosperity or lack of it as a result of direct interference by, certainly, western economic interest and those who seek to make trouble in the country from surrounding countries as well as those who seek religious strife in the country as well.",

He had a similar message in Madagascar and Mozambique where abundance of resources, again, are being plundered. In terms of the results, we can see in different places such as Central African Republic and elsewhere in Africa some success in shining that light, but also really bringing a memory for the people there to have hope that, yes, it is possible to have a reconciliation, it is possible to have peace starting with what Pope Francis calls within those countries the importance of forgiveness.
