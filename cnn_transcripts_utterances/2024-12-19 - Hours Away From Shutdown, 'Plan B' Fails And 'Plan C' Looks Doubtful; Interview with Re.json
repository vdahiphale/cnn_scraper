Later, was the Wisconsin shooter planning another mass murder, along with someone from across the country? What newly obtained court documents reveal. Good evening to you. Jim Sciutto here, sitting in again for Anderson. Tonight, House Republicans have failed to pass legislation to keep the federal government running for the millions of Americans who depend on it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): This is Washington. This is how the lawmaking is done. It's a long process, sometimes it takes a while to reach consensus. But we're going to do the right thing here tonight. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCIUTTO: That was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who could not corral enough of his own party members behind what was, actually their Plan B legislation after Elon Musk and President-elect Trump sank a bipartisan Plan A yesterday. Today, both men were behind the measure tonight. But again, not enough of their fellow republicans were as well. So, Plan A is dead, Plan B just died, and we just learned from GOP whip Steve Scalise that Plan C, they had been looking at looks doubtful as well. The question tonight is once again, what now? CNN's Manu Raju joins us at the Capitol. So, I wonder what you're hearing from lawmakers, particularly since Steve Scalise is now moving away from an option that was at least out there to try to get this passed on a simple majority.",

He said they were going to regroup, they are going to try and figure out what the next steps were. And he attacked Democrats, even though there were Republicans also who voted against this plan on the House floor, despite the push from Donald Trump.Now, one big reason why there were Republicans who voted and defied Donald Trump was his demand -- Trump's demand to suspend the national debt limit for two years. Remember, this is something that Congress has to typically deal with every so often, but it is expected to be dealt with next year. But Donald Trump recognized that this will be a complication next year for his agenda. And now demanding in the 11th hour to inject this into this government funding fight, saying it must be addressed right now. But here's the problem. There are a lot of Republicans who fundamentally oppose raising the national debt limit. Dealing with that without any spending cuts whatsoever. So, as a result, you saw a revolt on the right, and you had, in some of those members, I caught up with, Jim, and they expressed why they are concerned with Donald Trump's demands.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. to answer your question to the point, I think there's two or three things that we could take away from this. We had a reasonably good deal. And by the way, you're never going to get a debt ceiling increased or a CR passed without Democrats' support because we have about 30 Republicans that will not support that in a tight majority. That means you've got to have some Democrat support, which means you got to have a bipartisan bill. So, that's the first point.Second point, the bill that we had yesterday had a lot of wins for Republicans, a lot of great things we've been trying to get for two years now. But to get that, we had to give away a couple of priorities that the Democrats wanted. And I thought it was a reasonably good compromise. The problem was one or two people in our conference, instead of just opposing it, had to go out and demonize and distort things provisions in the bill. So, for example, our salaries $174,000.00, but they put out we're going to get $240,000.00. That wasn't true that we were going to prevent any kind of investigations on those who served on the J6 Committee. That is not in the bill. I could go on and on. So, this stuff was put out by members of our own party. Then you have these social media influencers with a million followers. They pick up on it and they throw gasoline on the fire. And that's what we had yesterday. So, and people run away from it. I'm sort of used to it. I've been a target of a lot of these same people. So, Elon Musk took some of this false data and put that back out there. And this is my third point, if you're on the same side and you don't like what you're hearing, pick up the telephone and call your friend, your ally. Why tweet and throw your ally under the bus? And I think this could have been easily resolved through a phone call to Speaker Johnson and worked their way through it. Today. I voted for this bill today because it would prevent a shutdown, and it was a skinny CR, but I think Plan C is not going to happen because we don't have the majority of Republican votes for this.",

This has been Speaker Johnson's dilemma. He knows he has to have some Democrat support to get these things passed. So that's why he was working across the aisle. And he was -- and he's -- I trust him. He's only going to agree to the Democrat priorities that he can tolerate and live with. And I thought he did a good job. It got demonized and a lot of lies about it.And I think in the end, people will see through it. I believe President Trump today, after hearing the facts, actually thought what we had yesterday was a reasonably good bill. He just wants to get the debt ceiling modified.

      "sentences": "Well, we'll see. I want to talk about the debt limit because, you know, House Republicans have repeatedly lambasted Democrats for raising the debt limit. Now they want to suspend it for two years. And by the way, it's the Democrat's suspicion and listen, some of this is public because Republicans have been quite public about extending the Trump tax cuts.That is because they want to allow an expanded debt ceiling to what will -- tax cuts that will add to the deficit. We know that's the CBO estimate. So why should voters believe, including your voters believe, that Republicans actually want to cut spending if they want to suspend the limit for two years and then pass a big tax cut? BACON: Well, I think there's two things. One, I do believe in extending the tax cuts because I think it makes our economy competitive, like 21 percent tax rate for businesses is what the average is in the world. We don't want to go back to 35 percent or somewhere higher. So, I do think we want to do that. But I believe in the end we've got to do a debt commission because 72 percent of our spending is mandatory spending. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, only 28 percent is discretionary. If you subtracted the entire discretionary budget, all of it, we still have a $800 billion a year deficit. And so we've got to get together Republicans and Democrats and figure out how we're going to preserve Social Security and Medicare, but yet get ahead of this exploding debt that's coming from the mandatory spending. And it can only be done in a bipartisan way. If Republicans is trying to fix it, well get killed the next election. If Democrats try to do it by themselves, they'll get killed. We got to do this together and I think a commission is the only way to do it. And we've done one before. But the difference was, we did not have in the previous one that whatever they come up with, you have to put it on the floor for an up or down vote. This commission, you got to have it put on the floor for an up or down vote.",

They are an adversary. They got a million Uyghurs and slave labor camps and doing forced sterilization.What they're doing to Hong Kong is terrible. What they're doing in Tibet is terrible.

RHONDA COLVIN, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": You know, it could be and I think we're all still trying to figure out what exactly just happened, because if you would have talked to a lot of us Hill reporters at the beginning of this week, even probably a month ago, this didn't look like the way that it would shake out. It looked like this was a done deal. In fact, it really wasn't the big news in the last few weeks since Congress has been back since the election. So the fact that, you know, in a matter of 24 hours, there was this disruption in a deal that had been brokered in a bipartisan way. I think that is -- I am really struck with how it all played out and the fact that lawmakers today, a lot of them are saying we don't know what's going on and we don't know what tomorrow brings. And I know \"looming shutdown\" is something we all use to describe these moments while we're on the brink, but this one feels a little different because it was so unplanned and it really just came about all of a sudden, and no one knows where they're going to go to next. [20:15:18] SCIUTTO: It seemed to follow a tweet, right, from Elon Musk and then sort of a backup tweet from the president-elect. Brad, I mean, the cold, hard facts are that Republicans have the majority today, and they're going to have the majority in the House and the Senate.

Now, could Congress, the Treasury Department can use extraordinary measures and not have the country hit the debt ceiling until a little later this spring.

She said in all of her years practicing in New York, she had never seen an instance where she'd started the day with an appointment to go to state court, where she expected him to be arraigned on those state charges, and then having to divert and change tactics and come to federal court to face federal charges. She also said that she thought that these two charges were in conflict and question if authorities were even working together, because, she said, the state charges were saying that he committed murder with the purpose of instilling terror.

And credit to the NYPD is they were able to put in hundreds if not thousands of hours to make an almost reverse documentary of the actions of this individual. Well, to show insanity to the level that he would be excused criminally, I think is a long shot. I also think it's really bad news for Luigi Mangione and good news for the rule of law the action that the federal government took today, because that brings this case to a whole another level. Because the murder charge involves there, that people aren't really talking about that too much involves the death penalty is not available in the state of Manhattan (ph). And it also involves a mythology, you know, using the stalking laws to weave in murder. I think is pretty much right down the middle of the plate based on the evidence as we have now. On the other hand, Alvin Bragg, who will have to take a backseat here. He can talk all he wants to give press conferences that they're going to move on parallel tracks. They're not going to move on parallel tracks. The federal government is going to dictate the pace.

So for a lot of reasons, it makes perfect sense for the rule of law for the federal government to go first, use all their leverage that they have with this being a death penalty case.
