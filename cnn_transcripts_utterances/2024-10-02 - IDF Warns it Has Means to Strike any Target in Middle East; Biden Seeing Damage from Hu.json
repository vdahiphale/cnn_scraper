And that help cannot come soon enough, especially as we learn from energy officials, the major portions of the power grid in the Carolinas have been wiped away.And from the debate stage to the campaign trail, vice presidential candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Walz heading to battleground states after a debate that featured get this policy over personal attacks. I know what is the world coming to?

This as the world is waiting to see what Israel's next move is going to be after Iran's missile strike.Right now, Israel is ramping up its ground war in Lebanon with plans to deploy more troops to take part in that fight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing that Iran will pay for the aerial assault. Now, earlier, President Biden weighed in on how Israel might retaliate. He says, he does not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, saying the U.S. will be discussing with Israel what it plans to do. CNN Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto is live for us in Tel Aviv right now. And Jim, we've just learned that a permanent U.S. resident was killed in Lebanon. Tell us more about that. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Listen, it shows just how easily the expanding war here can touch the interests of so many countries, right? I mean, you already have Americans who were killed or captured still held in Gaza in the first front of this war. And as the war expands, it's likely that not just more Americans, but other countries citizens are affected as well, of course, including the people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, the people of all the countries involved. I think as the country, as people here in Israel, but also the region awaits Israel's promised response to the missile attacks last night. Those words from President Biden that you mentioned, Boris, are quite telling because he was asked, does the U.S. support an Israeli attack, a potential Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites? And he said quite clearly the answer is no. So when Israel says they can strike any target in Iran, while that may be true, to do so without the support of the U.S. President would be notable. And there are also open questions as to whether Israel could militarily carry out at least decisive strikes on Iran's nuclear program without U.S. military support, including things such as air refuelers, given the distance between Israel and Iran. So that split, again, if Israel were to go that path, would be just the latest instances of daylight between U.S. leaders on the conduct of this war and the current Israeli government.",

He accomplished two big things, which was he reintroduced himself to the American public and obviously did very well if you look at the CNN polling on it. But he also made Donald Trump look like he made a really good decision in terms of being a vice president and someone who could step into the role of being president.And I think in an election where increasingly people are looking back at Donald Trump's policies and saying they like them, he did a great job of telling, -- reminding voters that they like Donald Trump's policies and also reminding voters that Kamala Harris is part of the Biden administration.",

He was asked about a statement he'd made previously about being there in Tiananmen Square or being in China during the Tiananmen Square protest that we found out yesterday, according to new reporting, was inaccurate.It's only the latest time, the latest incident, where the governor has had to clarify statements about his biography that were less than accurate. What did you make of his response and his approach generally when it comes to questions about these incidents being essentially, I'm a knucklehead and my grammar isn't the best? TIM HOGAN, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, HILARY CLINTON 2016  CAMPAIGN: Yeah. Look, he said he misspoke. He said that on stage. I think what Americans saw last night was someone who is plain spoken in Governor Walz and someone who likes to play pundit as J.D. Vance. What these two candidates had to do last night, they had to answer some questions about their record. Yes, because they are the two on the stage. But at the end of the day, they are explaining the policies at the top of the ticket from Donald Trump and from Kamala Harris. And I think Walz did really well on the January 6th question. He did extremely well on the abortion question where J.D. Vance said, you know, we got to try to regain the trust of American voters. When Vance himself on his website has said he was for a national abortion ban, has said it on podcast, Donald Trump won't say that he won't sign a national abortion ban. He touts that he put those three judges in place that struck down Roe. Walz hammered the point that maternal mortality in those states with abortion bans is significantly worse. And I think that's what voters really care about. So I think on the issues where undecideds or independents or even Republican-leading voters, where we saw Walz improve his standing and his favorability, Walz did a great job.",

I mean, voters need to be truthful or, excuse me, a candidates need to be truthful about where they stand on this issue. And I think he's also right. The polling shows Republicans do have a lot of work to do.But one of the things he did I think really well, and I disagree with Tim, is he was very transparent. Whereas we know Tim Walz was not transparent about his connections with China. We know he's not been truthful on many things that he said. But in terms of that, that was a level of honesty and transparency that we saw out of J.D. Vance that I think a lot of voters were expecting.
