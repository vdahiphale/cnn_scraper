CNN's Jeff Zeleny explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: For the next year, as Republicans try to win the Senate, keep their narrow majority in the House and indeed win back the White House, abortion will be front and center in their strategy. The lessons of Tuesday night's elections in Virginia, in Ohio and in Kentucky certainly serve as a reminder that abortion is still a very potent issue and now it has become a motivating factor for Democrats. Of course, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade with the Dobbs decision a little more than a year ago, there are so many examples now, election after election where Republicans are largely on the losing side of this argument. We are going to see much of this discussion at a Republican presidential debate here in Miami on Wednesday. There has been a difference of viewpoint to some degree about the way forward on abortion. Nikki Haley, for example, the former South Carolina governor, has tried to strike somewhat of a middle ground. Now Donald Trump, for his part, will not be participating in the debate. But he has tried to not dwell on abortion. He believes it's a losing issue, in the words that he has spoken to some of his advisers. But look for Democrats to try and turn this to their advantage over the next year. In fact, it could be one of their big motivating factors. So there is no doubt as Republicans try to win control of the Senate, hold their narrow majority in the House, and went back to the White House, abortion will be front and center.

You know, we're a very decentralized nation in some ways. And of course these local races turn in some part on what's happening where you are.And so if you're blaming Joe Biden for inflation or for being old, right, that's not necessarily going to reflect itself in how you come out to the polls in these local issues. But again, Democrats looking to nationalize these issues are going to look at things like abortion rights. They might look to Andy Beshear in Kentucky, right? A Democrat who won reelection in a very Red State, a state that Trump won, I think in 2020 by close to 30 points. And thinking about ways, you know, they can borrow from that kind of more localized agenda. Almost to take, you know, the attention away from the top of the ticket. Now that's difficult in a 2024 election year. I do think Democrats will be thinking, OK, well, maybe some of this polling is something of a protest vote. Our young voters, as the CNN poll just show, breaking practically half and half for Trump and Biden, that would be inconsistent with the results we're seeing here. So I think Democratic strategists will be thinking that, you know, even with an unpopular Biden, maybe they can beat an even more unpopular Trump and the platform that he's going to represent.",

So this decision to call for humanitarian pauses and not necessarily a ceasefire is significant. Especially as we have been reporting, many of the G7 Arab counterparts have been pushing very firmly for this idea of a ceasefire. This is at odds with that. That is a contrast. Yet the G7 feels this will still allow for humanitarian aid to reachcivilians in need, and it will also give Israel the opportunity to perhaps free its hostages. Let's take a listen to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He spoke just a short time ago from this G7 Foreign Minister gathering in Tokyo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: When it comes to post conflict governance in Gaza, a few things are clear and necessary. One, Gaza cannot be -- continue to be run by Hamas. That simply invites a repetition of October 7th and Gaza uses a place from which to launch terrorist attacks. It's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that the Palestinian people be central to governance in in Gaza and in the West Bank as well, and that again, we don't see a reoccupation.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nighttime on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The sea explodes in an otherworldly spectacle. This is coral spawning. One of the world's greatest natural wonders is made up of billions of living creatures that reproduce like this each year. And this season has scientists excited. ABBI SCOTT, CAIRNS-PORT DOUGLAS REEF HUB COORDINATOR: We were out driving until about 11 o'clock last night, looking at the coral spawning, and we were lucky enough to see some of the species spawning. Not all of them, but we saw the soft corals, and they filled up the water with bundles of eggs and sperm, which was really spectacular. WATSON (voice-over): The spectacular sight is a type of synchronized breeding. Coral polyps release millions of sperm and egg bundles into the water all at once. When two bundles from the same species collide, new life is born. It's a display of nature's resilience, repeated around this time of year across the Great Barrier Reef's nearly 133,000 square miles. But while some parts of the reef remain healthy, other parts are bleaching and dying, killed by temperature rise due to global warming.",
