      "sentences": "This morning, how will Jack Smith respond? Donald Trump's legal team has laid out its full argument for absolute immunity in a new filing to the Supreme Court. They claim rejecting his bid would, quote, \"incapacitate every future president with the facto blackmail and extortion while in office.\" The Supreme Court has already given Trump much of what he wants here by effectively delaying the federal election subversion trial against him. The high court plans to hear these arguments on April 25th and decide whether Donald Trump is immune from January 6th related charges.CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in Washington with the latest this morning.

      "sentences": "John, the wording of Donald Trump's team in this brief to the Supreme Court is quite stark. They are warning the justices of a ruinous situation in America if there isn't immunity around the president and that a president could not be charged with a crime. That's what they want. They want the justices to dismiss the case against Donald Trump and say, he is totally immune from prosecution for anything he could have done, even if he broke the law just to stay in power at the end of the presidency. They want that immunity.And the arguments they're making, the words they're using, they're saying if there isn't an immunity around the presidency, it would hurt the president because the president would do a worse job, quoting Brett Kavanaugh from 15 years ago in a law review article. They're saying that it would cause blackmail and extortion of the president while in office if the president was fearful or could be politically prosecuted after office or prosecuted if they broke the law. They're also saying it would create post-office trauma for people who serve as president, and it would be the end of the presidency as we know it. Obviously, many of the justices, including Kavanaugh, have some level of sympathy or familiarity with the executive branch. And so they're trying to appeal to that among the Supreme Court justices. All of this taken together is going to be strongly refuted or pushed back against by Jack Smith and the special counsel's office when their arguments come in in a couple of weeks. We also know that the courts so far have totally shut down this argument that there should be this immunity bubble around the presidency. The D.C. circuit, the last group in the court system to write about this said, actually, laws in this country that apply even to the president or the presidency, that prevents people from breaking the law while they're even serving in that office. So we'll have to see exactly how the Supreme Court responds when they have oral arguments later in April.",

The law would allow state level law enforcement to arrest and deport people suspected of entering the country illegally. Now, this was after the Supreme Court had given the green light yesterday, and that stayed in place for a few hours. The conservative majority deciding that the law would be allowed to take effect while the legal battle over whether it was constitutional continued to play out. But before any real enforcement of it could happen, it was blocked again.Critics argue that the law, its known as S.B.4, it violates human rights, stokes racial profiling, and overreaches government authority. But supporters of the measure say that the crisis at the border calls for the state to take matters into his own hands. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Arizona for us this morning watching all of this.

Why did we know that? It was like that was too early, when we had a situation right here, I remember very clearly when President Ghani came here, he was here at the Capitol and said he would stay and fight.The next week, he ran. That changed the situation and the administration had a choice, and people can make the determination, whether or not we did wrap up and bring more troops in because the generals also said that they're 100 percent sure we would have been back at war with the Taliban, or withdraw the troops and get out.

It could triple again in coming year up to 48 billion cubic feet a day, produced mostly in the Gulf, shipped out of the Gulf states there. But what worries regulators is that none of the regulations have been updated since the 80s. And there is lax oversight and what liquefied natural gas really is, is methane, which is a huge planet cooking pollution, much more powerful than CO2. And what they do is they get it very cold, down to negative 260 degrees. They use other chemicals, hydrocarbons to condense it. So what's in a beach ball goes down into a ping-pong ball, but those chemicals can leak and create a vapor cloud and what could be ignited by any sort of spark. We saw the explosion you showed a little bit in Venezuela 2012. It killed dozens of people. The biggest fire in England's history after World War II came as a result of one of these explosions in a place called Buncefield back in 2005 and huge fires as a result of that. But now there are calls for, hey, let's take a little pause here. The Biden administration has done that for new liquefied natural gas terminals going forward.

They were understaffed. The company has redacted a lot of their internal investigation as to what happens there. But this is just one of those points that folks are pointing to. This is Freeport, Texas, Port Arthur -- so much of this taking place in these neighborhoods of color and places that have disproportionate cancer deaths and clusters in these places.
