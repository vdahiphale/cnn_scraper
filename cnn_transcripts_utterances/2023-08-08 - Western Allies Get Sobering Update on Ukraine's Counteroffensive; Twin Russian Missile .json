And I've been speaking to folks here in the U.S. and Europe, in the military, in diplomacy, also lawmakers.So there's a consistent read of the intelligence assessments here, and that is that this counteroffensive has run really into a brick wall in the east and the south, that is severe severe and difficult to breach Russian defensives, tree lines, tens of thousands of mines, that have led Ukrainian forces to incur just punishing losses there, and therefore make a change, pull back some of those units to reduce those losses. Those Russian defenses are one factor, but another factor is training here, and it's been noted to me by a number of officials that eight weeks or so training that many of these units have received on some of these new advanced Western weapon systems like the German Leopard tanks, is not a lot of time. And the challenge of basically turning the Ukrainian military into a massive, mechanized armored force in short order to attempt to breach these lines, which is always going to be difficult, was perhaps too hopeful, too optimistic. They haven't given up hope. But they do believe that time is short. A senior Western diplomat telling me that they're still going to see for the next couple of weeks if there is a chance of making some progress, but for them to really make progress that would change the balance of this conflict, I think it is extremely, highly unlikely, and it's that change that I have noticed speaking to these officials in the last couple of weeks that they feel time is short, and the chances of real significant territorial gains are falling.",

Take a look at the Abrams tanks, for instance, just approved this weekend to be sent there, but they're not going to arrive through the fall because it takes a number of weeks to train up Ukrainian forces to use them properly and well in the field.F-16s, for instance, there's increasing agreement that Ukrainains need air power. They need air cover, because they're attempting to take these -- break through these Russian lines without much air cover. Russians keep the advantage there. And that's a really, really hard thing to do. So there's movement towards allowing F-16s to go. The U.S. has given approval. But again, you've got to train up those pilots. It takes time to get them into position, and that's not going to happen before the fall comes, and then the fighting conditions change, so that's another pressure point here going forward.",

They were either police, they were service personnel or they were emergency workers, and they were all on the scene responding to that first incident.It's not the first time that Russia has tried this sort of, what sometimes called a double-tap tactic to drop a missile in, and then follow it up a little bit later to target the emergency workers. In fact, Ukrainian officials say since the war started 78 emergency workers have died in just these sorts of circumstances. But in this particular attack, there is an uncomfortable familiarity to it not just from this double-tap effect, but from the fact that it was targeting a popular pizzeria in the Donetsk region, and remember just barely a month ago in Kramatorsk another popular pizzeria was targeted by a very accurate Russian missile system. And it killed a lot of people. And why? Because it came right around supper time in the evening. When did the first missile impact yesterday evening? Right around supper time. Intended to get the most number of civilians, it appears. I've been to that particular restaurant. I've been in that location before. There were, when I was there fairly recently, no obvious military targets around it. So Russia clearly signaling that it's going to strike deep at civilian locations. Who knows why they've chosen to do it now, but it's certainly an indication to the Ukrainians that they can pick and choose these popular types of venues. Seven killed as you say.

For all those reasons that Jim laid out there, and the Ukrainians will say, well, we've been short of ammos, supplies didn't come in time, the Russians are, you know, just listening yesterday to the defense minister speaking, talking about the fight around Bakhmut, not talking about being able to take ground but actually the Ukrainian fighters putting up a good defense and putting punishment under the Russians, but not taking any ground.That kind of tells you even the Ukrainian narrative is shifting there. But they've had successes. You know, Russia has never been targeted over the border in the way Ukraine has done it. The Kremlin has never been hit before in the way the Ukrainians have managed to do it. The Central Moscow government offices have been hit the way they haven't before. There's been a mutiny in Russia because of the war. And there are a number of areas, it's asymmetric.

Compared to yesterday, 600 storm reports, the hurricane-force wind gusts you saw knocking and toppling over trees, the softball-sized hail falling from the sky. Today will feel like a walk in the park. But we know that it only takes one storm especially across the populated area to create problem.So let's focus in on the areas that are dealing with some of that severe weather risk today, and that is across northern New England. Check this out. We currently have a severe thunderstorm warning for a heavily populated areas, Newport, Rhode Island, into Bristol. The storm cell is actually moving across Rhode Island and into Massachusetts, so for the next 30 minutes or so, this area could experience gusty winds in excess of 50 to 60 miles per hour, and potentially some frequent cloud-to-ground lightning and large hail as well. We're also monitoring the threat of flash flooding. You can see flood watches and flood warnings in effect, just west of the Boston metro area. This is different than what we experienced yesterday but part of the same storm system. Look at what that hurricane-force wind gust can do to apartment buildings. Completely sheering off the top of the roofs. There's a 600 reports of severe weather yesterday. Very active and it's all part of the storm system that is going to help fuel more thunderstorms later today. It is simply just so hot across the Gulf Coast states that these thunderstorms will start to bubble up and that's where we can see severe weather again today. Kate?",

She's telling Trump's team and special counsel they need to submit their availability for scheduling by 3So taking you back to these back-and-forth filings, Donald Trump's team last night they once again accused Special Counsel Jack Smith of trying to subvert Donald Trump's First Amendment rights by restricting what he can disclose publicly once he's received this evidence in the case, and that's when the special counsel quickly shot back here in the court filing saying that allowing Trump to share anything he gets before trial would really damage the case. They wrote it this way. They said, \"The goal of the defendant's proposed protective order pre-trial publicity is antithetical to the interest of justice.\" So basically saying there that Trump wants to use everything he gets to drum up his supporters on social media and the campaign trail.

Now the speaker himself has indicated publicly that they are still investigating the matter. He has not made an official decision.But in talking to Republicans up and down the line, my colleagues and I have heard from a number of Republicans who believe it's essentially a foregone conclusion that an impeachment inquiry will be launched sometime this fall, and then they'll see if they can move forward with the articles of impeachment that will make Joe Biden just the fourth president ever in history to be impeached. Now the question is what evidence do they have to charge the president with committing high crimes and misdemeanors. They are trying to tie Joe Biden with his son Hunter Biden's overseas business entanglements. They say that they believe that Joe Biden was involved in some pay-to- play scheme while Biden was vice president. But they don't have the proof yet to corroborate their claim. Even as they have come up with some evidence showing that Hunter Biden tried to use his dad's position and power for leverage in his own business dealings, not information about whether or not Joe Biden himself was influenced in his actions by Hunter Biden's positions in his own business. Now nevertheless, the speaker made clear that he believes that an impeachment inquiry is on the table if the evidence rises to it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I raised it on this show not long ago that because the actions of the Biden administration withholding information that that would rise to the level where we need impeachment inquiry to get the strength of the Congress to get the information that we need to give to the American public and follow through on our constitutional authority.
