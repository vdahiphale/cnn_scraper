      "sentences": "This is the 11th large-scale attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure so far thisyear. And throughout the night, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, 90 missiles and 100 drones fired at targets across Ukraine. Putin saying this was a response to the use of U.S. supplied ATACMS to hit targets inside of Russia, but it's part of Moscow's persistent bid to erode the infrastructure here, the heating, the electricity that's going to keep the lights on and Ukraine warm through what's already becoming a dark and freezing winter. In fact, Zelenskyy said that some of these Kalibr missiles that were fired and used cluster munitions, particularly harmful to civilians, to hit some of their targets. But it was to the Kremlin head, Vladimir Putin, said a response to the use by Ukraine of U.S. supplied ATACMS missiles to hit targets inside of Russia in the last weeks or so. Escalation here, it seems almost daily. And Putin taking opportunity today, not only to refer to why this occurred because of the ATACMS but also potentially hold out a kind of branch of some description towards President Donald Trump coming to the White House in January, calling Trump experienced and capable man and suggesting potentially that he might be able to find a, quote, \"solution.\" Now, that is surely a nod to the diplomacy, which many believe Trump will adopt as the U.S. policy going forwards in January, a nod to that, certainly through his appointment of a Ukrainian special envoy to Ukraine, and that is General Keith Kellogg, his former national security adviser, who in April wrote extensively about a potential way forward for a peace plan here. It would involve freezing the frontlines, taking up negotiation as the formal policy of the United States. Ask Ukraine to accept aid, but aid as loans. And the condition for that continuing would be that Ukraine would become part of this peace process too. Russia, in turn, would get slight sanctions relief for becoming part of the negotiation process. But then I think the details as to how it gets to an end point in where Ukraine could potentially be happier and secure a little fuzzier. The plan in itself seems to accept that the amount of aid the U.S. is currently giving to Ukraine is at its maximum and they can't produce any more, but also, seems to suggest potentially that they need to continue and indeed supply Kyiv more to secure itself against any future Russian advances. But clearly, moves towards diplomacy here and potentially a moment in which Vladimir Putin, a wily and frankly at times cynical negotiator, may find it easier to get what he wants out of the new White House. The news from the frontlines though, inconsistently in Moscow's advantage, they're moving forwards on multiple different directions along the eastern front, as we saw ourselves over the past week or so.

But the problem that he has is to bring all that stuff to the front. Now, on the other side of that equation, they have the Russian economy is on a war footing right now, and that does give them a degree of advantage in this regard, but he does not have unlimited supplies.

He issomebody who knows Ukraine well, has just spent some time there. And it seems as if he is a much more amenable than the Ukrainian position than you would think anybody from the Trump administration would be given the pronouncements during the campaign. So, what General Kellogg seems to be proposing is basically a freeze in place kind of scenario. The one difficulty with what he's proposing right now seems to be that he is saying that Ukraine should not join NATO for the foreseeable future. That is something that really should not be left off the negotiating table at this point, in my view. I think that is something that would need to be changed if they want to really leverage -- have leverage against the Russians. The other thing also is that he will allow for the Russians, according to this -- what we know so far of this peace proposals, you will allow the Russians to maintain their positions within Ukraine, and that, of course, rewards very bad behavior and frankly, human rights violations. So, there's a problem with that as well. The good part about it is that it seems to allow Ukraine to maintain its sovereignty and its current form of government, which would, of course, be helpful for Ukraine and for the west as well.",

Nonetheless, despite that, this ceasefire is indeed still holding up, at least for now. Now, here's what both sides are claiming. The Lebanese military, for its part, says that Israel violated this agreement through the, quote, \"targeting of Lebanese territory with various weapons.\" The Israeli military actually admits that it did open fire on Lebanese territory, but it says that it did so in order to enforce this ceasefire, claiming that Hezbollah was violating the terms of this agreement. The Israeli military says it carried out two airstrikes in Southern Lebanon. In one case, they say they identified, quote, \"terrorist activity\" at a Hezbollah rocket storage facility. In the second case, they say they struck quote, \"two terrorists\" that they say were arriving at a known terrorist infrastructure site that had been used to fire on Israel. In another incident, they say they opened fire on people they described as suspects who are arriving in areas of Southern Lebanon. Now, the Israeli prime minister is actually touting these actions by the Israeli military in a new interview with Israel's Channel 14. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We enforced it already on the first day. You saw, yesterday we killed five Hezbollah operatives. We captured four. Today, we strike more. There is no trickery with us. We enforce it forcefully. But, if necessary, I have given directive to the IDF. If this framework, this ceasefire, is violated, it will lead to an intense war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One thing that's so tricky withthis new ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah is first the fact that the Israeli military is gradually going to withdraw from this territory. That means for up to 60 days, Israeli troops could actually still be inside Southern Lebanon. In addition to that, you actually have a party to this ceasefire agreement, Israel in this case, saying that it is going to unilaterally enforce this deal and strike at Hezbollah whenever it feels like it needs to for its self-defense purposes. And that, of course, could ultimately lead to questions about whether or not Israel is violating the ceasefire by carrying out those actions. Israeli officials say that they have an understanding with U.S. officials about the actions that they can and cannot take in Southern Lebanon. But, of course, all of this is potentially complicating additional layer on top of this agreement. The other question is whether or not this agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, the ceasefire in the north could ultimately lead to a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli prime minister also saying that he believes that is increasingly possible now, at least a deal that would free the hostages because he believes that Hamas is feeling increasingly isolated by this deal. U.S. officials are of the same view. And President Biden said last week that he is now going to push for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What was the fascination, what drove you to want to makethis documentary and take us back to those times? NICOLA CAULFIELD, DIRECTOR, \"THE RUBBER-KEYED WONDER\":  Well, I grew up with a ZX Spectrum and I absolutely adored it. You know, it really -- the whole thing just takes me back to the '80s, to growing up, being in my mom and dad's front room, programming away. And I actually have my Spectrum here. So, what it was, our first film that we did was called \"From Bedrooms to Billions.\" And there came a point within that film that we could touch on the Spectrum, but we couldn't actually go into as much detail as we wanted to. So, it was always something that we really wanted to come back, revisit it, and do a whole film that was all about Sir Clive Sinclair and the ZX Spectrum, plus all the other things that he actually invented as well.",

No, I think it's pretty sensitive British design and an idea, but it's -- it also captured the imagination of the people in the United Kingdom because it was low-cost technology. It was -- it obviously was an innovation in the fact that it was the first time we had a low-cost computer that suddenly could be at all across homes across the U.K. and kids embraced it and they sort of wanted to create their own titles, their own games from it. And I think it was more of a -- it was like a sort of rock and roll for the -- as the baby boomers had in the -- obviously, those born in the '40s and '50s.

I mean, certainly with the with the calculators, you know, prior to him inventing his pocket calculator, they were these great big things that sat on your desk and were plugged in.

Georgia's ruling party halted the accession talks with the E.U. after accusing it of blackmail and trying to organize a revolution. Opinion polls suggest show 80 percent of Georgians are in favor of joining the E.U. The Meta boss, Mark Zuckerberg, had dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump. What they discussed isn't clear, but a Meta spokesman tells us Zuckerberg was grateful for the opportunity to meet members of the incoming administration. Donald Trump previously accused Zuckerberg of plotting against him and threatened him with life in prison if he did anything, in his words, illegal during the election. And Delta Airlines is investigating a stowaway and how they managed to fly from JFK to Paris without a boarding pass on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The passenger evaded multiple airport security checks and according to one passenger hid in the toilet on board. How the person got on board? Still not known.
