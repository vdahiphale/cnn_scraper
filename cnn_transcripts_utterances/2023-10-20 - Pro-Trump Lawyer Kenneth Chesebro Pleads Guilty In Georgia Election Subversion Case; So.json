They said his legal team was not going to get what they hoped would be a preview of the Fulton County criminal case. They hoped that when prosecutors put on trial Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, they'd be able to suss out the weakest parts of this case and prepare a more robust defense for their client. Now that there are two plea deals, they're not going to have that. And that's what I was told was the biggest problem. But, Dana, that was before we heard this in court. So I'm absolutely going to follow up and see what they think because they were likely expecting something similar to what we heard from Sidney Powell yesterday, which was effectively a slap on the wrist. She was pleading guilty to misdemeanors. Trump's name wasn't mentioned. But this, he's pleading guilty to a felony and admitting in open court that he conspired with others, including their client, former President Trump to subvert the Electoral College process.

It does not bode well for them.Also pay attention to John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani. These are both individuals that Kenneth Chesebro could provide testimony about with respect to the crafting of what was called the fake electors scheme. All of them played some role therein. And Chesebro could provide a tremendous amount of valid -- valuable testimony there in that process. And I -- and frankly, I would think that that's far more prosecutors are interested in than testimony that Chesebro could provide about Donald Trump. The other thing that I would note here is that it is a felony, and Paula mentioned this a moment ago as well. Sidney Powell pled guilty to a number of misdemeanors. Pleading guilty or being convicted of a felony carries a number of restrictions on somebody's rights. It could affect his right to vote. It could affect his right to own a firearm until restored by the governor of the state. So this is quite significant for him and all the other defendants around him.",

There is a difference of opinion about whether or not he already has the authority. Obviously, this list that Speaker McCarthy put together was enacted after September 11th to ensure continuity of government. Patrick does not believe, and the parliamentarian does not believe, that he has the full powers of the speakership.

Appreciate it.And I've got some great reporters here who have been very patient in waiting while you're doing. I know you're reporting on your phones. Seung Min, this -- we've covered a lot of this. I've covered this building on and off for three decades. I mean, nothing even comes close to the dysfunction that we are seeing right now. I mean, because usually there's maybe some solution that's up down the road that we just know we have to get down the road to get there.",

Kick us out of the conference. Punish us, censure us, but just please vote for Jim Jordan. And people like Mike Lawler are saying, no, that's not going to happen.",

And I think this is one of those moments where we should just step back and remember what John Boehner calls all of this, which was the Chaos Caucus.And there were a number of people who came to Congress not to legislate, but to cause chaos. They are like the dog that caught the car, OK? Now they are near the pinnacle of power. We're kind of peak cresting here, chaos, and they don't have a platform to govern. When you listen to Jim Jordan this morning, he was talking about the Wright Brothers. He wasn't talking about what his platform is or what he's accomplished, because he hasn't -- doesn't have any bills to his name. And this is a defining moment for the Republican Party.
