A political bombshell in the United States, the federal prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden, son of the president, has been appointed a special counsel in that case. We will of course, explain that. And Russia is keeping up its deadly attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine. We're live on the ground for the very latest. Well, we begin this hour on the Island of Maui, once a tropical paradise, and now this. It's just a matter of days, this is all it remains, really, of the historic town of Lahaina. It's buildings, as you can see there, reduced to rubble. The county mayor says it's simply -- it's all gone. You can see ash there. The wildfires have killed at least 55 people on the island. That number, unfortunately, is expected to rise, as recovery efforts continue. Fires are still burning, but the main blaze is now largely contained. And winds are due to die down over the weekend. Some reprieve there. But for the residents of the island, the true scale of the destruction is coming into focus. Our chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir says it looks like a bomb is gone off. He shows it's just some of the devastation. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, when that interface connects, all of a sudden, you have a wildfire that blows into a town or a city. It happens every time we lose major population centers because of a fire, typically it doesn't start in a city, it starts outside of the city, and blows into the city. And in this case, those winds were 120 kilometers per hour. So think about how fast those winds were blowing embers to the next house, to the next, and to the next. So things have really helped a little bit here, as Dora has moved away, that hurricane, and the high pressure to the north has also moved away. So the winds are nearly what they were on those days of the fire. We're talking about 30 kilometers per hour right now. A normal day, you're always going to get 20, because it's a trade wind, and that's what we always expect. We're not going to get really any significant rain here, whatsoever, over the next couple of days. It's not a big system coming at all. So, this is the west side of Maui, a very dry area. Well, why is it dry? It's dry because it's a rain-shadow effect. I'm going to draw on this map, do a little bit of show-and-tell. The wind from those trades comes in, in this direction, right through here, blows up the hill and it rains on top. But all of a sudden, it doesn't rain down here, because the air is already dried out, and the rain has already gone. What else happened here? There are canyons on this part of Maui, that may have funneled the wind right down to Lahaina, which is right there, and look at the canyons on top of this extinct, very old volcano, all the way down through here, there's a canyon, right through here, there's a canyon. And this is the area that picked up those winds that were so very strong. So, this funneling effect may also have had a significant impact on why so much of this land and population center burned. Significant drought in the area has been there for a while, winds picking up a spark and ember, we know that there are power poles that are down. If there are power poles that are down, that means power lines came down. Likely power lines that were still energized, creating sparks. So, here we go, things are good until I think the middle of next week when another low center is south of Hawaii. And that may pick up the winds to 50 to 60. Not where they were at 100 to 220, but if things are still even glowing embers out there, we could pick up some of these flames. There's just -- there's just -- Isa, there's not much left to burn. I mean, literally, singularly, you look at the satellite pictures, the overheads, the houses are gone. What we thought in our nighttime video, well, were just embers and hotspots that were burning trees, were not burning trees. That was just the remnants of what was left of a house. It was just a big, bright, red spot. And you thought, oh, that's just a tree that burnt. No, that was somebody's livelihood. That was somebody's home. That was somebody's business, was -- it's insane. It's incredibly sad to think about where they are right now.",

And there were two assassination attempts targeting the mayors of two cities.

Their sign says, \"give me back my home.\" The flood was caused by floodwater discharge, not by heavy rainfall. At some point, men with police shields dispersed the crowd. The incident took place after deadly floods caused by the heaviest rains to hit northeastern China in 140 years, a typhoon that killed dozens of people in and around the Chinese capital, Beijing, forcing the evacuation of more than a million people from their homes. Over the last two weeks, these three provinces all saw dramatic flooding, but we're learning that some communities weren't just damaged by a natural disaster. The small city of Bazhou, where the protests took place, was deliberately flooded by authorities, following a government disaster plan aimed at protecting bigger cities like Beijing and Tianjin. (voice-over): At 2:00 a. m. on August 1st, authorities activated a flood- controlled plan, releasing water from dams into flood storage and detention zones. They then had to evacuate more than 800,000 people living in those zones, which quickly flooded. State TV showed the Communist Party Chief of Hubei Province touring the disaster area, instructing subordinates to reduce flooding pressure on Beijing and vowing to resolutely be the capital's moat.

Let me start off with getting your reaction to the scenes of true devastation coming out of Maui. I mean, whole communities scorch, Mayor. Your reaction to what we have seen in Hawaii.",

And this is why based on what we experienced earlier with wildfires here in Quebec, and it did affect the quality of air even in New York, for example. What is happening in Hawaii is disturbing and terrible. And that just gives me just more and more examples of why we need to act stronger and faster on climate change.",

But at one point, there has to be things that people love, like I said, parks and trees. But we need to have that will. We need to accept that climate change is going to affect us even worse if we don't act. And it is our role as political leaders to have this courage and to bring forward other people that have courage in the civic society, from the business network as well.

Right now, people are seeing the impact, for example, of all the fires and how it impacts their -- directly their health. And I think that's a way to show them we need to do something. But at one point, and I have to be very honest, it is a position where we need to say, even though this is not a popular measure, I have to do it. And I'm confident that with other mayors, and this is why the C40 Network, I want to bring it forward, it's so important because whatever it's Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, New York, London, Montreal, we're together saying we need to do the right thing for the future generation, not just for now.

So, we need to prepare the cities for all these new people, right, coming in.And for me, it's been how do I put measures forward that also contributes, for example, at the economic level, we've decided in Montreal to make business streets, big business streets, pedestrians. And at first, for example, businesses were like, we're going to lose money. It's not going to be interesting. It turns out they're making more money than ever. And so there's less cars, more space for pedestrians, better quality of air, but also good business affairs. So we need to come up with a strategy where there's a little bit for everything and to convene different actors. Because if I don't have the real estate with me, if I don't have the business network with me, if I don't have the institution with me, it's not going to work.

She essentially didn't let her let them take her down that lane and instead reminded them, these are what the orders are. You're agreeing to us that he's not going to be tampering with witnesses that he can abide by these rules. And so that's what Donald Trump's legal team was saying. But the overlay of this whole case is how fast it can go to trial. And so now that this evidence protection order is set up by the court, they can all start preparing for trial and the judge did signal that she's going to want things to move fast. And even they may need to move faster than the Trump team wants because one of the reasons that plays into her thinking is that if Donald Trump is escalating what he's saying, that's a good reason to have a trial quickly. Justice Department wants it as soon as January. But we're not going to get a date until probably the end of this month.",

Donie O'Sullivan is at the conference in Las Vegas. Donie. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Isa. We are here in Las Vegas for DEFCON. It's one of the world's largest hacking conventions. And this year, a lot of the focus here is on AI. Obviously, we have seen an explosion in artificial intelligence over the past year, especially with apps like ChatGPT. What we're going to see is thousands of hackers are going to try and basically break chat GPT and other AI apps from Google and Meta. And they're going to try and see if these apps will do things they shouldn't. These apps have been designed to not, you know, promote misinformation, to not spew hate speech, and to not give out dangerous information. We saw researchers at Carnegie Mellon University here in the U.S. a few weeks ago have managed to trick ChatGPT into giving us instructions to hot wire a car for instance. You might think the companies would be against this sort of thing, that they wouldn't want hackers doing this, but instead they actually really want them to do this and they want to hear from the hackers.
