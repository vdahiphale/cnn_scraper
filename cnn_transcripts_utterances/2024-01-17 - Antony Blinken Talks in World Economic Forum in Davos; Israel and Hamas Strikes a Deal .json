We don't know exactly where in the process that delivery of medication actually is. But yesterday, the Qatari government said that planes would be flying from Doha, Qatar to Egypt today in order to transfer that medication, then via land, through the Rafah Crossing to Palestinian health ministry officials inside the Gaza Strip. From there, getting it to Hamas, which is going to be providing the aid directly, we're told to some 40 hostages. Many of these hostages are those who have chronic medical conditions that existed before they were taken into captivity. And over the course of these more than 100 days of captivity, many of them have not had access to the kind of medication that they need to treat some of their -- those conditions. Now, in exchange for the medication being provided to the hostages, Israel has agreed to allow more humanitarian aid and medication into what we're -- we understand are some of the most affected areas of the Gaza Strip, though it's not exactly clear exactly how much aid that actually is. What we do know certainly is that the conditions on the ground certainly require a lot more humanitarian aid. When you look at the numbers of Palestinians who are displaced, the numbers who are dealing -- who are now facing famine, it's clear that much, much more is still needed. I think one of the major questions that now remains is what exactly is going to come of this deal to provide the medication. Is this some kind of a confidence building measure that could lead to some kind of a broader deal to free additional hostages? Something that we know U.S., Israeli, Qatari officials, Egyptian officials have been working on for weeks now. Or is this some kind of a standalone situation? That remains to be seen. Of course, the families of those 100 plus hostages who still remain in captivity have been really ratcheting up the pressure, especially as we hit that 100-day mark over the weekend, and they would also like to see some kind of proof that this medication actually reached the hostages who need it the most.",

Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was a moment of decision pain and trauma for many Israelis. The end of Gush Katif, a cluster of Israeli settlements in Gaza dismantled by the government in 2005. Thousands of settlers forced out of their homes under the disengagement law that saw an end to Israel's presence in the Gaza Strip. But after nearly two decades of yearning for return, the movement to do so now appears more emboldened than ever. Among no less than Israeli troops themselves. Social media is now awash in images like these, one of Israel's most popular musicians to the cheers of troops sings about that return. And moving the Nova festival, scene of a Hamas massacre to Gaza's beaches. From inside Gaza, soldiers proudly displaying the orange color of protest against the 2005 disengagement.

Now, it's very questionable as to whether or not that would be the case. Potentially Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is autonomous but could well pull back.

The third strike from U.S. Navy trying to target some of those anti-ship missiles, which the Houthis are using to a fair effect in the Red Sea.

And we believe a humanitarian ceasefire is necessary to facilitate the liberation of hostages. And independently of that, hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally. To take hostages is unacceptable in any conflict. But we need it also in order to be able to provide effective humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza that is suffering in a desperate situation. With starvation progressing in a terrible way. I mean, it's unimaginable. The living conditions in Gaza, I mean, it's really hell on earth. And so, without a humanitarian ceasefire, it will be impossible to organize effectively the distribution of humanitarian aid. And then I believe that a humanitarian ceasefire would facilitate a serious negotiation for de- escalation in Lebanon. We cannot have, in Lebanon, another Gaza Strip. And it is essential to avoid an escalation in Gaza that could be an absolutely devastating conflict. We need to have freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. I mean, a lot of things need to be avoided.

I actually did go there myself for surgery a couple of years ago, and it's very private. I didn't see or hear another patient while I was there. It's very quiet, very private. I mean, she couldn't have found a more private quiet place. But -- so, I hope that, you know, obviously her recovery is very smooth. And I think we do hope to see perhaps maybe a few online engagements, maybe in February or March when she feels a bit more recovered. But, you know, as with recovery, you just can't push it. So, we are wishing her all the best.",
