The District Attorney Fani Willis has said she would like to do the arraignments for all 19 defendants the week of September 5.Now in his federal cases, this all happened at once. He was processed and then he went before a judge to enter his plea. But here in Georgia, things happen at a slightly different pace. Now after that initial week or two of arraignments, the defendants actually have a short window of time to file certain challenges to their case. Now several defendants, including Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, they have already challenged their cases trying to get these state level cases moved to federal court. Now the former president has signaled that he will likely try to do the same. Rudy Giuliani may also try that move. So that process will take quite some time to play out. The next thing that's going to happen though is on Monday, there will be a hearing for Mark Meadows' efforts to move it to federal court. We expect that the focus of that hearing is going to be that infamous call between former president Trump and former Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That District Attorney Fani Willis has dismissed any suggestion by Meadows that what he was doing is just part of his job as chief of staff and that this should not be prosecuted. Now it'll be interesting to see what the judge does here. But if Meadows does not succeed, he'll be back with the other defendants here in Fulton County as this case proceeds. But for a RICO case of this size and complexity, it could take years for a final resolution. Paula Reid, Fulton County, Georgia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What happens with that as we know is that because he exercised his right for a speedy trial, now his case is going to end up being separated from the other 18 other defendants.So what we're looking at possibly is several different trials. It's not going to be all 19 defendants at the same time. It's going to be staggered out. Also many things can happen. Defendants can plead out. Meaning they plead guilty. You can have defendants that actually going to cooperate with the district attorney's office and testify against each other. And ultimately you will have those that won't plead guilty and are going to exercise their right for a trial. As of now we know Donald Trump is going to delay this trial as much as possible. You heard on one of his cases he is asking for a trial date when? In 2026. Highly unlikely it's going to happen in 2026, but his trial definitely one of them should be going forward out of the four sometime in 2024, hopefully before the election. This case itself is very important for the people of this country, so hopefully this case can move along.",

Because you need the right team in order to be able to assess and maneuver these different trials that are going on.So the right fit for one case won't be the right fit for another case.
