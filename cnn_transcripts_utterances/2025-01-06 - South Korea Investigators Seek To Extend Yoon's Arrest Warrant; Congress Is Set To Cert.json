Yoon is accused of abuse of power, leading an insurrection of his brief botched attempt to impose martial law last month. Police and protesters both in sport of and against Yoon have gathered near his official residence in Seoul. These are live images Just past 3:00 our local time there in the afternoon. The warrant for Yoon set to expire at midnight local time, nine hours from now. These protests have been going on all part all over the weekend. They look set to continue for some time. Still, investigators tried to arrest him on Friday, but they were prevented by the impeached president's personal security detail. Amid all of the turmoil, the U.S. Secretary of State has arrived in Seoul and during a meeting with the acting president, he told her the U.S. has faith in the power of Korean democracy. According to the State Department, Antony Blinken is working to reaffirm the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea, as well as discussing ways to build on their cooperation. Blinken is the first high level U.S. Official to visit South Korea during this month long political chaos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We had serious concerns about some of the actions that President Yoon Suk. We communicated those directly to the government. At the same time, we have tremendous confidence in the resilience of South Korea's democracy, in the strength of its institutions and in the efforts that it's making to work through those institutions pursuant to the constitution and the rule of law, to resolve differences and to do so peacefully.

But the problem here is that the anti-corruption agency does not have the jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges, and they don't have the jurisdiction to issue and execute a detention warrant, which is why we're seeing this issue.

You're seeing various political parties interpret the law, the South Korean laws, and spin it to their political liking. And the key here right now is to allow the courts to actually and the law to actually play out and separate politics from it.

And now the U.S. Congress set to meet four years after the attack on the Capitol, this time to certify Donald Trump's election victory. Monday's certification will mark a striking political turnaround for Donald Trump, who is widely condemned even by prominent supporters for his actions or lack of actions on the day of that Capitol attack.President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday he still believes Trump's actions were a genuine threat to democracy, but says he's hopeful we're beyond that. Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, will fulfill her duties as president of the Senate and preside over the counting of electoral votes from each state in today's joint session. For many political commentators and critics of Donald Trump, his political future ended January 6, 2021. His poll ratings sank in the aftermath of the violent attack, but over the past four years, they've made a remarkable recovery. CNN reporters Harry Anton and Marty Raju break down the numbers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Remember, after January six, what do we have? We had the impeachment of Donald Trump, and then, of course, we had the trial in the United States Senate. I want you to take a look at Republicans who voted to impeach or convict Trump in a second impeachment or impeachment trial. You know, you go back to January, February of 2021. What was it? It was 17. That's a significant chunk of folks, right, Manu? Most of the GOP didn't, but 17 is a pretty big number here.",

I'm John Vause.The head of U.S. Homeland Security is warning of what he calls a heightened threat environment following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans. It comes with several high-profile potential targets this month, including Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. But officials say there are no specific threats surrounding any major event. The concerns come from continued instability in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, as well as significant increase in violent extremism domestically in the United States. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have not only the persistent threat of foreign terrorism that, of course, created the Department of Homeland Security, but we have adverse nation states. We're very concerned about the instability that has resulted from that. And whether, in fact, it creates some space for the reemergence of ISIS in Syria. And ISIS continues to seek to radicalize individuals outside of the Middle East and throughout the world and that is something that we are, of course, also very focused on. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. In fact, congestion pricing has been in the works here in New York City for at least a decade but it's faced a lot of political opposition and obstacles in recent years. In fact, it still remains deeply unpopular in the New York City suburbs and in New Jersey, which sued to stop the program at the last minute. They were unsuccessful in that lawsuit.So early on Sunday morning, at the stroke of midnight, congestion pricing officially went into effect here in the big apple. Now, it is exactly what it sounds like. It is a congestion pricing tolling structure designed to alleviate congestion and traffic here in New York City. It's also intended to raise public funds for the city's public transit system. And eventually it is supposed to significantly decrease gridlock in what is one of the most congested zones in the entire world. Now, this is a first-of-its-kind program here in New York City. No other city in the United States has done this before. In fact, many other cities around the world have implemented similar programs, including places like London. Now, how much is it going to cost New Yorkers? Well, if you drive a passenger vehicle, it's going to cost you at least $9 on weekdays to come into the city from the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. and on weekends, it's going to cost you $9 between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Now, if you drive in during the off-peak hours, it will be significantly less. And if you drive a commercial vehicle or a truck, it will also vary in price. Now more than 700,000 vehicles are estimated to enter the tolling area on a given weekday, so that is where a lot of this revenue is expected to come from. Now, officials here in New York City, especially in the suburbs, have been in opposition to this program. And even President-Elect Donald Trump has said that he will cancel the program when he takes office on January 20th. He has called it a regressive tax, saying he believes it will hurt families, workers and businesses here in New York City. But the MTA chairman, who is in charge of administering this program, responded to that criticism on Sunday. Take a listen.",
