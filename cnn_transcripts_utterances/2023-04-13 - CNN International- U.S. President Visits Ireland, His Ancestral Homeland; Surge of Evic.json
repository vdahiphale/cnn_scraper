      "sentences": "Clare Sebastian thank you so much. Applying all of the caveats that you outlined, this is just the most visible and horrific display of what humanity can be capable of.North Korea has fired another ballistic missile, and this one triggered an evacuation warning from Hokkaido, Japan. That warning was later lifted, but Japan's government said it was not a false alarm and that it was meant to inform people about possible dangers like falling objects from the missile. By CNN's count, this is the 12th day this year that North Korea has fired one or more missiles. Right now, a severe tropical cyclone is barreling towards western Australia, where it makes landfall in the coming hours. It's expected to be one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in more than a decade and is currently headed towards the coast with the strength of a category four hurricane. Authorities are piling up sandbags and residents are being urged to get to safer ground. From delicate diplomacy to a big dose of nostalgia. We're live in Dublin with the next stops on Joe Biden's tour of Ireland. Plus, high inflation and rising rents lead to a surge in evictions in the U.S. Hear from some Americans finding themselves priced out of their homes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

There's only been -- well, he will be the fourth us president, Kennedy, Reagan, Clinton who've done that here. So, I think the very fact that he'll be making a speech there to highlight those Irish ties, to highlight the connections with the United States, speaks to his sense of himself as being of one of those 1 in 10 in the United States, who really feels that they have strong Irish roots. And making those connections with real feeling.Because it comes with President Biden, it comes from the heart. The practicalities of what he might achieve. Well, he might achieve endearing himself to those 1 in 10 Americans, which of course, is important come elections next year. But I think at a practical level for the president, this really is a trip that has been wanting to make as president. He came vice president. It's been important for him to try to shape the narrative over Northern Ireland. But here it will be, as you say, about affirming those roots. Affirming their ties. There are so many American companies here that are investing in the Republic of Ireland that see the Republic of Ireland also as part of their roots and ties. And I think that's what we'll hear the president expressing today. But it will really, I think, a speech that will come from the heart.",

Stocks gave up earlier gains Wednesday after minutes from the Fed's march meeting. Revealed fallout from the recent banking crisis could push the U.S. economy into a recession. But new economic data shows positive signs. The pace of U.S. consumer price increases continue to cool down in March from last summer's red-hot levels. Annual inflation dropped for the ninth consecutive month. And we're also seeing positive signs for prices at the grocery store. Food prices finally dropped in March, falling for the first time since September of 2020. But housing costs remain sky high, and millions of Americans are falling behind on their rent and mortgage payments.

But now officials are concerned about another drug called xylazine that is sometimes mixed with it. On Wednesday, the Biden administration declared this combination an emerging threat in the U.S. And that's because the mix of those two drugs has been linked to the skyrocketing number of overdose deaths. Xylazine is an animal sedative. It's not meant to be used by humans. A top anti drug officials says the declaration will put drug traffickers on notice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. RAHUL GUPTA, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY: Xylazine is one of the contaminants into fentanyl. But there could be others. So, I think with declaration of emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we're going to respond quicker. We're going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply. And then we're going to protect lives first and foremost. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to walk off their jobs and protests in the streets against President Emmanuel Macron's push to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.
