And, you know, one official told me that they completely understand that many people - they basically did become very comfortable being in these kids of settings, in a hotel setting in Manhattan. It was close to any potential job opportunities. However, city officials also are very aware of their legal obligation to house families and mothers with children in those kinds of private environments, in those hotel rooms. So, the reality is, they are the ones that have to take a priority when it comes to offering those kinds of accommodations.As for the single men, these asylum seekers, city officials maintain that this is the best they can come up with right now given what is still a very challenging and fluid situation, which is this large barracks-style housing facility. And I spent all day yesterday speaking to these migrants outside of the Watson Hotel, many of whom say, you know what, they're going to -- they'd rather sleep on a sidewalk than come here. And it's not necessarily about comfort, it's about convenience. Many of their potential job opportunities are in Manhattan. So, being relocated to this part of Brooklyn, a cruise ship terminal that is not very easy to get to if you don't have transportation, that just presents yet another obstacle. So, it really is a very complicated situation, not only for these adult male migrants that are being asked to relocate from Manhattan here to Brooklyn, but also for the city that's trying to keep its head above water when it comes to finding housing for well over 70,000 homeless people. This includes those chronically homeless and also the tens of thousands of recently arrived asylum seekers. I want you to hear directly from Mayor Eric Adams as he actually visited this particular site here, trying to put any concerns among those asylum seekers at ease. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: I just had to come here when I started hearing all the rumors about it is too cold. My brother got on shorts. (INAUDIBLE). It's warm inside. About the food not being there. You know, healthy food is present. Even the snacks are healthy. We just need to stop the anxiety. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You go like this for 100 days and you will have actually saved $5,050, right, on the 100th day you're putting it - so, that's - that is saving money. But in 100 days a lot of people don't even make $5,000. So, you know, this is - you're putting all of your saving for the year into 100 days. And it looks like it has results.
