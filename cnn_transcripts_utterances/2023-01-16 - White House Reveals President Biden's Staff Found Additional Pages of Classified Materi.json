We sell treasuries, we sell things that the rest of the world gobbles up because we are so good at paying our bills. People want to own American debt because we don't break our promises and we have such a stellar reputation.When you fight about paying your bills, when you fight about not raising the debt ceiling, that starts to undermine your credibility. It's sort of like a credit card limit, if you want to put it into your household finances terminology, it would be like your credit card limit. And of course, we can't just arbitrarily raise our own credit card limit. That's how the United States is different than our own personal finances.

If you are serious about spending and not racking up so much debt, you have to spend less or tax more, some combination of that, and grow the economy. When the economy grows you can also limit how much debt you're racking up.But the answer is not to, after you have already passed the spending and tax laws, to then say, oh, we're not going to pay for that. That is dangerous, that is a self-inflicted potential crisis when the United States does that.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:16:58]  DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Since we had been reporting here over the weekend, White House lawyers reveal the President's staff discovered five additional pages of classified material during a search of Biden's private home in Delaware. That brings the total number of classified documents recovered to about 20. Now the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer has sent a demand letter to the White House to turn over evidence for a congressional investigation. He is defending his decision to focus on -- focus the probe on President Biden and not the former President Donald Trump. Let's discuss now. Joining us a Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. We're so glad to have you here. And I'm interested to know what you think about this. Because over the weekend, five additional pages of classified information found at Joe Biden's residence in Wilmington, Delaware. How concerned are you about that? And are you satisfied with the Attorney General that he has now appointed a Special Counsel to investigate this? REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY):  Well, I think obviously, when you look at the former President and the current President, the bottom line is this: Classified documents should not be in anybody's home. They shouldn't be leaving the White House. They should be returned back to the National Archives, et cetera, and I think you need to have consistency on this. And so if there was a Special Prosecutor appointed in the case of the former President, then there needed to be a Special Prosecutor appointed here to investigate this. And it's not enough to just say, oh, the intent wasn't there. Well, how do we know what the intent was? You know, and the fact that you have classified documents on Iran, on Ukraine sitting next to a Corvette, yes, that's a bit of an issue. And I think the current president should not be so flip about it, especially given his comments when Mar-a-Lago was raided and you know, his comments suggesting, well, I can't imagine how this could possibly happen.
