So far, and that includes senior most former White House and administration officials, never believed the president when he said he wasn't going to pardon his son but their view was basically, its exactly what you said Hunter is his son, and he was always going to be his father, who would have wanted to do anything to protect his son. One former senior West Wing aide just to give you a taste of the kinds of things I'm hearing, they said this: Anyone who was even close to the top knew that he was probably going to do this. Why did we pretend otherwise? I think the widespread view right now is that at least the hypocrisy criticism was avoidable, that there were many things that the president could have said as an alternative to. I am not going to do this. Like, you know, I'm not focused on that right now. I just want to focus on being a supportive father.

The Supreme Court has never said that you can pardon someone without an indictment. Supreme Court has said you can't pardon someone for a crime that's never even happened yet.

They could have simply said to MJ's point to Chuck's point, the president isn't going to put his thumb on the scales of justice. He's going to wait. He hasn't made a decision yet. Most people would have expected that. They would have respected that. I think most people, to your point, Chuck believe if it was my child, I probably would have done the same thing. That's not the issue, Jake. The question here, the burden on the White House, I would argue is the continuous lies. You said that you were better than this other guy. You criticized the other guy for all of these things. And now, your DOJ is committing witch hunts and this is now politicized, where you appointed Merrick Garland. You can't blame Republicans for that. And I can only imagine, as I've talked to a lot of Republicans, if this were Donald Trump and I know people are going to give him a lot of criticism for the pardons he's already given. But if this were him and Don Jr. or Eric Trump or Ivanka I can only imagine what the headlines would have been.

But Patel is also controversial even among Trump's inner circle.A lot of people kind of see him as this sort of relentless self- promoter. He really pushed himself for a role in this administration. You know, but ultimately, he was successful. Donald Trump has been very clear that he wants people who are fiercely loyal to him, especially in this role, that the FBI, the Justice Department and the intelligence and Kash Patel certainly fits that bill -- Jake.",

And, you know, first, I've been talking with sources inside the FBI, many different people and a lot of them wanted to dispel this myth that some other networks have apparently been reporting and that's, you know, FBI agents are scared or afraid.I mean, these are dogged people that put their heads down. They do their work. But what I am hearing is there is grave concern in two respects. The first, you just mentioned their potential impact on investigations in this case, someone like Patel, who as Sara reported, an extreme Trump political loyalist. Would he try to get FBI employees to investigate Trump's opponents? Would he try to stop any investigations that begin within Trump's orbit? That is a major question. And then second, it comes down to independence. You know, historically, there has been this at distance that a White House would keep the FBI because this is a powerful law enforcement agency. People may not realize that the FBI doesn't brief the White House on every investigation that it conducts. And that's because a lot of times, they could be investigating political opponents or political loyalists of a president. The big question here is what will that independence look like? How would that be impacted? And then finally, I just want to read one line from this great, insightful piece that Elaina wrote recently on Patel what she said in talking to, you know, sources around Trump world is that people called Patel dangerous not because he would come in on day one as FBI director or CIA director with a plan but because he appeared to have no plan at all, his priorities today always subject to a mercurial president's wishes tomorrow. That's the big question. How far would he go for Trump?",

He -- Trump really wanted to promote him at one point to deputy FBI director. Then there was deputy CIA director. I mean, various senior positions that were it not for people like CIA Director Gina Haspel or Attorney General Bill Barr, who the latter, of course, said, over my dead body to the idea of Kash being promoted to deputy FBI director. Without people like that in this administration and Trump has made clear he has no desire to install the, quote/unquote, guardrails that populated his first administration, I don't think there's any doubt that whether its as FBI director or some other highly powerful position -- Kash Patel, we will see him try to use whatever means he has to launch or at least try to launch investigations into many of the people that are listed in that appendix of his book.",

Less than a month ago, they were at the White House meeting with President Biden, urging him to advocate for their sons safe return home. And today, of course, all of that came crashing down as they learned this news. Four of the seven Americans who are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas are now confirmed dead by the Israeli government. Their bodies still being held as bargaining chips by Hamas. That leaves the families of three Americans still holding out hope that perhaps their loved ones will indeed come back alive. One of those families is the family of Edan Alexander, who is also an Israeli-American. He emerged this weekend in a hostage video posted by Hamas, speaking obviously under duress. He urged Prime Minister Netanyahu, but also President-elect Trump to work to secure his release and the release of other hostages being held in Gaza. And sure enough, today we did indeed hear from President-elect Trump, who is bringing more pressure to bear as some of these hostage and ceasefire negotiations appear to be quietly restarting behind the scenes. But in his message, President-elect Trump said that there will be all hell to pay for those holding the hostages if they are not released by the time he is inaugurated.
