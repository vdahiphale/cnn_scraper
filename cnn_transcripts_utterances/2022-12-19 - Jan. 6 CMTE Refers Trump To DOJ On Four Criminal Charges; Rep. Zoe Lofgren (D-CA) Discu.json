      "sentences": "Nearly two years after the U.S. Capitol was violently attacked, the January 6 Select House Committee is recommending that Donald Trump be prosecuted on four criminal charges. The panel laying out extensive evidence for the Justice Department and for the public making the case that then-President Trump was ultimately chiefly responsible for the insurrection.We're back with our live coverage of the unprecedented criminal referrals against Donald Trump that were announced during the final public meeting of the House Select Committee just a few minutes ago. Panel members concluding unanimously that there is more than sufficient cause to charge Trump with the very serious and frankly rare charge of assisting or aiding and insurrection. The Committee also recommending that Trump be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to make false statements, rounding out the for criminal referrals against Trump. A recommendation that he'd be charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, that stems from the efforts to thwart the certification of the 2020 presidential results on January 6th 2021. We're breaking down all the Committee's recommendations, what it means for the Justice Department's investigation. Sara Murray is on Capitol Hill for us right now. And Sara, the Committee just released the executive summary, 160 pages or so of its final report, which will be much, much longer. Break it down for us?",

That could also be of interest to the Department of Justice beyond these criminal referrals that they just did. I mean, one of them we heard a little bit about in the hearing and it's their concern that there were lawyers paid for by Donald Trump or allied groups that were incentivized to protect Trump rather than the witnesses.They lay out that in one case, a witness was told to say she didn't recall things when she actually did, when she brought up with her lawyer that there was territory she may go in that would be potentially look bad for Trump. The lawyer advised her, no, no, no, we don't want to go there. That is certainly something the committee took pains to lay out. They also pointed out that Donald Trump was contacting witnesses before their testimony to the Select Committee, writing in their executive summary. The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses, the Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances. They will also lay out in this executive summary a couple instances where they heard conflicting accounts of events from witnesses the Committee talked to. One of those - we remember Cassidy Hutchinson bombshell testimony. She said Tony Ornato sort of told her about this incident where Trump became irate, Ornato told the Committee he could not recall and in their executive summary, the Committee says over and over again, they have serious questions about Ornato's credibility.

That is a far cry from the department's standard to indict, which is we think there's enough evidence to prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt at trial and to sustain a conviction on appeal.

Does that mean I could prove they lied? No. But she was counseled not to tell the truth and it just seems some of this testimony seemed quite unbelievable.",

The House Select Committee essentially handing off to the Justice Department at its final public meeting.I want to bring in now our Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez. So Evan, they have laid this out. We have had the 11th and final hearing. What are you now learning about the likelihood that prosecutors of the DOJ will pursue what may be the most serious proposed charge from the Committee against Trump?",

It's a Civil War era law that has been rarely enforced in the United States. And for the Justice Department, it is something that they looked at as they began these investigations nearly two years ago into the Capitol attack.They have yet to use it to prosecute anyone for violating this law, Erin. And I'm told that one of the reasons is because there's so little case law for them to rely on. And there's a concern about whether this would be a successful prosecution, so it's one of the reasons, but there are hundreds and hundreds of people, of course, who have been charged with crimes related to January 6, none has been charged with this. And so that's going to be one that I think is going to be very, very challenging for the Justice Department, again, relying and looking at what the Committee turns over as far as their evidence. Just the letter - just reading the letter of the law that as it reads there really is something that I think they're going to have trouble with.",

Ironically, he would claim a First Amendment right to engage in political speech, which is what he was doing at that rally.Now, the Department of Justice would have to prove that the president's comments were directed at inciting imminent lawless action. In other words, they'd actually have to prove that he intended for a mob to engage in violent activity and that would be a hurdle prosecuting under that charge.",
