That's the one that we all have known about. Then you've got the $180,000 payment to Cohen. Now, what does that actually include? That includes what he would have to report for his reimbursements as income. And so, Trump, I let you take the tech (ph) on an extra $180,000 so that Cohen would still have the money he was owed after his taxes.Then you've got a $60,000 bonus as well to Cohen and apparently something about $50,000 to a tech company as well that helped to boost the polling and the ratings. You add all this up, and I'm hoping my math is correct here, and about $420,000. But you -- at the end of the day, you've got 11 invoices, 11 checks, and you've got the ledgers. But again, what's important to think about is the calendar year. All these different dates, all the different moments, it wasn't a one-time payment. It was intended to be tributed over time. Now, the whole core here is about these false entries, because if these were not actually legal fees, then you go right back over to what is being charged and what has to be proven here. You're talking about the intent to commit another crime, to defraud the other crime, et cetera, and this false entry, that's the key here. And we've got the documents that would be needed, of course, to do so. This is this witness talking about what they're seeing. They are talking about the handwritten notes. They're talking about the different bank statements as well. And again, this thing right now, McConney is saying that the red finch line item on the document is for tech services as we went back to the $50,000.",

Now, McConney is being shown an e-mail that he sent in February 2017, reminding Cohen to send an invoice.He also just testified that it was customary for employees to submit invoices to get reimbursed. Because they're talking about, you know, the $130,000 payment that Cohen made to Davidson, Keith Davidson, Stormy's lawyer. Then they're talking about how he's upset with his bonus. Then they're trying to offset some taxes. They're just throwing all these numbers down. I think what the prosecution really needs to do right now is go step by step through how these business documents were intentionally falsified. Because I think a lot of people, for example, you know, when Cohen has to submit this invoice, when we do our expenses, you know, you may not always be super specific or you could be general, right? Say, news gathering, instead of what assignment you're going to. So, right now, in this critical moment, prosecutors really need to slow their roll a bit and walk jurors through how they believe this was intentional falsifying of business records. COLLINS:  Karen, do you think it's confusing for the jury as they're walking them through, you know, as we've seen these detailed updates of how they're walking them through this evidence of the documents?",

When you when you put in an expense for something, you say what it is and you get reimbursed for it. That's very different than if you're getting paid income, right? And then you have to pay taxes on income. And so, that is going to be a critical piece here about what this is.

But I know in speaking with sources that the defense team also believes that McConnell will be a helpful witness to them to illustrate how uninvolved Trump was at that time.
