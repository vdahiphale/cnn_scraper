Walter Isaacson speaks to Michael Gordon, national security correspondentfor \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. And tonight, we have an extremely difficult, important, and highly compelling conversation in hugely unusual circumstances. Siamak Namazi is an Iranian American businessman imprisoned in Iran for over seven years. He spoke to me over the phone from inside the notorious Evin Prison, giving us a firsthand look at the desperation of foreign nationals, dual citizens detained in that country. I first interviewed Siamak back in the early 2000s during the reform era, a very different Iran then. He was a prominent businessman and an analyst trying to build relations between Iran and the U.S. Siamak was arrested during a 2015 business trip and convicted of cooperating with a hostile foreign government, only that government is the United States and he is a U.S. citizen. It's a conviction, of course, that he completely refused. In the following years, American detainees have been released as part of prisoner swaps with the United States. Siamak's own father who was also arrested in 2016 while trying to visit him in prison was released on medical grounds last October. But Siamak continues to languish in prison even going on a week-like -- a weeklong hunger strike back in January and writing a letter to President Biden. Now, he says, he feels so alone, so abandoned, and so out of options that he has decided to come to us, hoping to beseech Biden to help him and the other Iranian Americans. And here is our extraordinary phone conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The situation in the general ward is far better than the corner of hell that I used to be in, in the detention center. It's far from a pleasant place to be in, but everything becomes relative. It's still extremely difficult to bear the very basic fact that I am denied many of the rights of a prisoner because I'm a hostage. I don't know how to convey that. I see hardened criminals, I see members of members of Daesh, I see people who -- human traffickers have more rights than I do. And, I don't know, you know. So, yes, our general circumstances and the general ward are OK. And I would say that we do the best that we can to adapt to our circumstances. I personally take comfort, to use that word again, in the fact that I know that I am doing everything I can to fight this injustice. I want to say that my situation today is very different than the first 27 months of my arrest when I was still being held at this detention center. There, my situation was really precarious. I did not feel safe at all. And I want to mention that the Obama administration knew exactly, exactly how unsafe I was. I made sure of that. At that point, it seemed my captors had made it their mission to strip me of any semblance of human dignity. I spent months caged. I spent months caged in a solitary cell that was a size of a closet, sleeping on the floor, being fed like a dog from under the door. And honestly, that was a least of my troubles.

That deal didn't go through in the summer largely because the United States's position was that a deal on the prisoners should happen in tandem with the nuclear deal. The nuclear deal fell through in September of 2022. And then we ended up in a situation where, you know, you had the protests in Iran, their -- the relationships between Europe and Iran went sour. And it -- and western governments, the United States included, are now extremely skittish about any kind of a deal that would give Iran money because of the backlash in Congress and public opinion in the United States. And I hope that in addition to the White House people in Congress and media also hear your interview with Siamak and understand the gravity of the situation. Unfortunately, there is no way to release these prisoners without some kind of a deal. And ultimately, the White House has to make that decision, the Congress should support them. In the past few months, the government of Qatar has stepped in and has been negotiating in directly with both sides, trying to come up with mechanisms to ensure that the money that Iran would get would only and only be spent on pharmaceuticals and food issues, and that they would not -- Iran would not have access to that money freely. And as we are speaking, that deal has been going -- that negotiation has been going on for some time, it's probably towards the end. But when all the technicalities have been sorted out by the Qataris, between Tehran and Washington, of course, Tehran has to make a decision if they are going to sign. But it really comes down to President Biden also making the decision that he's going to sign and he's going to pay whatever political cost comes with criticisms in Congress domestically.

And so, there is an urgency to seeing this prisoner done because there's even larger issues attached to it. But look, President Biden, end of the day, made a prisoner deal with Russia, with a government that is killing civilians and destroying and pulverizing an entire country against international law and the president made a deal to -- for a prisoner exchange and brought back home an American prisoner that was held in Russia. And I think that Siamak is right, the president and -- of the United States should take that decision. Unfortunately, dealing with a government like that, of Iran, it means that they are not going to release these prisoners out of the kindness of their heart. They are going to want something in exchange. Yes, there is going to be criticism of President Biden if he does make that exchange. But the situation for Siamak and his fellow prisoners is grave. And ultimately, there is moral, political humanitarian responsibility for us to see this through. And there is -- as we're speaking, there is a process happening in Qatar. So, I am not privy to where that process is, but I know that at some point this process ends up on the desk of the president and the president has to sign. And I also do agree with Siamak that the administration has not really reached out to the families of the prisoners in the way that it should. It has met with many dissidents when the protests were going on in Iran. But it didn't take the step of actually talking to the families of those who are held in Iran. And I do think that there is an opportunity to -- at this moment in time, to use the Qatar process to finish this really, really horrendous ordeal that these prisoners have gone through in Iran and bring them home.",

These insurgent and militant forces didn't have an air force, they didn't really have affective surface to air capabilities. So, we had air dominance. None of that would apply in a war with China. Second of all, we had bases throughout the region from which we could project power, ground power, air, power and the like. And these bases were largely immune from enemy attacks, that also wouldn't be the case in a conflict with China. They'd go after our bases in Japan and Guam, from the get-go. So, the war against ISIS is a very similar. But there are some lessons, which is it in the war against ISIS we relied extensively on the Iraqi military, on Syrian forces to be the grand element. We didn't put a lot of American forces in combat. There were some, but not a lot. So, we let them do the main fighting. I think that's the way of the future for wars in the Middle East. Why is that? Because our main focus is going to be on China and Russia, and if we are going to have to tangle with militant forces in the Middle East, at least we're going to want to rely heavily on partners on the ground instead of our own troops. One exception would be if there is ever a war with Iran. But I think that one of the lessons is the war against ISIS showed how we need to fight in the Middle East if we are going to put most of our effort into deterring China and Russia.",

And he had recently been assigned from the Middle East to come back to the Pentagon and be one of the people planning the future of the air force. In fact, today, he is in charge of that task, these air force features is what the officers called. And he comes back he told me all on the record that, you know, he's -- when he first saw the results of the war game of how he would fare in a conflict with China, he's -- the expression he used was holy crap, you know.

Our naval base in Guam is going to come under attack immediately. This is going to interfere with our ability to replenish subs at seas, and subs are really important. Our ability to supply our own troops with logistics is going to come under fire, there is a terminology for this in the Pentagon, they call it contested logistics. None of that was true in our wars in the Middle East. Those -- we assemble forces over a period of six months. If you remember the Gulf War, you know, no one interfered with that. We pick a time on we want to initiate the conflict. And then, we did without any appearance. Well, that wouldn't hold in a war with China. So, what the General Hinote was pointing to was that these assumptions with regard -- guided the U.S. employment of force in previous conflicts would no longer obtained. Therefore, you need a totally new concept for how to do this. You need to have some forces that could survive within range of the Chinese missiles. That's what the marines are trying to do now. You have to have additional standoff capabilities, long-range missiles that you could fire from a safe distance into there. You have to integrate these capabilities and novel ways. So, it's not merely a matter of shifting our current military to another part of the world, it's a matter of coming up with what the Pentagon calls new operational concepts, new forces and new ways of employing the forces to deal with the threat that's entirely different from the one that we've been involved with for the past few decades. And then, you have to factor into this the possibility that, if Russia and China are not formal allies, if were caught up in a conflict in the Western Pacific, Russia might act opportunistically to pursue some aims in, let's say, Eastern Europe. And we know the Russians have had a hard going in Ukraine, but you still haven't prepared for the contingency that, let's say, a decade or two from now, they might strike out somewhere else, thinking we were bogged down in the Western Pacific.

But a lot of the weapons, number one, we are giving Ukraine from drawdowns from our own stocks, 155, artillery, shelves, javelins, things of that sort. I mean, those are not the kinds of weapons U.S. military is going to use in a war with China. We are not fighting a land war with China. We'd be operating with, you know, long-range anti-ship missiles or marine forces, you know, and anti-ship missiles and the like. Hypersonic missiles. We're not going to be fighting trench warfare with the Chinese. So, some of these weapons that are being provided to Ukraine are not relevant for a U.S. fight with. China. The second point I would make is, you know, the Russians have lost more than 1,000 tanks. They've lost a substantial part of their armed forces. They've had more than 100,000 killed and wounded. Their military capability has been diminished significantly. That's a positive thing from the U.S. perspective. So, yes, we've given Ukraine a lot of weapons but they've been used to diminish Russia's military capability, at least, conventional military capabilities to have enormous nuclear capability for, you know, a period of time. So, that is a net plus from a U.S. strategic standpoint. But here's the problem for the U.S. What the Ukraine war has shown is that in conventional conflict, weapons can be consumed at enormous rates. I think much more than the West anticipated. So -- and there is a problem with the American defense industrial base, and just keeping the weapons flowing. I mean, it's not enough to have small numbers of these things, you have to have massive numbers of these things to keep up the volume of fires. So, one of the hurdles to implementing the new strategy is to revamp the defense industrial base. I mean, take submarines, we're producing about 1.5 attack submarines a year. There's a deficit of submarines. Submarines are important in the Western Pacific. That's not a problem that's easy to quickly remedy. It is a product of concluding that the Cold War was over and spiking the ball in the end zone a little too soon. So, these are sort of the bigger challenges that have to be met, if you are really going to make this strategy real. It's one thing to announce the new strategy. The Trump administration did that. And so now has the Biden administrations. That's the easy part. The hard part is implementing the strategy and doing so consistently over a period of a decade and longer.",
