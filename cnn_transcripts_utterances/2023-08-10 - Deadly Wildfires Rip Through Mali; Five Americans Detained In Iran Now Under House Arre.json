I'll have those new numbers on US inflation in just a moment after I've updated you on what's going on in the US state of Hawaii.

It was actually softer than expected. And core inflation, what is really encouraging there is it cooled off for the fourth month in a row? Moody's Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi, he declared on Twitter that this was a \"great report.\" He said, if anything was softer than people had anticipated. And so I do think big picture here, Richard, this is going to give the Fed even more room to hold off and not raise interest rates when they meet again in September, and it does raise those hopes that the soft landing that many people thought was impossible could still happen.",

And why I'm so optimistic about the next winter is because there has been in the last 12 months, a lot of activity in order to diversify the sources. I'm looking at, especially to Italy, and therefore, I'm expecting the next winter should be okay, and they should also remind you that last winter, it was also okay, not really for the mild weather that contribute to for about one-third, but two-thirds of the reduction came from the action put in place by our governments.",

The challenge is that, for many West Africans, democracy hasn't necessarily led to economic development.
