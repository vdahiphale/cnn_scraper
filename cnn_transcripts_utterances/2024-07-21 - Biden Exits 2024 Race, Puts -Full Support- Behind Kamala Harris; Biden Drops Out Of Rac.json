JAKE TAPPER, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": President Biden has endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris, quoting President Biden now, quote, \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President, and it's been the best decision I've made. Today. I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats, it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" unquote.",

      "sentences": "Anderson, the President had remained defiant really only until the last 48 hours. What we are learning that played out behind the scenes is the President, who while self-isolating at his residence in Delaware, was also reflecting on the last several weeks. The President on Saturday had summoned his senior advisors to his Rehoboth Beach home, where they huddled and assessed the polling and also what Democratic lawmakers had been saying. And it was during that time, were told, that the President was starting to come to the decision that he was going to drop out of the race. He also, we're told, consulted with his family. Of course, they have been influential in almost every decision the President has made over the course of his long political career. And then it was on Sunday, as his top brass on the morning shows weresaying that he was in the race and he wasn't going anywhere, while in the early afternoon hours, the President notifying senior White House and senior campaign teams that he had in fact decided to drop out of the race, and then just minutes after, putting out that letter to -- publicly, saying that he was not going to seek reelection. Now importantly, shortly after he did so, he also put his entire support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that he is endorsing her to be the Democratic nominee, and urging the party to come together, particularly after a divisive last several weeks. Now, the Vice President herself, sources tell me, did not know until today that this was going to be the President's decision. The two spoke multiple times over the course of the day. And now, it is full steam ahead for the Vice President, who up until this point was fiercely defending the President and completely behind him. Aides told me multiple times that the two, there was no daylight between the two, as she was hitting the campaign trail. But now, today, she was working the phones, trying to get these endorsements, as she tries to secure the Democratic nomination. So, it has been a pivotal, remarkable day for this campaign. And really, Anderson, it shook White House officials and campaign officials who up until earlier today really thought the President was not -- wasn't going anywhere and that he was going to stay in this presidential race. So, certainly, a lot of people still absorbing this news as they prepare to put Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the party's ticket.",

It's an economy that's humming, a country that's recovered from COVID. America's reputation has been healed around the world. That's not to say there aren't still challenges, but it's a record we should run and she can do that.But, she also represents this bridge to the future. She, is the next generation. She is going to be the first woman President, a woman on the ticket in a moment when women's rights are under assault, a prosecutor running against a felon. She can run on the Biden-Harris record.

VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: There is going to be some process, and I think that's good. But, right now, it is for us to lose, because first of all, she has got a whip operation, second to none. All this past week, some of the best people in American politics, I want anybody's name out there have been calling people online, talking to delegates, talking to people on air, saying, listen, if this ball goes to Kamala Harris, she deserves a shot. And so, who has a whip operation like that? Nobody. Can you put one together that quickly? Maybe. But, she is definitely in the lead. I also think Republicans are about to have a little bit of a wake-up call. A lot of times, people get in these kind of circles and these echo chambers. They start believing the stuff that they say. And they think that just because they don't like Kamala Harris and they see her a certain way, the whole world is going to feel that way. But, there is a whole bunch of people who are just now googling Kamala Harris, just now trying to figure out what this is about. There is an opportunity on both sides to shape her.

KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, THE SOURCEbiggest announcements he made today, one, he is getting out of the race, but getting behind her. That has changed the trajectory of what the last six hours have looked like since he has dropped that letter. And what we were told is that, as of yesterday morning, he was still telling people full steam ahead with the campaign. That started to shift Saturday, as he was meeting with a top advisor, Steve Ricchetti, one of the closest of close advisors that Biden has. He called Mike Donilon, another other close advisor, summoned him to his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, house, and then had a few others on hand. And it was Saturday afternoon, I'm told, that he started to come to the decision that he was going to get out of the 2024 race. He made a few calls to other -- his chief-of-staff, Jeff Zients, other top advisors of his, and then he had a family meeting, which I think, if you know, Biden, that is exactly what he is going to do, and he is weighing a decision. Certainly, one is critical and is personal as this one. But, I'm told he didn't come to the final decision to leave this race until today, and that was when he phoned Vice President Harris and let her know that it was an official decision. So, when you talk about what this effort looks like, she hasn't had all that long to really wrap her head around the fact that she is now potentially going to be the Democratic nominee and that people are getting behind her. And so, when we talk about this, it's going really quickly. DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRES. OBAMA: You could see the trajectory of this thing, and there is no doubt that any of us who have been around politics knows. They have been quietly planning for this exigency for a while.

And there is a lot of reasons it might make you feel better if it happened. But all -- as you all pointed out, all the principal players have already decided they're going to support Kamala Harris. So, at this point, I'm going to defer to Elaine, because she knows far more about the rules than I do, and they've probably changed a bit in 20 years. But, at this point, from a political point of view, it hasn't even been 24 hours, and I think this thing is getting pretty close to being locked up.",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): We should host four town halls around the country, do a straw poll now of the 4,000 convention delegates, Democratic delegates. Vice President Harris should be automatically invited, and then three of the other top vote-getters to do a series of four town halls, introduce themselves to our delegates, to the country. It will legitimize her candidacy. It will energize the base of Democrats in this whole country and will also, in the words of Jim Clyburn, afford the opportunity to vet a likely vice presidential candidate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Josh Shapiro, the popular governor of Pennsylvania, look at Pennsylvania. That's a state Joe Biden won by just over a point last time. Can be Josh Shapiro help expand that lead? That's something that could be exciting for Democrats. Same story for Mark Kelly in Arizona here, a state that Biden won by less than a point last time, maybe Kelly on the ticket makes Arizona easier for a potential presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Now, North Carolina is interesting. North Carolina is -- was the closest state that Joe Biden lost to Donald Trump. Would Roy Cooper, the retiring governor in North Carolina, let Democrats go on offense in a state that Republicans had been winning? That might be attractive. Now, one face on this list right here, not like the others, and that's Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky. Kentucky is the state that Donald Trump just crushed Joe Biden last time, 25 points.

The Republicans can continue to argue this on the margins.

That ad is talking about Joe Biden's age, Joe Biden's failures, the things that Joe Biden was unable to do. One of the things Kamala Harris has to do when you go big in a campaign like this is make sure that you're forward looking and saying, look, it's not about what this country was or what it is, but it's about what this country can be.

Here is how the historic moment is being captured on the new cover of Time magazine. It shows her literally stepping into frame as President Biden steps out.We're going to get some perspective now from Pulitzer prize-winning presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Her latest book is \"An Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960s.\" So, Doris, as always, on remarkable days, we turn to you. What went through your mind when you heard about President Biden's announcement? DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, &amp; AUTHOR, \"AN UNFINISHED LOVE STORY: A PERSONAL HISTORY OF THE 1960S\": I think the first thing that went through my mind is having lived with presidents for the last half century, I know that this is one of the hardest decisions they could possibly make. I mean, every President wants their administration to be endorsed. They want to finish the job. It's what Abraham Lincoln said in 1864, it mattered even more to him, he said, to win the second election than the first because it would show that people cared about what he had done. And like Biden said over and over again, I want to finish the job. But, I guess what also went through my head was the thought that he was particularly hard for President Biden, because he has always come back from these tough situations before. We've seen it time and time again. And he must have believed in these last three weeks for part of that time, I've done it before, I can do it again, until what I guess will come out more and more in these days ahead. My guess is that the reports that came in from the congressman who talked about what their constituents were feeling in the field, that the perception of age and health is something you can't come back with by will, by hard work, and by your whole history of resilience. It's just there. And once that became part of it, then he was able to make the decision that it was better to concentrate on the presidency, as he said, and then focus on that, and allow the campaign to go forward. And I would guess, if anything, he is feeling a great sense of relief tonight. The tensions must have been enormous. As I know, they were for LBJ. And when that decision is finally made, then the anger, the sense of betrayal, what am I going to do, it's over, and then you're going to get accolades, as I suspect we're already seeing for him, and he can bask in that and rightly in these days ahead.",

It was said that his decision to withdraw was almost like political suicide for somebody for whom that was their whole life. But, he felt he had to do so. In his case what it was, was the Tet Offensive had occurred at the end of January and it really taken away the notion that the war could be won by more and more troops going away. So, he knew that he had to somehow wind the war down. But, the only way that could be believed is if you were not a candidate for President.And also, unlike Biden, he was still running for election, but he was in a contest, and with McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy, and he was not doing well in that contest. Anyway, he comes to the speech performance that night and thunderstruck was the nation because they were not expecting this. He started talking about winding down the war. He started talking about going to the peace table. And then he said, with our sons in faraway fields and the challenges at home, I don't want to devote a single day of my life to other than the presidential duties, the same thing that President Biden talked about in his letter. And then what happened is, the next day, he goes out on the field. People are clapping for him. The anger that they had felt to him was dissipated. Every review, every editorial said he had put principle about politics, that he had been selfless. In his 37 years, he'd never done anything like this. And he said three days later, when the North Vietnamese agreed to come to the bargaining table, that it was the happiest he had ever been. So, it all seemed great. But then what happens is that fate intervened. He was ready to go to Hawaii to talk to the generals over there and begin the peace talks, negotiations. And then he gets a message the night he was prepared to go, the whole White House plane is filled with aides (ph), etc., that Martin Luther King had been shot. And then everything seemed to change after that, riots in the cities. Bobby Kennedy killed two months later, the war continuing on, and then that crazy Democratic Convention in 1968.

But now, as it is, even though fate may intervene again, we have no idea whether or not whoever comes forward, if it is Vice President Harris, who she may lose in their own right, but at least it won't be him who loses it.And the interesting thing for, I think, President Biden is some of his legacy is already being talked about. I mean, historians, they start talking about it right away. In the last presidential poll this year, they brought him up to number 14, which is like one third of the President -- the top one third of the presidents. So, he knows that. I mean, other presidents don't know that until much later, when President Carter lost that reelection campaign. He was so sad about the fact that, I can't finish what I was trying to do. Same with Bush 41. He said he was afraid he'd be an asterick in history because he couldn't finish what he had wanted to do. And he worried that he'd let down his supporters. Both of them thankfully lived long enough to see that they were held in great esteem by their countrymen. Biden already knows that.
