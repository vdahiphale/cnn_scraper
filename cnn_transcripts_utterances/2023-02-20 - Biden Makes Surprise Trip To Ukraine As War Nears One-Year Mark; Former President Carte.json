I think it underscores the reality of a moment where U.S. officials look back at the year and see the resiliency of the Ukrainian people, the resilience of Ukrainian forces, and perhaps most importantly, in minds of U.S. officials, the durability of a western U.S.-led alliance that has stuck together despite the length of this conflict.

Often these are weapons that the U.S. has not yet committed.But to that last point, we should note that this is a city that is relatively back to normal. People are out and about. We're out -- we're able to go out into the streets and talk to them. But at the same time, you really do feel that this is still part of the war, there was that air raid siren as the presidents cross that square. And we've seen in the past when the Secretary General of the United Nations left, Russia fired missiles into Kyiv, when the CIA director was here just a couple of weeks ago, he spent hours in a bunker. And that is a major reason we understand that the White House gave the Kremlin a heads-up that while they may target Kyiv in the past that today was not the day to do it. Bianna and Victor. GOLODRYGA: Yes, air raid sirens really have become the norm in the capitol there. Phil, the president now headed to Poland from Ukraine. What more can we expect to see from that visit?

But the president's remarks tomorrow are being billed as very high stakes, very critical. Again, mostly kind of following up on what he did today in Kyiv before we knew he was going to Ukraine, those remarks were kind of the cornerstone of this trip. But those remarks are designed not unlike his remarks, the same place in Poland in March of last year to underscore the stakes, not just for Ukraine, but -- not just for the Western coalition, but for democracy writ large and also the scale of the effort that's going to need to go into this in the months and perhaps years ahead, guys.",

The White House notified the Kremlin of this visit the administration says for de-escalation purposes, is this visit especially exculpatory or incendiary any more than the billions of dollars of lethal aid that the U.S. has supplied to Ukraine? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RUSSIA, UKRAINE &amp; EURASIA: No. I mean, Victor, this is, you know, just essentially underlining to the Russians and, of course, the world that the United States remains with Ukraine, and, frankly, to the Russian people that Putin is losing. But I don't think it's escalatory. I think that they just wanted to make sure the Russians didn't inadvertently strike Kyiv and then create an escalatory situation.",

They have the advantage of being on their home soil. They can -- they use terrain, they've used rivers, in order to block certain passages. But until the Ukraine military can threaten Crimea can they can launch some kind of focus on offensive. They can't -- they can't do an offensive in both the east and to the south. I think they've got to decide whether they're going to do that. And I think they're waiting on making sure they have potential manpower, but they're still likely three to six to even nine months away of any kind of counter-offensive just from a manpower perspective.",

So, if he -- if he says that there's something more coming anything where he talks about the brothers in Belarus, of course, you know. I think Putin usually does actually telegraph pretty clearly in his speeches what his intent is. If I could just go really quickly back, though, to the Major's comments because I disagree. I do believe that Ukraine can win -- Ukraine can take the offensive and take back the territory, specifically in the Donbass area if we give them the tanks, which are on the way, in addition to that, if we provide them with fighter aircraft. If they have air cover, their troops can go head-to-head with the Russians break through their lines, and actually push them out. In addition to that, I don't think that the longer-range artillery is necessarily escalatory. So, I know we don't have a lot of time to go into it but I think there is another perspective here.",

Only about half of the people who are eligible for hospice in this country actually access it.
