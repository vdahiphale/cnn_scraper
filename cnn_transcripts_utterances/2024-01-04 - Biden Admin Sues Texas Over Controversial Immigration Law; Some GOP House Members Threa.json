Manu, tell us where things are standing right now. MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Really in a period of uncertainty and huge consequences looming. There is a negotiation happening right now in the Senate to try to come up with some sort of middle ground among a handful Senators in the administration to see if they can get a deal that can actually pass the Senate and move through the House, get signed into law. Of course, Republicans are insisting that the border security provision must be dealt with first before they will agree to greenlight aid to Ukraine. Even aa the administration is sounding the alarm and demanding that aid to Ukraine be approved immediately, warning that the countries future could be at risk in its war against Russia. But there's a big problem. This negotiation in the Senate still has yet to produce a deal. Even if there was a deal, many Republicans in the House say they simply will not accept it because it is not expected to go as far as that House bill, H.R.-2. I spoke to several of key Senators who are negotiating this plan about what the Republicans' demand in the House, whether or not they would accept H.R.-2 as part of the negotiation. They pushed back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): If you are serious about getting results, you have to be working across the aisle. My impression is Speaker Johnson has not spent one minute trying to work across the aisle to get a deal on immigration. We are trying to work across the aisle in the Senate to try to get a bipartisan deal on the supplemental.",

Not just within the Republican party but between the two chambers, between the House and the Senate.

But they still have to make a decision, program by program, on how to fund the rest of the government and what to fund and what not to fund. That is where the complicated matters come in, including dealing with issues of the border, as well as immigration, as we are hearing. Calls from these Republican hard-liners, in particular, demanding stricter border security measures in that government funding bill. Some of them say, shut down the government, if they will not shut down the border. That is going to be part of the dynamic as they come back to Washington with very little time next week. Because the first government funding deadline is January 19th. The next one is February 2nd. And real concerns about a government shutdown because of those sharp disagreements. Even if there is an overall agreement on funding, what will they do about those overall programs? Will that lead to a broader government shutdown? Big questions in the weeks ahead?",

Even places like D.C., for instance. They might still have some issues working with the court system.

It sounds like a nightmare but it's actually a way for you to have more privacy online.Today, Google is beginning a media diet, a limited test to restrict the technology that allows advertisers to target you with ads by tracking your Internet activity, those cookies. Google is starting by disabling cookies for 1 percent of its Chrome users, roughly 30 million people. It says, by the end of the year, cookies are going to be eliminated from Chrome entirely. Joining us with more on this is Thomas Germain, a senior reporter at \"Gizmodo.\" Thomas, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. This is a big deal. The online ad business is a $600 billion a year industry according to the \"Wall Street Journal.\" So why is Google now eliminating them? THOMAS GERMAIN, SENIOR REPORTER, \"GIZMODO\": What we are talking about is one of the biggest changes not just in the history of the Internet but in the entire business model of the tech industry. So cookies, like you said, are one of the primary ways that consumers are tracked online for targeted advertising purposes and all kinds of other things. But the walls have been closing in when it comes to privacy as governments and the public wake up to issues about our data. So a couple of years ago, Google saw the writing on the wall and I think they realized they needed to make the change to get out in front of this. Because if they didn't do something about privacy, the government was going to do it for them. And that's not what they wanted. So they announced this new initiative to get rid of cookies and replace them with a new technology that still tracks you and allows advertisers to target you with ads but it works a little better when it comes to your privacy.",

So how is the new system going to work? GERMAIN: It's phenomenally complicated when you get down into the technical details. But on a basic level, what will happen is Chrome itself, your own browser will be the one tracking you instead of these files floating all over the Internet. And then Chrome is going to collect data about what you are doing on different Web sites but it stores the data on your device, and Google and everyone else doesn't get to see it. Instead, Chrome is going to sort you into these different cohorts of people who are interested in different topics. And then Web sites and advertisers will be able to ask Chrome which cohort, what topics is this person interested in and then show you an ad. But they won't get to know exactly who you are or learn anything about your browsing history. That's a lot better for your privacy than the status quo, which is everyone gets to know everything about you. At the same time, there are lots of other browsers, Firefox and Duck Duck Go, that don't track you at all. So, it's not perfect.",
