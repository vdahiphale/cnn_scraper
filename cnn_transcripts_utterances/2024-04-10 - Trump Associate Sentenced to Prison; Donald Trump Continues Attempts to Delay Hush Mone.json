      "sentences": "These two leaders are set to announce a list of new defense and technology agreements, all in an effort to counter China's emerging power in the Indo-Pacific.CNN's M.J. Lee is joining us now live from the White House. M.J., tell us a little bit more about these points of cooperation that Biden and Kishida are going to unveil. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Brianna and Boris, this visit by the Japanese prime minister says a lot about a key feature of Biden's foreign policy. And that is strengthening the U.S.' alliances with countries in the Indo-Pacific, with the goal of countering China's strength and influence in the region. And that's going to be quite clear when we see the two leaders emerge from this bilateral meeting and announce dozens of deliverables. And, if you look closely, a couple of those things at least get to this issue of countering China, for example, further integrating the two countries' militaries and strengthening the two countries' defense industrial cooperation. There are going to be a number of other announcements too that just get at the two countries' potential areas of cooperation, technology, artificial intelligence, even space cooperation. And now, as with any two countries, there have, of course, been other areas of tension between the two countries as well. We know, for example, that the president opposes Japan's efforts to purchase U.S. Steel, a company that is based in Pittsburgh. But, interestingly, when a senior U.S. official was previewing this meeting yesterday with reporters, they predicted that the issue probably would not come up because the two leaders already know where the other stands on this issue. Now, one of the ways in which the White House is making clear that Japan is such an important alliance for the U.S. is, of course, by hosting the prime minister as part of a state visit, featuring, of course, the state dinner coming tonight. We know that there is going to be all of the pomp and circumstance that comes with a state dinner. There is going to be an ornate and decadent menu and decorations and entertainment that all pay tribute to the U.S.-Japanese alliance. And, also, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that, in just a few minutes, when we see the president come out with the prime minister in the Rose Garden, this is going to be the first formal press conference that the president is holding this year. The last time that he had a formal press conference was actually back in December, when the Ukrainian president was here at the White House.",

We're going to bring that to you live as soon as it begins. But, in the meantime, let's turn now to Arizona, which is the latest state to turn back the clock on abortion policy. President Biden and former President Trump are reacting to a ban on nearly all abortions that could reshape the political landscape in a crucial 2024 battleground state, the Arizona Supreme Court reviving a law that dates back to 1864. It bans abortion in all cases, except to save the life of the mother.",

Today, he's actually saying that states like Arizona may have gotten it wrong. CNN's Natasha Chen is tracking the fallout here.

Now, that was a civil case against the former president. In the New York criminal case against him, his attorneys filed yet another appeal. The case is set to go to trial next week. There, the Manhattan DA is accusing Trump of benefiting from a hush money scheme during the 2016 campaign. CNN correspondent Kara Scannell is live for us outside the courthouse in New York. Kara, let's start with these new appeals. Again, Trump's team has been trying to delay this case and all the others for quite a while. It's set to start with jury selection on Monday.

      "sentences": "Right, Boris.This is the third attempt this week to try to delay this trial. Today's filing, they're asking this judge, the judge here, to have an emergency hearing and delay the trial so they can make arguments on two different fronts. One of the fronts is about presidential immunity. Trump's team had filed a motion with the judge overseeing the trial, Judge Juan Merchan, asking him to delay this trial until the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump is -- has immunity from prosecution in the January 6 case in Washington, D.C. Now, Judge Merchan denied that motion, saying it was filed way too late, just a few weeks out from this trial. Now, they also are asking the appeals court to allow them time to make arguments about whether the judge should be recused from this case. They filed a motion asking the judge to step aside based on work his daughter does for a political organization that works for Democrats. The judge has not ruled on that yet, but, already, Trump's team is bouncing to the appeals court to try to get them to get involved here and stop this trial, so they can make further arguments on that. Now, we are waiting for to see whether a judge will take up this emergency action today or if we will be back tomorrow. But that is the most recent pending thing. And, as you mentioned, this is just the latest effort. Earlier this week, Trump's team came to this same court and asked judges to stop the trial so they could make an appeal of a gag order that was put in place on the former president to limit certain statements he can make about possible witnesses, about the judge's family members. That was swiftly denied. Another motion that was denied, the judge's -- the judge overseeing a different one about whether to stop the trial so Trump could challenge the venue, because he said that he couldn't -- Trump could not get a fair trial in Manhattan due to all the pretrial publicity. That was also very quickly denied. So, waiting to see if this is going to be taken up today, but it is the third attempt this week to try to stop the trial from happening, and jury selection is still scheduled at this point to begin on Monday -- Boris.",

And what he said he did was that he lied during the investigation into Donald Trump's financial statements. That was by the New York attorney general's office that resulted in that big fine, almost half-a-billion dollars, that Trump is ordered to pay.Well, Weisselberg with investigators during the course of their investigation, and he admitted to having lied to them about what he knew about the size of Donald Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower and how that apartment was valued on the financial statements that the judge found were inflated. Weisselberg came into court today under a deal with the prosecution. The whole sentencing hearing lasted less than five minutes. The judge said she would honor the agreement that he had with prosecutors. So, she sentenced Weisselberg to five months in jail at Rikers Island. Now, the previous sentence, you mentioned, was also five months. Weisselberg ended up serving about 100 days. But, in either case, he's not cooperating against Donald Trump, and he's not expected to appear at the trial next week -- Boris.",

So, there's clearly some tension. She's been under a lot of scrutiny for how she's handled this case. She still has over a dozen motions outstanding, and she still has not set a trial date. We were down in court in Florida well over a month ago to hear arguments from both sides about how far back to push this case. She still has not decided that issue. Now, a question I get asked a lot is, will the special counsel move to try to get her removed from the case if they're not happy, if they think it's either her inexperience or some other issue means she's not handling this properly? There's nothing in their filings right now to indicate that they're going to make that move. But if they were to do that, they would probably need more of a record, and decisions like this, where she sort of backtracks, and other decisions where they believe she is wrong in the law, that would all go to support that, if that's something they do down the road.",

I have been in the courtroom with Judge Tanya Chutkan, the other federal judge handling the other special counsel case. I mean, there is certainly a contrast, in terms of a judge who's been on the bench for two or three years versus a judge who's been on the bench for over a decade, in terms of how -- how well you control your courtroom, control the Trump legal team, control the special counsel prosecutors.

Of course, we know it's not. It's going to be -- the issue of immunity is going to be heard at the Supreme Court. But then you look at a judge like Judge Cannon. She's only been on the bench for a few years. And you can tell, when you're in the courtroom and she's dealing with a special counsel and the defense attorney's arguing with one another, sometimes over substantive issues, sometimes over petty personal grievances, she doesn't have as much of a command of her courtroom.
