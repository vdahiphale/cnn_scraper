She's moving away from it now.

You have multiple Republican officeholders, you know, tried to downplay what happened on January the 6th, the whole election stolen narrative, because Trump is now the Republican nominee and again he is the route to being in power and staying in power.

Now, he is quoting Israeli government sources as saying it could be between one and three days before they get a response. It's interesting to note, though, that all the sources, all the leaks at this point are coming from the Israeli side. Clearly feeling domestic and international pressure to push this process forward.

So, there was this long- standing threat from ISIS operatives.Putin needs to convince his people that he didn't leave them unprotected while he was pursuing a war of choice and aggression next door in Ukraine. That's why I think you're seeing reports that the U.S. and Britain have dismissed as not credible, that these suspects, these four Tajik suspects, were captured on their way to Ukraine, on their way to a border area that's mined and full of patrols and, sure -",

So, there's a lot of work that still needs to be done.
