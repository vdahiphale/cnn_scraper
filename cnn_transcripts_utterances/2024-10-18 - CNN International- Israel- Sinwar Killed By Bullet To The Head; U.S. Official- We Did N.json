An Israeli chief pathologist, who autopsied Sinwar's body, tells CNN he was killed by gunshot wound to the head. The Israeli military released this new video today it shows a tank firing at the building where they claim that Sinwar had taken shelter after a firefight with Israeli soldiers. Sinwar's killing has left a gap in Hamas's leadership the fate of Israeli hostages in Gaza, as well as Americans held there, remains uncertain. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to keep fighting in Gaza until all of those hostages are returned home. Hamas says it will release none of them until the war is over. For Hamas, that means Israel will have to completely withdraw from the enclave, they demand, as well as release Palestinian prisoners, perhaps hundreds, perhaps even thousands of them held in Israel. All of this comes as Israel faces new pressure from the World Health Organization. Israel denies the accusation that more than 50 medical specialists have been blocked from entering Gaza. For the latest on the crisis in the Middle East, Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Tel Aviv. Remarkable details that we're learning about just how Sinwar was located and eventually killed. Tell us what you're Israeli military sources are telling you about those circumstances.",

That that video that they released today of a tank firing at the building where they had already located a man who they didn't know at the time was Sinwar, but an injured Palestinian militants is what they believed and they fired her to tank into that building -- a tank shell into that building. And they have suggested that that is indeed what killed Sinwar.But today, I interviewed the man who actually conducted the autopsy on Sinwar's body, the chief pathologists that Israel's National Forensic Institute, Dr. Chen Kugel, and he told me that he is confident that it was a bullet to the head that actually killed the former Hamas leader.

He said that a finger was actually cut off of Sinwar's body and sent to his institute for DNA analysis and it was that DNA analysis that confirmed that it was indeed Sinwar who had been killed.

You can't exactly tell his identity in the moment, and he throws would stick at this drone.And for an Israeli audience that has been viewed as kind of look at this man, how he's been brought to his knees effectively after carrying out the deadliest attack, a terrorist attack in Israel's history but for a Palestinian audience and perhaps even for a wider Arab audience, what is being seen here is a man who is fighting up until the end. And this is kind of extending this kind of myth that Sinwar had built around himself as some kind of a freedom fighter who would be fighting till the end and who would be happy to die for his cause and so two very different ways of viewing this. But certainly the decision to release that drone video is being viewed by a lot of Middle East experts as a big mistake by the Israeli military because of the fact that it could kind of cement this myth that he had built around himself.",

But even after Sinwar's killing Biden believes the road remains difficult. Right now, he is on board air force one on his way back to the U.S. A U.S. official says Biden is huddling with his national security team. To discuss these latest developments in the Middle East, CNN's Kylie Atwood is tracking the story. And, Kylie, do we know if there has been any effort yet to restart ceasefire and hostage release talks which the U.S. has been highly involved in for months with some I think frustration, we can say, not just with Hamas opposition, but also the roadblocks thrown up, they say by the Israeli leader. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: There has certainly been early conversations to that end, Jim. We know that the secretary of state spoke with his counterpart in Qatar, his counterpart and Saudi Arabia just yesterday after the news about Sinwar became a reality. And one of the things that was discussed was returning back to a ceasefire and hostage negotiations. But what we don't know exactly right now, Jim, is what the framework for those conversations will actually look like. U.S. officials are telling our colleague, Kayla Tausche that they're going to focus on the release of hostages. Front and center, that's something they want to do. But then the question is, they're also saying there should be ceasefire, there should be an end to this conflict. This death of Sinwar presents a massive opportunity in the words of U.S. officials, to try and restart those efforts. But exactly how they approach that isn't yet clear, and it appears that that something that they are figuring out in their conversations with regional counterparts right now, with the Qataris, with the Saudis, with the Egyptian, of course, with the Israelis as well as they try and figure out how to take advantage of what they see as a moment of opportunity to try and get things back on track and to try and drive this conflict to an end. But President Biden while yesterday, he was very clear and saying that this is the moment for this to come to an anti. Also said today in those remarks before heading back to the us that the road ahead is not going to be easy. Its likely to be difficult a recognition of the fact that still even though Sinwar are the major impediment to these efforts, is now no longer there, still this is going to be a challenge to get to the Israelis and get Hamas on the same page particularly, of course, when we don't know who the next leader of Hamas is going to be.",

And I believe that that will also help to tamp down the possibility of the scenario in Lebanon spiraling out of control.And certainly, I think it will also shape the way in which Israel views the nature of its retaliation on Iran and so what happens in Gaza right now is extremely important, and it could unlock a lot of other promising possibilities, too.",

In fact, just now in Grand Rapids, that was her message, was trying to draw that contrast with former President Donald Trump on this issue, on manufacturing, and essentially saying that the vice president's plans are better suited for labor and for the manufacturing industry and for union workers.But to your point, Jim, the counties that she is visiting today say everything about the strategy here. For example, she's going to Kent County. That is a county where former president Donald Trump won in 2016, but then Biden won in 2020, and to the other counties Biden won by wider margins in 2022. So, that is what the Harris campaign wants to emulate here and build on. Now, another area that they see opportunity here in Michigan that they will also be trying to reach in the messaging over the course of the day is white college educated voters, essentially targeting the suburbs that is where they think that they can also make some inroads and then tomorrow, the vice president will be Detroit, where she is going to participate in a get out -- get-out-the-vote event with Lizzo. Now, this is important not just because of the star power, but because this is the first presidential where Michigan can have early vote in person. And that is where the campaign is trying to capitalize and try to get these folks to the polls early -- early on. The same goes for Georgia. She will also be going to Georgia tomorrow where she's going to be joined with Usher at a rally. Again, same focus focused on the early voting. So certainly what we are starting to see you come to fruition here is the strategy by the campaign to fortify the blue wall. That's where the focus has been for the vice president, including here in Michigan. But then also to try to gin up enthusiasm when it comes to early votes. Now, next week, I'll also note that the vice president will be joined with the Obamas on the campaign trail. She'll be with former President Barack Obama on Thursday and then on Saturday, she will be with Michelle Obama. This will mark Michelle Obama's first campaign appearance for the Harris-Walz campaign. So, certainly, with this final stretch, the campaign in trying to bring the star power, but also fine tune their messaging for these different pockets of the coalition that they want to reach.

Of course, they think that they have a real shot of being victorious here once again, after Donald Trump had, of course, won the state in 2016 but lost it to Joe Biden in 2020. And a part of his visit here today is that he's going to be starting with a roundtable into Oakland County. We know that's just north of Detroit. It's a bourbon area and that's really a key demographic that the former president has been targeting in recent weeks. Remember, earlier this week, Donald Trump actually appeared at a town hall with an all female audience. And it's very clear that women voters or something that Donald Trump is trying to make inroads with. This morning, actually, on \"Fox and Friends\" during interview, Donald Trump was asked this question directly, and he was also asked if he would deploy more women on the campaign trail in the final days of this cycle.

Joining me now for more on the impact of this killing, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, a former assistant secretary of state for political military affairs under George W. Bush. Thanks so much for joining, sir. Tell us the significance of killing Sinwar. Listen, he was -- he was a powerful leader. He was the architect of the most devastating terror attacks on Israel perhaps ever, but there's a history of killing terrorist leaders and those terror leaders being replaced. The U.S. has some experience with that its own wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Is this the kind of assassination though that weakens Hamas fundamentally? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS: Not fundamentally, perhaps temporarily we took out to be took out Hassan Nasrallah about a month ago, has taken out the top tiers of the Hezbollah leadership. It's had little tactical effect on the ground. Yes, they can't fight as combined arms operation but I think Hassan Nasrallah is a good example that this may set the organization back a small been, but it's not dead.",

It depends on oil, fuel donated from countries like Russia and Mexico. And that fuel apparently over the last several days has begun to run very, very low. Several of the power plants were taken offline.
