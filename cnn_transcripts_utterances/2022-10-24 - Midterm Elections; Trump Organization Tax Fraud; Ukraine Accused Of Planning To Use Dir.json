The judge will bring in hundreds of Manhattan residents and begin the screening process to narrow down until they can get 12 jurors and alternates, people who are impartial can hear this case.You know, the backstory here is the Trump Organization was charged with nine felony counts. This is all related to this off the books compensation scheme. And just in the last several weeks, there were some plea negotiations according to sources. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office had wanted the Trump Organization to plead guilty to felonies. The Trump Organization attorneys wanted to plead guilty to misdemeanors. And the former president, according to sources, didn't want his company to plead guilty at all because he doesn't think they've done anything wrong. He's also, according to sources, concerned about the political impact of actually pleading guilty compared with, say, maybe potentially being convicted at trial. Different things at play there. So, key thing here, prosecutors will be bringing in a number of current Trump Organization officials who will get this insight into the company and how it works, at least as far as the compensation scheme goes. And one of the key people will be the Chief Financial Officer, Allen Weisselberg. He's been with the company for nearly 50 years, and he's on paid leave now. So, he is cooperating in the sense that he's going to - his lawyer says he's going to answer questions truthfully. He's been meeting with the prosecutors in recent weeks, but also meeting with the Trump Organization attorneys in recent weeks. He will be the insider who can walk the jury through this complicated financial tax type of scheme. And if he testifies truthfully, prosecutors have agreed to this deal where he could serve as little as 100 days in jail. If he doesn't, he could face as many as 15 years in prison.

Because some businesses, some industries have rules where you can't be in bed with a convicted felon. So that remains to be seen.The company has managed to raise money through different sources, not through the traditional banking channels.

So, he's fought a lot of things in court. He's even fought allowing the National Archives to turn over documents, so we could very well see a court fight.There could be a circus in that regard, but even if he does sit for testimony with the House, there would likely be demands for transparency from the wider public, right? This is about getting him under oath and also getting answers for the American people that Congress can force. But if you look back in history, one of the most secretive things that can happen in getting people under oath is grand jury testimony. Bill Clinton testified to a grand jury under oath. It wasn't as secretive as that proceeding usually is, even in that sense.

Officials are warning that Russia is trying to use that accusation to escalate its invasion of Ukraine. CNN'S Nic Robertson is live in Kyiv with the latest here. And again, this was a Russian claim that Ukraine is planning to use a dirty bomb. What's the international reaction been?NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: To tell the Russians that they're getting it wrong. A transparently false accusation is what the joint statement by the foreign ministers of the United States, of France, and the UK. Now, we know that just a couple of days ago, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had a phone call with Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Defense Minister. We got a very slender readout from that phone conversation, saying that it was important to keep conversations going. Really surprisingly, just three days later, you have the defense secretaries of the UK, France, and Lloyd Austin again, and the Turkish Defense Minister all calling and talking to Sergei Shoigu at their own request. So, clearly, something in that first conversation with Lloyd Austin and Sergei Shoigu a few days ago led to a level of concern that we haven't seen before. Russia's accusation that Ukraine might be about to use a dirty bomb. President Zelensky says very simply, and we've seen this before with Russia, that if Russia is making these accusations up now, this can mean only one thing: that Russia itself is potentially preparing to use a dirty bomb. There is no evidence of this presented by either side yet. A dirty bomb, remember, not as bad as a tactical nuclear device. This would be a bomb that has radioactive components, maybe from medical use, that would disperse radioactive components over the bomb blast area. It is still a dangerous and potentially deadly device, but not at the same scale.",

But at the same time, this intelligence chief says they can see, the Ukrainians can see Russia is bringing more troops into Khershon for the fight. The civilians are being forced out. He says that all but the sort of most badly wounded who can't physically get out of the city are being forced out.So, there's a real level of concern here that while they push the civilians out, clear out the banks of money and cash and take it over the river, that they might stand firm.

The question is, are there enough people behind her in the GOP primary electorate that could actually make that happen? I think she's going to be an interesting dynamic during the election if she does run because she will get all of the press.You've got, like, half a dozen candidates all made by Trump, associated with him historically, and they're not going to be hitting him. And she might be there on the campaign trail, or maybe even on the debate stage, just pummeling him. And she might be the contrast. And who knows? She may end up rising up as the standard bearer [ph]. I don't think she'll still get enough votes to win a primary.",

He's not conservative, and that's her core point.The other issue is whether there could be a third-party independent conservative challenge, which is kind of along the lines of what we're seeing Evan McMullin mount against Mike Lee pretty effectively. But that's actually about one-party states and actually drawing that contrast really clearly. But I do think it represents the fact that for true old school conservatives, a return of Donald Trump is the opposite of everything they believe. And they're not going to simply appease him as some folks looking to get into power in the short term are willing to do.",
