      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the nation pauses to remember a permanent scar on America's soul. And to honor the nearly 3000 who paid the ultimate price on that September Sunday morning.Plus, bullied by the pulpit. The president returns home from a dual purpose, big foreign trip to advance his policies on the world stage and try to quiet voters' skepticism of his approach and his ability to serve. And Kevin McCarthy runs the congressional hamster wheel. The House speaker is battling the same problems caused by the same set of conservative hardliners, and this time a new version of the same question. Can he escape with his job? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, America is replaying and reliving one of its darkest days. By this time, 12:01 pm Eastern, 22 years ago, both World Trade Towers had collapsed. Lower Manhattan was in the middle of an evacuation, its streets its firefighters, its police, its people are caked in concrete dust and ash. This morning, the tolling of the bells followed by moments of silence. And then reading of the names, all remind us of that nearly 3000 men and women whose lives were stolen on September 11, in the terror attacks that forever altered America and the world. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live from the 9/11 Memorial Plaza in New York City. Brynn?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. As you just mentioned, we're at the point now, where there are no more moments of silence, but we're continuing to hear the names of those lives lost 22 years ago today. And I have to tell you being here at Ground Zero, when we heard those bells toll six different times throughout the morning, everyone here just stopped and stood in silence. And it was just such a moment of just the gravity of what happened here really settled in. And I want to get out of the way because we're very close to the southern reflection pools. And you can see all the flowers and the flags that people have placed next to the names of their loved ones. And I've had a chance to actually get to talk to some of these people. I talked to one woman who was putting a flower next to her name.And I asked her, who did she lose? She lost her husband. And I asked did she come back every year? And she said, no, she doesn't. She came back this year, though, because her son, now 22 years old was reading some of the names of those people lost. He was 10 months old when his dad died. And another little boy, maybe six or seven years old. He was also reading names. And he said that he was named after his uncle who passed away here. And he says he never got to know him, of course, but he feels like he knows him just from the stories that he's been told. And that has been so important, as I talked to the organizers of this event every year to make sure the kids were part of this, Dana, because it's the generations coming forward who don't know necessarily what 9/11 was, they get a talk through all of us who lived it. And it is important to them that of course, this story continues to move forward and that we never, never forget. And you really, really felt that sense here today 22 years after those devastating terrorist attacks. Dana?",

So, we talked about what's going on right now to commemorate. And of course, what is going on the campaign trail is a lot of Republicans are running to be the nominee in order to get the chance to be commander in chief.Just one our team went through the sort of list of Republican candidates to show where they were and what they were doing on 9/11 2001. Donald Trump was a real estate mogul. Ron DeSantis was a high school teacher. Vivek Ramaswamy was a high school student. Mike Pence was in Congress. Nikki Haley worked at her family business. Senator Tim Scott was in the Charleston city council. He was a councilman. Chris Christie was a private attorney. Asa Hutchinson was the DEA administrator. And Doug Burgum was executive at Microsoft. And it was a long time ago when they had such different, different lives, but they're all, you know, commemorating it in a way for the most part that feels appropriate. FRANKLIN FOER, AUTHOR, \"THE LAST POLITICIAN\": Right. Well, 9/11 wasn't just a day, it was an era. I remember that day. My wife was stranded in Japan on a business school trip. And just she ended up flying back into Newark Airport. And I remember her flying over the city with, you know, you were able to see the smoldering halls. And I remember driving up 95, which was empty, listening to the radio, and it was just this incredible feeling. I mean, think of helplessness that everybody felt but not knowing what was going to come next. But the sense that there probably was something to come next. And so, for, I think everybody who lived through the next couple of decades, it changed our foreign policy, obviously, we're preventing the next 9/11 became our abiding concern. But it also changed our politics. I think a lot of what we're living with now, you could probably chip trace back to that day, just the fear and the anxiety that was opened up, was something that was also exploited by politicians over time. And it's interesting to see all of these politicians continuing to interact with this seminal date on the calendar and finding their way to navigate through it.",

Or is it more than Nikki Haley stature.What's interesting is Ron DeSantis gave an interview to the Washington examiner talking about 9/11. And he focused all of this not on national, not on a foreign policy, but on border security and the southern border, and that that's a reason to keep our borders and our country strong, kind of avoiding the divisive issue within the Republican Party of what the United States's role is around the world.",

And President Biden is currently on an 11-hour flight from Vietnam to Alaska, where he will meet with service members to mark the 22nd anniversary of the September 11 attacks. But the president is returning back to the U.S. after making some significant headway.When it comes to trying to position the U.S. as a counterbalance to China, the president spent some time at the G20 Summit in India, which produced an agreement to establish a shipping corridor, opening up India to the Middle East, and to Europe, that could serve as a challenge to China's own infrastructure initiatives around the globe. In Vietnam, the president elevated the United States diplomatic relationship with the country a neighbor to China as they are trying to assert more influence in the region. But this trip while it had those foreign policy objectives, it also has a second purpose. Aides here at the White House in the campaign often point to these trips, as an example of not just the president's ability to foster and build relationships and his decades of foreign policy experience, but also a chance for the president to show that the -- that he as 80 years old, is up to the grueling task that these trips require, especially at a time when there is significant concern and polls from Americans about the president's age. Now, these trips are whirlwind trips. He has been traveling over the course of five days, meeting with world leaders. There are times where you do see some verbal missteps. But ultimately, what advisors here at the White House have been trying to lean into as the president is up to doing the job. You'll remember just last week, his campaign rolled out a new ad, highlighting that secret trip that he took into Ukraine. Ultimately, this will all be up to voters to decide whether they believe the president is up for a second term.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite probably doesn't have the same capacity that it had before. This is not a criticism. It's an observation. He has his hands full right now. He has overwhelming unemployment with his youth. One of the major economic tenants of his plan isn't working at all right now. I'm not happy for him that, but it's not working. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But China is also something that is very hotly contested right now. There's a lot of divisions, not only among Republicans, but among Democrats too, on how to address China.
