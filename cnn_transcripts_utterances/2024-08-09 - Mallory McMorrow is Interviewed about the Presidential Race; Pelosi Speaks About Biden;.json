There was a Whitney Houston singing along. I think as it relates to young people, when it comes to reproductive rights, when it comes to the economy, and even when it comes to the approach in the Middle East, I think young people are excited and fired up and it is a whole new ballgame here in Michigan, and it feels good.",
