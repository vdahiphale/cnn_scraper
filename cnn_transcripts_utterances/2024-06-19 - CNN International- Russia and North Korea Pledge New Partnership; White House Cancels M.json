What we're -- the video from Hezbollah certainly set off alarm bells in Israel because I think they realized that Hezbollah's abilities are far more perhaps than they expected, been able to ten to a drone, about 30 kilometers inside of Israeli territory, flying over sensitive military installations, the port of Haifa, which is a major port, the biggest port in Israel, then flying back with that footage is quite an intelligence coup by Hezbollah. Now, we have seen last week there was quite an intense exchange offire between the two sides after Israel killed they senior Hamas field commander. This week, the actual amount of back-and-forth fire between the Israelis and the Hezbollah is somewhat less, but certainly the rhetoric does seem to be heating up. Today, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah was basically talking about their abilities. He was saying how they've only used a small portion of the weapons. They have that they have other weapons that they have received that he was not willing to talk about. He said that Hezbollah is in a position. He said to launch an incursion inside the Galilee, northern Israel, if he said war is imposed on Hezbollah. But he also made it very clear the best way to end this cross-border fire that is in danger of becoming something much more serious is to bring an end to the war in Gaza. He said, if that happens, Hezbollah will stop firing on Israel, the Houthis will stop targeting navigation in the Red Sea? Those pro-Iranian militias in Syria and Iraq will stop firing on Israel. So he's sort of putting the onus back on, in a way, the Americans. Keep in mind that this envoy from the United States, Amos Hochstein, was in Lebanon yesterday, passing a message through who intermediaries to Hezbollah, and I think this is Hezbollah's response to him -- Erica.",

The U.S. and its allies are currently trying to work out what the language is actually going to look like during this summit in terms of Ukraine's path to NATO membership. And its kind of being painstakingly debated at this point, kind of, you know, the discussions between words like irreversible path to NATO membership versus a bridge to NATO membership.And it might sound small, but in the long run, it is significant because it tells the world, and particularly Russia, just where the alliance believes Ukraine's path to NATO lies at this point. And what were told is that the U.S. right now doesn't want to go as far as to say that Ukraine has an irreversible path to NATO membership because there are questions about whether Ukraine actually qualifies for NATO membership at this point, given the fact that they haven't implemented certain democratic and anti-corruption reforms, just yet, that are required for NATO membership. And there's also the fact that U.S. officials don't believe that the entire alliance would go along with such phrasing, particularly Hungary, which has been a pretty opposed to Ukraine joining the alliance. But then there are countries in NATO, including the UK and some Central and Eastern European countries, that say that the U.S. really needs to go a bit further here in order to send a signal. And they are in favor of that language being included because they want to make sure that the world and Vladimir Putin understand that Ukraine's membership in NATO is not negotiable, it is not something that is going to be on the table during peace negotiations, for example. Now, of course, Vladimir Putin has said quite starkly, including as recently as last week, that if Ukraine does not drop its NATO aspirations, then there will never be any negotiations to end the war. It is debatable, of course, whether that actually is true and whether if Ukraine even dropped its NATO plans, whether Russia would indeed come to the table. But still it gives you a sense of the Russian mindset here and why European allies in particular are so eager to see a more concrete, definitive path and timeline for Ukraine to join that defensive alliance -- Erica.",

It's going to kind of compartmentalize. And importantly, it's going to be overseen broadly on the macro level by NATO itself and not just by the United States, so that if anything happens in the U.S., for example, if Trump gets elected and decides to cut off support for Ukraine, then it will be secure under the NATO umbrella instead.",
