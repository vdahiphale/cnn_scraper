And when they were stuck in the traffic here, this is when police say the shooters who arrived in one vehicle, got out of their vehicle at different locations, started shooting on the traffic that was lining up here. And if you can (inaudible), if you're able to zoom in down the road a little bit, you can see a vehicle on the back of a truck down there, a blue vehicle. That appears to be the vehicle, as best we can understand, that the attackers arrived on the scene in. We know that one young man in his 20s was killed. Five other people were shot. At least one of them, we believe, a woman in serious condition. Another person, as they were trying to rush and get themselves away from the attackers, hurt themselves. But right now, several people have been taken to hospital. One of the people taken to hospital, we understand the woman who is seriously injured. One person died at the scene here. And right now the police are on the scene. The highway, this main highway into Jerusalem is shut at the moment. There's no traffic coming up here. And the incident took place at a time when every day you'll see massive queues of traffic here of people coming to work either in Jerusalem or going on to Tel Aviv. So this shooting, slightly different from others that we've seen recently, because there were three attackers involved here. All the police say with automatic weapons, all choosing and shooting at different targets here. The police say that two of the attackers were shot and killed immediately. Another attacker was chased from the scene and shot and killed. We understand that at least one senior politician, possibly a government minister, has visited the site this morning. We're still trying to work out and confirm if that has actually happened.

On day three of the hearings, the U.S. said the world court should not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territories. More than 50 countries are voicing arguments. The UAE's envoy to the U.N. argued Israel's presence is, quote, \"illegal and cannot remain without consequence.\" But the U.S. said the October 7th attack served as a reminder that Israel's security must be guaranteed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD VISEK, ACTING LEGAL ADVISER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: Any movement towards Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza requires consideration of Israel's very real security needs. Regrettably, those needs have been ignored by many of the participants in asserting how the court should consider the questions before it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: Israel is not participating in the hearings, saying it could harm efforts to reach a settlement. The U.N. General Assembly asked the world court back in 2022 to issue a non-binding opinion on the issue. But no decision is expected for months.

JANINA DILL, OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS, LAW, AND ARMED CONFLICT: Looking at it with the available facts, it's really difficult to see how this could be a legal attack. And so at minimum, it would look like a very serious violation of international humanitarian law. Whether it's also criminal then depends on questions of intent. POLGLASE (voice-over): The truck set off as part of a U.N. marked convoy of 10 up al-Rashid Road in the early hours. It reached an IDF holding point at 4:15am. Stationary for over an hour, it was then hit at 5:35am. Fortunately, no one on board was killed. The U.N. says they were hit by Israeli naval gunfire. And in satellite imagery taken just two hours after the attack, CNN identified ships that could only be Israeli naval boats.

      "sentences": "Hello there, Rosemary. It has actually been a very busy afternoon here in Beijing. As we sort through some new allegations from Chinese officials, Chinese officials are now accusing Taiwan of a cover up. And this all relates to an incident last week when we saw a Chinese boat capsized with several fishermen on board. In many ways, prompting that inspection that you just referred to.We are hearing from a fisherman, a Chinese fisherman, who says that a Taiwanese boat hit the Chinese boat, rammed it, and that the boat just didn't turn over on its own. In fact, Taiwan's Coast Guard now responding, saying that the Chinese fisherman's vessel took a sharp turn, causing it to capsize. So we're hearing a lot of this back and forth. And that is what's prompting tension in this part of the world, off the coast, near the Kinmen Islands. And that is what is perhaps prompting this most recent case, this inspection by Chinese officials of that Taiwanese boat. It is prompting response, of course, from Taiwan, including Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council. We heard from an official a short time ago. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KUAN BI-LING, HEAD OF TAIWAN'S OCEAN AFFAIRS COUNCIL (through translator): When Chinese boats cross into our waters, we know that these boats are not illegal at all, and they have just entered by accident. We would just broadcast warnings and hope that they leave immediately. So we think China boarding and inspecting our boat February 19th has harmed our people's feelings and triggered people's panic. It was also not in line with the interests of the people across the street. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The two missions are part of a NASA program where private companies carry payloads of science and technology from the Earth to the moon, depositing equipment and conducting experiments on the lunar surface to help pave the way for NASA's planned crewed missions in the Artemis program.
