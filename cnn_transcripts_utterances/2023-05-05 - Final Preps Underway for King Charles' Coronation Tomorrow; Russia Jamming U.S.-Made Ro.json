Invitations were sent to approximately 2,300 people, including roughly 100 heads of state from around the world. For what it's worth, U.S. presidents do not or have not -- they don't go to British coronations. Again, there will be two 1.3-mile processions through London, one to get the king to the ceremony, one to take him back to the palace for the drive to the service. King Charles has opted to ride in the diamond jubilee state coach built in 2014. It is newer to the collection, black tires with gold hub caps.

And the reason the coronation is so important, yes, there is a religious ceremony, but the archbishop of Canterbury and King Charles III have made sure it's inclusive to those of us from different faiths and different backgrounds.

They're the most celebrated, the most feared by the Russians, the most important piece of weaponry that the U.S. has given Ukraine throughout the course of this war. They're normally extraordinarily precise, to within ten feet.Now, the rockets that the U.S. has given to Ukraine, they fly around 50 miles or 80 kilometers, so from quite a distance. But the Russians have been quite effective at jamming them, we are told. Now, those rockets are guided in part by GPS guidance, and those GPS signals can be jammed. I spoke to one Ukrainian source who talks to drone operators on the frontlines. Those operators fly forward and look at targets. And we're told that the HIMARS have been having a harder time being precise, harder time missing their targets -- harder hitting their targets and sometimes missing their targets. So, what has had to happen, Sara, is the U.S. and Ukraine have had to come up with workarounds to pierce through that Russian jamming. So, they'll figure something out to get around that jamming, then the Russians will come up with a countermeasure, then the U.S. and Ukraine will then have to come up with something to counteract that. So, in the words of a senior Pentagon official, this has been a game of cat and mouse. It means that they constantly have to be tweaked to maintain their effectiveness on the battlefield. Sara?",

A debt default would have a major impact on tens of millions of Americans, from social security to veterans' benefits, to how much you pay for a loan.Here's a look at potential downsides. First, social security, about 66 million retirees, disabled workers and others receive monthly benefits from social security. For two-thirds of them, it makes up more than half of their income. And if the U.S. defaults on its debt, those payments could be delayed. It could also take longer for veterans to get their disability payments and pensions. And even paychecks would be stalled for the 1.4 million active duty military members and more than 2 million federal civilian workers. If you look at the big picture and the economic effect, a debt default would likely be disaster for the financial markets. Moody's Analytics has estimated stocks could shed as much of a third of their value or around $12 trillion, yes, with a T, in household wealth, even if the impasse were solved very quickly. The cost of borrowing money and paying off debt would also, of course, rise. That's because interest rates on loans, credit cards, and mortgages are often based on treasury yields. That is on top of the increased cost Americans are already facing from rate hikes. And, finally, a debt default could trigger an economic downturn. As you might imagine, analysts suggest the jobless rate could jump to 5 percent if it lasted a week and over 8 percent if the standoff lasted more than six weeks. Let's hope it doesn't happen.

But in this report, we saw that health services, education services, professional business services, even information technology, which had big headlines in terms of layoffs for large companies, even that showed hiring strength.
