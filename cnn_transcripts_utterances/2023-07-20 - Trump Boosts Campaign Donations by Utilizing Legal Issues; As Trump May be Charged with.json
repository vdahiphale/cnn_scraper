We've seen in multiple requests, almost by the hour, particularly yesterday, the former president trying to rally his base and look for support. We won't know exactly how successful these fundraising efforts have been until after the next fundraising period when candidates are required to report their numbers to the FEC.But we do have a glimpse into how it worked earlier this year. And if you look at the March indictment, when he first was indicted in New York, before that, our analysis shows that he was getting about an average of about -- some $80,000 a day or so in donations after it spiked to about $4 million in the days around the endorsement. And that is certainly significant. So, the reason for this is, he's simply asking for money. He's simply in the news a lot. He's trying to weaponize this indictment to gain political favor out of it. So, certainly it was successful previously. We have no reason to believe it will not be again this time.",

GOVERNOR:  The least of Donald Trump's problems are money, right? I just don't really think that's going to be an issue as he navigates this process of trying to run for president again. And this is starting to get serious. Love him or hate him, this is getting really, really serious. And we're quickly accelerating past political fodder. I mean, this indictment looks like it's imminent. And then you've got a Fulton County indictment that looks like that's imminent in the next few weeks. And this creates a math problem for him, right? We can go through all this gyrations and act like he can win the presidency again, but he can't, right? The middle is done with him. The middle in 2016 gave him a shot, and walked away from it and is never coming back.",

If Republicans are still trying to fight the last war, the war over 2020, over January 6th, that is not about the future.But by and large, Republican candidates have rallied to the former president's defense. Why is that? Because they think that that's the only political lane. They believe that in a Republican primary contest, it is dangerous to speak out against him. So, now, basically speaking about the weaponization of the Justice Department has become an unspoken party platform. Many candidates are talking about it. But Nikki Haley also is leading the way saying, enough of this drama. This is why if Republicans are going to win the general election, as Geoff was just saying there, they need to appeal to moderate and independent voters here. So, as for now, they've, sort of, boxed themselves in. They have made the decision, the rival candidates to not speak critically of this. But I think we should point out, each one of these potential indictments are different. And the one that is coming down the pike now is about January 6th, something much more seared into people's minds, and classified documents, or the New York case which is, you know, the -- sort of, confusing to be frank. This is a very different matter here. So, we have be patient, and wait and see what the charges are, if any, give voters a sense to digest them, and see how it plays out and affects the process.",

I know it's a short-term sugar high to try to beat Donald Trump light, but I think it's a huge self-inflicted error that we're making, right? We need to be clear voiced with saying, you know, who cares about Donald Trump? He lost to Joe Biden. He lost the middle. He lost the Senate.Just look at Georgia. Look at what Brian Kemp did to win. He beat David Perdue by 52 points. Donald Trump's best-friend, he beat by 52 points and then ran the tables on Stacey Abrams because he didn't focus on Donald Trump. He focused on his conservative record and the policies that matter. I think that's what a majority of Americans want. They want an excuse to not have to vote for Donald Trump.",

But of course, as I just stated, this was stolen labor, uncompensated labor. The new standards also omit the fact that the Florida legislature in 1957 passed a resolution opposing the Brown V. Board of Education ruling, that's the landmark Supreme Court ruling that made public education -- made segregation in public education illegal.They also say that when you're teaching -- this is in high school now, teaching the Ocoee Massacre, that you have to include acts of violence perpetrated by African Americans. Now, this is really, really important. The Ocoee Massacre in 1920, it's been called the deadliest U.S. election day in history. A man tried -- a black man tried to vote, he was turned away, and later mobs of armed white people attacked blacks in the town of Ocoee. These rules apply to other massacres as well. The Tulsa Massacre, the Atlanta Race Riot, among others. And the problem here is that talking about violence perpetrated by black people when we're actually talking about massacres that involved violent armed mobs killing -- of white people killing black citizens.

He's had a big campaign against what he calls WOKE ideology, and that bill makes it illegal to teach children that they are inherently privileged or oppressed as a result of their race, or their sex, or gender. And so, this is kind of, all part of that. The state believes that these new standards are in line with what their goals are. But, of course, critics say they aren't. Critics, among them, the president and CEO of the NAACP Derrick Johnson who says, it's imperative that we understand that the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow were a violation of human rights and represent the darkest period in American history.

And separately, anecdotally, we're hearing of other trials that either had to shut down or some that were scheduled to start this summer. That couldn't start because they can't get enough medications for their studies.
