      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, it's an incredibly meaningful day for this country -- the Jewish state that was really founded in the embers of the Holocaust. And almost every Israeli has some sort of personal connection to the Holocaust through family members -- parents, grandparents, great grandparents who either perished or survived the Holocaust.So today will be a day full of ceremonies and remembrances. The most notable -- the one that most people are aware of is those sirens that go off exactly at 10:00 a.m. for two minutes straight. And it's incredible to see people completely standing still in their tracks. You'll even see people driving on the highways -- on the roads stopping their cars to get out of their cars and stand at attention in memory -- really, in recognition of the millions upon millions of lives lost. Now, today there will be ceremonies all throughout the day. The main ceremony, of course, at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum. They will be recognizing the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust with six different torches who will each be lit by a survivor of the Holocaust. And the main theme of this year's Remembrance Day is the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. This really kicks off, though, a week of memorials here. So today is the Holocaust Remembrance Day. Next week will be the memorial day for Israeli soldiers, and it will be followed by Independence Day. And it is interesting today of all -- of all days to really put politics aside, today is the day that Israelis do this. As you noted, the Israeli President Isaac Herzog appeared alongside the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And although Israeli society is very much divided over this judicial reform that the Netanyahu government is trying to push through and over the politics in general right now, the president called on the public to set politics aside -- to allow for a moment of unity. And it does appear as though the Israeli society is doing this. It is interesting to note, Christine, there are still more than 147,000 Holocaust survivors who are still living in Israel. More than 400 of them turned 100 this year. And an interesting other note is that they have now noted that more than 500 of them actually just recently arrived here from Ukraine and are designated as Holocaust survivors -- Christine.",

There have been snags in the supply chain and after that they've been looking to diversify their manufacturing units and look elsewhere other than China, and India seems to be the place for them currently. What's interesting though is that Apple is the second-biggest smartphone maker in the world and despite that it holds only about six percent of the market share here in India. They're hoping to expand that and opening these two stores -- first, in Mumbai and then in Delhi -- is a message they're trying to send out that hey, we're here. We want to expand and we want more people to buy our phones. But more importantly, like I said, there were a few rules relaxed in 2019 by the Indian government after which you had the first online retail store from Apple also for India and now the expanding. They have those two retail stores -- the second opening just a day after in Delhi. And along with that they're looking at manufacturing a lot more and exporting and shipping a lot more from India -- so much so that figures speak for themselves as well, Christine. There's been a huge increase, about 65 percent since last year in the shipment and exports from India in terms of iPhones that have been manufactured here -- Christine.",

Sabonis goes down fighting for the rebound and he grabs Draymond's leg, and Draymond responds by stomping on Sabonis. He was in a lot of pain, as you can see right there. Sabonis got a technical for grabbing Draymond's leg. Draymond got a flagrant two and was ejected from the game. Sabonis had some x-rays on his chest afterwards and those came back negative. The Kings -- they would pull away late to win this one 114-106. The first time in the Steph Curry era with the Warriors they're down 0-2 in a series.

Pandemic relief expired, such as the enhanced child tax credit. That was worth up to $3,600 a child. Those breaks have now gone back to $2,000 per kid. More on tax day in a moment.But a look at Wall Street and markets around the world. European markets are higher at this hour. Asia closed mixed. China's economy off to a solid start, by the way. Gross domestic product there grew by 4.5 percent in the first quarter. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning up here on tax day. Stocks clawed higher in a busy earnings season yesterday. The Dow rose 100. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq also up on the day. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Netflix all report before the opening bell. And on inflation watch, gas prices rose a penny overnight to $3.68 a gallon. Today we get key housing data, building permits, housing starts. Those are due out later this morning. All right, but the main event. Just hours remain to get your tax returns in on time. I want to bring in senior economist and research manager for federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, Erica York. So nice to see you, Erica, on a very busy day. We know the average tax refund is a little bit less this year. A lot of that pandemic aid expired. I'm wondering, does that mean the filing process was simpler this year than the past couple of years? ERICA YORK, SENIOR ECONOMIST AND RESEARCH MANAGER, TAX FOUNDATION (via Skype):  Relative to the last few years, yes. Taxpayers didn't have to navigate all of that pandemic relief on their tax returns this year. So we're back to a more normal tax filing season as far as what benefits are available for taxpayers when they file their tax returns. That's also meant, as you noted, refunds are down by about $300 on average or about 10 percent overall because many of those expanded benefits are no longer available. But just because we're returning back to normal though doesn't necessarily mean it's a simple process for taxpayers to file their taxes.",

The deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury yesterday said that the IRS has been answering more than 85 percent of calls this filing season, which is a big improvement over 10 percent.But there's also some troubling signs ahead. The IRS, in the first two months of this year, spent through 10 percent of that $3 billion and the agency has said, itself, that it anticipates running out of those funds within four years. So the promise of long-term improvement is pretty uncertain if the IRS is going to burn through that money so quickly.",
