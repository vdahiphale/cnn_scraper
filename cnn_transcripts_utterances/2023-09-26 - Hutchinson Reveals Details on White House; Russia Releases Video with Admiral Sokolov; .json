She quotes her former boss, former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, as saying, \"Cass, if I can get through this job and manage to keep Trump out of jail, I'll have done a good job.\" And after a 2020 campaign rally Meadows reportedly asked her, quote, \"would you take a bullet for him,\" meaning Trump. She says she tried to joke back saying, \"could it be to the leg?\" Meadows then responded that he would, quote, \"do anything\" to get Trump re-elected.CNN's Sara Murray is with us now with some of the details in this new book.

And so, obviously, he's a very high-profile target for the Ukrainians.Back on Friday we saw the Ukrainian military use western-provided long-range missiles to strike at the building which houses the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. It's in Sevastopol, in Crimea, which Russia occupied back in 2014. Completely destroyed the building. An astonishingly symbolic strike in which the Russians say one person went missing. And so there's some doubt about that when you look at the pictures of the huge explosions. The Ukrainian, you know, authorities came out, the intelligence services came out and said actually we killed Admiral Sokolov and a couple of dozen other senior figures as well. Now, that's not been confirmed to us by the Russians and it seems now that Sokolov, if this video is accurate, is alive as it appears on the television (ph).

You do have cities and you do have counties here in the border that are making emergency declarations, but there's usually a very pragmatic, a very practical reason for that. In places like El Paso, it allows our local communities to access more resources, to open up more shelter spaces, to provide more transportation options when we have to process people more quickly when the numbers go up. So, the situation is urgent. The numbers are real. But I can say that here -- here at the border, in our border community here in El Paso, the city and the county are doing great work to process people humanely. Churches, NGOs, you know, they're doing what they do best, which is to provide people a warm welcome, a hot meal, a place to sleep until folks are ready to move on.
