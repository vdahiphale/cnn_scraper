It is a county that President Biden won by wider margins in 2020 compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016. It's also a county that Obama did well in back when he ran in 2008.So Obama and Tim Walz will be delivering a message that we have heard repeatedly from the Vice President over the last several days, which is trying to underscore the stakes of this election. Expect more of that over the next several days from this campaign as they try to hyper focus on the risks and threats that they say a second Donald Trump term poses. Now, in addition to all of this, as you just mentioned, Obama will be going to Michigan, yet another swing state, and also a state, by the way, that Vice President Kamala Harris was in a few days ago to also kick off early voting in Detroit. And then he's going to join the Vice President in battleground Georgia on Thursday for their first campaign appearance together. So taken together, what this is, is the campaign bringing the star power to pull supporters to vote early and to make sure that they can lock in their coalition. That includes by more exposure for the Vice President with interviews, traditional and nontraditional, but today with Telemundo to try to appeal to Latino voters. The reason for that is while she polls well with Latinos, more - better than for President Donald Trump, when you dig into those numbers, it's lagging behind Democratic nominees and she's evenly split among Hispanic men with Trump. So today in that interview, the focus for the campaign is for her to appeal to them with her economic proposals centered on affordability. Brianna? Boris.",

His podcast is consistently ranked as one of the top podcasts, and it actually reaches into a community that Donald Trump's team has been trying to tap into, which is essentially low propensity voters, people who don't generally show up to the polls, but also people who don't generally engage with politics using traditional media. But they might listen to podcasts.We know Donald Trump has used this effort to try and reach out to these different voting blocs time and time again. But Joe Rogan would really be kind of the cherry on top because of the fact that he is so popular. And one of the things that I had heard back when RFK decided to drop out and endorse Donald Trump was that Donald Trump's team was actually hoping that this would help with the relationship with Joe Rogan to get this interview on the books. Because remember, Joe Rogan and Donald Trump have not had a perfect history. Joe Rogan essentially said that all politicians but RFK Jr. were manipulative. And then Donald Trump slashed out at Joe Rogan. So it'll be interesting to see how all of this plays out when they sit down together in Austin, Texas, at Rogan's studio there on Friday.",

I mean, who knows? But that's what they think.And that the concern of those undecided voters is about his temperament. And what they're trying to do is over and over again say that he is unstable, that he is a risk to the country. Now, it is difficult for them, and they admit it, when you have a 60 percent sort of disapproval rating of the way things are going in the country. You know, two-thirds of the voters think things aren't going well. To convince people on that case alone that Donald Trump shouldn't be president. Now, she believes she has introduced herself to the American public, but I think she's still got some work to do on that front to talk to people about what she's going to do as president.

And then, of course, on humanitarian aid, the necessity for the humanitarian aid flow into Gaza to increase. The Biden administration has been pressing Israel to actually enable more of that humanitarian aid to get in, to make sure that it is distributed within Gaza. That's according to Blinken's message to Prime Minister Netanyahu in their meeting earlier today. But the Israelis aren't saying anything about that today.

But U.S. officials also recognize, they say, that there is a need, there is - Israel should be able to go after Hezbollah targets inside of Lebanon.And that is where the challenge is here, because a lot of the strikes that the Israelis have been carrying out have had civilian deaths that have occurred as a result.

Our best guess is that these two documents, it was just two pages that came out, probably came out from someone who had access to it, could be even a fairly low level military official, who maybe wanted to make the point that Israel was getting ready for this attack. We knew it was getting ready for the attack. The president said so. He said so on Friday that he knew when the attack was going to be and how it was going to go proceed. He didn't give any details, obviously.But it's embarrassing because it reminds the Israelis in a very visible way that the U.S. doesn't trust what they're saying to them and is spying on them. Now, on the other hand, the Israelis at various moments, especially during nuclear negotiations with Iran, have done the same to the United States. So it's not like allies don't watch each other.",

But we'll have to see how that sorts out.Obviously, the Biden administration has set some parameters about what they think Gaza should look like. They've said it should not be ruled by Hamas. Seems reasonable. They've said Israeli troops should not be there. The prime minister has not fully agreed to that. And certainly, if there were settlements inside Gaza, that would sort of undo the whole sense of what Gaza was all about.",
