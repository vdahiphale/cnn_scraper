This is CNN Newsroom.President Joe Biden courting Black voters in a battleground state. What to expect from his much-anticipated commencement speech today at Morehouse College. An ultimatum from within the Israeli government, how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is responding to calls for him to solidify a plan for Rafah. And hundreds of thousands of people still without power in Texas and Louisiana, as high temperatures threaten the region. President Biden is on campaign trail this weekend, talking with supporters at a downtown Atlanta restaurant and attending a fundraising event. Now, he's working to allay fears over recent polls that put him behind Donald Trump in several battleground states. Now, in a few hours, Biden will give the commencement speech at the historically Black all-male Morehouse College. This comes as the President is facing criticism for his policies towards Israel and Gaza. And there are concerns that what should be a joyful day could turn ugly. Arlette Saenz has more.

      "sentences": "President Biden will deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College, an all-male historically Black college here in Atlanta, Georgia. The event is meant to celebrate the graduating seniors, but it has come with a dose of controversy, as some faculty and students have expressed frustration with President Biden's handling of the conflict in Gaza. That is an issue that has been of key concern to many young voters. The White House dispatched a senior official just last week to Morehouse College to meet with a small group of faculty and students. That meeting lasted a little over two hours, and I'm told that about half of it focused specifically on the issue of Gaza. But President Biden will face a very delicate balancing act as he gives his remarks on Sunday.One, there is the potential for possible protests due to his support for Israel in its war against Hamas. But then also the president is trying to navigate shoring up support among Black voters, including young Black men. Black voters comprise a core part of Biden's constituency and coalition back in 2020 that sent him to the White House. But recent polling has shown some lagging support from that group. Now, President Biden stopped to meet with some Black voters, supporters at a restaurant here in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, and talked about the accomplishments of his administration, but also warned the threat that Trump could pose if he's reelected. President Biden also took a bit of a swipe at his rival. Take a listen. JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: The fact is that this election, lots of stake, lots of stake. It's not about me; it's about the alternative as well. You know, he -- I think it's fair to say -- I won't use the exact phrase that I'd use if I was still playing ball, but my opponent is not a good loser. (LAUGHTER)",

      "sentences": "Well, Kim, I think it's important to think about this from a historical perspective. So we know that in 1964, President Johnson, Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, signed the Civil Rights Act into law. And he did so against a lot of protests from Southern Democrats, who at the time were the racist party. And when he signed that bill, all those Democrats defected from the party and became Republicans. And I think from then on, over the decades that followed, it was pretty clear which party stood for what.The Democratic Party was perceived to be the party for civil rights, expanding civil rights for Black folks, whereas the Republican Party was viewed as being the antithesis of that. I think now that we're decades beyond that, I think what you're seeing is that a lot of younger Black voters just aren't seeing it that way anymore. They're not giving the Democratic Party that same benefit of the doubt that older Black voters perhaps are. And so despite the fact that I think the President has amassed an incredible record of accomplishments and has delivered an incredible amount of policy wins for the Black community, including, you know, younger Black voters, when you talk about creating jobs and investing in HBCUs, investing in Black-owned small businesses, expanding healthcare access, canceling billions and billions of dollars in student debt, I think what we're seeing is that a lot of young Black voters just haven't felt that quite yet. And so it's important for the President, I think, during his speech to really lean into his record, but before doing that, to address the frustrations and the concerns that a lot of younger Black voters are feeling right now with the Democratic Party.",

Look, I think we're obviously not in a pandemic right now in the same way we were four years ago, so it certainly feels very different in that respect. I think it's important to emphasize that President Biden's support among Black voters is very solid, and President Trump's support among Black voters is abysmal. I don't think we're going to see a defection en masse of Black voters from President Biden to former President Trump. I think what we could see, you know, in a state like Georgia is perhaps some of the younger Black voters staying home.And so I think it's important, it's imperative that the Biden campaign make up that enthusiasm gap, because we know on the other side, President Trump's base is ready to come out.

And as you say, they discovered the body of Ron Benjamin, a 53-year-old father of two, a keen cyclist, used to go biking every Saturday morning. And so it was on that fateful Saturday morning of October the 7th, he was out on his bike, he got killed, the IDF says, by Hamas militants, and then his body was abducted into the Gaza Strip. And Israel recovered his body, along with the bodies of three other hostages that it had already announced that it had found on Friday. And the big concern, and they've been saying this for weeks, for months now, is that there simply isn't time. Time is running out for the hostages being held in the Gaza Strip now since October the 7th. If something isn't done, if the government doesn't do whatever it takes to bring them home, then they may not be able to get their loved ones back into Israel alive. That is their biggest fear. There are still 124 hostages, the IDF believes, being held inside the Gaza Strip, about a quarter of whom are already dead, and these protesters are concerned that that number of dead will only grow.

More Ukrainians are being evacuated near the northern border, but heavy fighting with Russian forces is making it harder to leave. Officials say about 100 people are trapped in the embattled town of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine's emergency services say explosions are moving closer and the situation is getting worse every minute. At least three people were killed and seven others injured over the last 24 hours, according to police. The head of Kharkiv's Defense Forces says the overall situation in the region is difficult, but Ukrainian troops are gradually stabilizing it. Kharkiv is hoping to beef up its defenses by requiring all men between the ages of 18 and 60 to register with the military, even those living outside of the country. The new law went into effect on Saturday as Ukraine faces a shortage of troops and equipment. [05:15:09] Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili says she has vetoed the so- called foreign agents bill that sparked widespread protests across the country. It would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents or face fines. Critics say it's modeled after Russian laws meant to snuff out opposition. And Zourabichvili says the bill could jeopardize Georgia's chances of joining the European Union. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALOME ZOURABICHVILI, GEORGIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, I vetoed the Russian law. This law is Russian in its essence and its spirit.

This could be a problem as heat starts to build this weekend going into early next week. We'll find temperatures in the middle 90s, but that could feel even hotter than that once you factor in some of the humidity. Look at the heat index values approaching 100 to 105 from Brownsville, Texas, up near 100 in Corpus Christi. Heat index values in the middle 90s in Houston, again without power and air conditioning. This could pose a little bit more of a risk, so be careful to take breaks as you're cleaning up some of that damage. That heat builds in the south as another storm system develops there in the Rockies and that's going to pose our next severe threat in the Plains by Sunday and Monday. We're looking at another couple of rounds of storms with damaging winds, large hail, and maybe some tornadoes possible, so we'll need to stay weather aware. You can see the storms are starting to fire up late on Sunday, especially across parts of Kansas going into Nebraska and we'll have that front slowly start to work its way into the rest of the Midwest as we go into Monday with that continued storm threat. So for Omaha, you're looking at temperatures above average before that front with highs in the 80s as showers and storms roll through as we start out the work week and those temperatures do get back closer to average with highs in the middle 70s.

Scheffler was detained early Friday morning on the way to the Valhalla Golf Club ahead of the second round of the PGA Championship after police say he didn't obey an officer's instructions near the scene of a deadly car crash near the course.According to police, the officer identified as Detective Bryan Gillis got hurt attaching himself to Scheffler's car when the golfer tried to drive around. It's not clear whether Gillis was wearing a body camera, and if he was, why it wasn't recording, which is required by police. Scheffler, who called the incident a, quote, \"big misunderstanding,\" faces four charges, including second-degree felony assault of an officer. As for Scheffler on the course, well, let's bring in Coy Wire. So, Coy, after doing well the day it happened, he struggled Saturday, right?",

By the third round Saturday, perhaps that adrenaline had worn off. After missing a birdie putt on the opening hole, the world number one and reigning Masters champ would hit a double bogey, bogey, then bogey again over the next three holes. He would go from three shots off the lead, Kim, to eight shots back by the end of the day, finishing two over par.Meanwhile, the rest of the field played Valhalla really well with low scores pretty much across the board. On top at 15-under, Xander Schauffele, who's looking for his first major of his career, and second two-time major champ Collin Morikawa. Here's Scheffler on his struggles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, WORLD NO. 1 GOLFER: I was definitely, did not feel like myself today for sure, but yesterday happened and I did my best to recover from it and come out here and compete today. And, you know, I did a great job yesterday of coming out and competing, riding the adrenaline. And yeah, this morning was definitely not my usual routine for a round, if that makes sense. But, you know, at the end of the day, I came out here hoping to have a good round, wasn't able to get it done, which is pretty frustrating. But I'll come back and try again tomorrow.
