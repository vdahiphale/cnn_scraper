I'm Omar Jimenez, in for Fredricka Whitfield.We're going to begin this hour with the race for the White House Tuesday, marks three weeks until Election Day, but who is counting? As we enter this critical home stretch, polls continue to show the presidential race remains neck and neck. CNN's latest National Poll of Polls is out today shows no clear leader, with 50 percent of likely voters supporting Harris and 47 percent for Trump, really no clear leader here, as we mentioned and both candidates are spreading out across battleground states this week. In the next couple of hours, Trump will hold a rally in the swing state of Arizona. Right now, Harris continues to campaign in storm- battered North Carolina, where she just spoke at a church, and soon, the Vice President will hold a rally in that critical state. Tomorrow, Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz will begin a week-long campaign blitz of blue wall states. CNN's Poll of Polls in those blue wall states shows Harris and Trump are still locked in a dead heat in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. We've got a team of correspondents out on the campaign trail covering this race. Alayna Treene is with the Trump campaign in Arizona, but let's start with Eva McKend with the Harris campaign in North Carolina. I mean, Eva, Harris is going to hold a rally soon, but has already taken a few shots at her political rival during that church visit. What can you tell us about what she said,",

Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yet instead of offering hope, there are those who are channeling people's tragedies and sorrows into grievance and hatred. And one may ask why? And I think, sadly, frankly, the motives are quite transparent, to gain some advantage for themselves, to play politics with other people's heartbreak, and it is unconscionable.

What I'm hearing from Democrats here is that they're hoping that North Carolinians will vote early. Early voting starts in just four days, and it is there where the Vice President has the opportunity to try to recreate the winning multiracial coalition that led, in part, to President Biden's victory in 2020. To give you a sense of how this worked, we're in Pitt County, President Biden won this county in 2020 by about 10 points alone.",

They recognize that Donald Trump, his rhetoric is getting darker, his language is getting more angry and aggressive, but they argue that they think that strategy is working.I know from my conversations with those close to the former president, that Donald Trump himself really believes that that type of fear- mongering, about stoking fears about migrants in this country helped deliver him to the White House in 2016 and he believes that it will help deliver him to the White House again come November. They also recognize, of course, how tight this polling is. As you mentioned at the top that this is a neck and neck race. They recognize that. They think that this election is going to be won on the margins, and they really do believe that this anti-immigrant rhetoric is going to help them. Now, just to talk a little bit more about Arizona, we know that this is a state that Donald Trump lost, or excuse me, he won in 2016 but lost to Joe Biden in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 points. Now, if you look at the most recent polling from us, but also \"New York Times\" and others, it shows that Donald Trump continues to have a small lead in this state. I know from my conversations with the Trump campaign that they really do believe that Arizona is going to be one of the most crucial, crucial states to them in November. That's why you're going to see him spend a lot more time here as we look ahead to November 5th -- Omar.",

I want to turn now to storm-battered Florida, because more reminders of what Florida residents are finding when they return home. A portion of a pier washed up on a beach behind homes on Florida's Anna Maria Island after Milton hit the island just four days ago, while 1.5 million Floridians are still without power. President Joe Biden announced more than $600 million to shore up the power grid in places like Florida. And after getting a bird's eye view from Marine One of the extensive damage left, this is some of the view there, by Hurricane Milton, today's visit marks the second time in a little over a week, Biden traveled to the state. We've got a team of correspondents covering this. CNN correspondent, Brian Todd is traveling with the president in Florida, while CNN White House correspondent, Arlette Saenz is in Wilmington, Delaware as well.

So he is again flanked by several Republican officials. In turn, the president himself thanked the first responders who showed up to help. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the White House and officials across the administration have said that they do believe they have enough funding to deal with the response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, but it's any disasters that could pop up around the corner that they are concerned about. Earlier in the week, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said that they have already run through about $9 billion of the $20 billion that Congress had recently appropriated to the disaster relief program with these hurricanes. So it really speaks to the urgency that the administration is facing as they prepare for any other possible natural disasters that could come. There is also the issue of a program at the Small Business Administration, which officials argue needs to be funded more in order to help small business owners, as well as homeowners, recover some of the property and equipment they may have lost in these hurricanes. But one big question is exactly how much the administration will be asking Congress to provide. Earlier today, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, would not put an exact figure on what they will be asking down the road. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Iran fired 180 of those at Israel just two weeks ago, Hezbollah has fired a handful. The Houthis from Yemen have fired a handful into the center of Israel as well. And this does seem to indicate that the United States and Israel both feel the need to step up the defenses against ballistic missiles. This, of course, as Israel is mulling just how it strikes back at Iran, following those ballistic missiles here two weeks ago. And of course, Iran threatening to escalate and follow up with their own counter strikes, potentially, if Israel does. So, it points to an increase in tensions. It points to an increase in potential vulnerability, if you will, across the country, and the need to bolster the defenses here in Israel. You know what those -- what the THAAD won't do is stop the drones that came in this evening. Now the IDF said they did intercept one of the drones that was coming in from Lebanon, but these -- the drones are perhaps proving some of the trickier weapon systems incoming to take down.",

What it does is integrate different types of air defense systems. Now everyone knows about the Iron Dome. That's the word that, or the phrase that rolls off of people's tongue that Israel has. The Iron Dome is used against low altitude rockets and some missiles. Israel also has a weapon system called the David Sling that's for medium altitude incoming rockets and missiles. They also have something called the Arrow, which is high altitude, and it was tested up until about the 2012 timeframe, and put into service. The US before that, when I was commander in Europe, we used to loan Patriot PAC-3s with their crews to Israel, and we used to have those Patriot PAC-3 going against high altitude weapons. Well, the THAAD system is very, very different. It's something called a kinetic kill technology. It doesn't have a round that goes off against another missile and blows up close by. It has a direct impact with just a kinetic kill against the missile. So it actually strikes the incoming anti -- the incoming ballistic missile system. The US is deploying a US battery. As Nic said, it has got about a hundred soldiers as part of it. It will have six launchers, and each launcher can fire about eight missiles at a time. So you've upped the potential to strike the anti -- or to use as anti- ballistic missiles coming in from Iran, if there is a reaction to any kind of Israeli strike against Iran in the coming days. This is the best system in the world that, and there's only six of them, six batteries of these in the United States inventory. So loaning one and deploying a group of soldiers to Israel is a pretty big deal.",

We have not given this system to the Israelis. So this is a US system only shared by a couple of other countries that have bought it recently. But they need to be there in order to fire this system.But the other important thing about it, and I'll counter what Nic said, it has a range of about a hundred -- almost a hundred miles in terms of its shoot capabilities and it can range in area about 125 miles. So if you put these missile systems spread out throughout Israel, a country that's only about 250 miles from north to south and about 70 miles from east to west, you can basically cover the entire country with this one missile battery. This is unlike something that might go to Ukraine, which is 500 miles from north to south and about 800 miles from east to west. So this is specifically geared toward Israeli defense, and it's something that the US and Israel have practiced multiple times in the last 20 years in something called an Integrated Air Defense System.",

That's not normally the way you do it for more assets based on their belief that the former president was still vulnerable. Once that got detangled, now the request, it goes through the normal processes, which is the Department of Homeland Security, which would then pull from the Department of Defense, if it determined, and President Biden seems to agree, if it determined that some of these requests are necessary. There are legal issues that might be involved. But this is one of those things that it's not clear. No one benefits from this being sort of out in the dialogue, in some ways, because you want to -- you do want to protect Donald Trump, but his campaign made it public. They claim that it was very slow in the making, but obviously this is a determination made by security professionals, not by the candidate, and that's why you're hearing a lot of this, like, is this for real, or is this just a way that he wants to look like the president as we approach the election.",

This is no different than Oklahoma benefiting from the federal government when it gets hit by tornadoes or Florida, as we saw last week. But this is part of the narrative that Trump is pushing right now on disaster and the politics of disaster. He's been pushing these lies about whether the Biden administration is favoring or disfavoring red states, it is not. And he now takes it to California to say California will be punished and he uses violent language when and if he becomes president, it's unprecedented. That's worth saying as well. It's unlawful.

So scenes like this, where you can see buildings and homes under water, you have to understand that Florida's topography plays a big role, and because it's very flat, you don't have that water receding as quickly as say you would for rivers, creeks, and streams that are say in a more mountainous terrain where gravity helps push that water back out.Now one bit of good news is for a lot of the rivers, creeks and streams on the western side of Florida, those have already crested. We're starting to see those numbers come down, but it's the eastern portion of Florida, including the St. Johns River, where those rivers are still going up and likely won't crest for several more days, providing those folks the relief they desperately need. There is rain in the forecast in Florida, but today it's mainly going to be focused in South Florida, areas like Miami and Key West. Other areas of rain from an entirely separate system are going to be making their way through the Great Lakes, and it's all thanks to this cold front, but the cold front is going to have more of a widespread impact in the form of temperatures the next few days. Take a look at Washington, DC, for example, high temperature today likely to make it into the low 80s, but that high temperature Tuesday may not even make it up to 60 degrees, thanks to that cold front. Look at a city like Atlanta, you're going to see the temperatures dropping back down to 63 for the high on Wednesday, that next morning, low may not even get to 40 degrees. You're going to see those temperatures dropping back into the 30s. And also, Dallas, take a look at this, going from 96 today all the way down to a high of only 68 on Wednesday. So if you haven't already, you're going to want to take those sweaters and coats out. You will need them this week.",

But Springfield was a city once struggling to find workers. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate, Senator JD Vance has spent a lot of their campaign lately targeting these legal immigrants, spreading claims that haven't been backed up by evidence, and threatening to deport them if elected. Now, since the presidential debate back on September 10th, I've been to Springfield many times, and I quickly realized there was a bigger story there that existed way before all these national politics got involved. So in this week's \"The Whole Story,\" I'm going to take you inside this community. I spoke with local residents, business owners, city leaders, and the immigrants who are now facing harassment and threats to their safety. Here's a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
