But now late yesterday, we heard from, not only Governor DeWine's office but also that federal, federal officials saying that FEMA support will, in fact, be on the way in the form of what they described as a senior response official and also what FEMA described as a Regional Incident Management Assistance Team. That announcement made late yesterday.Now, what's yet to be seen is exactly what that will look like. Officials do say that this will come in the form of teams that will assess the long term needs of the region, and that is really still the heart of the stories, as you just heard from that concerned resident right now. Our team is on the ground up and hearing from people that say that they've developed sore throats, headaches, feeling of nausea, and also some rashes after returning to their home when the all-clear was given after that incident that took place on February 3rd. Officials, as you just heard from the governor have maintained that testing has determined that the air is safe to breathe, as well as the water, that there are no hazardous levels of any chemicals. But that still has done little to reassure the many residents there that are still concerned at this hour. We also heard from federal officials after the incident that they have deployed some assets and then of course, health officials will be sending medical personnel, also toxicologist to the region starting next week to be present to assess some of these people with these concerns. But again, Boris and Amara, what is yet to be seen is what, if anything, this will do to reassure those residents that are still worried that it's still too dangerous to return to their homes.

Part of what occurred in the management of the release is that there were several cars of this that were heating up and there was fear of an explosion.And the responders had to make a very difficult decision to do a controlled burn of this material to break it down into less hazardous, although pretty nasty looking substances in order to avoid the risk of explosion.

She said, that the, that Russia had pursued a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population really ticking through direct instances in which the U.S. came to their conclusion. Take a listen. Oh, so, so basically, in this shot that I threw that we don't have right now, the Vice President tick through moments in Bucha. Russia, where we know that we saw really bodies, shot and left for dead rotting in the street there. Times where we know that a maternity ward in Russia was bombed, killing a pregnant mother and, and other reports of sexual violence against the people of Ukraine, including young children. So, that was the Vice President getting really, really descriptive there talking about the evidence that the U.S. has looked over allowing it to come to this determination. Now, the Vice President also turned to Beijing and international norms and rules. She said that basically, you know, really, the U.S. was troubled about China's support of Russia as the war has on, as the war has continued. Boris and Amara, she said, really, that it could potentially violate international rules and norms by supporting Russia really allowing other nations to feel as though they could do something similar in other places of the world. And also, she touched just basically on the support that, that the U.S. and other western allies have given to Ukraine. She promised that it would continue that Russia -- the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine, as it fights for its sovereignty. And that President Biden and the U.S. would continue to keep this alliance together that has done so much to support Ukraine in terms of aid, funding, and military equipment.

First off, I want to get your reaction to Vice President Harris's speech. As you heard she has officially declared Russia committing crimes against humanity during its war with Ukraine and vowed that those responsible will be held to account. How significant is this as we are less than a week away from the one-year mark of the invasion? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Well, that's certainly the news in this speech today. The very -- the real specificity and strength with which the Vice President made the case that Russia is committing crimes against humanity. And it really serves two purposes, right, and it's, it's hard to explain what the atmosphere is like here -- the free world is gathered in Munich right now. And of course, there's a hunger for justice here, given the images that are, that continue to come out of Ukraine. But the other thing that's really important about this is that, you know, from the private on the battlefield in Ukraine right now, the Russian private right up to the masters in the Kremlin, they need to understand that this ends with them in handcuffs. That this ends with them being held accountable as the Vice President said for these crimes against humanity, and that may serve the effect of creating a little bit of tension within, within Russian ranks.

In every room I've been in, people have said something that you didn't hear last year, right on the eve of the invasion, which is that that Ukraine must win this war.

And as recovery efforts continue, officials in Turkey have identified more than 90,000 buildings that have already collapsed or are ready to be demolished.Let's go now to CNN Nada Bashir live in Istanbul, Turkey. Hi, Nada what is the latest? NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (on camera): Of course, a sad news. Christian Atsu has now been recovered from the rubble, but is sadly not alive. It's the reality that many families in southeast Turkey are now facing as this rescue mission draws to a close. According to officials, there are less than 200 search and rescue operations ongoing at the moment, although there are still 1000s of search and rescue personnel operating in southeast Turkey. But the hope of finding survivors is fading very, very quickly. Although there are still these miraculous stories of people being pulled from the rubble. Earlier this morning, State media reported that three people, including a 12-year-old child had been pulled from the rubble, 296 hours after the earthquake struck. However, it is now transpired that, that 12-year-old child has now passed away after being recovered from the rubble. And this is, of course, a hugely difficult time for many of those families in southeast Turkey, waiting for news of their loved ones, hoping that they may still be alive. And real reality now is that there are 1000s of families who did survive, but are now facing a completely transformed life. Their homes, completely demolished, their livelihoods gone, many of their relatives, loved ones, have passed away, following this earthquake. They are in need of this humanitarian assistance, and they will be for the next few months. And that is the real focus now here in Turkey. Certainly, for the Turkish government, and as well as the international community. We've already heard from the United Nations, they are now appealing for $1 billion in aid to Turkey to support that humanitarian response effort. And it's a similar story in northwest Syria. The U.N., they are appealing for nearly $400 million to support that effort there. But, of course, as you mentioned that there is a huge infrastructural challenge ahead for the government as well, some 90,000 buildings, at least, either demolish or have been deemed unsafe and in need of demolition. And 1000s left homeless. This is going to be an enormous challenge for the Turkish government. They've already committed to rebuilding the demolish buildings within a year. And they have said that they will go at for all the efforts they have to support those families made homeless. We're already seeing some families being evacuated here in Istanbul as well as children who've lost their parents being cared for an orphanages in this city. But the question now was whether or not this will add pressure to the Turkish government as we are already beginning to see a backlash in that aid response. Amara, Boris?",

OK, this recall covers 2016 to 2023 Models S and Model X vehicles. 2017 to 2023 Model 3, and then, 2020 to 2023 Model Y cars. Now, the recall notice says the system may allow a vehicle to travel through an intersection while in a turn only lane. Enter a stop sign intersection without completely stopping, or enter an intersection during a yellow signal without caution. The chief executive Elon Musk plans to fix the $15,000 feature with an over the air update, essentially, a software upgrade. So, it's not like a recall where you drive your car to the dealership or the service center. This is something that will happen automatically in coming weeks.
