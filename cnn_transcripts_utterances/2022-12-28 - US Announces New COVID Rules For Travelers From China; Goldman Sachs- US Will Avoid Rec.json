The Dow losing more than 200 points, the NASDAQ heavy, even worse this hour. Those are the markets, and these are the main events. The US will begin requiring travelers from China to show a negative COVID test before flying. Goldman Sachs predicts the US economy will avoid a recession in 2023. And yes, what a difference a year makes, especially if you are that guy, Elon Musk. Live from Atlanta, it is Wednesday, December 28th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And we have breaking news for you tonight, the US has announced new restrictions on travelers from China and it follows concerns about China's spike in COVID cases and Beijing's lack of transparency about the numbers. Starting next week, the US will require all travelers from China to show a negative COVID test before flying. We want to get right to our news here with Dr. Jonathan Reiner of George Washington University. He is a CNN medical analyst. And yes, this is deja vu. It is happening in another part of the world, though here, Dr. Reiner, and yet some of the issues completely the same. I want to ask you, in terms of this US response, do you think it is driven by sound public health policy? Or is there more fear because there is so little transparency in China, about the cases and any variants that are spreading? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's probably a little bit of both, but there's a role for some of these restrictive travel policies, but almost all of them are at the very beginning of a pandemic. So you know, new infections spreading around the world, if you're trying to build testing capacity, you know, build hospital bed capacity and trying to buy time, some of these restrictive travel policies can perhaps buy you a little bit of time. And they might have done that in the late winter and early spring of 2020. But this virus is all around the world, and the predominant strains that are circulating in China right now are circulating all around the world, including the United States. So I think this concept of trying to test passengers before they come to the United States is really just a false sense of security. I call it like locking a screen door, you think you're preventing an intruder, but it is really very minimal security.",

We only know the numbers that are reported. And as you know, the vast majority of infections in the United States are found via at-home testing, none of which are reported to the CDC or central authority. So we have no idea how many cases are actually occurring in the United States or in most parts of the world. But what we do know for sure is, the longer this pandemic persists and the more people become infected, the greater is the opportunity for variants with even more rapid transmission profiles, or more immune escape capacity to propagate. So the way to -- you know, the way to prevent variants from forming is to prevent people from becoming infected. But we've lost some of the will to do that. One of the ways that you can do that in the United States and in Western Europe and other parts of the world is to bring back mitigation strategies that have been unpopular, like masking, but we simply don't want to do that.

Kevin, I really want to thank you for getting on top of this breaking news for us. Appreciate it. Now, Goldman Sachs is making a bold prediction for 2023 that the US in fact will avoid a recession. Its analysts see the economy making a soft landing, did I say that well enough? Soft landing -- as the shock of higher rates fades and slower growth eases job growth and inflation. The projections for Europe, yes, they are a lot less optimistic. \"The Financial Times\" polled 37 economists and the vast majority think the Eurozone is already in fact, in recession. Megan Greene is the Global Chief Economist at Kroll. She joins me now from San Francisco, and I'm glad to have you weigh in here as we put 2022 in the books. And now I want to quote you, right? You said this may be the most anticipated recession in history, and yet it may not happen. So weigh in here. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, it's not impossible that Goldman Sachs is right, and that the Fed does manage toengineer a soft landing, I just think it's also not very likely. If you think about it, rates in the US were zero percent at the beginning of this year. So there has been an incredibly aggressive rate tightening cycle. There are a bunch of economic indicators suggesting that we're not only slowing down, we are heading towards a recession. So if you look at the survey data, confidence data, PMI data, if you look at the yield curve, it is deeply inverted. That will suggest the recession is coming. What has held up really well is consumption and consumption accounts for about 70 percent of our growth in the US, and that's partly because there is a huge cash cushion among consumers and among corporates. It is also because the labor market has held up really well, and so the Fed is really hoping that what will happen is it will whittle down job openings, and that the labor market won't deteriorate that much and we can avoid a recession. If you look at the data around past recessions, though, that's a great theory. It's just literally never happened before. So I think if we do get a deterioration in the labor market, people will really pull back on that spending and that is when a recession will hit, I think probably sometime around the middle in the second half of next year.",

So it's really unlikely. Generally, the Fed pitches the economy into recession, it's because monetary policy kicks in with such incredible lags, and there are really blunt tools that the Fed has to work with. So it's really hard to engineer a so-called soft landing while hitting the inflation target of around two percent perfectly, and it makes it really unlikely that the Fed is going to pull this off.",

He is looking at the data, and he wants that inflation number to get to wherehe wants it to be, and he will not take any compromise on it. I want to move to Europe. We were just talking about the FT survey saying that 90 percent, right, of economists are saying, look, there is going to be a recession in Europe in 2023. So if we accept that, it seems what is more worrying now is a protracted recession, maybe even going to 2024. I mean, what do you see when you see that European economy?",

Germany and Italy areprobably also already in contraction. The hope is that it is a short and shallow recession. But Europe is disproportionately hit by the war in Ukraine. Energy costs are much higher in Europe than they are in the US, the cost of living crisis is even higher. A lot of economies in Europe are over leveraged already, so don't have that much room to intervene and protect the vulnerable in society. And the banks, I think, are in a weaker state in Europe than in the US. So there is a risk that you end up seeing financial market blowouts, as the ECB and the Bank of England are withdrawing accommodation, and then you risk getting a financial crisis on top of a plain vanilla recession and that would make the recession a lot deeper and a lot longer. So it's not impossible, that will happen. It's not my base case, either. I think what we probably will see is a shorter, shallower recession this time around than what we've seen in the past, but there of course risks that it could be longer and deeper.",

It is $250 to $300 million in terms of absolute value. The question is how they defray that, that being in terms of how many tickets can they get? How many people can they convince to hold on to their ticket and just rebook rather than sort of insist on the cash refunds?

Born Joseph Aloysius Ratzinger in Germany, in a childhood spent under the shadow of Hitler's Nazi regime, Pope Benedict XVI has sometimes been a divisive figure, unflatteringly referred to as God's Rottweiler in his conservative defense of the faith. He was cardinal and pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts toward a zero tolerance policy. However, after his retirement, he suffered a reputational blow when the church commission report found he knew and failed to act against a pedophile priest while he was archbishop in Munich 40 years ago. Benedict denied the allegations. Even after his resignation, he continues to be a towering figure in the Catholic Church. And as his health declines, there will be many sending him their thoughts and prayers. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
