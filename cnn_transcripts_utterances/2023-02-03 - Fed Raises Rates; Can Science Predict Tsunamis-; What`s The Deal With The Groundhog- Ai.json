Now, the Fed is still trying to slow this economy down to knock inflation down. But it`s gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to tapping the brakes and that is an important shift because it lowers the risk that the Fed ends up causing an accident, either in financial markets or in the real economy or in both. And the Fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The statement says that inflation remains elevated, but it also concedes that it has eased. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A tsunami is a series of waves usually caused byan underwater event like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption and they can cause serious damage to communities that are hit by them. More than 700 million people live in coastal areas that could be exposed to tsunamis. So, imagine how powerful it would be if we could predict them. We`re traveling to Tonga, a Polynesian country that`s part of an archipelago of islands to hear about the work of the folks at the Tonga Geological Society who are studying the ocean floor to get a better sense of what causes tsunamis.

Two weeks later, a series of eruptions willreverberate around the planet and be visible from space. Tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific and the next afternoon, a series of waves hit the island country of Tonga, some as high as 15 meters, killing three people and leaving mass destruction in their wake. When the dust had settled a few months later, a ship from New Zealand`s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWAR set sail to find out what had triggered the eruption. Marine geology technician Erica Spain was on board. DR. ERICA SPAIN, MARINE GEOLOGY TECHNICIAN, NIWA:  The voyage up to Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha`apai, an active volcano, was really exciting. It`s a multi- disciplinary voyage. So, you`ve got multiple science streams working together to try and figure out what was going on and why it erupted so violently. There are the multi-beams on either side.",

Every volcano has a different trigger in terms of when it might erupt, and by mapping Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha`apai and then comparing that to other volcanoes, we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be or what they might look like on the sea floor.",

Happening on March 20th this year, the vernal equinox marks the start of spring. Bye, bye wintertime. Yesterday, February 2nd was Groundhog Day. On this day, some people predict when winter will come to an end by watching a groundhog. In Pennsylvania, my home state, one of the most notorious groundhogs of all time, Punxsutawney Phil. Each year in a tradition derived from a Pennsylvania Dutch superstition, people watch to see how the groundhog emerges from its burrow and whether or not the furry creature sees its shadow well that will determine when winter will end and spring begins. February 2nd isn`t just some random day. It falls at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring or vernal equinox, making it the ideal time to consider when springtime might finally come. We`re going to meet up with one of our in-house experts now to break it all down and find out what Punxsutawney Phil had in store for us this time. All right. The forecast in the hat you`ve all been waiting for, we`re here with friend of the show, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. And here it is, Punxsutawney Phil officially predicts six more weeks of winter after seeing a shadow Thursday morning.",

But if there had not been a shadow, spring would actually arrive early. Now scientifically speaking, winter will officially come to an end on the equinox, on March 20th, regardless of what Phil predicts but Mother Nature doesn`t always follow the timetable and neither does Phil.",
