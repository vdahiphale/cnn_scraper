The district attorney in the case is OUTFRONT.Plus, massive missile attacks, Putin launching at least 55 missiles across Ukraine today as the Kremlin accuses the U.S. of, quote, direct involvement in the war, warning of consequences. And OUTFRONT exclusive tonight, the ex-boyfriend of embattled Congressman George Santos is my guest, as the man he knew, the same person who has lied and lied to the American public. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a nation on edge. Cities across the country bracing for the release of video that is said to show the vicious and prolonged beating of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols by Memphis police, a beating that has been compared to Rodney King's, and according to the Nichols family attorney shows the father being beaten like a, quote, pinata. Now, that video according to the district attorney who I'll be speaking with in just a moment shows the entire incident from beginning to end and could be released by this time tomorrow night. Nichols family right now is getting ready to attend a vigil as the five officers who authorities say were directly involved with the 29- year-old's arrest have now been charged, charges which include second degree murder, aggravated assault, and aggravated kidnapping. Police say officers pulled Nichols over on January 7th for reckless driving. Police say he fled. When officers caught up to him, it sparked a, quote, confrontation. Now, the family's lawyers say that the video of this shows a brutal nonstop beating that lasted for three full minutes. Nichols was taken to the hospital and he died three days later. The Memphis police chief says the video shows a failing of basic humanity towards another individual. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It happened just a couple days after Trump publicly announced that he was running for office again against Merrick Garland's own boss, right? And, of course, once you do that one, and of course, these documents were found in the home and in the private office of Joe Biden, the president. They felt they had to do a special counsel in that case as well. So, right now, Erin, as you pointed out, this is being handled inside the Justice Department.

He didn't want to do the first one. He certainly did not want to do the second one. And so, there is a real reluctance to do a third one while this is still being reviewed.
