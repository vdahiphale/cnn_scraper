Whether in a house or outside, wherever they were found, they need to be autopsied and reviewed by the medical examiner to determine whether they were deaths caused by the blizzard.

He was trying to drive his car to help a friend, he couldn't make it there. Along the way, he had quite an adventure. He ran into one woman who almost ran out of gas, she joined his truck. They took turns sleeping that night.Earlier in the night, he tried to go to at least ten houses offering up to $500 to let him sleep on the floor, all of them said, I'm sorry, they turned him away. So, he returned to his vehicle. He and this other woman slept overnight in that vehicle. Eventually, they decided to break into a nearby school because he knew it would have bathrooms and heat and probably food. And so that's what he did by -- this was from Friday to Saturday. Early Saturday morning, he did this. Then he went out into the school's parking lot and he found a bunch of parked cars, a bunch of older people who were stranded in their vehicles. So, he said, all of you guys come into the school that I've broke into, and that's where they spent the rest of the blizzard until about -- it was evening of Christmas Day. And he said, you know, if one of those houses had let me in, I wouldn't have had this opportunity to save so many lives. He said the ages ranged from about 26 years old to around 73. And he left a note in the end at the school and he said -- I just want to read this note. He said, to whomever it may concern, I'm terribly sorry about breaking the school window and for breaking the kitchen, got stuck 8:00 P.M. Friday and slept in my truck with two strangers just trying not to die. There were seven elderly people also stuck and out of fuel. I had to do it to save everyone and get them shelter and food and a bathroom. And he signed the letter, Merry Christmas, Jay. And, of course, police said later that these people were stuck in areas where they just could not be reached. We know about all those emergency calls that went unanswered. So, this guy, this mechanic took it upon himself to not only save himself but save several other people. And, yes, he had to break into a school to do it but he apologized.

This is one of the surprises of the whole war effort.As you said before, Poppy, there was no evidence that China has entered into the war in a military way. And they were warned by the U.S. that if they did, there would be secondary sanctions on China that would further hurt its economy. But in every other way, every political way, they have come together. And mostly that is an alliance of convenience to frustrate the United States. The Iran element is a new and different one. That's largely between Russia and Iran. China is not as big a player in that. But in that case, both countries were under severe sanctions from the U.S. and both countries see some considerable advantage in getting arms from each other that they're running short of. We know that the Iranians are providing the drones and the Russians are thinking about providing electronics components and maybe even fighters. COLLINS:  And the context here, of course, is Ukraine is now saying they shot down 16 of these Iranian-made drones that they are giving to Russia. And you have fascinating new reporting about how the Biden administration is trying to step in to stop this ability to produce and provide these drones to Ukraine -- I mean, to Russia.",

And CNN did some very good reporting on this last week with Natasha Bertrand, and that is an effort to stop these American or western-made components from getting in.The second interesting element of it, I think, is an effort to try to help the Ukrainians target the drones from where they're taking off. It's not easy because these are very mobile launch sites. You can launch some of these drones from moving around on trucks and launch them from a parking lot or a soccer field. And then the third element is to provide the terminal defense right around the electrical substations and other infrastructure. The problem is, every time that you erect one of these anti-missile defenses around one of the infrastructure elements, you're giving up the chance to put that around a civilian location or an army base. So, it's a tough choice each time and they're in short supply. So, that's the three elements of it, and, of course, suddenly we discovery that the Americans are talking about this with the Israelis.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, two parts of this. First, on your point, Poppy, it really is hard to cut off a country's components when those components dual use. They're used in commercial products, as well as military products. If we were good at this, the Iranians would not be building nuclear centrifuges now, but they're building them just as they were prior to the 2015 nuclear accord that President Trump left. So, if you can't stop the centrifuges, it's hard to imagine they're going to stop the drone production. They might slow it down.The second part, the Israel part was really interesting. Last week, the United States and Israel had a quarterly meeting, security meeting, that's usually devoted largely to the Iran nuclear program. This time, for the first time, the U.S. brought up the Iranian drones. Now, the readout from the meeting, which was a classified meeting, did not say what, if anything, they decided to do together but we do know that Israel. And the U.S. have a long history of working together on trying to sabotage or undermine the Iranian nuclear program. They did so, of course, famously ten years ago on the cyberattack on the nuclear enrichment site, the Israelis have done like other kind of sabotage work. And it would be interesting to know whether that became a subject of conversation. We don't know that right now.",
