      "sentences": "For months, we've listened as pundits and leaders try to guess the political impact of Donald Trump's multiple indictments. Well, indictments seemingly have bolstered him thus far, at least among Republicans. And if Fani Willis is next to charge him, it may only amplify his campaign even more.In 2016, Trump drew 1,000s to rallies all across the country. Last week was pretty extraordinary though. He brought in an estimated 50,000 supporters to a tiny town in South Carolina, Pickens, where the population is just over 3,000 people. He drew a crowd 20 times that number. This was a striking contrast to who is thought to be his biggest political rival at the moment, Governor Ron DeSantis, who held an event in that state. [09:30:00] Last week, DeSantis only bringing in enough enthusiasm to fill a local activity center in North Augusta in South Carolina. In 2016, Trump won the state with over 30 percent during a very crowded primary season. What make this is week's crowd size even more shocking is that he's now running against two locals for the GOP ticket. Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and current senator Tim Scott, both recently held events of their own in South Carolina. Couldn't come close to drawing what Trump drew. Even though that's not enough to make the state waiver in its support as Trump makes his third bid for the presidency, he has already secured endorsements from the state's governor, three congressmen and its senior senator. Despite his legal woes, Trump is heading the Republican race somewhat effortlessly and the money doesn't lie. CNN reports that the former president has nearly doubled his $18.8 million from the beginning of 2023. His campaign earned $35 million in donations in the most recent quarter. Voters appeared eager for Ron DeSantis to join the race. He hauled in $20 million in fundraising in his first six weeks of campaigning. And yet the latest NBC polling shows Trump at 51 percent among Republican voters, DeSantis at 22 percent. Trump actually gained support following his second indictment. In April he was polling at 46 percent. He's now up five points. And it's not a matter of too much competition as some have proposed as in, what if the field narrows? Well, even in a narrow two-candidate field, NBC says Trump beats DeSantis 60 to 36. But what does the wagering tell us? Joining me now to talk more about it is PredictIt co-founder and CEO John Aristotle Phillips. Hey, John, welcome back. Your betting market for the GOP nomination, it seems to resemble the current polling, but it's got Trump running even stronger against DeSantis. Tell me what you see in the GOP nomination fight. JOHN ARISTOTLE PHILLIPS, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, PREDICTIT: So, in the Republican nomination fight, it's interesting. You have got Trump, as you point out, with a commanding lead. DeSantis has done -- you know, he was -- he had a rough launch to his campaign and he's at, you know, 22 percent odds at this point. So, he's -- he's really gone down a bit in the -- in the betting odds. It's interesting to see the second tier of Republican candidates. Scott, Ramaswamy, and Christie who are all at six percent odds. And they are looking to -- you know, they are looking to overtake DeSantis. They have got ways to go. And then the other candidates in the Republican side really haven't registered much at all.",

Interestingly, Gavin Newsom at 18 cents, RFK Jr. at 13, Kamala Harris, the vice president, you know, in a fourth position. What do you see in that wagering? PHILLIPSNewsom is interesting because Newsom is, you know, not even a declared candidate but he's -- he's running around the country giving speeches on Biden's behalf but -- and says he is not a presidential candidate but, of course, he is a presidential candidate. You have got Kennedy, who I think has got some room to grow. He's at 13 percent odds. And it's interesting to see where his support is coming from, but it's -- it's -- Kennedy could be the wild card here on issues such as vax and other issues where the other two above him aren't cutting the mustard. So, you know, the Democratic and the Republican races are wide open still. But there's a clear front runner on the Republican and Democratic side, but their loss is the gain of those below them.",

When tragedies happen, last year as well, we have a common bond and we can talk about things and those things tie us to the school. And also, donation is a life blood in many cases.

And he wrote a piece saying that there's another aspect of legacy admissions, which is that the people who are beneficiaries or historically have been they are tied into networks. Oh, good. We have it. Let me quickly read.\"Legacy students got a leg up in the admissions process, but they were already on the path to success, just by virtue of being born into privilege. In fact, there's considerable evidence that going to an elite school like Princeton, as opposed to a less selective college, made no difference to their earnings.\" Here's the key. \"One group, however, got a big economic boost from going to elite schools, poor students, students of color and students whose parents didn't have a college degree. And that's because the elite colleges connected them to students born into privilege, the very kind of student that legacy preferences admit to such large numbers.\" In other words, like a big part of college is the connections you make and the people that you meet. And now if we end legacy admissions and that network disappears, minorities, too, will be harmed because they are not getting access into those connections. WILLIAMS: Right. That's a great point. And I think I have seen that in my life and my children. I've seen that in their careers as well. And something you mentioned was really important, and I think from like 1970 to like 2010, the Black college enrollment, student enrollment quadrupled. So, there are tons of folks, like you mentioned, your classmates at school who is now like me that have kids who are going to school and they want to reap those benefits. So, it's really hard for me to say, well, you know, maybe we shouldn't be able to participate in this because it's like the rug is being pulled out from under us and take it away once we can finally, you know, participate and partake in it. But, again, like I can go back to the initial point, looking at the paradigm now, affirmative action served that same purpose. And that fact that it's now removed is kind of -- means, you can look at other things. I think if affirmative action was still there the way it was before two weeks ago, it would be a different story.",
