      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, Hamas confirms the death of its Leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. The question now is, will it mark a turning point in this war, or will the people of Gaza continue suffering?The conflict in the Middle East will be a focal point of talks between Joe Biden and European Leaders today as they meet in Berlin. And all eyes are on Michigan, as both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump take the campaign trail to the key swing state. U.S. President Joe Biden says the death of Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks, represents a moment of justice. President Biden spoke in Berlin a short while ago, this as a senior Hamas official confirmed the death of Sinwar, but said the movement he represented cannot be eliminated. The Israeli military released video that it says Sinwar's final moments. Israeli troops were said to be on a routine patrol in Rafah when they came under fire and responded with tank fire. A drone sent into a damaged building shows a man covered in dust, as you see here, who the IDF says is Sinwar. Sinwar's death is being called a possible watershed moment for the war in Gaza. Global leaders are hoping it could signal an end to the conflict and potentially the release of dozens of hostages still being held. The Israeli Prime Minister has made it clear there was still work to be done on the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The situation in Gaza right now is incredibly dire on a humanitarian level, but also in terms of, quote, unquote, day after plans, where the Israeli government has been making it very clear that they intend to have a deepened military occupation on the ground throughout the strip.So, the killing of Sinwar, frankly, in that regard, doesn't really make too much of a difference. This isn't going to be leading to the ending of the war. This isn't going to be leading to the withdrawal of Israeli troops. This isn't going to be averting the resettlement of the north of Gaza, which you know, prominent Israeli ministers and MKs members of the Israeli -- are already quite sympathetic to. So, I'm not sure what we're looking at here in terms of the changing conflict. Yes, of course, Sinwar was a symbolic figure. Yes, of course he was important operationally for Hamas. But this isn't -- this isn't a war on Hamas. This is a war on the Gaza -- on the Gaza Strip, and it's, of course, widened much more. So, I'm not sure that this is as significant as others may present it to be.",

      "sentences": "So, two things. I come at this as a historian and as a security analyst. As a historian, the occupation of the territories predates the establishment of Hamas by many, many years. The occupation began in 67. Hamas didn't even come onto the scene until the 80s. And as a result of the occupation. So, I don't expect the group to disappear overnight, because one of his leaders, even if it's a major leader, was killed.Secondly, in terms of security, what I've been concerned about over the past year in particular is that with this incredible devastation of Gaza that we've seen unfold on our screen day after day, week after week, the potential for radicalization on the ground. I frankly expect it, and I'm frankly surprised, pleasantly surprised, of course, but I'm frankly surprised that we haven't seen much more extreme movements actually evolve over the past year. Because that would be my expectation going forward, that when you have a huge grievance that are rooted in fact -- you know on occupation, the siege, destruction. You know, most of the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza being displaced, something like 90 percent of the buildings in Gaza either being destroyed or damaged -- were hunger. I mean, there are so many things here that -- you know would drive many people. Again, I wouldn't advocate this, and I would say that this is a bad idea, and I think it's incredibly regrettable and horrible, but I fully expect, unfortunately, there to be the development of new extremist militant groups that will evolve and carry out terrorist atrocities. That we will all condemn and that we should condemn, but -- you know we're seeing the roots of their recruitment tool book manifest right now, and I think we need to be very aware of that. Be careful about that on the security front, and we need to look for political solutions to take the -- to take the oxygen away from groups like that and provide people with different pathways for a more prosperous future where Palestinians and Israelis can live in peace and security.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that's absolutely, I think, moving forward and seeing how this all can be turned into an opportunity to try and get some sort of ceasefire, especially for Gaza, going. I think it was quite interesting to hear President Biden earlier today, after he received that Order of Merit from the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Obviously, he was very moved by all of that to then say that this was a moment of justice, as he put it, the killing of Yahya Sinwar, and that now was the time to move forward and try to get some sort of momentum going for a ceasefire in Gaza and to try and end the war that is currently going on there. Also, of course, one of the things that we have to point out Fredricka is that one of the first phone calls that President Biden made after hearing about the killing of Yahya Sinwar, which of course, happened while he was on Air Force One on his way over here to Berlin, was to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to congratulate him on killing the Hamas Leader. But then also to say that now was a moment to seek an opportunity to move things forward, to try and stop the violence inside of Gaza. That's, of course, something that the Biden Administration has been pushing for, for a very long time. You'll recall that there were mediated talks essentially led by the Biden Administration to try and get some sort of ceasefire going. Also, the Egyptians and the Qataris helping with that as well. And there were moments where it seemed that there could be close to a ceasefire. However, it never did fully materialize. So now, with the leader of Hamas out of the way, if you will, the Biden Administration certainly hoping that things can move forward, because the way that things continue to go, not just in Gaza, but in Lebanon as well. But certainly, first and foremost in Gaza, is definitely hurting the U.S.'s credibility in the Middle East, certainly not a good thing for the Biden Administration either. One of the things that we had yesterday, for instance, is once again those airdrops going on of aid into Gaza, because, of course, not enough aid is getting in there. And the fact that that is still so difficult is certainly something that the Biden Administration knows is a problem, and where they hope that now these new developments could lead to some more sustainable solution to stop the violence, but also, of course, to get more help into the Gaza Strip to help the many people who are in need there Fredricka.",

And today, she will be making three stops, including one in Grand Rapids. That's in a county that President Biden won in 2020 but that President Trump won in 2016 so both campaigns see that as a winnable place. She will also be visiting a union hall, and this is an area where she has struggled, somewhat particularly compared to President Biden, who did have strong support among union voters. You have seen some unions this time around stop short of endorsing Harris, and you've heard voices in the state, including the Representative Debbie Dingell, caution that she might not have the support that she thinks among that key constituency. So, you will see her there speaking directly to union voters in the hopes of bringing them on board. And so, this will be a critical day for her in that state. Yesterday, she was in another one of the blue wall states in Wisconsin, and it was an interesting moment when she was interrupted by some hecklers during her speech. Listen to how she handled it.

So that's just inaccurate.

So, zero for three on that from Elon Musk. And you know, it was notable that he brought up Dominion, picked a fight, so to speak, with Dominion, because that's the company that got almost $800 million out of Fox News for promoting similar lies. But I guess that's not much of a concern for the world's richest man. Fred, let me tell you what Dominion said in response to Elon Musk's comments. They put out a statement late last night. They said, quote, Dominion's voting systems are already based on voter verified paper ballots. Audits of such ballots have repeatedly proven that Dominion machines produce accurate results.

I think what's most striking is that we're hearing both Israeli officials and officials in the U.S. and other Israeli allies saying, this is an amazing opportunity, essentially, to end the war, to get the hostages released. And it could well turn out to be that, it may be that the death of Sinwar, the killing of Sinwar, leads to a fragmentation of Hamas that it encourages Hamas fighters who are left alive to hand over hostages and surrender themselves, as the Israeli leadership has demanded that they do. But the problem is, there's been no sign of that so far, in fact, to the opposite. The Hamas leadership so far has acknowledged in the past few hours that Yahya Sinwar has indeed been killed, but they come out with very defiant words, saying that they are clear that they're going to be eventually victorious. They're saying Israeli hostages won't be released until Israel's aggression against the Gaza Strip has come to an end.
