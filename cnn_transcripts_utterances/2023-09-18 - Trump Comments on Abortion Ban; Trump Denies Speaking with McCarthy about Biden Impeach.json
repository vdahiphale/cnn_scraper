It kind of reminds me of the 2018 cycle and when Democrats were trying to move to impeach then President Trump, how many Democrats from Trump won districts were very afraid to embrace impeachment at first.

But the reality is, it's almost not even worth talking about the details because it's so unlikely that this actually gets us anywhere because they reality is right now even - even if they can get it through the House, it's going nowhere in the Senate for a variety of reasons, not least because they don't intend to attach Ukraine aid to this bill, and that's something Senate Republicans really want to see.So, in theory, I guess, it's something to talk about.

What's your take on that statement and I think the repercussions of what's happened since? SEGUN ODUOLOWU, HOST, \"BOSTON GLOBE TODAY\": Well, I think the apology is as disingenuous as the book he wrote. Thank you for having me. You write a book on the masters of rock and roll and you don't have black contributors, then it's not really a book of masters of rock and roll since the art form was created by black musicians. So, if you're going to tell me that these same song writers who created this incredible music aren't articulate enough to have passages in your book, I find everything, from the premise of you writing the book, to what you called it, to not only be offensive but to really just show the true colors of the man. And in that interview where they said, you know, Joni Mitchell. So let's - let's just separate some of the women that he said were inarticulate because Dolly Parton is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Janet Jackson, who's black and a woman, is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Annie Lennox, from the Eurythmics, is in the Hall of Fame. Jay-z is in the Hall of Fame. LL Cool J is in the Hall of Fame. Quincy Jones is in the Hall of Fame. You're telling me that all of these prolific song writers, all of these masters of words and thoughts aren't articulate enough to be in your book? As far as I'm concerned, \"Rolling Stone\" and him and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I mean it's a joke, right?

Every time a man like myself will come on air, will say that this is horrible because I have a mother, and I have a sister, and I am the father of a daughter. But these are horrible. Like, I hate it when men say that, right, as if the act itself isn't horrible that we know women is that we should feel more disgust by it.Here is someone who is an alleged - or admitted, sorry, admitted substance abuser. So, during that time he's admitted to being not only sex -- a sex addict, but also addicted to substances. And I would just question his own recollection of this. One of the women who's alleged in - who's alleged to have been sexually assaulted by him was in her teens. And her family alleges to grooming. If any of this has a - has credibility, then Russell Brand should not be - should not be so cavalier with the way he's speaking. Because, yes, I do have a mom, and I do have a sister, and I am the father of a daughter. Putting all of that aside, this behavior is abhorrent, right, and Russell - Russell Brand has a history of abhorrent behavior. I don't think he did himself any favors. With all of that being said, right, with all of the disgust we feel, due diligence. Let's get to the bottom of this because there are victims involved and there are - there is Russell Brand. And if he did not do this, let the - let the courts, let the due diligence prove it out. But if he did, the way he has gone about this, just it offends. It's just offensive. Because sexual assault is the most egregious form of cowardice. It is to use your position, especially a man inflicting it upon a woman. It's not only cowardice, but it's chaos because you're robbing this person of their sense of self. And if one of them was a teenager, as is alleged, I - like I said, it's just the way Russell Brand is coming off, is, for me, unforgivable.",

You look at people and they just have this blank, shell-shocked look on their faces, staring into the distance. I mean, people here -- I mean I was speaking to a woman, a volunteer, who's been dealing with preparing the bodies of dead women for burial, and she survived this. And she's not had time to process what she's been through. And she was asking us if we think she will ever see her city rise up again. And she could barely finish this question before bursting into tears. And you just see this everywhere. You've got survivors who have not had the time to think about what happened to them, what they're going to do next. All they're focused on right now is trying to find their loved ones. But the gut-wrenching reality is really starting to sink in that there's really not much hope left to find them alive. So now they're trying to recover their dead bodies. And that also, Phil, may prove to be impossible. You do have search and recovery, search and rescue teams that have been working across the city in the devastated areas, in areas where you have entire neighbors that have been wiped, digging through the muddied rubble. You've got local teams. You've got some international teams. But what officials are telling us is they don't believe they're going to find many bodies here. They believe the majority of the bodies are in the Mediterranean. You have thousands of people, they believe, that have been swept away with their homes and inside their cars into the sea. And there you have this ongoing effort by different international teams, Libyan teams that have been using choppers, divers, boats, out at sea, trying to recover bodies. But one of those international teams we've been speaking to say it has become really, really difficult for them to recover bodies because a lot of these remains have ended up in hard-to-reach areas, in coves and on rocks, and they just don't have the ability to deal with that, especially when you take into consideration the health hazards. One of those teams telling us they saw 300 bodies spotted just a few days ago, and now they say they've just disintegrated into remains that they just can't recover. And you can imagine how devastating this is for the many families that are still trying to get the bodies of their loved ones and to give them a proper burial. These rescue teams out at sea telling us they have dealt with a lot of - a lot in the past.
