If you don't hear from the campaign personally, you still need to get out there and vote and make sure that your communities are voting. So this was them really making just a strong case. They also spoke about the vice president in really personal terms, in a way, Erica, that the campaign is trying to frame this argument more broadly.

Which is notable, because, of course, it comes just a day after the country's foreign ministry had vowed a deal was unrelated to Iran's plans for Israel and any sort of retaliation. The Middle East, of course, has been on high alert since that assassination last month of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

And there, we have seen not necessarily a shift by the Iranians in the past 24 hours but certainly a bit of a clarification. That was quite interesting; last night of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps came out. Their spokesman said that the Iranians would retaliate but there could be a prolonged period of waiting. And also did not say what exactly that retaliation would look like but that it could look very different than the last time the Iranians retaliated against Israel, which was, of course, after Iran's embassy compound in Damascus was attacked. Then they launched hundreds of drones and missiles, many of which were intercepted but some of which did come through. However, it's also the first time that the Iranians are directly linking a possible ceasefire in Gaza to their retaliation. The Iranians, though, not very optimistic.

And so you can expect a lot of discussion on that today. But I also think, more generally, trying to get into the foreign wars, about what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening between Ukraine and Russia. And I don't think you'll hear anything very different from what Donald Trump has said on all of these issues in the past. This idea that Joe Biden has been handling the wars abroad not well and criticizing that he's going to try to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to that approach. And kind of argue, as he has been doing that she's somewhat of a mastermind behind the Biden administration's policies, which, of course, she is vice president. She does not call the shots. But that is what Donald Trump and his team has been trying to do. But I also want to point out, Erica, just how interesting the visit to North Carolina itself is, because this is actually Donald Trump's third visit to the state since Joe Biden ended his campaign roughly a month ago. And just underscores how important they see this state. And really with all of the places that Trump is visiting this week, it's very similar. He's clearly going to the battlegrounds that his team view as must-win states in November. On Monday, he was in New York, Pennsylvania, talking about the economy yesterday. He was in a suburb of Detroit in Michigan today as we sat in North Carolina. Tomorrow, he will be visiting the border in Arizona and then Friday he'll be in Las Vegas. Of course, Nevada is another battleground. And then back in Arizona. And all of these events, they're actually not rallies other than the one you'll see Friday evening in Arizona. They're messaging events as the Trump campaign is trying to call them. And that's because they're much smaller venues, they're smaller crowds and they're really focused on Donald Trump, trying to get him to focus on the policy issues that they believe are going to be the most important to Republicans and particularly the areas where they believe Donald Trump is polling higher than Harris. Now one thing we did hear Trump yesterday bring up is an area that he's not polling higher than Harris on, which is suburban women. We know, Erica, that Donald Trump has long struggled to make inroads with that type of voting bloc. But he argued that he thinks suburban women like him. Take a listen to what he said in Michigan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn't like Trump. Well, I think it's a fake poll. Because why wouldn't they like me? I stopped low-income towers from rising right alongside of their house. I think that they like me a lot. I think it's a lot of fake polls. We've seen a lot of fake polls over the years.

Sham's mother, Sanaa, who suffered burns as a child, will never forget that day. SANAA ABU TABAQ, ATTACK SURVIVOR (through translator):  I wish we hadn't returned. I lost the most precious people. I lost the most precious thing for me, my daughter. DIAMOND (voice-over):  But there is more to that story than tragedy and loss in war-torn Gaza. Sham and Sanaa's story is unlike any other we have come across in 10 months of war. That's because Sanaa doesn't just accused Israeli troops of killing her husband, Akram and daughter Yasmeen, an Israeli soldier may also have saved her life. On November 24th, the week-long truce between Israel and Hamas begins, thousands of people begin heading back to their homes in northern Gaza. Sanaa and her family are among them. But as they approach the Salaten (ph) neighborhood where they lived, they find themselves walking alone and then shots ring out. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  May God bless her soul, Yasmeen. One bullet in her back and one in her shoulder. I was hit in my leg and my husband was hit in his stomach. So we all sat on the ground. We couldn't move and we were bleeding. Sham is the only one who wasn't hit. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Her husband soon decides to crawl away to try to find help. But moments later, he is shot again, fatally. Sanaa lies on the ground bleeding, cradling her eldest daughter, Yasmeen. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  She was saying, \"Mom, did you die? \"Please don't die and leave us. I'm still alive.\" I held her and I told her, \"No, my dear, we are not going to die. The ambulance is coming.\" I was trying to give her hope even though I know there was no hope.",

      "sentences": "I heard their sound.SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  I told her, 'They've reached us.' We recited the Shahada. She said, 'Hid me so I don't see them when they shoot me.' DIAMOND (voice-over):  An explosion then rocks the bathroom. Israeli soldiers enter the house and call out in Arabic. What happens next is captured on muted body camera footage provided by the Israeli military. Two soldiers treating Sanaa's gunshot wounds. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  I told him, \"Please have mercy. \"Didn't you see my daughter who was killed at the door? \"I beg you, please don't kill us, it's enough.\" He told me, \"It wasn't us who killed her. It was Sinwar.\" I told him, \"I have nothing to do with Sinwar or anyone else. You took my daughter and you took everything.\" DIAMOND (voice-over):  The medic soon realizes her condition is serious. She needs to get to a hospital. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  The one who spoke Arabic started to make his calls. Then he told me, \"We decided to help you and take you with us.\" DIAMOND (voice-over):  Israeli soldiers carry Sanaa out of the building on a stretcher, her hands clutching Sham. Nothing about this footage should be extraordinary. Militaries must protect and care for wounded civilians when possible under international law. But in this war, this site is exceedingly rare. For eight months, Sanaa and Sham have lived in this Jerusalem hospital. Their journey here was no less traumatic. Interrogation and strip searches came before treatments at an Israeli hospital. Israeli authorities are now planning to send them back to Gaza next month, unless another country takes them in. The Israeli military for its part told CNN in a statement that Sanaa and her family were caught in the crossfire. The IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings after the family stumbled upon a concealed military position, drawing a militant attack. The four people who entered in the area were caught in the intense exchange of fire between the terrorists and our troops. The troops did not open fire at the four people, nor did they aim at them. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  They are lying. There was nobody in that area.",

But he also took from me the most precious thing I had. I can't even thank him because he had mercy for us by the will of God, not by his own will. Because if he had compassion, he wouldn't have deprived me of the dearest people to my heart. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Sanaa's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home again in footage filmed this spring brings a flood of emotion. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  These are Yasmeen and Sham's shoes. I bought these shoes for Eid. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Mundane objects are transformed into relics. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator):  This is Yasmeen's dress and this is Sham's dress. She always loved pink. This is her dress. DIAMOND (voice-over):  And Sanaa is taken back in time to the life she will never get back -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So this is the revised jobs report, of course. This happens annually but it revised the number of jobs down significantly, in fact, estimating there were more than 800,000 fewer jobs in March this year than initially reported. Take a quick look at how the markets are reacting. They don't seem to be too upset about it. CNN's Matt Egan joining me now. So Matt, take me through this number being revised down. We're used to this coming. But where does it stand in terms of expectations?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, we were bracing for jobs to vanish and they did. This number coming out at 818,000 jobs fewerthat were added for the period between April 2023 and March of this year. This is sort of in line with expectations. It's probably a little bit on the high end. There were some estimates, notably from Goldman Sachs, that this revision could show about 1 million jobs fewer were added. And just to take you through where some of these revisions are coming from, we saw some of the biggest drops in employment based on a few different sectors -- professional, business services, leisure and hospitality; 115,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing. Of course, some sectors they were actually upwardly revised, including private education and health services and transportation and warehousing. So just to remind people, this is a normal thing that happens with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They look back at how many jobs were added. They update those totals. This is actually not even the final revision. That comes early next year. But this does paint the picture of a jobs market that is clearly slowing down. We knew that. We knew that from the July jobs report. And this does support the idea that hiring, it's still positive but it's not as strong as it once was. And the fact that there are such large distortions also reflects the fact that the economy is still being distorted by COVID and the reopening from COVID, it's just a very hard time for economists and for the BLS to really get a sense for what's happening in the economy. One last point here, Erica, is this large revision in jobs, more than 800,000, it does support the idea that the Fed is going to start cutting interest rates, likely next month. The question remains whether or not they do a quarter of a point or a larger interest rate cut. But again, it does seem like the Fed is clear here to start cutting interest rates.",

She didn't spend her birthday with him. She was in The Hamptons. Sometimes they are wearing their rings, sometimes they weren't.
