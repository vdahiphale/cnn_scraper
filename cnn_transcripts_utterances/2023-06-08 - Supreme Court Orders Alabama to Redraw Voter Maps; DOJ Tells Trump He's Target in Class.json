      "sentences": "Yes, John, really a major win here for black voters in Alabama, and more broadly, a major win for voting rights advocates across the country. Because what the Supreme Court did today, in a 5-4 decision, they ordered the state of Alabama to redraw their congressional voting maps that actually had been in effect for the last election cycle in 2022, ordering them to redraw that, to give black voters more representation, and also upholding Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act here denies any election law -- it bars any election law that denies the vote on the basis of race. And there was deep concern that this conservative court that has previously gutted many sections of the Voting Rights Act that they would potentially gut Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Now, to take you back, this case was about the congressional voting maps that were in effect in 2022. Black voters challenged those maps, saying that they were only majorities in one out of the seven congressional districts, despite the fact that black voters make up 27 percent of the state. The voting map was kept in place for 2022, but now the Supreme Court saying, go back and redraw it. And, John, what's really interesting here is that the state of Alabama had basically said, look, they said specifically this, they had said we're in a political system now where race no longer matters. They said that all you need to do are draw fair maps with race-neutral criteria. The court here, led by the Chief Justice John Roberts, striking that down, saying, no, race still needs to be considered. I'll read a quote from his opinion right now. A district is not equally open, In other words, when minority voters face, unlike their majority peers, bloc voting along racial lines arising against the backdrop of substantial racial discrimination within the state, that renders a minority vote unequal to a vote by a non-minority voter. Crucially, this opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the same justice who several years ago dismantled another crucial aspect of the Voting Rights Act, Section 5, saying that states that had history of racial discrimination, saying that they no longer had to get preclearance when it came to voting rules or voting maps. So, John, this is a significant decision from this conservative majority court that now falling along not even party lines with Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Brett Kavanaugh and joining with the liberals deciding that this map should be redrawn and that Section 2, as they've read it in years past, should stand.

      "sentences": "John, I cannot tell you what a major turn this was for Chief Justice John Roberts and how dramatic it was in the courtroom just a few minutes ago.First of all, just to understand John Roberts' history. Since 1980, when he was with the Ronald Reagan administration, he has been working to roll back the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He has constantly both outside the court and then once he joined the bench in 2005, has thought that voting rights protections were going too far, encroaching on state powers. And he shepherded the 2013 Shelby County versus Holder decision and then there were decisions in 2018, in 2021, where he led a majority to, again, curtail the reach of the Voting Rights Act. [11:05:13] So, he starts to read the opinion in the courtroom this morning. You know, all nine of them are on the bench. And I'm thinking, okay, here he is. He's going to roll back Section 2 that prevents discrimination in voting. But, no, he has this long wind up, and then, basically, he says, Alabama was pushing too far. We're not going to retrench on 40 years of jurisprudence related to the 1965 act. He cites a 1986 case that Alabama and several of his colleagues on the right had wanted overturned, and he said, we're sticking with it. And in this case, we're not going to go to any kind of racial neutrality in the Voting Rights Act, which is what Alabama was pushing for. And he did give a pretty full history of why the Voting Rights Act even exists in terms of providing equal opportunity for people of all color, especially for blacks who fought the hardest when the 1965 act was passed to have equal access to the polls. Now, as he's reading John, I'm watching the justices on his left to see, are they going to write a separate -- announce a dissent or something? But, no. Justice Kagan is watching him read our newest justice, the first African-American woman on the bench, Justice Jackson, is at first just looking down, and I'm thinking, oh, she knows what's coming. But then she's also looking out of the audience. Not a single one of the liberals dissented, which is so different in these cases, John. As I said, going back to Shelby county versus Holder, the 2013 case, that really gutted a significant portion of the law, it was the liberals so loudly dissenting, and voting rights activists being very concerned about access to the ballot. But here, it's three justices to his right who were dissenting, and no one dissented from the bench. If you didn't know all the drama behind Chief Justice Roberts' position, you might not have known much was going on because he read it so steadily, went on for five minutes. But it has really been a major turn in the law that has gratified voting rights advocates at this point, John.",

This was not the way that they anticipated this major ruling to go down, and it could have a significant impact on the 2024 elections. There are several other states in which there are maps from those House districts could get rewritten and could change how the ultimate votes come down there. But in Alabama, this could potentially help Democrats, and it also could help Democrats in some other states. It's possible, for instance, in Georgia, maybe Louisiana, could be states in which Democrats could benefit.But there are also other states that could have -- their maps are being withdrawn. There are court challenges, states like North Carolina as well as Ohio that could potentially be beneficial to Republicans. So, in the outcome, we'll see if it's a wash or it could benefit one side or the other. And then there's a general reaction on the Hill about what this says about the court. I just caught up with Senator Dick Durbin. He's the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of course, Democrats have been sharply critical of this very conservative majority in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision and losing one case after another. But Durbin suggested to me just moments ago, perhaps this is a sign that things are changing in the Roberts Court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  Well, perhaps they're shifting majorities. And I think Chief Justice Roberts, I really believe he understands, in history's view, this is his court and what they put together now, he's going to be held accountable for, particularly those cases he voted for.

The federal investigation connected to Trump's handling of classified documents, his failure to turn them over, and a question of possible obstruction of justice surrounding all of it. You'll recall, federal investigators searched his Mar-a-Lago home last August. The FBI recovered more than 100 classified documents there. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. CNN's Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez will have the latest for us. I'm going to start with you, Evan. You've got these two courthouses, these two grand juries.

We've seen so much activity in recent weeks, both in that courthouse getting witness testimony as well as here in Washington, where the bulk of the testimony, bulk of evidence has been presented to a grand jury. So, right now, we're waiting. And the fact is that the Justice Department rules allow prosecutors to notify someone, a subject of an investigation, that they've become a target. They can do it in earlier part of this investigation. They can do it in the later stages. In this case, it's clear we're in the later stages. And it really signals, Sara, that the Justice Department is on the verge of making this momentous decision, right? We've never been here before, where a former president could be facing criminal charges. There also, of course, could be charges against people around the former president who were involved in handling these documents. So, again, one of the things we anticipate now that the former president has been notified of this is that he has the ability to ask the Justice Department to present his own evidence, things that he believes prove that he is not guilty of any of these crimes. He could also choose to present himself before the grand jury to go and explain why he believes he should not be indicted.

The other is the Espionage Act, 793 E, which says that if you unlawfully retain a document which you're allowed to have, which has national defense implications information in it, and you also -- and or you disseminate it, that's another charge.
