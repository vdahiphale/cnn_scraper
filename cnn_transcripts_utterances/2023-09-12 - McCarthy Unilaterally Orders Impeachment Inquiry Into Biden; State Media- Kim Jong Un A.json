Congressman George Santos on impeachment on the 13 federal charges he's facing and whether he'll listen to calls for his resignation. He will be OUTFRONT. Plus, armed and on the run. Police believe they're closing in on the killer who escaped from prison after he stole a gun and engaged in a shootout with a local homeowner. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, impeaching Biden. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy facing a mutiny from the far right wing of his party, now unilaterally calling for a formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden. No vote. Just days ago, McCarthy said he'd only have an impeachment with a full House vote. But today, the speaker said he has no choice but to act based on what House Republicans have discovered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction, and corruption. And they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives. That's why today, I am directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. I do not make this decision lightly. And regardless of your party or who you voted for, these facts should concern all Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Multiple Republicans in the House have warned against moving forward at this time, saying the evidence is not there to back it up, and it could backfire on Republicans.Well, just in a few moments, I'm going to speak to George Santos, one of the most endangered House Republicans seeking election in a major swing district. I'll also, of course, talk to Santos about the legal investigation he is facing, and the many controversies swirling around him, that is coming up. But first, the White House and the Biden campaign both wasting little time to slam McCarthy. The White House called it extreme politics at its worst, and the Biden campaign saying, in part, quote, as Donald Trump ramped up his demands for a baseless impeachment inquiry, Kevin McCarthy cemented his role as the Trump campaign's super surrogate by turning the House of Representatives into an arm of his presidential campaign. Trump himself was also quick to get involved. No surprise there. A source confirming to CNN that he spoke on the phone with the House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik about the Republican strategy. But McCarthy's announcement today clearly contradicting a promise that he made himself just 11 days ago. Just 11 days ago, Speaker McCarthy told Breitbart and I quote him: The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives. That's why if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House and not through a declaration by one person. Well, I guess 11 days ago is a totally different world since, you know, now it's going ahead on one person. McCarthy also repeatedly criticized then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for launching an impeachment inquiry unilaterally one person against then President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total compliance or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair.

When I asked the speaker about that directly, he contended, well, this is simply an impeachment inquiry, something in which they would try to find the information to back up some of those claims and allegations that have come up so far. He also defended the decision not to have a vote to formally launch the inquiry. As you said, just 11 days ago, the speaker said that they would have a vote. But the problem is they don't have enough support in the House to formally vote to authorize that investigation.

It would make Biden only the fourth president in American history to be charged with that.And a number of Republicans, including the 18 who come from districts that Biden won in 2020, conservatives like Ken Buck of Colorado, all of whom are spectacle about moving forward.

Yet, I know that you support McCarthy in his call to begin the impeachment inquiry. How come? REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY): Well, it's very simple. The process can't be cheapened. We can't allow us to do the same mistakes that former Speaker Pelosi did and just bulldoze through an impeachment without any credible evidence. The American public is already fractured and sick and tired of that. So that's why I've been no impeachment without impeachment inquiry, period. And I've drawn that line.

And I believe she said there would be at least 150 witnesses as well. RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: That's right. I think it's inconceivable that she'll convince him. But in any case, it could be an uphill battle if she wanted to convince the judge she wanted to have a trial of all 19 together at a much later point in time, but the idea that the judge would force 17 individuals who have not said they want a speedy trial to all come together by October 23rd and then deal with all of their motions before October 23rd as he strongly indicated, I don't think that's in the cards.
