Currently he is sedated. He is on ventilator to take some of the strain off his lungs. Glenn said doctors had to flip him over on his chest in what our medical experts call a prone position to try to ease breathing, reduce some of that fluid buildup. So the next step in Hamlin's recovery is to get him to breathe on his own. But overall, Glenn says Hamlin appears to be trending upward. So that's a positive sign. Listen.

In 1998, St. Louis Blues head athletic trainer Ray Barile ran into the ice after star player Chris Pronger was hit square in the chest by a puck, which stopped his heart. Barile revived Pronger. In a tweet thread about Hamlin yesterday, Pronger credited Barile and the Detroit Red Wings medical staff for his survival. More than 20 years later, in 2020, Barile did it again. He revived another player, Jay Bouwmeester, who collapsed on the bench due to a cardiac episode. Bouwmeester also survived. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY BOUWMEESTER, FORMER ST.

Our team physicians cleared him, he returned to play, finish the 12-year career, Hall of Fame and won the Stanley Cup.And with Jay Bouwmeester, it was slightly different in the fact that Jay had an arrhythmia, not from a contusion or a direct blow, and subsequently had to retire because of this cardiac arrhythmia that he had. But it's -- I can only imagine. I know -- I know exactly how the Buffalo Bills medical staff was feeling right now, and also Cincinnati. We practice this. The Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers society and the NHL team physician society, we meet every summer, we review all these protocols, we go over the latest equipment, the latest protocols, and details, and we practice them. And so, we're prepared hopefully never to have to use these techniques and protocols.
