So this has been going on for several days. The United Center has been shut down for a month. And for people who are not big sports fans and not from Chicago, that's where the Blackhawks play and that's where the Bulls play, so this is a pretty iconic building for the city of Chicago.But again, you know, when you're talking about the security perimeter here, Sara, there are so many layers of security. So there's going to be this pedestrian perimeter around the United Center and that's where people are going to be able to walk around. But it's inside the hard perimeter where you're going to have to have a credential. And in addition to this fence, law enforcement is going to have huge mutual aid support. At least 500 officers from outside agencies are going to come in to try to help with his response. Law enforcement is going to have aerial support. They'll have support on the water as well, Sara. We have been asking for several weeks how many protesters law enforcement is expecting to just to get a sense of what the size is. Protesters have made clear they plan to use the DNC as a spotlight. As you mentioned, this -- we are expecting pretty big pro-Palestinian marches. This area is home to the largest Palestinian population in the United States. There have been marches in downtown Chicago for months. So we've asked the Chicago Police superintendent how many people they are expecting and here's what he told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUPT. LARRY SNELLING, CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT:  We do expect a large group of people to converge upon the city be it just to visit -- to participate in the Democratic National Convention or to come here and exercise their First Amendment rights. So we've been preparing for over a year for this, and we're prepared for whatever number of people decide to show up here in the city of Chicago. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Harris campaign confirming yesterday it will participate in a total of three debatesIn a statement, the Harris campaign also saying this. \"The debate about debates is over.\" And this morning, The New York Times is reporting that Harris is already preparing, taking part in mock presidential debate at Howard University this past Monday. Joining us right now is CNN political commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin and Brian Brokaw, former campaign manager for Kamala Harris' campaign when she was running for AG in California. It's great to see you guys. Brian, let me start with you on this. Harris in debate prep now, and what I was telling you about The New York Times saying that she took part in mock debate on Monday. What kind of debater is Kamala Harris? BRIAN BROKAW, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER FOR KAMALA HARRIS' SENATE CAMPAIGN (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, people forget at their own peril that she's someone who spent career -- her career in the courtroom as a prosecutor, so she's someone who takes preparation very seriously and I have no doubt she's doing her homework. The problem is for Donald Trump right now is that he's a candidate in freefall. He is in a doom loop of his own creation by virtue of his own actions, and he is looking and acting small. And that is not a good contrast with someone like Kamala Harris who is presenting a very positive, uplifting vision along with Tim Walz that is really being met with momentum and excitement around the country. So that debate stage, regardless of all the preparations that go into it, is going to present a very stark contrast for the public.",

The challenge is really communicating that to the people. And I think that's what you're starting to see right now with the focus on pocketbook issues. You know, not just talking about macroeconomics but talking about gas prices and the price of groceries. And so I think once we are able to really communicate that and talk about the plan for the future, and then voters can decide who they trust on this issue more. Do they trust the Democrats, or do they trust Donald Trump who all he did in office was cut taxes for the wealthiest people, like his friends?

An alleged gang leader suspected of killing 23 people in Peru is now in custody in New York State. Gianfranco Torres-Navarro, head of the Peruvian gang known as \"Los Killers\" and described as highly dangerous, is being held at a federal detention facility ahead of an immigration hearing. The tip that he was wanted in Peru led to the arrest by ICE. Authorities also arrested his girlfriend. Jordan Chiles is speaking out about being stripped of her Olympic bronze medal. The Team USA gymnast posted online that \"It feels unjust and is a significant blow.\" The governing body for the Olympics that decides these things ruled that the challenge to Chiles' score and the further challenges after that, to sum up a very messy back-and-forth -- that they were not valid. So her medal is actually now going to a Romanian gymnast for the floor exercise competition at the Paris Games. In her Instagram post, Chiles also spoke to the racially driven attacks that were coming at her on social media and she said that they were adding to her heartbreak and were extremely hurtful. She said she's still proud to represent her country. This morning, Usher is apologizing to fans after postponing the start of his \"Past, Present, Future\" tour in Atlanta this week. He pulled the plug on the tour opener and two other shows because of a neck injury. Usher says the injury happened during rehearsals and doctors had advised him against performing. The Atlanta shows now rescheduled for December. Usher says he hopes he'll be back on stage next week in D.C. And breaking overnight, four people have been arrested in connection to the deadly shooting of \"GENERAL HOSPITAL\" star Johnny Wactor. Wactor was shot and killed in May as he walked up on an attempted robbery in downtown Los Angeles. Three men have now been arrested on suspicion of murder. A fourth was booked on suspicion of being an accessory. Last night, Wactor's mother spoke out after hearing the news.

They're breathing air that they don't deserve to breathe in my opinion, and he can't breathe it any longer. And we miss him. So yeah, maybe it's time that their family missed them, and they go away.

They go out on the street and they look for people who are selling them drugs. They'd then call in the field team. They would arrest them and take them down.By the way, Anne Milgram -- now head of the DEA, right, and doing great work for our country -- she was one of those prosecutors in Manhattan on the front lines with me. But the reality is that you have to change your strategies to be consistent with the times and the circumstance. And so what they did here, very smartly, was they had an interagency task force consisting of the Postal Service, consisting of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. attorney, local law enforcement, LAPD. And what they did was they said we're going to hold everyone to account. Doctors, what role did you have, OK? You may have had a prescription. Did you exceed that? And if so, accountability. Where did you get the ketamine from? The clinic? Another doctor? Accountability. Personal assistant, why are you injecting him with drugs? Accountability. So what you're seeing is a shift. And I think also, Sara, they use -- they're using this as a message, right? Matthew Perry's life, of course, had great value. This tragedy now -- what are we going to do? We're going to deter other people. And I think when you take people down like this it sends the message that everyone in the chain, right, are going to have to come before that court and have their day in court. And ultimately, if guilty, then there's a reckoning to do. And that I think is the strategic shift, right, that we're seeing here. [07:50:05]",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Sara. So we're about two or three hours away from tropical storm-force winds impacting the island of Bermuda.But the very shear fact that this storm has found Bermuda in the very vast open oceanwaters of the Western Atlantic is saying something. It's only roughly about 20 miles long and at its widest it's about 1.75 miles wide. And this houses about 65,000 people and covers about an area of roughly 20 square miles. So very small. We call that a needle in a haystack. But yet, it is still on a track to impact Bermuda with some of its strongest winds, which are cranking at around 100 miles per hour near the center of the storm. Currently, Ernesto is about 300 miles to the south-southwest of Bermuda. That's why we have hurricane warnings in place. But think about this. Tropical storm-force winds extend about 265 miles from the center, so it won't take long for those winds to approach and impact Bermuda here in the coming hours. Now, the storm is forecast to weaken and then quickly exit to the north and east. So this will be a fast-moving storm for Bermuda, but they could bear the brunt of that eastern side of the eyewall. It could be the strongest parts of the storm. So, of course, on those east-facing shorelines we get that surge and wind impact kind of combining to create dangerous coastal erosion for those areas of Bermuda. And then this will be an expanding storm as well. So the wind field will continue to grow. There's a lot of rain associated with this, so considerable localized flash flooding -- over a foot in some locations across Bermuda. And then we've got to talk about the waves -- upwards of three stories high waves that are measured here around the center of Ernesto. And that's going to emanate outward, of course, impacting the East Coast through the course of the weekend and early next week. That's why have rip current advisories and warnings along much of the Eastern Seaboard. By the way, the National Weather Service out of Wilmington, North Carolina asking residents to stay, simply, out of the water this weekend -- Sara.",

Yesterday, at that event, I was there and there three women on the stage -- Meghan, Princess -- the Duchess of Sussex. Francia Marquez, who is the first African American to hold -- African Colombian to hold elective -- executive powers here in Colombia. And Maria Ressa, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and a journalist from the Philippines. And each of the three women talked about their experience with online harassment often related to racism, often related to gender harassment online, and how they hope that they can provide tools to the newer generation. All of them are, of course, mothers and they say that they want to leave a legacy of a safer digital environment -- a safer online environment. So I think that it was kind of like interesting to see women from very different backgrounds. Francis Marquez, the son -- the daughter of environmental activist -- a single mother from one of the poorest regions in Colombia. Meghan, currently the Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry, the most famous aristocratic family in the planet sitting on the same stage and talking about an issue that touches us all. Today, they will engage instead with other causes that are close to their hearts -- and the Archewell Foundation, which is the foundation that the Duke and the Duchess founded in 2020. They will visit a team of Colombian veterans who are competing in the Invictus Games. And then tomorrow and on Sunday they will visit other parts of Colombia. So there is a little bit of a pleasure travels -- tourism in this beautiful country. But also a very, very strong focus on online harassment and how that touches every single person on the globe -- Kate.",
