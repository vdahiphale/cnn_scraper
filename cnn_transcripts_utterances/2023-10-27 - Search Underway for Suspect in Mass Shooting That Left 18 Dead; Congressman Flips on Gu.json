      "sentences": "Good morning, Kasie. So, here we are on Friday and here is where we are right now. So,after seeing armored vehicles drive through town, after seeing clusters of police officers in some cases going door to door, checking on leads, we still don't have a suspect in custody. And two things are happening at once. So, on one side you have community that is completely torn apart by this. They are really feeling this heartbreak. And on the other, you have fear. This palpable fear that is affecting everybody and the more and longer this man is not brought into custody, the more that fear grows. Now, that brings us to the latest tragedy that's been done by law enforcement. They have decided to zero in on his home addresses, wherever he's listed as living a previously. They have been going to these places. They've been executing search warrants. They are calling it their due diligence. Only a few short hours ago, they descended upon his last known address in Bowdoin. You saw heavily armed police officers, they had bullhorns, they had to drones. After a few hours, it was given the all clear. But you saw this large police presence going in, doing what they call their due diligence to look for any evidence, anything that could have been given them any more clues as to what was going on. That search, those types of searches are expected to continue. There's one more location that they're going to hit. That's going to happen at some point later today. And that brings us to their searches and the way they've been searching. So, it has been more like a localized search. So they have been following tips and following leads and going to the particular streets and closing of all those running streets, doing their searches, checking out what they need to check out. And then they up those streets. That's a little different than something that we have seen in, say, Watertown, during the Boston marathon bombing, where they would close down certain streets and, as time started to take by, you started to seeing more and more street closures. So they are doing this localized searches with police going down and going and checking on these leads. And all of this comes after we got a briefing yesterday from local leaders where they were telling us, and they finally gave us those numbers of 18 dead and 13 wounded. Although they did not give us a motive, the working theory that law enforcement is working through right now is that the gunman broke up with his girlfriend, he targeted these locations because eased to go to these bars and he used to go to these bowling alley -- Kasie.",

It also has a rich gun culture of hunting and also very permissive gun laws.When you look at the rest of the Northeast, most of the states have licensing. Maine and a couple of other states are the exceptions and they have had very low gun homicide rates. They are usually only a couple of dozen murders in this state in in entire year. And this shooting, sadly, is almost that entire toll. But, luck seems to be running out in Maine. I spoke to someone in Lewiston yesterday who said it is amazing it hasn't happened before now. You know, we've been living under a false sense of security. After all, or part of America, and America has a gun violence problem.",

Speed is of the essence with these mechanisms. The yellow flag law, no other state has a law like this. It was a bipartisan compromise and it very much acts like that.It's not really an emergency order. A police -- only a police officer can invoke at this. In many of the red flag states, a family member can go to a police officer with their concerns and then they go to a judge. Here, a police officer will take the patient into custody, a doctor has to sign off, and then they go to a judge. And this process takes a lot longer than a red flag law and there's a lot of room in there for somebody to lash out violently. I think lawmakers and residents in Maine today are wondering if these yellow flag laws are enough, if they shouldn't just pass a full on red flag emergency risk protection order law?",

There is an argument out there that's what needed really are laws that allow police to intervene when somebody shouldn't be armed. The bar needs to be lower than in voluntary mental health commitment, focusing on certain categories of weapons, doesn't focus on the vetting of the buyer. It's really not the weapon.

Now, the health ministry in Gaza has previously been a very reliable reporter of information like this, according to our teams who have spent, you know, many years kind of lining up what they have said with what has played out. Obviously, the situation on the ground is much more chaotic, different here. But it is very dramatic to see that list that they published with the names, you know, sometimes dozens from a single family. FOSTER:  Yeah, and it is very, very detailed and they're making the point that these figures are reliable of the Hamas-controlled health authority. They are actually saying that this is an underestimate because there are, you know, it doesn't include bodies, for example, that haven't made it to the hospital yet, for example. So they are saying that it's an underestimate. I don't think Joe Biden is questioning that people have died in Gaza, it is just the number of people who've died and whether or not you can rely on these figures. But we can't -- the U.S. can't verify, like we can't verify them. They're coming from this Hamas controlled body. So, but there are figures that we have relied on in the past and the State Department has also relied on them in the past and quoted them as well. And it's this lack of information that we're getting, that were not able to verify all the information. The U.S. can't verify the information like many other nations. So it's a big debate about those figures coming out from this Palestinian health authority, which is run by Hamas right now, which is obviously regarded as a terror organization. So it's a very difficult situation, but it is the one source of figures that people have been quoting and President Biden, I think, is speaking for quite a lot of people in saying how, and questioning how much we can rely on the exact figures, at least.",
