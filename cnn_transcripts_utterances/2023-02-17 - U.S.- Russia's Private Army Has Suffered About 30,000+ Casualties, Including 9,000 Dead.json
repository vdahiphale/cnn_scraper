This as more Russian officials, past and present, are dying suspiciously back home.Plus, CNN takes us closer than anyone else can to a secret Chinese lab, home to a blacklisted spy balloon maker. It's an OUTFRONT investigation that completely blows China's cover. And new details about what led Senator John Fetterman to check himself into the hospital for depression. His fellow stroke survivor, someone that all of you know well, General Michael Hayden, opens up about stroke and depression. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good Friday evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT, inside a trench -- we have video tonight of the brutal life and death on the front lines. In this clip, which is disturbing, we are going to go inside one of the countless makeshift trenches in Ukraine. The Ukrainian who is filming this -- as you can see, they are shooting, it is alive battle, shooting and then runs to one end of the trench. So, you will see him turn and run. And as that happens, there is more shooting going on. And then they look up -- you see the scarred terrain. And amidst that terrain, then you are going to see there, that Russian soldier. That Russian soldier -- in combat mode. He looked the wrong way. And he saw his death, the flying casings. I mean, you have to think about this. The ability to film a moment like this in close combat, the value of a life, it does make you pause, seeing one life and it puts the mass numbers of dead in context. Tonight, the United States government is giving some bigger numbers, saying that the Wagner Group alone -- Putin's private militia -- has already suffered more than 30,000 casualties, including roughly 9,000 deaths. It's just a tiny fraction of the Russian deaths there. But still, that is what they are seeing, from the Wagner Group. And the losses and death seem to be putting more pressure on Putin tonight. Because, this evening, we are learning about Russian defense officials dead under mysterious circumstances. Maria Yankina, a senior Russian defense official -- you see here they're wearing four star, her four star -- found dead this week under the windows of a high rise building in St. Petersburg, according to the Russian newspaper \"Kommersant\". Now, officials told the newspaper the suspected cause of her being on the ground, 16 floors below where she was, was suicide. And Major General Vladimir Makarov, who is relieved of his post in January, also allegedly died by suicide. That's according to Russian state news agency TASS. Makarov have been in charge of cracking down on protesters. And those deaths, both military, coming after a dozen other high-profile Russians had reportedly died by suicide or unexplained accidents since the beginning of the war. I'll put some of the pond the. Screen just put this in context, one fell out of a window of his hotel. Another fell down a hospital window, another fell down a flight of stairs. Another fell off the boat. A lot of falling. It's well-known just how dire that consequences can be for anyone who crosses Putin, even with those living outside of Russia. You know Christo Grozev, right? He has been on the set many times. Christo is now on Putin's most wanted list. He told me this recently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But they now admit that's unlikely to happen.A Wagner affiliated social medias channel posted this extremely graphic video, the authenticity of which we cannot independently verify, of alleged fighters asking for more ammo. Every day, we lose hundreds of our comrades in arms. He says. It could have been half as many if our military functionaries had supplied us on time with weapons and ammunitions and the things we needed. Vladimir Putin, meeting with one of his closest allies, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, trying to show he is dealing with a military supply issue. And, of course, we will discuss, as usual, the entire range of our relationships, he said, including security issues and military cooperation. Lukashenko then claiming that Belarus, which served as one of Putin's launch pad for the invasion a year ago, will soon start producing warplanes. Yes, the attack aircraft, he said, a real workhorse. We are ready to produce it in Belarus with minor assistance from the Russian federation. Russia is apparently gearing up for a protracted and bloody war, which Ukraine's president warns, might expand beyond Ukraine. It's obvious that Ukraine is not going to be his last stop, Zelenskyy says. If we break, he will consume other countries, including all the other states that, at some point in time were part of the Soviet bloc. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  And, Erin, the other really important thing that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as well is he said that Ukraine really needs this war to end as fast as possible. He said, they want to bring it to an end before the end of this year. Now, of course, he said, the key thing to that is that those weapons deliveries keep going and in fact are accelerated, Erin.",

And in general, as we call it, this is a rule in Russia. The person is busy with his own PR, the less influential he is. And people who are truly close to Putin, like the oligarch Yuri Kovalchuk, for example, they have appeared on television only once in the entire lives.

A militarily helicopter is seen sitting inside the facility's gates dispelling any notions that the balloon are, you know, not used for military purposes.Will Ripley was there and filed this OUTFRONT investigation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hundreds of miles from Beijing, a place China does not want you to see. CNN, the first international media to come here. Behind barbed wire and security checkpoints, the base of a blacklisted balloon manufacturer, one of six Chinese entities the U.S. government sanctioned after the suspected spy balloon. Shot down, pulled up, and sent to an FBI lab, each piece providing more proof, the U.S. says, this was no weather balloon, deflating denial after denial by Beijing. China's foreign ministry calls the whole thing an accident, the balloon, and unmanned civilian airship. CNN searched for the truth behind the balloon, took our team from the Chinese capital to a Shanxi province, about 300 miles southwest of Beijing. Days of digging and geolocation technology took us down this road to a place few outsiders have seen. No international media has ever come this close. What did we find? An active industrial complex with ties to the Chinese military's vast and highly secretive aerospace program. Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology, or EMAST, blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department. CNN searched corporate records suggesting EMAST has permits to develop and manufacture products for the Chinese military. The first thing we noticed, a giant white dome. A closer look shows the company logo. Inside that dome, a lab. We dug up a 2017 Chinese state media report that says this is where workers test high altitude balloons like the one that flew over the U.S. Our team spotted two more massive structures. They look like giant tents. A search of state media archives reveals their true purpose. Huge stealth hangers helping military choppers evade detection by prying eyes. CNN cameras also captured what seems to be an assault helicopter on display. Listen to this. That same state media report never once does it mention meteorology. It boasts the balloons can carry multiple detectors, communications equipment used for civilian and military surveillance and reconnaissance. CNN tried to get answer from all six companies on the U.S. blacklist. No response from EMAST or the others. They are not talking about the balloon, but President Joe Biden is.",
