Ben Wedeman is following the latest developments.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The rebels have seized control of the central Syrian city of Hama, the country's fourth largest and one of huge symbolic significance. Yet the latest stinging defeat for President Bashar al-Assad's increasingly beleaguered regime. After several days of clashes around the city, the rebels, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, entered Hama Thursday and the regime forces pulled out. According to a statement from the Syrian army, the pullout was intended to avoid civilian casualties. The rebels took control of an air base, complete with multiple warplanes, and freed inmates in Hama's notorious prison. Hama has long been a hotbed of opposition to the Assad dynasty. It was in Hama in 1982 that Bashar al-Assad's father, then President Hafez al-Assad, crushed an uprising killing anywhere between 10,000 and 25,000 people, according to Amnesty International. Last Friday, the armed opposition quickly seized control of most of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. The next city on the highway south, Homs, is just 40 kilometers away, a critical crossroad linking the capital Damascus with the Mediterranean coast, home to the Alawite minority, which is the main bedrock of support for the Assad regime. And if that regime was looking for help from its old ally Russia, well, it may not be immediately forthcoming. Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow is monitoring the situation and will decide on military aid depending on how the situation evolves. Hardly a full-throated declaration of support for a friend in need. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: I'm convinced that this guy is a civilian, he's not a professional, he wasn't hired to do this. I think there's a lot of signs of that, the message essentially written on the bullets. That's not something a professional would do. In fact, leaving casings and live rounds at the scene, also not something a professional would do. Going to Starbucks on the way to the killing, also not something. But nevertheless, despite the fact that he is a civilian, he has put an enormous amount of time and effort into this. The amount of time that he spent in the city before the target even arrives. Now it's likely he knew, he went to New York because he knew the investor conference was going to take place there and he knew when that was going to happen and where it would happen. So he gets there 10 days in advance, he spends 10 days figuring out the city, getting back and forth, figuring out the best modes of transportation. Maybe that an e-bike is better than a car at that time of day. Using the subway, getting back and surveying the both, maybe both hotels, certainly the one where the killing takes place. So, and then you layer on top of that his use of the weapon, his clear amount, a significant amount of training with the weapon, the pre- positioning of the escape bicycle. This guy really thought through this thing very carefully. He's clearly a highly organized person, probably pretty smart, likely highly educated, really very determined to reach this goal, this deadly goal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hegseth has denied those allegations, but some still want to hear a lot more.

It's called the swamp for a reason. It's difficult to drain. If you just look at the federal budget, you know, a lot of it is dedicated to debt servicing. A lot of it is dedicated to defense spending, which Trump has said that he won't cut. And then a lot of it is devoted to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.

FLINT:  Well, the physiology of these birds, may or may not be comparable to us as mammals, but it certainly opens up the potential that there are ways that an organism that lives about the same amount of time as we do, at least it seems in this case, could teach us something.",

You're very welcome hope to give you good news about the hatching and about two months.",
