I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour, and we have lots of breaking news, but let's begin in Georgia, where the Court of Appeals has now disqualified the prosecutor in the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is no longer allowed to prosecute the case. The court says it has found significant appearance of impropriety, but is not dismissing the case entirely. Now, for months now, Trump and some of his co-defendants have been trying to get Willis disqualified because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, who is a special prosecutor that Willis hired to help handle the case. Let's get straight to CNN's Katelyn Polantz, who is tracking this breaking news from our Washington D.C. bureau. Katelyn, you've obviously been following this story from the very beginning. This is a pretty big development. Help us understand the decision.",

      "sentences": "A big development, because District Attorney Fani Willis, she is the person leading this case, the heart of the prosecution office against Donald Trump in this racketeering case, and by saying that she should be disqualified, that's the finding of the Georgia Court of Appeals today, that effectively (ph) puts into motion removing her from the top of this case.So, that creates a situation for Trump where he should be very happy with, he wanted this, because it would effectively end the case against him for moving forward in any capacity in the coming months, even years. It would take a great amount of time to replace her. And if there is somebody that comes in to replace her, they may not even want to continue this case against Donald Trump in Georgia. So, that is the big impact here. But, Rahel, it's important too what the Court of Appeals is doing. They're the intermediary court. So, there is another court in Georgia, another appellate court in Georgia that can still look at this and make another decision. What this court did today, though, is they said the trial judge, he got it wrong when he looked at Fani Willis, and whether there was enough reason for the public not to trust her to move this case forward. What this court said is, with the trial judge looking at a significant appearance of impropriety caused by Willis because of her relationship with Nathan Wade, other things she was doing when she was prosecuting this case, that's enough, even if they don't look at exactly what she was doing with Wade, the money exchanges that she says she wasn't benefiting from, just the idea of significant appearance of impropriety is enough under the law in Georgia to cause her to be taken off this case, disqualified from prosecuting Donald Trump.",

So, there were two federal criminal cases against Trump that are now dismissed while he is in the presidency and very likely to dismiss for all time. One of them is the classified documents case in Florida, but the other was closely linked to what the allegations here were against Trump. That other case in federal court was the January 6 case against Trump. Willis had built her own set of allegations about what happened after the 2020 election against Trump and several others in what she said was a racketeering conspiracy that they should all be tried for.This case was still existing in the court system, even though it was essentially frozen, paused for several months, waiting for this and other decisions by the courts in Georgia, and now with this decision, this was the big one that we were waiting for, with the court saying Willis should be disqualified. That puts this basically dead in the water. It's not even frozen anymore. This is just -- this is a throwing the entire case into disarray. So, those three ongoing criminal cases against Trump, they essentially are not hanging over him as he heads into the presidency now.",

I'll get attorneys that are not poisoned, if they will, under what they call the Yam Seng doctrine, fruit of the poisonous tree, get some attorneys in my office to handle this case. They would have to start a new ab initio de novo, as they say, but at least you would store public confidence. And if you had a Republican prosecutor in her office, make him or her the lead. That's -- that would make it even more believable in the eyes of the public.But, to fight this like that, this is a losing battle for her at best. The opinion by the appellate court is terrible, and I go back to the Supreme Court or the higher court in Georgia if they reverse and say she can stay on the case. That's a big if.

That's the gentleman that we've seen on our air for the past few weeks, but now we know that he is going to be really handed off to the New York defense attorney that he has been -- he has retained, basically, that we learned over the past few days, and then she is going to be handling the case moving forward. And you can tell that there is a lot of work cut out, not only because DA Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, is saying that they're moving forward with this 11-count indictment that was handed down by the grand jury, but now also new challenges potentially with a federal indictment coming as well.

(END VIDEOTAPE) SOLOMON: U.S. lawmakers are again in a desperate move to avoid a government shutdown this Friday. Let's get you up to speed. A bipartisan plan by the Republican House Speaker was tanked after the President-elect slammed it and called the 2023 deal that suspended the debt limit until January, quote, \"the most foolish and inept thing ever done by congressional Republicans\". Donald Trump ally and tech billionaire, Elon Musk, called the funding plan \"criminal\". So it's back to the drawing board and a scramble to avoid a Friday shutdown. And the blame game is already underway with one Democrat saying that this is the type of chaos that they expected with the incoming Trump administration.

But, that likely is not going to satisfy Democrats up on here on Capitol Hill who feel that Republicans reneged on the agreement that was struck when, in essence, a bomb was dropped on the deal last night by President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk, frankly.

She seemed very like content being alone, I guess.WILD (voice-over): This as new details are emerging about Rupnow, who opened fire at a private Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin, Monday, killing two and wounding six others. According to court documents obtained by CNN, her parents married and divorced twice within the span of about 10 years. The documents show a complicated arrangement, with Natalie moving between homes every two to three days. Ultimately, her father, Jeff, had primary custody with regular visits from her mother, and they lived roughly 40 minutes apart. The documents also show that Natalie attended therapy and her parents were encouraged to join her. Neither Jeff nor Melissa Rupnow have responded to CNN's multiple requests for comment. But, court family documents say, at one point reported a generally positive co- parenting relationship. Police say Rupnow's parents, Jeff and Melissa, are cooperating with the investigation. According to police, Rupnow used a handgun in the attack, but it's unclear how she obtained the weapon. A Facebook photo posted by Rupnow's father in August shows her at a shooting range. A comment from her dad on the photo says they joined the range in the spring, and quote, \"We have been loving every second of it.\" She is also seen wearing a KMFDM shirt, a German industrial rock band whose lyrics were cited by the shooters at the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in Colorado. The band, at the time, condemned that horrific attack. The band's music also accompanied a TikTok post from Dylan Butler shortly before he opened fire at a school in Iowa in January, killing a sixth grader and wounding seven. Police say they're looking into Rupnow's activity online. Experts say any social media footprint left behind by Rupnow is crucial to the investigation.",

The Biden administration's new target under the Paris Climate Agreement is for American greenhouse gas emissions to fall by between 61 percent and 66 percent by 2035. Long before then, though, Trump wants to once again pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.Let's bring in our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir, who is live for us.

That's a tough one to meet.But, it really speaks to the urgency of the crisis, and also just setting that standard, regardless of American politics, that the world will continue this fight, Democrat big cities' governors will continue this fight in the United States, regardless of Donald Trump's hostility to the topic at hand, and some of the momentum is sort of built in in terms of electric vehicles, for example. The EPA under Biden tried to agree with California, saying they going to limit the sales of those, no new gas-powered cars by 2035. Trump will certainly try to challenge that. But, it could take a couple of years in court. And so, auto manufacturers, for example, have to follow where the customers are going, and that's where the rest of the world is going, regardless of Trump politics.",

WEIRexchange for campaign support, pretty much pure deregulation, with the promise that he is going to bring electricity and gas prices down for Americans. Most economists say that no President has that power. In fact, when Donald Trump was President back in 2020, when OPEC and the pandemic caused oil prices to crater, and gas was $1.50 a gallon, it was really bad for U.S. oil companies. So, he was forced to go to Saudi Arabia and Russia and ask them to decrease production so the prices will go back up. Just a little history lesson reminder that it is the global markets that determine these energy prices by and large, and a lot of the momentum in these markets is going towards away from fossil fuels, towards electrification. So, that momentum could be slowed down, certainly by a Trump presidency right now, but there is enough of sort of battery factories and clean energy projects happening in deep red states that Ali Zaidi and John Podesta, the Biden sort of climate czars, thinks that that effort has sort of reached exit velocity, to use a rocket metaphor, and regardless of the Trump gravitational pull, it will keep going that way.",
