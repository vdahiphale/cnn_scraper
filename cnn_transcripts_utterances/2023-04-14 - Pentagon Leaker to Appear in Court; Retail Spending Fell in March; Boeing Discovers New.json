But with that access, with that kind of system -- maybe systems administrator like access, he also would come across pieces of intelligence that were maybe not specifically directed to him, but were within his purview, and he was able to take those and secret them out of the facility.So, definitely raises questions about how many people, not only have access to the systems, but are actually in the pipeline to receive some of our most sensitive briefings.",

The 346 Spetsnaz Brigade, now only with 125, they assessed, of their 900 numbers still remaining.Satellite images of another Spetsnaz base, suggesting a significant devastation to their ranks as well. None of this is particularly shockingly new because we did know that Russian special forces, elite units, have been thrown into battle at times to great significant losses, particularly around Vologda (ph) over the past few months, and other times as well, where they seem to have essentially been bid by the Russian military to show their prowess despite consistent defeats and themselves incurred significant losses. But it's the granular detail and, of course, the extraordinary aperture that U.S. intelligence has. And when it gathers intelligence like this that confirms what many had thought had been occurring, and also to the fact this information has come out and been leaked.

It may impact the morale of Russian troops trying to push on here as well. But this also shows, in this intelligence, that it will take decades, potentially, for Russia to recover from these losses.
