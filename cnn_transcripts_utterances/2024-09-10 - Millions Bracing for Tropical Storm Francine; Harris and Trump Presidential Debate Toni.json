Louisiana's governor has already declared a statewide emergency -- a state of emergency in preparation of Francine's arrival. Let's get straight to Meteorologist Elisa Raffa.

Right now, it's still a tropical storm with 65-mile per hour winds sending about 400 miles southwest of Louisiana. But you can see the outer bands already bringing some rain from New Orleans, Brownsville, Texas already getting some heavy rain. And look at all that lightning offshore coming in on those outer bands.We've had some dry air kind of limiting Francine a little bit overnight, but these ocean temperatures are incredibly warm. So, that's why we are expecting it to get its act together and strengthen just before landfall. Hurricane warnings in effect for a lot of Louisiana here looking at a Category 2 hurricane just before landfall. Again, that could be significant when it comes to damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, all of these impacts starting pretty much Wednesday morning. You could see the winds really starting to pick up on Wednesday. So, any preparations need to be done today. Things start to get nasty going into tomorrow morning. Look at these winds, could pump 90 to 95-mile per hour winds for parts of Louisiana, 45-mile per hour gusts in New Orleans and these winds continue to travel through Louisiana and then into Mississippi as we go into Thursday. Now, these winds will bring that onshore ocean push. So, we're looking at five to 10 feet of storm surge along parts of Louisiana here, two to four feet of storm surge in New Orleans. Also, this comes at a footprint of heavy rain, considerable life-threatening flash flooding possible. because look at the footprint of this heavy rain here, four to six inches would be pretty widespread, but we could find some totals approaching a foot. Also notice how far inland this gets. We could be looking at some flooding concerns for parts of Northern Mississippi, then even going into Tennessee as well. Something we'll be watching for days.

So, if you go back since 1976, the average candidate, the average leader at this point, leads his opponent, or her opponent, by six percentage points.But look how close we are right now. We are just a two-point race. While debates oftentimes really won't matter, because the fact is one candidate is so far ahead, this is one of those rare debates that actually could matter, because the race has been consistently, consistently close. Not just nationally, where we see right now Harris up by just two points, well within any margin of error, but in those key battleground states as well. You know, I was talking with our dear colleague John yesterday, in the key battleground state -- or key Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it was a tie, right? It was zero points that separated the two contenders. So, the bottom line is, while debates oftentimes won't matter, this is a year in which this potentially sole debate between Harris and Trump really could matter.",

Donald Trump, which just an 8 percent favorable. Kamala Harris with just a 13 percent favorable. But the bottom line is there's a lot more room for movement for Kamala Harris than there is for Donald Trump. So, the real question tonight is, can Kamala Harris seize this opportunity, seize the spotlight, put to rest fears that they may have about her, because the bottom line is undecided voters have already made up their mind about Donald Trump.

We're going to take this in stages. I'm going to ask you what each candidate needs to accomplish and what each candidate needs to avoid.

A lot of eyeballs, a lot of people who don't know as much about her are likely to tune in tonight. So, priority one for her should be to explain to people who she is, what she's motivated by, why she does what she does. You know, she has a really great opportunity to do that.And then, I would say priority two for her is to define Donald Trump as more of the same. To really paint him as, you know, not a change agent, not a disruptor, but the guy who was president for four years, who has been on the national scene for 10 years, you know, contributing to the corrosion of civility in our politics. I mean, she really has an opportunity tonight to do that. So, those are the two big things she needs to do. She needs to show the country who she is, talk about, you know, what motivates her and also paint him as more of the same yesterday's news, more of what people have rejected in 2020, frankly. BERMAN:  All right. Marc, so what does Donald Trump need to accomplish tonight? MARC LOTTER, FORMER STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN AND FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, first and foremost, he needs to put Kamala Harris on notice that she is the reason why that we have higher gas and grocery prices, why the border is not secure, why the world is at war. And so, as Kate says, more of the same, she literally is more of the same, more of the same failed Biden policies that two-thirds of the American people disagree with. So, that's mission number one for him. Mission number two is remind people things were cheaper, the border was secure, world was not at war when he was in the White House.",

She really needs to think about tonight as an opportunity to tell her story, to talk about what she's going to do for the country, lay out her vision, chart her path, and not let this debate become a constant response to Donald Trump.Now, that's easier said than done. That's easier said than done in any debate, frankly, but certainly, easier said than done when debating Donald Trump, who we know is going to be very aggressive, whether or not he chooses to -- you know, to go into the personal, which we know he -- you know, he likes to do as himself, that's -- we know that's where Donald Trump wants to go, clearly not where his team wants him to go. But either way, her aim needs to be to not allow the terms of this debate to be set by Donald Trump and to not be constantly baited into responding to him, but to think about this as an opportunity to be on the -- on her front foot and talking about things in the way that she wants to frame things.",

They see it happening with the southern border and they don't like it.And so, reminding people that, look, things were better off when he was in the White House and she's the reason why you don't like where we are right now.
