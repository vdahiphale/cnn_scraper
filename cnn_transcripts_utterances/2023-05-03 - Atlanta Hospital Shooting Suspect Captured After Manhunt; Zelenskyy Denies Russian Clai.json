And authorities say, the 24-year-old Deion Patterson (ph) was a Coast Guard vet. He was arrested, this evening, in Cobb County, Georgia, in a condominium complex. Patterson (ph) is accused of killing one, and injuring four others, after just after noon, local time, inside of a waiting room, of a Northside Hospital facility, in Midtown Atlanta. So, let's go straight to Gary Tuchman, who is in Atlanta, for us. Gary, you've been at the scene, of this capture. What do you make of what police has revealed?

And because people had heard already that it was likely that this man was in Cobb County, Georgia, and this area is about 11 miles northwest, of where the shooting happened? Everyone was being on alert. And we just talked to a woman inside. We walked inside the complex. And she told me that she heard two dogs barking, inside, very loudly, and they weren't stopping barking. She's heard them bark before. But they kept barking. And she was suspicious. So, then she thought, \"I'm wonder if this man, who's on the loose, could be in the gondola, at our pool area.\" It was a hunch she had. So, she called the police. The police rushed in. We were following those police. They came inside the complex. And we just waited outside here. And these women tell us, and they may say this later in the news conference, but you're hearing it first from me, these women tell us the police went to the pool and gondola, and then started yelling, \"Get down! Get down!\" And people in the community heard that and they stayed in their house. And it turns out, the woman's hunch was right, that this man was found, at the pool area, in this condo complex, was put under arrest, and at about 50 minutes ago was taken in a Cobb County police car, out of the gates, and he is now under arrest.

Of course, Grady Hospital is the Level 1 trauma center that's nearby this location that they were transferred to. You heard the Police Chief talk about the idea that the firefighters and EMS swarmed this area, despite the fact that there was still maybe an active shooter in the location, getting those people out of here. The hospital, or the facility, behind me, is where this man came to, earlier on, in the day, with his mother, apparently seeking some medical attention. We know he was a member of the Coast Guard. And, at some point became, very upset, on the inside of this building, and started shooting. And five people were hit. And unfortunately, one woman lost her life. We talk about that response, from police. It's through the video camera network that's all throughout the city. They were able to get the images, out there, to the public. That really helped. And you talk about the crowdsourcing of information that happened throughout the day. They were concerned about all the parking garages that are behind me because they were scared that someone could steal a car, so they were shutting those down. You heard the Police Chief say that basically, they know he got a car that was running at a Shell gas station that was nearby. And then, he went to Cobb County. And then, you had that elaborate camera network that sort of linked all the cameras, together, that was able to help them track him down, to the area.

The Republican Party has changed quite a bit, since the last time we had a showdown, like this. I think, frankly, the media has not covered the issue, in a way that is clear to the public, what is actually at stake, and what it is Republicans are asking for, or rather not asking for. They have been very vague about what their demands are. They have these across-the- board spending cuts, but they don't actually specify what any of them are. I'd love to hear Joe Manchin talk about what it is he wants to cut. I agree. We do have fiscal challenges. But we're not in a space, where we actually know what's being negotiated.
