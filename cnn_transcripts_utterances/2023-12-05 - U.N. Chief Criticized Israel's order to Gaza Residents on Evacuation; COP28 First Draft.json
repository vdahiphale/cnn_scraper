Israeli forces have moved their ground camp into southern Gaza in an effort to root out Hamas militants. And the U.N. relief agency says the number of civilian casualties in the territory is rising rapidly. The IDF tells CNN that a ratio of two Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza for every Hamas militant is, quote, \"tremendously positive given the challenges of urban combat.\"According to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, nearly 16,000 people have been killed in the enclave. The Israeli military reports its war objective in northern Gaza is nearly completed. Defense Minister Yoav Galant says the entire area, including Gaza City, will soon be broken. A video posted on social media shows the Israeli military detonating explosives and destroying a large building in central Gaza housing the Justice Ministry and courthouses. So let's go live now to Paris where CNN's Melissa Bell is following all these developments. She joins us now. So Melissa, what is the latest on Israel's military movements? MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's very difficult to know exactly what's happening inside the Gaza Strip because of the lack of internet access, entirely broken down, another blackout, very difficult to get information out. And yet we're trying to get an idea of what's been happening as a result of these expanded Israeli operations inside the Gaza Strip. Now, what we've been hearing is specifically heavy fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip, with the IDF now saying that it believes that it can entirely break this situation around Gaza City and in the north of the Strip. We've been hearing from those inside the Kamal al-Adwan hospital complex, which is in the north of the Gaza Strip, that have been speaking despite the blackouts managing to get through to CNN to speak about the situation there. Heavy gunfire, artillery, a sense that the hospital is now being closed in on. This is what the IDF says about its operations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON: We are pursuing Hamas wherever Hamas is hiding, in the North and in the South. Every rocket launcher, weapons depot, command and control center, senior commander, underground infrastructure and any hideout where our hostages may be held. Our war is against Hamas, not against the people of Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Most of them having been told to head to the south and the extreme pressure now is on the Rafah government to the south of the Gaza Strip. This is what the World Health Organization is warning of.

I suspect that there will be a lot of talk about alliances, there will be a lot of side events and side shows that look really good.

Hamas has denied committing any rapes or sexual assaults. SHERYL SANDBERG, FOUNDER OF NONPROFIT \"LEAN IN\": There are exactly no circumstances that justify rape. None. Rape is targeted. Rape is terror. Rape is torture. SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): Doesn't just strike fear in the hearts of Israeli women. It strikes fear in the hearts of every woman and girl around the globe. Their bodies are not worth defending. TAPPER (voice-over): The chief superintendent of the Israeli police read numerous accounts of the atrocities witnessed by survivors and first responders.",

At issue here is a complicated debate over the border.Republicans are insisting that stricter immigration and border security provisions be attached to any additional aid for Ukraine. Now, there was a working group, a bipartisan group, that was trying to hammer out a deal on the border. But we're told that over the weekend, those talks hit an impasse. So we'll see where the discussion goes from here. Now, Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has signaled that he's just going to put a package on the floor to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine without those additional border security provisions and essentially dare Republicans to vote against it. But so far, Republicans signaling that they are not backing off of their demands. Let's listen. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): This side of the aisle has been clear that a security supplemental must include funding and policy reforms to address the crisis at the southern border. And if that doesn't happen, we will not proceed. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Democrats want to be reasonable on immigration. We're willing to make concessions.
