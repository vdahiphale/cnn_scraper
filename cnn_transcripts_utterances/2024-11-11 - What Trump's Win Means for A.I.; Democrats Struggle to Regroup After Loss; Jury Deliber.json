In to -- heading into 2005 and then 2013, heading into the '16 campaign Hillary Clinton was way up in the national polls, it was pretty clear she was the heir apparent. How about Al Gore, going into the 2000 campaign, or '04, again, the clear heir apparent. You have to go all the way back, all the way back to the 1992 campaign with this giant question mark over here. Let's see if I can draw it in. There we go. Where there was no clear heir apparent.

It's one of the three most important positions in Washington. It's elected by the smallest number of people, and yet, we don't even have any accountability for how they vote. I think that's an issue you're going to see contested here in the next day or two. But if you are a Republican senator and you're not happy with the fact that maybe people from the outside -- now think about what the outside means, that means outside the Capitol, you know, where the bosses live.

That's what I'm saying. TODD:  Yes, but there's an attitude in leadership elections, it says, just trust us, right? Just trust us. This is not the first one. We've seen that in previous leadership elections where it's like, you know, the voters are not smart enough to help us figure out who we should vote for. This is a really important job at the top of the Republican Party. And so, it's only natural that other people outside the little club of 49 members might have an opinion. And it's their job as senators to factor those opinions and decide what's the mass of the Republican Party. What would the voters want us to do in regard to this election?

And the next day, their bodies were found, both with cuts to their throats. The case attracted tons of attention, in part because of a photo and audio recording of a suspect taken from Libby's smartphone. The case ran cold for more than five years until Allen was arrested in 2022. Pleaded not guilty to the murder charges. He could face up to 130 years in prison if convicted.Drought conditions are fueling wildfires not out west we're talking about, but rather in the northeast. Nearly 12 million people are under a red flag warning in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island today. And this weekend was filled with hazy, smoky skies in New York and New Jersey from several wildfires burning there. There's also fires at the heart of the -- in the heart of New York City as well. Windy conditions ignited one in an iconic green space in New York, Brooklyn's Prospect Park. New York City, clearly not an area known for wildfires, has been under a drought watch after the driest October on record. Firefighters in North Texas pulled off a heroic rescue this weekend, saving a two-year-old child trapped in a massive apartment fire. When they arrived on scene, they were alerted that the child was trapped on the second floor of the apartment building, and we see through here how that rescue played out thanks to body worn camera footage. They managed to pull the child through a window and then transferred him quickly to a medevac helicopter for immediate care at a nearby hospital.

But remember, Donald Trump is already signaling pretty hard that he does not want the sort of old Republican establishment in his new administration. I think it was notable that he said already that both Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo, who are seen as strong supporters of Ukraine, will not be welcomed back into a second Trump administration. Donald Trump Jr. meanwhile, literally was sending out a social media post the other day saying essentially ha, ha Zelenskyy, your allowance from the United States is about to end.
