It's all to do with the debt ceiling, you know that much and it doesn't take much to really send it one way, or considerably lower. Anyway, that's where it is at the second. Here are the news we're looking at. France has banned short domestic flights. It's a symbolic move to reduce greenhouse emissions, but it does raise the question of where would it go next. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor will announce his bid for presidency tomorrow. He will do via Twitter in a conversation with Elon Musk we are told. And Meta sells off Giphy at a substantial loss after an order from the regulators. Live from New York, Tuesday, May the 24rd. I am Richard Quest, delighted to be with you. And here of course, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, France has imposed its ban on domestic flights for journeys possible in less than two-and-a-half hours by train. It's a move designed to reduce airline emissions, although frankly symbolic at best, only three routes are affected so far, Paris only to Lyon, Nantes, and Bordeaux. Because the bans are such must meet certain EU conditions. For instance, there must be a high-speed rail alternative. The train schedule must allow people to arrive in the morning and return the same day, and there must be enough service to absorb the increase in passengers. The ban, it may be symbolic, but it does presage a much greater change of your will in future transportation. So last month, the French transport minister, Sir Clement Beaune told me greening the transport system is his priority. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For the time being, it isjust the French battling with first of all, their commitment that you just heard from the transport minister there of zero carbon emissions by 2050. To give you an idea of how far they have to go is 408 million tons last year. They are looking at getting that down to 270 million tons by 2030. But there is a long way to go, and that is why that is part of their reason for announcing this ban, it had already, Richard, been in effect. Air France had agreed to go with it even ahead of the degree being published in exchange for some COVID relief and other operators had been banned from coming in to take over on those particular routes that you mentioned, so Bordeaux, Nantes and Lyon. But critics say that it really is nothing at all. You're talking about 0.3 percent of the overall emissions caused by airplanes departing from France, so very little indeed, and -what the environment committee that advises the French government had suggested is that this should actually apply to almost all domestic journeys, that is any journey that could be carried out in France within four hours, so therefore, Marseilles, the very south of the country should see this band as well. That has not been the case. So it's been criticized at once for being slightly timid, for not being terribly effective. And you're quite right, Richard, the next question that follows is what then happens at a European level?",

What we are looking at here in Europe, where you have much smaller countries remember, Richard that Francefits 17 times inside the United States. So these are very different conversations that are going on. Already, Europeans tend to favor rail rather than air wherever they can, but of course, the problem is that it is for the correspondents, for instance, what this latest law does not do is prevent you if you're flying in from New York, taking the ongoing flight to another city. It is for people wanting to go from one European city to another. And you can imagine that this is something that will carry on, but that will have to be agreed at European level. The point is, this is on the minds of Europeans, partly because also remember last year here in France was the hottest since 1900. This has really helped to focus the minds. These may be timid measures for the time being, opposed, of course, you should expect by the airline companies and the lobbyists, but nonetheless, likely the way of things to go here, Europe-wise as well -- Richard.",

Moscow has claimed that it has crushed the latest incursion that's launched from Ukraine. According to the Moscow defense ministry -- Russian defense ministry, 70 fighters who attacked the Russian region of Belgorod were killed and it says the rest were pushed back into Ukrainian territory. The Kremlin is calling the attackers Ukrainian militants, although Kyiv is denying involvement. Two groups of anti-Putin Russian nationals have claimed responsibility. Matthew Chance is reporting from London and I need to warn you, the report is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian forces insists they are taking back control from a group of what they call saboteurs infiltrating this leafy border. These images purporting to show a Russian soldier detaining three of them was broadcast on state media. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): Meet the anti-Kremlin Russians, now taking the fight back home. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): \"This is how we work,\" he says. Amid a bold armored raid across the Ukrainian border into Russia itself. CNN can't independently verify any of the images, but this entire column of vehicles was spotted crossing the frontier. Ukrainian forces insist it's not them, but exiled Russian groups fighting against the Kremlin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We are Russians. Just like you, we want our children to grow up in peace and be free so they can travel, study, and be happy, but this is not possible in Putin's Russia. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): And the raid caught Russian border guards unaware. This one tried to be a hero, the narrator says, amid the scattered passports and a portrait of Vladimir Putin overlooking the carnage below. (UNIDENTIFIED MALES speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): \"The border is now unlocked,\" says one of the fighters. \"Grandpa Putin will soon turn to honey,\" says the other, in other words, \"die.\" (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): On Kremlin controlled television, the presenters stood like statues as the day's events replay of videos from stunned locals witnessing the fight. The Kremlin called the attack a diversion, but already, there is sharp criticism from Russian hardliners that this was allowed to occur. This Russian region right next to Ukraine is no stranger to cross border attacks, but armed incursions like this are rare. And the mood here, according to local Russian officials has shifted. With empty buses coming in to evacuate residents, while those who can are leaving by themselves. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, yes, we certainly have. And I think you're absolutely right that it is certainlybecoming a lot more complicated, especially as right now, much of the world and certainly many of the countries that are supplying weapons to Ukraine are waiting for this massive counter operation, counterattack that the Ukrainians have said that they are on the verge of launching. It's quite interesting, because earlier today, Richard, I was actually with Ukraine's national security adviser and I asked him if they were ready for this counteroffensive, and he said they have a plan. They are working according to that plan. However, they are obviously not going to say when exactly that counteroffensive is going to start. They are saying that it's going to happen when the president says so and when he has talked about it with his main military advisers. So that's certainly also something that plays into it as well. But I think you are absolutely correct to note that right now, the situation certainly right now is increasingly not only getting tense, but that the stakes are getting higher, as well as President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he made that round, first through Europe and really, to Asia as well, getting a lot of new weapons pledges, like, for instance, from the Germans, from the Brits, from the French as well. And now some of these countries are saying, look, we need to see something on the battlefield after this happens, after these pledges have been made, as well. Zelenskyy, today, by the way, Richard, he was visiting Ukrainian troops on the frontlines, naval troops on the frontlines, telling them how important their work is. But right now, what you have is a situation where a lot of the frontlines are very bloody, but not moving very much. And then you had this incursion that took place that Matthew was just talking about there in his report, that certainly could complicate things even further, because one of the things of course, now could happen is massive retaliation by the Russians after quite frankly, what was a humiliating incursion onto their territory.",

And I think one of the things that we always have to keep in mind and quite frankly, also, one of the things that the national security adviser told me about today and many Ukrainians have said is that of course the Russians have a say in this as well. They've been strengthening their positions down in the south of the country. They've obviously had that massive operation going on in Bakhmut as well, which has drained some Russian -- well, a lot of Russian resources, the Ukrainian say, but of course, has been extremely tough also on the Ukrainians as well. They've had massive losses in those areas. The Ukrainians are saying, they still have a shortage of a lot of the very important munitions that they need. We talk a lot about Western weapons that they've gotten, but the actual Munitions for those weapons are extremely important to them, as well, as they want to strike this offensive. It seems as though right now, the Ukrainians obviously are saying that they have a plan for this offensive, but they're waiting for the right moments to start. And that is, of course, something that could vary, you know, when that's a good time, and where exactly that could happen, as well. So certainly, there will be an offensive, the Ukrainians say, at some point in time. Right now, they're not getting nailed down on when that's going to be, but I think one of the things that we have to make clear to our viewers also, Richard, is that the Ukrainians right now have put together of course, thanks to a lot of these donations from Western countries, one of the most modern militaries in all of Europe. If you look at the main battle tanks from Germany or coming from the UK as well, infantry fighting vehicles, howitzers, they have a lot of gear. They certainly on paper seem to have the capabilities to do this. Now, it seems they're waiting for the right moment. And of course, also the right level of training as well -- Richard.",

Richard, it's the question I think a lot of people are asking right now because it is sooutside of the realm of what we are used to when it comes time for somebody to announce they are running for president. However, in talking with people who are working closely with the governor, this is what they want. They want something that is different. They want something that is unconventional, and they want to really make a statement. And so this is certainly one way to do it and they certainly feel like this is the right way to do it for Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. You know, he has been traveling around the United States over the last several months to a lot of key early states, a lot of key swing states. I'm told that he was invited to all of them, he didn't ask to go. But it's no coincidence that that made up his schedule. I was told he was really taking what he and his advisers like to call the Florida Blueprint. They really feel like they've had a series of wins here in Florida that they can take on the road and sell to the American people and they really wanted to take their temperature and see how they responded to the Florida governor, and I think if we can glean from all of that by the fact that we now know that he is officially announcing tomorrow, that they feel like it is time to go. It is a broader theme, Richard for his what I think will be for his now campaign, we can almost call it, but his political operation today, which is they really want to do things differently. We should expect to see him out on the campaign trail aggressively. They really want to draw contrast between President Joe Biden who they really want to paint as older and a different generation and President Trump who they think -- they want to paint a contrast with him as well for different reasons.",

But to that, the Home Office has made clear they don't think that UK Police should be for hire from wealthy individuals. They don't want to set that precedent. A judge agreed with that.

It's a great example that shows thedirection that we're going, in terms of trying to create safer context for kids online. What we've specifically done, we're now removing content from YouTube platform that shows disordered eating behaviors that kids might see and then imitate in their real lives. So this is things like bingeing and purging, weight based bullying, excessive dieting behaviors. So we're removing that content and that's important for fostering space that better promotes wellbeing.",

Obviously Meta did not want to lose $250 million on this attempted acquisition. And I think this is a reminder of how tough of an environment it is for Meta in terms of making big acquisitions and growing its business through acquisitions. The whole reason it had to sell Giphy off is because U.K. antitrust regulators said that this acquisition could harm competition. So in that respect, I think this is chump change for Meta, a couple hundred million dollars. But that is a real significant problem for the company.",

Potentially, this opens up the possibility for Giphy to be available on more platforms rather than just Meta's platforms alone. And Richard, I want to point out, although Meta has made a big loss on Giphy, it doesn't mean that GIFs aren't cool anymore.
