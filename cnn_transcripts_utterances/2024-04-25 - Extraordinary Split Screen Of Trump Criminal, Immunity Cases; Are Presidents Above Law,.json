More on that in a few moments. But, first, we learned a lot today, Abby, from inside of a Manhattan courtroom and the lips of one David Pecker who was supposed to be the eyes and ears but the mouth is speaking, and the tabloid kingpin who did Donald Trump's bidding. Pecker will go back on the stand tomorrow, but today's testimony put an awful lot of meat on the bone about how prosecutors say Trump architected an agreement to catch and kill the Stormy Daniels story in the deciding stretch of the 2016 campaign.",

I mean, this is crucial, because while we have those reporters in the court who are giving us the real time information, this is actually it in black and white.And the first thing I want to highlight from these pages really goes to the core of this case, the issue of not just the falsification of business records, but possible campaign finance violations. So, the first part of this transcript here is from the prosecutor saying, were you aware that expenditures by corporations made for the purpose of influencing an election, made in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or a campaign are unlawful? David Pecker answers, yes. Continuing, the prosecutor said, did either you or AMI ever report to the Federal Election Commission in 2016 that AMI had made a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal? Pecker says, no, we did not. Steinglass continues, why did AMI make this purchase of Karen McDougal's story? Pecker says, we purchased the story so it wouldn't be published by any other organization. And why did you not want it to be published by any other organization, the prosecutor asked. Pecker says, we didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign. Again, this goes to the heart of the case here, guys. The possible campaign finance violation mixed in with the false business records. I will note that AMI, after David Pecker left, the board of AMI actually did settle with the Federal Elections Commission. They paid $180,000 fine for this exact contribution, guys.",

This is wonderful, but thinking about this, each witness has a different piece to play. Think about an overall jigsaw puzzle, right?This one witness is not going to give you everything. They want to have the catch and kill scheme pattern established. They want to suggest that Donald Trump was aware of a catch and kill scheme for the purpose of trying to have no transparency for the election. In moving that particular needle, what did you see today? KIM WEHLE, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY:  Well, I think they've established probably the narrative that he had an intent to influence the election, not necessarily to protect Melania or his reputation and also that the catch and kill scheme was created in order to cover up the payouts to these women. The question, I think, is what Todd Blanche would say Said in his opening statement, which is, will the jury be persuaded that this is a crime. Well, they say to themselves, listen, this is just the rough and tumble of politics. This is just the dirty things that politicians do. And should a former president really be prosecuted for what amounts to falsification of business records? That's really the crime. What brings it from a misdemeanor to a felony Is this intent to commit another crime or conceal. And there was a motion for a bill of particulars The judge did rule and they had FOUR different theories of these underlying crimes. Three of them, The judge said could go forward. One was the Federal Election Commission violation. One was the New York law that loops in the Federal Election Commission violation. And then one was essentially tax fraud that essentially said that when Michael Cohen was paid back, they grossed up the payment to cover up the fact that he was going to have to pay income taxes on that. So, we haven't seen that theory, but if any of those, I think, they were able to establish, they might be able to make that link.",

You know, David Pecker didn't just talk about the scheme, you know, during the election up until the election itself, but he also talked about how this really continued on into when Trump was elected, even when he entered the White House.In particular, there was a conversation with White House officials, March 2018, actually right after Anderson Cooper interviewed Karen McDougal, and here's how the conversation went according to Pecker. The prosecution said, did there come a time after that, after March 2018, when you spoke with Mr. Trump and other members of his White House staff? David Pecker says, yes. When in relation to the call that you had with Mr. Trump? And then he said, did there come a time after that -- sorry, Pecker said it was right after the call I had with Mr. Trump, that there was this other call with the White House. Steinglass said, who else was part of that call besides yourself and Mr. Trump? Pecker answers, Hope Hicks and Sanders. That's Sarah Sanders. Okay. Can you tell the jury about that call a bit? Well, on that call, what I was planning to do and I mentioned it on the previous call to Mr. Trump, that I was going to extend Karen McDougal's contract. It was for six months. The contract was up. And I felt that from the last lunch that I had with her that we had fulfilled some of the obligations that she was looking for, specifically her beauty products and media training. So, I was going to send her a new contract. He thought that was on our original conversation. He thought that that was also a bad idea. So, when I received the second call, when I got the call back, and Hope Hicks and Huckabee, Sanders Huckabee, that's Sarah Sanders, when she was on the call, I explained to them, to the two of them, why I was going to extend the agreement. And both of them said they thought it was a good idea. Prosecutor asks what was the reason that you gave for why you wanted to extend Karen McDougal's contract? Pecker says, I wanted to extend her contract so she would not go out, not give any further interviews, or talk to the press, or say negative comments about American Media or Mr. Trump. Now, you said that when you had your individual conversation with Mr. Trump, he was skeptical of that. Pecker says, yes. Prosecutor says, how about when you explain the reason that you wanted to extend her contract to Mr. Trump, Ms. Hicks and Ms. Sanders, how did Mr. Trump react to the new plan or how did he react to that plan during that second conversation? Pecker answers, saying Trump said, it's your business, you do whatever you plan on doing. So, guys, it really talks about how Pecker was still moving on this and working with Karen McDougal even after Trump took office. And having these phone calls with very high level people within the White House during the presidency, still dealing with the fallout of these catch and kill deals that they had made leading up to the election.",

There's -- it's nowhere in article two of the constitution there is immunity for legislators in this under the speech and debate clause. The impeachment clause specifically says, if there -- someone can be impeached and be then criminally tried. That's in the plain language of the United States Constitution.Richard Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford with the assumption that he could be prosecuted if that was not an assumption, why would there be a pardon. In addition, Mitch McConnell, after the impeachment trial stood on the senate floor and said there's -- we are, procedurally, we're not going to convict because the justice system can hold this man accountable. The problem in this moment is if you look at Donald Trump, we've never had a president like him. We've had 240 plus years of no need for immunity for criminal immunity for presidents. The political system works. The other checks and balances work. Donald Trump mowed through every other guardrail, every other mechanism to disincentivize crimes in the White House. It's not a speed limit that gets us to slow down when we're driving. It's the ticket in the mail when we -- when we speed. And this, in my mind, is crucial to ensure there's tickets in the mail for speeding for presidents. I mean, think about it. This is being manufactured by the court in response to January 6th.

That was a scene allegedly orchestrated by the President and, you know, it is his official capacity.How can it be that he can be at the center of that conspiracy, all these other people can be charged, they can go to court, but somehow Donald Trump has this immunity bubble around him? That cannot be. And even the members of Congress who were involved in this knew there was something wrong with it because as revealed by the January 6th Committee, they asked the President for pardons from it. So, how can that be? And then what also came up in the court today was the idea that there is complete unfettered pardon power that cannot be touched. That should be rejected outright. The pardon clause of the Constitution is 20 words. Those 20 words are not a free pass to run roughshod over the rest of the Constitution to create licenses for political violence in the way that Donald Trump dangles them for January 6th rioters. You can't use the pardon power to override First Amendment rights.
