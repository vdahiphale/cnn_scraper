Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas coming with specific requests from Mexico to drive down the numbers at the U.S.-Mexico border.That includes, according to officials, moving migrants south who are on Mexico's northern border, also controlling railways, which are often used by migrants to quickly get to the U.S. southern border, and also providing incentives, like visas, to keep migrants from journeying to the U.S. southern border to begin with. Now, border towns here in the United States have been growing restless as they have been overwhelmed by the number of people who have been arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. And that has put more pressure on President Biden to do more to try to manage the situation. And that is what he is looking to Mexico to help with. And the U.S. has historically done this. They have leaned on Mexico in moments of crisis to help them with the numbers at the U.S. southern border. They're hoping now that with these asks, they can at least get some relief to these border towns and to the country as a whole.",

They're not going to have their visas automatically approved, as they have in the past. It's going to be a much more time consuming, case-by-case process. Bureaucratic delays could back up the process of visa applications for U.N. workers for weeks or even months or even longer.And that is because Israel says they believe the United Nations is biased against Israel, and they accuse U.N. staffers who are operating inside Gaza, who are broadcasting pictures of the situation there, of essentially trying to turn the world against Israel. And so from the Israeli point of view, they don't want to make it any easier for them to get in and see the situation. Of course, critics might argue that that is not only cutting off Gazans from necessary help from the United Nations, but also some sort of government imposed censorship to try to silence the voices that are raising the alarm about the situation, the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground in Gaza right now.",

The word cloud is part of a survey where a thousand voters, thousand likely voters, were asked what Trump wants out of a second term. It comes after Trump's social media Christmas rants attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith and President Biden.CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now. Kristen, I see the slight grin on your face because we're talking about a word cloud that's mostly nonsensical and has limited impact on anything, but it's also exactly what Trump would want people to be talking about right now, which I assume is why he posted it, or is there a deeper strategy and meaning here?",

      "sentences": "Oh, Phil, I'm sorry to disappoint you that I don't believe that there is a deeper strategy and meaning here. And I will note we had to actually dig to find out where this word cloud came from because he just posted the actual picture. He didn't post a link to any article.But here, I want to break this down into three parts. First, let's look at the biggest word on there, which is revenge. Donald Trump does believe that this campaign is about revenge, and he has said so out loud. He has said that if he won a second term, he would weaponize the Justice Department to go against his political enemies. So, that is part of his campaign messaging. The second part of this is trolling. This is exactly what he wants people to be talking about. He knows the word dictatorship. And if it comes from him, will spin the media up, will spin Democrats up, as well as those anti-Trump Republicans. But the one thing to pay attention to here is, yes, he continues to say, dictatorship, dictator. He uses these tongue and cheek remarks, saying, I'm only going to be a dictator on day one. But the thing to point out is that Donald Trump himself and his allies outside of his campaign are working towards a second administration that would consolidate power under an executive, giving the president and the White House an enormous amount of power and an unprecedented amount of power, which is how this conversation all started. And that is a very real thing that is happening. Now, the third part of this is that Donald Trump does have a base that eats this up. It's not just the dictatorship part. But if you look at the other big words that are around the same size, power, economy, he likes to look strong, and he believes that his voters want a fighter. And that is why he is posting something like this. Now, one thing I do want to point out is that they had the same questions for a second Biden term. The words were a little different. They were nothing, economy, peace and power.",

Let's start with the first item on the docket, which is the criminal case, federal criminal case brought by Jack Smith relating to 2020 elections subversion against Donald Trump.Now, we remember Donald Trump claimed that he's immune, meaning he can't be prosecuted because the conduct has to do with his official job as president. Now, Trump lost that argument here at the trial court level, the district court. Jack Smith then, looking to expedite, hurry things up, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case directly to skip this middle level. But in a somewhat surprising ruling on Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court said, no, you're going to have to go through the normal channels, meaning the next stop is the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and then potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, the good news for Jack Smith is the Court of Appeals has ordered a mega expedited schedule. The arguments in that case are going to be on Tuesday, January 9th. I think it's very likely that the Court of Appeals will rule by the end of January. Now, the problem for Jack Smith is then DOJ -- then Donald Trump can ask for what's called an en banc review. That takes a few weeks. Then he can ask the Supreme Court to take the case. That takes months. The trial date here is March 4th. I think that's very much in jeopardy. But that's the first thing to watch for in January.",

This ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, they put it on hold, a stay, as we would call it, until January 4th. And that's a crucial date, because the next day, January 5th, is when Colorado prints up its primary ballots. Meaning, as long as Trump goes to the Supreme Court -- he doesn't have to win, just goes to the Supreme Court, everything is on hold. Trump will be on the ballot if he goes to the Supreme Court for the primary, but then the Supreme Court is going to have to decide the bigger issue, which will be for the general itself.",
