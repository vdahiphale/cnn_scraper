      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, this is good news on the cost of living front. We're talking about wholesale inflation. This is pricing that's in the pipeline before it gets to all of us as consumers. And essentially prices are still going up but at a slower pace. And that is a relief. Look at this, 0.1 percent month over month. That beat expectations. And 2.2 percent year over year, also better-than- expected. If we look at the trend here, we could see a significant improvement. Just a month ago this was at 2.7 percent, so it's improved. But when you really zoom out, look at this, two years ago this metric was at almost 12 percent. It's hard to believe. Look at this significant improvements since then.This is exactly what Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve want to see because it's going to give them some confidence that, yes, inflation is improving. Yes, they can cut interest rates at the next meeting in September, which, of course, would be good news for all of us on main street, but also on Wall Street. And that's one of the reasons why we've seen U.S. markets open solidly higher. We see the Dow up 137 points. The mood has really improved significantly after what was one of the wildest weeks in years on Wall Street. All of those concerns about the economy. Thankfully, calmer heads are prevailing right now. Of course we get another big data point tomorrow. That's the Consumer Inflation Report. That's going to play a big role here in what the Fed does next. One other point I just want to make, as far as the markets go, because I know there's been a lot of scary headlines on these markets swings. There's that thousand point drop just over a week ago.

So just another reminder here that we need to not panic and stay calm as the markets adjust to all of these moving pieces right now in terms of inflation, the Fed, the jobs market.

And look, she's very proud of her economic agenda with President Biden, over 15.5 million jobs and counting created, four major economic bills passed. President Harris - Vice President Harris was very much part of that strategy and getting those - that legislation passed with President Biden. But she's also going to talk about her own economic agenda, how she's going to continue to reduce costs for American families. She was very much part of making sure that insulin was capped at $35 per consumer. And also something that - that Governor Walz did when he was governor, which is also capping insulin costs. So, the two of them are putting consumers first. They're putting American families first. This is going to be front and center of her economic agenda.

And that's something you heard her talk about when she talked about no taxes on tips in Nevada earlier this week. She's been endorsed by nearly every union, supporting workers. She was just endorsement by the culinary union in Nevada, which is a testament to the fact that she is fighting for consumers, that she is putting working families first and her campaign. A stark contrast to Trump, who is simply putting corporate interests first. He's focused on - he's made it very clear that one of the first things he would do is give big tax breaks to billionaires and if he gets back - steps one foot back in the White House. That is certainly not on Vice President Harris' agenda. And you're going to hear her talk about - more for about her economic policies -",
