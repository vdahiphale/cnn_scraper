The seven day average reported on November 28th was around 6, 800 migrant encounters in December. The seven day average is over 9, 600 daily encounters. That goes to show this is one of the highest recorded totals that we've seen when it comes to these averages in the month. And the challenge here and the unique challenge is that multiple regions of the U.S. Southern border are being slammed by the number of arrivals, which makes it all the more difficult to navigate logistically. And the president speaking to his Mexican counterpart to place more pressure on his neighbor, Mexico, to do more to stem the flow.",

Now, these audio recordings are from November 17th of 2020.They've been reviewed by the Detroit News. They've not been reviewed by CNN, but in them, the Detroit News reports that Donald Trump is speaking directly to workers in Wayne County, the most populous county in Michigan. Trump telling the two canvassers in this call, in these segments, that it would look, quote, \"terrible if they signed off on the election results.\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel saying, quote, \"do not sign it, we will get you attorneys.\" To which Trump added, \"we'll take care of that.\" Joining us now, CNN Political Commentator, former Trump White House Communications Director, Alyssa Farah Griffin, and CNN Senior Political Analyst &amp; Anchor, John Avlon. Alyssa, we have talked for years about Donald Trump getting on phone calls and pressuring people in phone calls from the president of Ukraine to the Georgia Secretary of State, more immediately related to this.

You follow the first responders, the policemen and women, as they come in through the chaos. The gunman is still active.You can see the students trying to head for cover. And perhaps one of the most chilling and harrowing parts of this body camera footage that was released, as you say, in a press conference earlier today by the police is when the first responders arrived in some of the classrooms, Kate, were tragically all of those bodies were found. Now, you see them going about the initial triage, trying to save who they can save. We now know, of course, that in the end, 14 people lost their lives. Most of them were students who had just a couple more days to go for their term before their end of year exams and before they went back to their families for the holidays. A couple of them were staff members. But this, we learned from the body camera footage of the immediate chaos, but we also learned in that press conference from the police chief who delivered it, that they had been surprised to see the amount of ammunition, weaponry the young man had with him. And what this suggested was that this could have been far, far worse if the police hadn't been as effective as they had. But now, to put it into context, these are exceedingly rare here in Europe compared to in the U.S. And yet, what Czech police are saying is that they'd been preparing for this for years. Ever since what happened in Norway in 2011, when a far right extremist killed 77 people, they'd been running drills, and this is what really prevented them from preventing -- allowed them to prevent this massacre being even worse than it was. And as you said a moment ago, I think this is important. They've also said that they are not naming the killer. We know he was a 24 year old philosophy student. We know he killed his father before killing himself, killing all those students and staff members in between. They're not naming him to deprive him of the oxygen of publicity. They don't want some sort of macabre desire for fame to prompt any more of these students from going on the rampage to prevent also any kind of copycat killing.

But it's really not what you would expect. Now, in terms of what we're seeing here at New York's LaGuardia, you would know that it's supposed to be one of the busiest travel seasons in recent time. That's because what we've witnessed here is a sort of a steady flow of passengers outbound passengers coming in, checking their bags rolling to TSA in terms of what we saw yesterday, some 2.64 million passengers using TSA checkpoints in the U.S. That is a telling figure as it was slightly higher than was expected. That number expected to be in even higher today. In terms of what we saw last year, you recall that 10 day nightmare that Southwest Airlines experienced having to cancel close to 17, 000 flights. The federal government really has been urging airlines, not just southwest to make sure that their systems are resilient enough to handle any sort of factors that get thrown their way. Of course, the airlines can't control the weather.
