      "sentences": "Fred, at this point, we have zero indication according to police that there's any active threat to the public, but the investigation is certainly just getting underway here. It's in its infancy stage.I want to get you straight to what Boston police have actually confirmed so far. As you look at some of these pictures that have come in, police have confirmed that at least seven people were hurt during a situation that played out earlier this morning at about 7:00 a.m. All of them are expected to survive, so there are no life-threatening injuries. And we do understand, as we just saw from the pictures a short while ago that this incident interrupted what was supposed to be Boston's Caribbean festival which usually features about two parades. The first of which was getting ready to actually begin early this morning when those shots rang out. You could see at least one vehicle that was damaged there. Doing some digging, this is supposed to be a moment to celebrate, usually draws in large crowds and families that will line the streets there in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, but in the past, it h as also attracted some violence and has resulted in various incidents that I have been able to see here, at least confirm officially either authorities or from previous reporting from our local affiliates there. So it certainly wouldn't be surprising that there would have been likely an increased police presence to make sure that people felt reassured that they were safe. But unfortunately, again, we can confirm that this shooting that took place earlier this morning, though a motive remains unclear, did result in at least that delay, if not potential cancellation of some of the festivities. Though I should note that we have not officially heard from the city yet in terms of what the rest of the day will have in store. But these pictures will really tell you everything you need to know of everything that's left behind. Some police patrol cars there that were damaged in what was likely a very chaotic situation. I should note Fred, that in the next hour or so, we should hear from Boston authorities, potentially from city officials and police department officials, they will likely provide a clear picture of what took place. But again, the main takeaways right now as we send things back to you, is that it was at about 7:00  a.m. as crowds were gathering there to participate in Boston's Caribbean festival when shots rang out resulting in the injury of seven people. All of them, according to police, are expected to survive.",

Polo Sandoval, keep us posted. Thank you so much. All right. Now to the new developments in the fast-moving Georgia election interference case. Two of the pro-Trump attorneys charged in the case are now asking for speedy trials. Sidney Powell has joined Ken Chesebro in requesting quick trials. A judge had already scheduled October 12 for Chesebro and in response to the request, Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis wants the trial for all 19 defendants at the end of October. But the defense team for former president Donald J. Trump is trying to delay the start. Trump and his 18 co-defendants are facing a variety of charges, including racketeering and conspiracy. They all surrendered ahead of yesterday's noon deadline. This morning one of the 19 co-defendants remains in the Fulton County jail. Last night a judge declined to set bond for Harrison Floyd, a leader of Black Voices for Trump. And during a hearing, he told the judge he could not afford to hire an attorney. The judge informed him that he didn't meet the eligibility requirements for obtaining a public defender. CNN's Jeremy Herb is tracking all the developments. Jeremy, walk us through what is next in the case overall?",

It includes Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, Jeffrey Clark the former DOJ official and three of the fake electors who were in Georgia and cast those votes for President Trump. Now what they are trying to do is move their case into federal court for a variety of reasons. One of which is that it could help them with the jury pool that goes beyond Fulton County and potentially gives them more pro Trump jurors, Fred.",

He is a former prosecutor and served as Robert Mueller's special assistant at the Department of Justice. All right. Good to see you. Let me begin with your reaction to this new filing from Sidney Powell asking for a speedy trial. And this comes after fellow codefendant Kenneth Chesebro made the same kind of request.

I think that they believe that they have a triable case and they don't want to wait or sit next to all of the other defendants.So there maybe a trial with just these two people, unless the judge says somehow says we're not going to sever you two from that. But normally, if they get a request like this, they go to trial. And there are advantages and disadvantages. The advantages to the non-tried defendants, Trump and the 17 others, is they get a preview of the evidence. They get to sit in the back of the courtroom and watch. The bad news is that Sidney Powell and Chesebro might well, as you would expect, point the finger at Trump and say, we were following his orders. We were just doing what he told us. He's the culprit. We're just, you know, sort of  victims of his criminality and he's not in the courtroom to defend himself. And that evidence just comes in and comes in and comes in blaming Trump for everything. So, there's a plus and a minus to these guys' request. And we'll see how the judge plays it with respect to joining the other ones in or letting them be separate and distinct.",

They can put in a bit of a streamlined case against these two, but they still have to prove the racketeering enterprise and that they were in a conspiracy to violate the law and that they did certain overt acts, racketeering acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.So they put in their case and then they say this was the role that these guys played in a conspiracy. So they have to do it twice which is very burdensome, but it's not unheard of. Trials like this often with that many defendants get split up. And so the prosecutors are ready to do this twice. And it won't be too painful for them.",

And that would be in Georgia before a state judge with a state jury.The people who have moved for removal to send it to federal court, Meadows and some of the electors, and those people are trying to say we want a trial in the federal court, not here in the state court. And there's going to be a hearing about that and what they have to prove is that what they were doing as federal officials was acting within the scope of their employment as federal officials. They weren't doing something outside of the scope of their employment and that they have a defense as a federal official. That's a complicated case to make because generally speaking, violating the law, especially violating state election law, which is nothing that the federal employees have anything to do with, will be a hard case to make. But they can argue and the judge is going to make a decision. And if they get removed, it will be in federal court and maybe a little bit bigger jury pool. But in the end, I don't think it's outcome determinative of what will happen in this trial. The evidence is going to come in. The jury is going to decide whether these guys did this or didn't do it.",

No, in a sense that if it gets removed to federal court, they will then argue that they are immune from prosecution because they were federal employees acting in the scope of their employment. They get to have immunity.So that's not a delay tactic. That's a get the case dismissed tactic. But there's also, of course, the delay aspect to this while that is all being sorted. And of course, many of these defendants, like many defendants in trials all around the country, would prefer that they have reckoning to be postponed as long as possible.",

Even though you say, you know, you need to -- a federal employee needs to be able to establish that they were acting in the scope of employment, as the former chief of staff, can he simply say, you know, he made me do it.

That would not be something that he could say well, the president told me to do it and I did it and therefore I'm immune from prosecution because that's not clearly within the scope of anyone's employment in the federal government.So the question will be when he said go get false electors, go set up meetings so I can pressure people, is that sort of an order like go rob a bank and therefore not protected, or is it within the scope of his employment just on the edges of it then he gets the protection.

You're talking about open terrain, much of it heavily mined, and it has been extremely costly for the Ukrainians to try and advance against these extremely well-defended and entrenched Russian positions. But what we're hearing not just from Ukrainian officials, but also from Russian military sources, the bloggers that follow what happens on the other side is that the gains have allowed this wedge to be created. That the Ukrainians will now try and substantially increase as they try and make their way strategically to the key, the Sea of Azov trying to break that crucial land bridge from one side of the Russian-held territory through to the Crimean Peninsula. Now, of course, what we have seen over the course of the last few days is a good deal of criticism of Ukrainian strategy that they should have allowed themselves to focus so largely on this thousand-kilometer front rather than focusing their efforts more specifically in the Zaporizhzhia region. Now what Ukrainian officials and military sources tell us is that in fact they believe that this will be a winning strategy. These small successes that you're seeing around Robotyne and not just in and of themselves, they say but because it will force Russian forces to consolidate their positions and they hope allow breaches further along the line, Fredricka.",

He's a Democrat from Delaware, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Foreign Aid. Senator, good to see you. Let's begin with the war in Ukraine. Is there a concern that the counteroffensive isn't achieving its goals and that Russia may have the momentum at this point? SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Look, I think it's important we continue to provide support for Ukraine and their counteroffensive. They have made slow but steady progress. Unlike last summer where they made great big breakouts and took back significant pieces of territory. This summer they have been fighting against entrenched Russian forces who had months to lay mine fields, to build trench systems in depth. We didn't anticipate they were going to breakthrough and make very rapid advances. In fact, many military experts with whom I have spoken say there's still a good chance that the counteroffensive will pick up steam. They have gotten training. They have gotten new equipment, they have gotten resources, but frankly most importantly, they have the will to fight. They are determined to take back their country from the Russian invaders and occupiers, even though they are taking very heavy losses on the battlefield. And when Congress returns to session next month, I think it's particularly important that we show our ongoing support for them by taking up and passing the supplemental appropriations request President Biden submitted to Congress just a few weeks ago.",

They have provided as much support as has the United States.But to answer your question in meetings in London and here in Dublin, and in other meetings I have been in throughout Europe and the rest of world over the last year and a half, virtually every one of our partners, friends and allies thank the United States for our leading role in pulling together NATO and our global partners in support of the Ukrainians. I think this says, in many ways has been President Biden's strongest, most effective moment of global leadership. But the, in the next breath, express grave concern that if former president Trump were to return to the White House, that we would step back from supporting Ukraine's fight and that we might make some significant mistakes that would harm our alliances and weaken our reputation in the world. So it is widely a topic of concern. I'm a part of a bipartisan and bicameral delegation, that means members of the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat. One group came over and visited Northern Ireland. Another group that I was a part of visited London. And then all of us met up here together this weekend for a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement. I actually last night over dinner got to meet one of the former leaders of Ireland, the Taoiseach who helped negotiate those accords. In all of the celebrations we've been a part of here, there is a recognition that Senator George Mitchell of the United States, President Bill Clinton and leaders of both parties over a long period of time contributed to bringing to an end the troubles in Northern Ireland. We have an excellent special envoy for Northern Ireland now, Joe Kennedy. And we have a role to play in helping move forward the positive progress that's been made in the Republic of Ireland and in the North of Ireland, in Northern Ireland. And it's my hope that we will see positive progress made in (INAUDIBLE) reconstituted. But there are some concerning developments in the parliament in the United Kingdom and some unresolved questions that we need to address. So I'm glad I was a part of this bipartisan group.
