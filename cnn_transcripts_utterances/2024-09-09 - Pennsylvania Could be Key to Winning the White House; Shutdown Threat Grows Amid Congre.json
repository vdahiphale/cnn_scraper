This is Harris vs. Trump margin in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.A month ago, when you looked at the polls, New York Times plus four Harris, plus three Quinnipiac for Harris. Franklin and Marshall, plus three for Harris. But look at polls that have come out over the last week or so, and what do we see? We see a much tighter race. We see a tie in the CBS new YouGov poll. We see a tie in the CNN SSRS poll. And this, to me, is part of an emerging pattern, which is in a very pivotal state. What we saw was a small Harris lead, but within the margin of error, becoming a race that is way, way, way too close to call it this particular point one that is even.",

But those states themselves have become hyper competitive. I mean, they are swing states because they are balanced, you know, on the edge of a knife. So, what you're talking about is a couple 100,000 people in really six or seven states choosing the direction for a nation of 300 million -- 330 million. And we see some pretty similar patterns, whether we're talking about the national polling or the swing state polling where Harris, like Biden, is running pretty close to what Biden got in his winning number in 2020 among white voters, maybe a little below where he was among whites without a college degree, maybe a little above where he was among whites with a college degree and netting out to about the same place. But despite her gains, she is still not equaling what Democrats usually get among non-white voters and young voters, and that, in many ways, looks like her challenge and her task in the remaining weeks of the campaign.",

I mean, there's a broad agenda that's out there. But, you know, voters are safe, 30 percent in that poll in The New York Times rising to 40 percent among Latino and black voters, 50 percent of younger voters. They need to know more about her.

It's one of the youngest nations in the world. It's also the second most Catholic country, next to the Vatican.

The governor says he noticed the man struggling, who is signaling for help. So, Sununu jumped up and started performing the Heimlich maneuver. All was OK, is OK.

Thank you, sir, so much for joining us. First of all, you and your wife, you live in Texas, a state that has restricted abortion, probably one of the most restrictive states in the country. You have really told the publican what has happened to you and your wife personally. Can you give us some sense of what happened when your wife is experiencing a prolonged miscarriage? RYAN HAMILTON, WIFE EXPERIENCED LIFE-THREATENING COMPLICATIONS DURING MISCARRIAGE:  Absolutely. And thank you for having me. What happened to us was we needed abortion related care, and I think there's a lot of confusion around that because my wife had an incomplete miscarriage, you know, finding out that our baby's heart had stopped beating would have been enough. But what happened to us was she needed a procedure called a DNC and the doctors refused that care and kept sending us back home after multiple visits to multiple hospitals across Texas. They just kept sending us back home with a prescription for a drug called misoprostol. And the short version of that story is my wife bled profusely for four days, and I found her unconscious in her own blood in our bathroom, and she had to be rushed to the hospital for life saving care.",

Wade, the country as a whole, every time that people are polled, they do believe that abortion care should be a part of the care that a woman gets, and there is a discussion as to what the restrictions should be. But most Americans did not like the idea that Roe v. Wade was overturned. How did you all deal with that?
