If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.At least seven World Central kitchen workers in Gaza have been killed in an Israeli military strike. The organization says a convoy was hit leaving a warehouse where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is temporarily shutting down Al Jazeera's operations in Israel on Monday. The parliament approved a law allowing the government to shut down foreign networks deemed a threat to national security. Israel has claimed the network played a role in the October 7th attacks. Al Jazeera disputes this claim. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Paris today for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. The two are expected to discuss continued U.S. support for Ukraine as well as the Israel-Hamas war. Iran is vowing a decisive response after what it says was an Israeli missile attack on its consulate in Damascus in Syria. Two top Iranian military commanders are among the seven people killed. More now from CNN national security correspondent Natasha Bertrand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Iran says its consulate in Damascus, Syria was attacked by Israel on Monday leaving at least seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials dead including two senior commander.Now Iran's ambassador to Syria said the building was targeted with six missiles from Israeli F-35 warplanes but the Israelis have neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the strike which has raised fears of an escalation in the region as Iran has vowed to respond decisively. Now a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told CNN that he would not comment on the attack other than to say that according to Israeli intelligence the building that was hit was actually a military building being used by the IRGC rather than a civilian consulate. CNN cannot independently verify either Iran or Israel's claims but State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. has been in touch with regional partners to determine what happened here and he reiterated that the U.S. does not want to see the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalate beyond Gaza. But it remains to be seen whether and how Iran will retaliate here. Iran backed proxy militias who were attacking U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq almost daily up until February have not launched any new attacks in nearly two months. But the concern now of course is that that could change now that Iran is vowing revenge. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem again on Monday calling for his resignation and demanding new elections.They blame Netanyahu and his government for failing to secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages being held in Gaza. It is one of the largest protests the country has seen since the start of the war. Dozens of demonstrators were also camped outside the Israeli parliament or Knesset and they're planning to stay there until Wednesday when the spring recess begins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump Media disclosing it lost $58 million in 2023 generated very little revenue, just over $4 million.Some context, Twitter generated more than 100 times as much revenue in 2013, the year it went public. This is why some experts say the multi- billion dollar valuation on Trump Media defies logic. One professor told me that this stock is a bubble. Another called it a meme stock. But Trump Media's losses are so severe that accountants warn the red ink raises, quote, substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Now, that's Wall Street code for we might not be able to survive. We should note, though, that that warning, that likely predated last week's blockbuster merger, a deal that allowed Trump Media to receive an influx of $300 million in cash. Matthew Kennedy from Renaissance Capital, he told me that this cash infusion, that should remove the going concern risk here. Still, though, Trump Media's troubles, they've continued in recent months. Monthly active U.S. users on iOS and Android, they plunged 51 percent year over year in February to 494,000. That's well shy of the 75 million users on X, the company formerly known as Twitter. Even Threads has 10 times as many users as Truth Social. Investors should fasten their seatbelts because the wild ride here, it's likely just getting started. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Hanako Montgomery has the details for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After months of delay, the father of the atomic bomb's life story finally took to the big screens in Japan, the very country where his invention wreaked terrifying devastation. The film, highly praised globally, was met with favorable reaction from some Japanese viewers. KUMIKO FUKUDA, TOKYO RESIDENT (through translator): I was interested in this movie because it shows expressions and emotions hidden behind the eyes of both Americans and Japanese who saw the atomic bombs. It doesn't just show the tragic story, which I think is easier to depict. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But left others with a bitter aftertaste. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Of course, this is an amazing film, which deserves to win the Academy Awards in the United States. But the film also depicts the atomic bomb in a way that seems to praise it. And as a person with roots in Hiroshima, I found it difficult to watch. I'm not sure this is a movie that Japanese people should make a special effort to watch. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Omitting images of the ghastly wreckage caused to Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the atomic bombs, lethal weapons that killed over 200,000 people, was a conscious decision from director Christopher Nolan.",

But the criticism hasn't deterred viewers entirely. During opening weekend in Japan, the movie grossed 2.5 million U.S. dollars. Abroad, the highly lauded film won seven Oscars this year, including the coveted Best Picture and Best Actor awards. Christopher Nolan, who also took home Best Director, will receive a knighthood in Britain for his services to film. But despite the film's global accolades, Japanese viewers tread lightly, wary of how the West remembers and depicts history from 78 years ago, a past far from forgotten in Japan.
