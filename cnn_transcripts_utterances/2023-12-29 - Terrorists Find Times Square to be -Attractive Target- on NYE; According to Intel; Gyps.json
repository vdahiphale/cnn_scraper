Now, Blanchard pleaded guilty to second degree murder in 2016 and was sentenced to 10 years. She admitted to convincing her boyfriend to kill her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, who was victimizing Gypsy by forcing her to pretend she had multiple serious illnesses, including leukemia, muscular dystrophy and brain damage leading to dozens of unnecessary surgeries.It's a syndrome known as Munchausen by proxy, that's when a caregiver fakes or exaggerates a child's sickness to get attention. Gypsy told her then boyfriend about the abuse by her mother and they came up with a plan to kill her. He was sentenced to life in prison. Lifetime now will soon air a new docuseries on the crime called \"The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard\". Joining me now is Sharon Scott, the executive producer of this miniseries. Sharon, thank you so much for being here. Just for those viewers who might be unfamiliar with this story, remind us, what was it actually like for Gypsy and what was her mother doing? SHARON SCOTT, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"THE PRISON CONFESSIONS OF GYPSY ROSE BLANCHARD\" AND PRESIDENT, A&amp;E FACTUAL STUDIO:  It was horrific for Gypsy and her mother abused her, really, from the time that she was a little tiny baby to the time that, you know, the moment where she and her boyfriend decided to kill her mom. She, as you mentioned, was diagnosed with leukemia, muscular dystrophy. She had her -- she had glands removed and she was fed through a feeding tube. She lost 16 of her 32 teeth. It rotted out. She had to wear diapers. She was chained to her bed. I mean, it goes on and on. It was, you know, truly horrific every single day of her life. And all because her mom wanted to get the story out there, appear on television, make everybody feel so sorry for Gypsy, and, you know, get attention.",
