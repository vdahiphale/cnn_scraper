Moscow's Red Square blocked off again today After the brief but stunning insurrection. It's gripped the world could perhaps weaken Vladimir Putin's grip on his country. We should know, it's far too soon to know. So much, we don't know about what led Wagner Mercenary Group Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to launch a march on Moscow and what convinced him to abruptly call it off.And then it said, go into exile. U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken today called the whole series of events, extraordinary, believes it indicates that cracks are emerging in Putin's rule. The very latest now from CNN, Sam Kiley, live from London. And Sam we're watching Russia closely Ukraine also events in Belarus, any developments to indicate to us what's actually happening right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, I think the most stunning developments so far is an absence of any kind of news about the whereabouts of the of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Mercenary Group, as you rightly point out there he was, in command oval no not present in necessarily a column of military, his military that got within 200 kilometers 125 miles of Moscow.And then suddenly there was this intervention from Lukashenko from Belarus. And we saw pictures of -- of the Mercenary Leader leaving Rostov-on-Don, and ostensibly for exile and safety critically in neighboring Belarus, whilst his troops were, again as part of this deal, sent back or return themselves to their camps inside occupied Ukraine. But we haven't seen any evidence that he's turned up in Belarus. My own speculation is he might choose to go somewhere a bit safer, a bit further away from the reach of Vladimir Putin's intelligence services to some of the places in Africa, Central African Republic, or Libya, where his mercenary group has a footprint. But the future of the mercenary group itself, of course, remains in question now, as in does -- as indeed does the coherence of the Russian military effort inside Ukraine, because what he said at the beginning of that coup attempt, as he said, it wasn't in a weird way, even though he was marching on Russia -- on the Russian capital, he said he was not committing a coup, but actually trying to rid the country of the military leadership. But he did say that Vladimir Putin's reasons for invading Ukraine, specifically, because of the threat posed by NATO, were invalid and that something is going to really struggle to recover from Jim.",

Thanks so much to both of you here.Listen, we have to start with a dose of humility here because even -- even the most informed intelligence analysts right now don't have the full picture of what's going on in Russia. But Dmitri you've been watching this closely, you have a number of years' experience watching events in Russia. First question is, is Putin's leadership, is his power damaged here going forward? DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, RUSSIA &amp; CYBER EXPERT: I think there's no question, Jim, that Putin is dramatically weakened here. However, I don't think that he's in danger of losing his presence anytime soon. But what he's in danger of is losing relevancy. The reality is that everyone right now in Russia, all the elites, whether you are a governor somewhere, whether you are in the security forces, where you are general, you're looking at this, you're looking at Prigozhin, challenging Putin, and so far, at least getting away with it.

And he expected Putin to take his side.Putin once again, that not and said that everyone has to sign contracts with MoD. So I think this was actually an attempt to force Shoigu, to renege on that order to let Prigozhin keep walking in his business, which is very lucrative business, by the way.
