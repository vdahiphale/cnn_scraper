Now, so far, President Biden has resisted any suggestion that he would drop out of this 2024 campaign.

There seems to be a game plan forming behind Vice President Kamala Harris, and there's even talk of who her running mate might be. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, that's right, Boris. Look, there are more people than it might appear in public who are ready for Joe Biden to get out of the way, certainly also more people than are saying or hoping that he will stay. But there is a growing mood among top Democratic leaders that this just hasn't worked over the past week, that they don't have faith in where Joe Biden is going to be able to move people's minds over the next couple of days. They are willing to wait, but they are still, nonetheless, as you say, already so far down the road in thinking about what will happen if Kamala Harris takes over for him, that they have started to think about who her running mate would be.",

REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA):  Nice being with you, Pam. First, I think everyone agrees that we can't sugarcoat what took place with the debate. Secondly, I think what we need to see and what I want to see is the real Joe Biden. And he needs to make sure he tells the story. He's been one of the most effective presidents ever. I think it's important for people to remember, first of all, COVID, how he saved lives and livelihoods through developing a strategy to get us through COVID, secondly, created millions of jobs, thirdly, reduced the cost of prescription drugs. Yes, the cost of living is still too high, but he's working very hard to bring our economy to the point where the cost of groceries are reduced, the cost of housing, the cost of childcare. So he's got to remind people of what their lives -- how their lives have been made better and what is left to do.",

But I think we have to make sure we remember he's a human being, but everyone has him under a microscope. And so he's got to show in no uncertain terms that he is ready to campaign, which he is, and that he can do the job. Also, it's very important to remind him that he -- remind the public that he beat Donald Trump. He's the only candidate who has beat Donald Trump. Donald Trump wants to lead our democracy into dictatorship. He's a liar. He's a convicted felon. And, in fact, it's very scary to think of what would take place. I was sitting on the floor of Congress on January 6. This man and his following almost thwarted the peaceful transfer of power. So the president has to remind people of what the risks are.",

I think people inside the president's inner circle, they have listened, they have heard that there are things that he needs to do to reassure people, and they are trying to do that, a sit-down interview, travel, more unscripted moments. But at the same time, there is a palpable sense that none of it is really going to offset what the country saw on the debate stage last week and that the president really took his big liability and made it even bigger, adding to concerns about his age and apparent frailty and really imperiling his reelection. I mean, his campaign is teetering on a razor's edge right now. And even if he gives a decent interview, shows some pep, some vigor, some commitment, there are already, as Isaac spoke to a little while ago, a lot of talks in Democratic circles about what plan B is going to look like. There are a lot of members on Capitol Hill, dozens, in fact, who are already privately of the mind that the Democratic Party needs a new presidential nominee. They haven't said that. They have -- most of them have held back those comments publicly. But that is the conversation behind the scenes. Inside the White House, inside the campaign, there are some aides who, despite putting their head down, trying to do the work, expressing sort of a determination and resolve to go forward, there are a lot of aides who understand that this may not be fixable. And so, yes, all eyes are going to be on what the president says today in Wisconsin and in this interview, how he looks, how he sounds, but it may not be enough to allay the anxieties that a lot of people have across the party that the president's biggest liability is just not something that can be fixed, and, politically speaking, that it may already be fatal.",

If he understands, through private conversations or public pressure, that the majority of Democratic lawmakers believe he's a liability at the top of the ticket, that donors are ready to maybe pull the plug, to stop writing the checks, then that may leave him not much choice in terms of stepping aside. He said in 2020 that he intended to be a bridge candidate.",

And that sort of went along as planned. But as we have gotten into the general election, what the public has seen from the president himself has really given a lot of people pause. The campaign, the White House, they have been so dismissive of questions and focus on the age question. But that continues to be the big thing that is imperiling his candidacy. They did a lot more damage to themselves with the president's performance last week in the debate. And I think they all understand that on some level. And so what happens after this little swing of travel over the holiday weekend, when members of Congress come back to town on Monday, that's going to be critical. There are going to be conversations continue to take place over the weekend, but they are gauging support. They are gauging where the party, where donors are. They're trying to kind of contain the fallout. But that's difficult and may prove too difficult come next week.",

She doesn't just show up with the president at the July 4 celebration just because she had some time on her calendar.So that tells you something about people putting them together, wanting people to see them as unified, as a ticket. She was brought into that meeting with the governors. She spoke at the end. And a lot of the people that we spoke to who had a readout of that meeting said that it was really notable how at the end of that meeting, she was the one who was preaching, let's stay together, let's rally behind President Biden. Her response after the debate, starting with the interview that she did with your colleague Anderson Cooper just moments after the debate ended, that has bought her a lot of goodwill from Biden's inner circle and from the Bidens themselves. They have seen her as a staunch ally, a defender of the president. And there may be a situation where, if they feel the pressure mounting and the president is unable to continue his campaign, that may make them feel better about the situation that they are in handing the baton to the vice president, who really up to this point in the administration, yes, she's been the leading voice talking about reproductive rights and some other issues. But she really has not had a starring role in much of anything these first three-and-a-half years. And it's interesting to see her really quickly moving to the fore, seeing the country more focused on her and her performance than it has been to date. And, certainly, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where Biden steps aside and the Democratic Party and an administration that has really tried to do a lot to be responsive to the concerns of black voters, black women, in particular, that there would be a situation in which the vice president was somehow passed over, gone around in terms of who is going to be the next standard-bearer for the party.",

As you were talking about Vice President Kamala Harris and the way that some Democrats have seemed to have this renewed appreciation for her, in light of the disastrous debate last week, if Democrats have clear logistics of how that supposed passing of the torch would go if President Biden decides to step away from a reelection effort and potentially who a running mate would be for her.",

Which way it goes, that sort of remains to be seen. We're not at that point yet. And, obviously, the president at the moment remains a candidate and the party's presumptive nominee for reelection. So we will see how that goes. But I think the reactions to the debate, right, there have been strong reactions by people across the party. And there's been sort of people -- things people had not been willing to say publicly, now they're saying them. And I think just supporters, regular folks who might come out to rallies and line the motorcade, right, I think a sign that says, \"We love you, Joe, now step aside,\" right, that kind of captures where a lot of people in the party are, is that they appreciate what Joe Biden has done, how hard he has worked as president. But they recognize in him physically that it just may not be possible for him to serve another four-year term. And so I think that message, they're hearing that from a lot of different quarters. You're not hearing it, you didn't hear it from the governors who met with him a few days ago. You didn't hear that publicly, still no congressional leaders, maybe a handful of donors here and there and other members of Congress. But, really, it has been pretty small the number of people who have come out and said that publicly. They are trying to give him some space and some time to work through this out of respect and appreciation for who he is.
