      "sentences": "Well, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv closed for the first time, really since the invasion of February 2022. Diplomats not coming to work, many warned to shelter in place because of the fear they say of an air assault. Very untypical, this kind of warning to Americans and their diplomats to essentially take cover and not something that Kyiv itself would find that abnormal.Look at the streets around me here, there's no signs of life really changing at all despite the specific nature of this warning indeed. But it is a sign of the escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow, since Ukraine has started using in the last 48 hours, U.S.- made and supplied ATACMS longer-range missiles to hit targets inside of Russia. Is it likely that there will be a direct attack on this building? That would be an extraordinary escalatory move by Russia, in just the closing months of the Biden Administration, and I'm sure Vladimir Putin frankly, would not want to take a move like that when he knows President-elect. Donald Trump may engage in more favorable discussions with him. But other European embassies we are hearing are at least restricting their services, some closed to visitors. And it may be, I think, a reflection of how there's increased anxiety in all of NATO's ranks about what may follow the stark move by President Joe Biden to allow the ATACMS to be used. Overnight, we're hearing that Ukraine's defense intelligence says it has hit further targets inside of Russia, but still it's Russia on the front foot across the Eastern battle zone here, making incremental progress over the past months. But you do get a real sense here in Kyiv of the heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow because warnings like this are just so rare. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.",

Natasha, could you first start off by talking about what anti-personnel mines are, how they work, and how the U.S. is hoping that this could impact Ukraine's defense, its frontlines?NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Amara. So these are different from the anti-tank mines that the Biden Administration has been sending to Ukraine since the earliest days of the war. These are designed to essentially blunt the advances of personnel of Russian troops. And the reason they're giving these mines to the Ukrainians now, according to Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, who just confirmed this news earlier today, is because the Russians have changed their tactics in recent weeks and months to lead with those personnel, with those troops instead of those mechanized forces, tanks, for example, that they had been leading with before. So now, basically, the United States is trying to keep up with the Russians changing tactics here by giving the Ukrainians these mines that can essentially stall these advances by these troops. Now, importantly, the U.S. says that these anti-personnel mines, they are different from the kinds of mines that the Russians are using, for example, in that they are battery powered and they can become inert basically from a preset period. So basically, they can only last anywhere from two hours to two weeks according to U.S. officials. And that in turn, of course, would blunt the impact that they might have to civilians once the war ends, because that is one of the major concerns, of course, of human rights groups who say that these kinds of mines, they can really pose a threat to civilians who may come across them at a later date. [08:05:00] And so, the Administration is saying, look, these kinds of mines are going to be only used in Eastern Ukraine, not inside Russia. The Ukrainians have assured us that they're not going to be used in areas that are heavily populated by civilians. And importantly, they don't last that long. Right? The battery will run out of them eventually. And so, now the Administration in the waning days, of course, trying to give Ukraine everything that it needs and that it will need in order to fight off the Russians who are making pretty significant advances.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So interestingly, the Biden Administration is basically reversing its own policy here. The Trump Administration before the Biden folks, they had loosened the restrictions on anti- personnel mines. Biden, when he came into office, he reimposed those restrictions saying that these actually need to be completely eliminated from U.S. stockpiles, and the use of them worldwide really needs to end.So the reason for that was because, of course, they could pose that risk to civilians, right? I mean, if civilians came across them later, if they did not explode, then the personnel -- then the civilians who come across them could be maimed and injured. The Biden Administration is now saying that they're accounting for that by sending this version, which the battery can run out and they won't last as long as, for example, a traditional land mine would for decades. So that is how they're explaining this at this point.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the House Ethics Committee is expected to meet today. Now, when they do meet, we don't often get a lot of detail about what specifically is on their meeting minutes, if you will. Instead, they're going to go into a room and have a conversation about exactly what, it remains to be seen. It also remains to be seen if they decide ultimately to have a vote today or not to release the report on Matt Gaetz.Now, there is sort of this past practice where when a member leaves Congress, the ethics investigation into them ceases. In this case, I think there's a lot of question right now on what that gray area is, if they have a preliminary report prepared, do you move forward with releasing that to the public? And there's a lot of pressure right now from Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, House Democrats to get that report into either the public's eyes or at least the hands of some of the Senators who are going to have to make a decision about whether or not they think Matt Gaetz is up for this job. So this meeting today is going to be really high stakes for the House Ethics Committee because House Speaker Mike Johnson has made clear that he doesn't think the Ethics Committee should release this report. Now, Michael Guest who's the top Republican on that Committee says he's not feeling any pressure or influence from the Speaker of the House. Typically, the House Ethics Committee is very separate from anything that the Speaker's office does. The Speaker doesn't provide any direction. The Speaker doesn't technically have any power over the House Ethics Committee in terms of what its decision making process is. But look, I think ultimately, this is a really significant meeting. We're going to see how they decide to proceed in the hours ahead. Amara?",

In this case, it's going to be VP Vance who's going to be taking folks around, introducing them to members. What makes the situation unique obviously, is that Vance is a former Senator. He is currently a voting Senator of the United States Senate and he does have some relationships with some members.I will say, Vance is a relatively new member of the United States Senate. So he doesn't have the kind of deep-coursing relationships that you might expect from other Sherpas in the past when it came to someone who was going to take a member or a nominee from one office to another. This is going to be a really interesting moment. These are some of the most controversial nominees that Donald Trump has selected so far. The vetting process is just getting underway, but Vance is going to likely come into contact with some people who have a lot of questions for him about what is in this ethics report, why it shouldn't be released if it clears his name? There's a lot of argument from some Republicans that he should want it out there himself. So, Gaetz should be prepared for some tough questions today as he begins to have these conversations with Senators. We should note that Gaetz has been having some direct conversations with Senators, having phone calls over the course of the last several days. Donald Trump obviously, also making calls on behalf of his cabinet picks. Amara?",

He was visibly thinner than he had been in the past. He's 77 years old. His wife and daughter were in the gallery watching. He waved to them.And during the questioning from his own lawyer, at one point, he was asked about the core values of Hong Kong which he described as rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly. He was the founder of the \"Apple Daily\" newspaper, which was a highly influential, popular newspaper here, which shut down amid the crackdown that Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese national government endorsed on kind of opposition political parties and political organizations and independent press in this city. But the charges against him are very, very serious. And they've been put under this controversial national security law that Beijing helped ram through into Hong Kong amid many, many street protests, a year of protests, and they are of sedition and two counts of collusion with foreign forces, to which Jimmy Lai has pleaded not guilty. And the Chinese government is not mincing words about what it thinks about this former newspaper publisher. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIN JIAN, SPOKESMAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): Jimmy Lai is the main planner and participant of the anti-China and Hong Kong rebellion, as well as an agent and front runner of the anti- Chinese forces.

      "sentences": "So in his testimony today, Lai talked about how, in 2019, he traveled to the U.S., met with senior officials in what was at that time, the Trump Administration, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, the then Vice President, Mike Pence, and Senators, as well as the then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He was asked about what kind of message he gave to Mike Pence. This was at a time when there were weekly street protests that were increasingly deteriorating into riots with a lot of damage and clashes between anti-government protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.And Lai insists that all he did was ask Pence to speak out in favor of Hong Kong, that he never donated any money to any U.S. politician, only to religious organizations and to think tanks. But it's that kind of activity that certainly infuriated the Chinese government and the Hong Kong authorities. And it is during the Trump Administration, in that period that Hong Kong lost with the U.S. a special trading status, and also that the Trump Administration then imposed sanctions on several top Hong Kong officials, one of whom is the highest ranking official in Hong Kong today, who still is under those U.S. sanctions. So this is part of that -- the whole trial concerns Lai's contacts with the U.S. government at that time. A final note, this is the second day of an important trial taking place in Hong Kong. Yesterday, we saw 45 pro-democracy activists all get sentenced with more than 245 cumulative years in prison. Part of a bigger picture of just how kind of freedom of expression has really changed in this city in the past four years. Though the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities would argue all that they have done is brought stability back to this international financial hub. Amara?",

A Matt Gaetz type appointment would not go over well with investors around the world or business leaders for that matter. Now, sources have told CNN that the remaining contenders for Treasury Secretary under Trump include hedge fund executive, Scott Bessent, Senator Bill Hagerty who has a finance background, former Fed official Kevin Walsh, and billionaire Marc Rowan.Now, whoever ends up getting this role and getting confirmed is going to almost immediately face a series of deadlines and pressure starting with the debt ceiling, which is returning early in January. Remember, that is the borrowing limit that Congress has to avoid. Otherwise, there's a default which would be just catastrophic for the economy and for financial markets. And listen, this is kind of like the Treasury Secretary is going to basically be inheriting a ticking time bomb, that they not only have to diffuse by getting Congress to raise the debt ceiling, but then also figure out the accounting maneuvers to keep paying all the bills on time. But this is not just about the debt ceiling because there's also a looming fiscal cliff at the end of next year related to taxes. Remember those 2017 tax cuts, they expire at the end of the year unless Congress takes action. And so, it's going to be up to the Treasury Secretary to convince lawmakers to do what Trump wants, which is fully extend those 2017 tax cuts at a cost of maybe $4 trillion. And Trump has also called for trillions of other dollars of tax breaks. And lastly, the Treasury Secretary has to figure out how to finance all this because there's estimates that the Trump agenda could add almost $8 trillion to the national debt. And treasury is kind of like the government's banker, right? They have to figure out how much money to borrow and how to do it in a way that does not freak out the bond market.

A bomb cyclone has to reach a specific criteria for it to be called that, and it has to do with the pressure within the center of this low pressure or this cyclone. It has to actually drop a certain amount, 24 millibars in 24 hours. This particular low pressure system over doubled that criteria to be met. So, two times the amount of that bomb criteria, so certainly fulfilling that and tie in (ph) for the record lowest pressure off the Pacific Northwest. That's saying something. 77 miles per hour winds near Mount Rainier. You factor in the snowfall that caused the blinding conditions, the near zero visibility in some of the areas. And then the other thing about this storm system, there it is, but notice the trail of moisture tracking all the way back towards Hawaii. You see Honolulu there in the bottom portion of the TV screen. This is called the Pineapple Express. And it's a tropical atmospheric river that takes this moisture across the Pacific, and then it drops that deluge of precipitation over the Western U.S. So we're not done with this storm just yet. Several more days, in fact, of mountain snows and heavy rainfall, particularly across the state of California, from San Francisco northward into Eureka. You could see one after another storm system continuing to impact the western portions of the United States. The radar very busy right now. Of course, the shades of white, that being the snow, but the heavy rainfall continues across California and so does the wind. In fact, we have high wind warnings and advisories all over the western parts of the U.S. associated with this very powerful bomb cyclone. Amara?",

The 22-time Grand Slam winner lost his singles tie in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga yesterday, as Spain bowed out to the Netherlands, marking the end of his 23-year career.You can see there are lots of emotions, understandably. Nadal had tears in his eyes, pre-match, as did many in the crowd and many watching from home. For more, let's bring in CNN World Sport's Patrick Snell. I mean, it really is emotional because I think he's a favorite for people all around the world, including myself. How did all unfold?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara. I remember meeting Rafael Nadal as a raw 17-year-old back in 2003 as he played his first- ever Wimbledon. Fast forward to where we are now, it's just so hard to even process the fact that this is now the post-Nadal era. Tuesday's opening match of the quarterfinal clash with the Dutch, seeing Nadal playing, as you say Amara, in the singles.Remember, there had been speculation he'd be kept back for the doubles, but that wasn't the case. And you can see the emotion there just etched right across his face. The fans as well, really emotional. It's just a constant struggle throughout to fight back tears. The Malaga crowd showing their love and their respect for this 38-year-old icon of the sport. He was playing in his first competitive match in over three months. Nadal, perhaps no surprise in the end that he would eventually succumb to a dangerous opponent, Botic van de Zandschulp. Rafael beaten, but at that point, he didn't know whether his career was over or not, or whether it would actually continue because it all depended on how Spain did in the deciding doubles rubber (ph). Nadal anxious to see if his career would carry on. Spain needed to win to make that happen, but they would fall short in the end. Let's give the Dutch team huge credit here. They were written off by so many, but this was all about Rafael Nadal though, as the realization there sinks in that the dust is about to settle once and for all on his amazing career. Remarkable, truly inspiring, 23-year career now at an end, as Spain are beaten by the Netherlands. And then this is the moment that really got me, the retirement ceremony. It all just came out there. Just an outpouring of just sheer emotional grief in a sense, really that retirement ceremony. Nadal, remember, he won 22 Grand Slam singles titles, 14-time French Open Champ at his beloved Roland Garros. Amara, you know as well as I do, this is a man who is a class act on and off the court. Tributes coming in there, the iconic Raul, the Real Madrid legend, and of course, former rival turned friend, the great Roger Federer as well, paying his respect. And Rafael through it all, so very, very humble. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAFAEL NADAL, 22-TIME GRAND SLAM CHAMPION:  Just a kid that follow their dreams, worked as hard as possible to be where I am today. And at the end of the day, being honest, a lot of people work hard, a lot of people tries their best every single day. But, I am one of these, that I have been very lucky that the life gave me the opportunity to live unforgettable experiences because of tennis. So I just want to be remembered as a good person and a kid that followed their dreams and achieved more than what I ever dreamed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
