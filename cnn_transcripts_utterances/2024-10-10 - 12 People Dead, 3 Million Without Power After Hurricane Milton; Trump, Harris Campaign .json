      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.At least nine people have been killed in the state of Florida and search and rescue efforts are underway right now after Hurricane Milton made landfall as a powerful category three storm last night on Florida's west coast. Floodwaters inundated multiple areas across the state of Florida, leading to water rescues that began late last night, Milton dropped more than 18 inches of rain on the city of St. Petersburg, which was more than a one in one 1,000 year rainfall events. That's where Milton also ripped the roof off of Tropicana field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays, Major League Baseball team. The stadium had been set up previously to be a makeshift shelter for first responders, but no first responders were staging there when the roof was damaged. And in Manasota Key, close to where Milton made landfall, Milton leveled entire homes along the beach. In Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, an incredible moment there today as the sheriff found a 14-year-old boy in need of rescue, he was clinging onto a fence that was floating. The sheriff's office says the teen was at a friends house last night, did not think it would get that bad, but when he tried to get back home, he needed help and that's when he flagged down and he was thankfully pulled out of the water. (VIDEO GAP) winds certainly and he caused many problems, especially on Florida's west coast. At least five of the deaths reported so far came from a tornado outbreak on the opposite side of the peninsula. Milton created deadly supercharged tornadoes. The National Weather Service issuing more than 125 -- 125 tornado warnings, the most ever issued in the state in one day. At least nine tornadoes struck St. Lucie County, killing five people there and flattening hundreds of homes. We're going to talk to the St. Lucie sheriff in just a moment. So, of course, the big question, what comes next in terms of recovery as many areas were dealt a one-two punch from Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, and now Hurricane Milton. Right now, about 3.4 million people are without power. Many are without water. St. Petersburg shut down water services citywide, and one in four Florida gas stations still has no gas, according to GasBuddy, which could complicate travels for evacuees who are trying to return home. President Joe Biden today said there are still dangerous conditions in the state of Florida, and he urged people to wait to go out until given the all-clear by local officials. According to Governor Ron DeSantis, Milton's worst storm surge, up to ten feet came in Sarasota County, where Milton made landfall and that's also where we find CNN's Randi Kaye and where she rode out the storm. Today, she reports on what the storm left in its wake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I don't think I've ever seen an 18 wheeler just basically picked up and tossed over like this. Look at the power that it took to just kind of just knocked this thing over. There's another 18 wheeler across the street here. This -- this truck was basically picked up and kind of impaled on a tree back there and just again, just the power that it took to lift this thing up and throw it on its side and impale it on trees. Again, there's another one across the street, just down the street from here on the Lakewood Park Methodist Church, a roof gut ripped off. We spoke to the pastor there, Leo Volbragg (ph). He said he -- he knows some people in the community where the fatalities occurred. That's called the Spanish Lakes Country Club Village Community. According to the sheriff of St. Lucie County, Keith Pearson, that's a modular home community for people who are 55 years and older. We have tried to get access to that community. The police and the sheriff's office are not letting us into that community. They're still scoping the damage, possibly looking for more victims and assessing just kind of exactly what happened in that village. But that -- that area is the one that's really devastated. That is just a couple of miles south of here, Jake. You know, again, quotes from local officials, the commissioner of St. Lucie County, George Landry, said this has been a tragic 24 hours. The mayor of St. Port -- St. Lucie, Shannon Martin says, quote, we've never seen anything like this. And again what's interesting about these tornadoes that came through here, Jake, that they seem to have been kind of sporadic in nature in some communities, they tear whole swaths through communities and you can see the path. This one, it seemed that these 20 touched down affected certain pockets of communities than lifted up. So you can see devastated buildings and things like this next to buildings that are completely intact -- Jake. All right, Brian Todd, in Fort Pierce, Florida, thank you so much. The storm surge left boats stranded on lawns and even tennis courts in Punta Gorda, Florida, about 50 miles south of where hurricane Milton first made landfall, and other areas of the state, people lost their entire homes. That, of course, is where FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency comes in. I want to bring in Keith Turi. He's FEMA is acting director of response and recovery. Keith, how vast is the devastation in Florida and where do you think it is the worst? KEITH TURI, ACTING DIRECTOR OF RESPONSE AND RECOVERY, FEMA: Obviously, the storm impacted the entire state as your reporters were just saying and we were talking about that before the storm off. So we have the storm surge risk, the rainfall, which was extreme in some areas and that tornado risk, which turned out to be a more significant risk of tornadoes than we typically see in a hurricane like this. So I think it's hard to say exactly where the most -- the most damaged areas are. Obviously, some of those areas south of Tampa where they had that storm surges significantly impacted, but there's inland flooding in the Tampa area. You just talked about the tornadoes on the East Coast, and, of course, we're still going to see riverine flooding in other parts of the state. So still a very dynamic situation and widespread impacts from Milton.",

That is the first type of assistance that people impacted by a storm like this can get access to. It's for those upfront things they might need, like food, water, diapers, et cetera. But after that, there are opportunities to get additional assistance, temporary housing assistance, access to a hotel room, a range of other things.

They are taking place and obviously that mission over the next day or two is going to transition into life sustainment. And part of the -- part of the thing that's going to be really difficult to manage when you take a hit like this is everybody wants to rush back into the areas to check on their homes and rightfully so.In many cases, it's a dangerous area and there's down power lines, there's materials obviously debris everywhere. So it takes some time for responders and communities to get the debris out of the way, open up the roads so that people can be allowed back in. And then once that starts to take place, you'll start to see some of the initial recovery -- recovery efforts and then eventually bleeding into the long-term community recovery efforts.",

But again, what they've got to be able to do is the first pushed debris to open up the highways and secondary roads to be able to get these trucks in to some of these locations. And then hopefully, the gas stations are operational. You know, did they have passed power generator, backup? So there's a lot that's got to take place and I wish we could just flip a switch and get things to work in the infrastructure, but that's just not the case after traumatic hit like this.",

It's disasters or locally executed, state- managed, federally supported and they all have to work together.So when people say, where's FEMA? The systems working FEMA is probably been on the ground with hundreds of employees in Florida because of multiple storm hits that we've seen in the past, working with Kevin Guthrie in Florida Division of Emergency Management and trying to assess what the counties need, as well as the states and then FEMA comes in to help supplement and augment state support to the counties that are hardest hit.",

So what we developed as a result of those storms was what's called community lifelines and what we've got to do as a country as we have to identify what infrastructure has to be working that if its not working, people are dying or life routine is disrupted, regardless if it's a tornado, hurricane, act of terrorism, whatever it may be.And then eventually we have to redesign the mitigation programs around public and private infrastructure to make sure that when they go down, there only down for a short time. But hopefully, we can mitigate them in the future to where they don't go down for various scenarios. And so, I really think, Jake, if we want to stop this response cycle that were in, this constant response cycle we really have to get Congress to start incentivizing proper land use planning, building codes ensuring infrastructure that's insurable and really mitigating the infrastructure that we need to work. And people get frustrated after disaster at FEMA for things that are outside of their control. For example, we don't own the power grids, you know, at FEMA. FEMA doesn't own the communications backbone, but what we do want to do is coordinate with those private sector agencies to figure out what they need to get back online.",

One saying he wants to revert back to the trade agreement that he had had between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.He talked about imposing, sweeping tariffs on imports, as well as wanting to give some sort of tax break to automakers that build their own factories here domestically. But then at one point during this two-hour or so speech, Donald Trump called Detroit, like I said, a collapsing city. He also argued it was a developing city. He said, quote, it is more developing than most places in China. He also called it a once great city. And then he used to Detroit to characterize what he argued would happen to the entire country if Kamala Harris were to win in November. Take a listen to what he said.
