Blinken is also hoping to make progress on a hostage deal as well as an end to the war in Gaza. Blinken's fifth trip to the region began in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and a two-hour long meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They discussed regional coordination to end the fighting in Gaza, as well as what comes after that. But, for now, there is no let-up in Israel's military offensive onHamas, now underway for almost four months. Palestinians in neighborhoods west of Gaza City and in Khan Younis to the south have been advised by Israel to evacuate. But, many are asking where? And with the Israeli officials again declaring the next stage of their operation set to focus around the city of Rafah in the south, fears are growing for the safety of almost 1.5 million civilians who fled there in search of relative safety.

Something was detected last month during treatment for an enlarged prostate. A source tells CNN it's not prostate cancer.

Charles will continue with state business, but other members of the royal family, including Prince William and Queen Camilla, are expected to step up their public duties.Meantime, many across the UK are offering their support to the king.

I have no doubt at all that should something arise which regards, let's say environmental policy, a huge passion of his, there will be some phone calls from his desk and a few memos being sent out.I think that what we know of him is what will guess, and people would not have it any other way. What he is not going to be doing clearly is getting out and about shaking hands and perambulating and meeting the people. That's not going to happen. He is clearly undergoing a course of treatment as we speak. Clearly, he has known about this for longer than the statement indicates. But, he will certainly be at his desk.

Chile's wildfires are not an isolated incident, as the continent faces the growing impact of climate change, particularly from El Nino, a natural phenomenon characterized by warmer than average waters in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe. Compounded with a drought the country has been facing for years, the wildfires were lethal. December through February are the peak months of the fire season in Chile.

But the Ukrainians say they've been extremely effective at attacking Russia's Black Sea fleet and even sinking warships.PLEITGEN (voice-over): \"The main thing is to feel the drone,\" 13 says. \"Not everyone can hold a firm grip. If you squeeze a little, you can lose control of the drone. I would say it's like working with jewelry.\" Asymmetrical warfare, they call it, and the Ukrainians, outmanned and outgunned, say they need to do a lot more of it. After visiting the Southern front this weekend, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Italian media he not only plans to fire his top general, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, there could be a larger government shakeup. A front runner to become the new commander in chief, the defense intel boss, known for brazen attacks against Russian military and infrastructure targets. \"The Russians are waking up at night to explosions,\" he says. \"Explosions in the air, explosions directly at the facilities. They see the real picture of war. They see burning oil depots, destroyed buildings and factories, and so on. This is all beneficial.\" And the Ukrainians vow to continue hunting Russian military vessels in this battle of David versus Goliath on the high seas. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in Southern Ukraine.

More now from CNN's Marc Stewart, reporting in from Beijing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Parts of China at a standstill during one of the most treasured times of year. Cars are stuck. Some highways look like parking lots. There is such desperation people are doing whatever they can to chip away the ice-covered pavement. It's all part of a winter blast hitting as hundreds of millions of travelers head home for the lunar new year holiday. Tang Zitao is in the middle of it. TANG ZITAO, TRAVELER (through translator): This journey has been too long, and it is indeed a torture. STEWART (voice-over): He told me his six-hour drive is now taking more than 24 hours.",

It has melted a little, but it then turned into ice. So the road is very wet and slippery. STEWART (voice-over): He is one of many on a treacherous journey that has left some travelers stranded without food and water. \"Who needs warm water?\" this little girl asks as she goes car to car with her mother, other villagers offer noodles and porridge from over the fence. It's not any easier if you're taking the train. It's packed inside the station in central China as passengers deal with delays. Much of this mess a flashback to 2008, when blizzards left 24 people dead and hundreds of thousands of people stranded. Yet, there's a spirit of determination to make it home. ZITAO (voice-over): No matter what, always head home for the spring festival. It is a Chinese tradition. STEWART (voice-over): A tradition that could be hindered by unforgiving forces of nature.
