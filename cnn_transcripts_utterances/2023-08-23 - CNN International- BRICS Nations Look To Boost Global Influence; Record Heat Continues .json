The summit continues for a second date, and we are live in Johannesburg for you. An extreme heat wave is fueling deadly wildfires in Greece. We'll tell you when they might see some respite. And waiting for a lunar landing, India is counting down to fulfilling a long held ambition. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin lashed out at the west during a fiery speech at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg. He says the West's aspirations to preserve its dominance in the world led to the war in Ukraine. The speech comes on day two of the summit. Other top leaders took shots at the west as well, saying it's time to rebalance global power and to expand the BRICS influence. The leaders are entertaining formal bids from nearly two dozen countries to expand the bloc during this week's summit. Right now, the bloc's members include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. For more, let's bring in CNN's David McKenzie in Johannesburg. Just take us through the Putin speech because that sounded pretty strong.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it was definitely a typical Putin speech at this kind of forum, and, in fact, any kind of forum, Max. He did have a screed against the west, as well as blaming the Ukraine war on the west and on his necessity to defend the people of the Donbas.Now, that's something we've heard multiple times from the Russian president, of course, doesn't mesh with the reality of the situation where Russia invaded a sovereign nation. And it was quite telling, I think, with all of those leaders of the other BRICS nations seated in a circle in a very high profile public meeting, and President Putin had to stream over his comments. And it does show, I think, very clearly the isolation of the Russian president, though he does virtually have a seat at the table, and that's important. Overall, there was a lot of talk of rebalancing the world order. We've heard that throughout these two days so far. Interestingly, now the events that were scheduled for later today have been canceled. Those leaders are now in a closed door meeting where clearly they are hashing out the details of a possible BRICS expansion. Now, if you read very carefully the statements from the various leaders, you can tell that China and Xi Jinping are very keen to expand the influence of BRICS and therefore their own influence on the world stage. More muted conversations and statements, in particular, from the Indian Prime Minister Modi, who said that any agreement needs to be by consensus. Xi Jinping gave an unusually robust statement. Here's what he had to say about the international financial system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translation): International rules must be written and upheld jointly by all countries based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter rather than dictated by those with the strongest muscles or the loudest of voice. Ganging up to form exclusive groups and packaging their own rules as international norm is even more unacceptable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you.Now, record shattering heat continues across southern and western Europe where extreme temperatures are fueling devastating wildfires in at least two countries. In Greece, emergency helicopters are desperately trying to extinguish the fast moving flames amid dry and dangerously windy conditions. Dozens of wildfires are burning out of control for a fifth straight day. They spread to neighboring Turkey, where hundreds of people were evacuated from a northwestern border province. Derek Van Dam joins us now from the CNN Weather Center. We're speaking to Rolaney (ph), who was on the ground out there in Greece, just outside Athens.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, those are some pretty compelling visuals. I was also watching our colleague Eleni as she was on some of the front lines of one of the 65 fires that have erupted across Greece here within the past several days.Now, this is just one of them that's located just northwest of Athens where Eleni is located. And it's visible from space. And you can see just how quickly the smoke is drifting across the Gulf of Corinth, across this region. Here is how fast the fire has spread. You can see from the mountainside all the way down to the ocean basically running out of room to burn. So what is causing this? Well, we have extremely high temperatures, above average temperatures for many locations. We talk about a heat wave. It's centralized across the southern Mediterranean, and that includes places like Athens northward. And we're looking closely at what is called the soil moisture. Not only does the low soil moisture here indicated with the shades of brown and tan indicate a very dry, brittle vegetation that is often easily combustible, but dry soils often warm more quickly during the course of the day versus wet soil. So that is also adding fuel to the mix. And not to mention the increasing winds across this area out of the northeasterly direction. And they're not really going to abate anytime soon. And unfortunately, just talked to my producer, we don't see any real rainfall on this forecast as well. So even though the temperatures come down a notch over the next couple of days into the weekend to right about average in Athens, we still expect the dry conditions to persist along with the winds. Now it's not just across Greece. We have our heat wave expanding across much of Italy into the Balkan states. In France, we've had over 100 records set or tied just yesterday alone. There is some relief in sight across the western sections of Europe. Look at Marseille, you can see temperatures, the mercury thermometer start to go down into the weekend as a subtle cold front starts to edge in. Some relief from the north and west. But we do believe more heat is on the docket here for the end of the month. Max?",

Eight of Donald Trump's Republican rivals will be taking to the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But the big story is that Trump himself has refused to attend the event. He has overwhelming leads in the polls and says voters already know him, so he doesn't need to debate. It's expected that most of the candidates will refuse to attack the former president and instead battle with each other. Sources tell CNN that Rudy Giuliani is planning to surrender today at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta. He still has to work out a bond agreement with prosecutors. We expect him to leave for New York -- leave New York, rather, for Georgia at any time. Most of the accused have negotiated bond agreements and at least four have already surrendered to police.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. In addition to being an appeal to the American people, I think it's safe to say that was also an appeal to one man, and that's Donald Trump. A lot of what we heard from Rudy Giuliani just now is almost word for word what we've been seeing from Donald Trump in his social media post over the last several days and sort of a bold strategy by Giuliani to tie himself -- attempt to tie himself directly to the former president.They are both co-defendants in this case, in this indictment facing criminal charges. And I think overall, regardless of what Rudy Giuliani was just saying about liars and his truth telling history, is that it doesn't change the fact that he did confirm he is traveling to Atlanta today and where sources have told us that he's expected to meet with the district attorney and negotiate a bond agreement and then surrender to authorities here. And so Rudy Giuliani probably one of the most bold faced names in this indictment. He was the former president's then personal attorney, and he really headed up a lot of the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And then the indictment from DA Fani Willis here in Georgia really details how Rudy Giuliani was involved, allegedly in nearly every phase of the effort to overturn the election. I think I'm going to go back to what Rudy Giuliani was saying about how he's always told the truth and everyone else has lied. I would say that Rudy Giuliani has consistently said the 2020 election was stolen and yet has never produced any evidence to prove that point. So a little bit of a window into the very polarized and partisan, but also, you know, traction we're gaining here in Atlanta as these defendants arrive and start to surrender.",
