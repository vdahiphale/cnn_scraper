We'll break down each of their strengths and weaknesses headed into the final stretch of the campaign.Plus, end this war. That was President Biden's message in his final speech to the United Nations. Saying, innocent people in both Israel and Gaza are going through hell, as he tries to jump start the push for a cease fire deal. And Donald Trump is headed south to talk about an issue. He hopes will define this race as Kamala Harris tries to cut into his lead on the economy with the endorsement of more than 400 economists and policymakers. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, six weeks, 42 days. Election Day is right around the corner. And in some states, voters are already headed to the polls. But Donald Trump is delivering some mixed messages about early voting, encouraging it in one breath, and then pushing baseless conspiracies about doing so in another. Here's what he said last night in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Early voting begins in Pennsylvania over the next two weeks, and we need each and every one of you to go out. Just don't take anything for granted. We got to get out and vote. You can start right away. You know that right now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. Let's move the -- see these votes? We've got about a million votes in there. Let's move them. We're fixing the air conditioner in the room, right? No, it's terrible. What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we're not going to let it happen again too -- you know, too big to rig right? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's a big advantage, but it's not the 75-point advantage that Joe Biden had in the 2020 exit polls.Similar story here, even more so, among Latino voters. In our poll, Harris has a 19-percentage point advantage among likely Latino voters in this poll, but Biden in 2020 according to the exit polls, had a 33- point advantage among Latinos. And we should note, while it is getting late now, people are voting, and this race is locking into some extent. There are still persuadable voters here. So, 86 percent tell us in our poll, their mind is made up. And again, these are likely voters. 12 percent say they changed their mind, and only two percent of the people in this poll say, they don't have a first choice of a presidential candidate.

If you talk to folks in Trump world, they think they're basically in the margin of error in most of the states. They see their numbers as a little bit better than the public polls, but they know that they're behind in some of these states. They certainly see a gender gap, as you delineated there. I think what they believe is that their gender gap with men is better that they, you know, are going to do even better than that.Polling shows with men -- with black men, I guess we will see if that's true or not, but that's what you hear from them a lot. I think the way they look at where the numbers are right now is if that's a missed opportunities. You know, the month of August, by all accounts, was not his best month. The debate performance, I think most people are honest in his world would say she did better. The speech went a little too long at the convention, but that it's a tied race, and it's their race to lose still, and that he can still win. And that's optimism. I hear from their orbit, even as you see Kamala Harris doing better in a lot of ways in Joe Biden was against him.",

I'm fine on my own. And I think a lot of other women feel that way. I did think, though, that this was very interesting, because up until now, Donald Trump has fed up red meat to the base. Last night. I felt like that was a bit of an olive branch to independent women, to say suburban moms, independents. Look at me. I'm here for you. He talked about the safety of women, the health of women. I mean, there's two women in Georgia who would argue against that based on what's happened to them with regard to abortion. And you know, he's a little bit like the hands made tale to me, calling himself a protector of women. It makes you wonder what else is going to happen to women if Donald Trump is elected. [12:10:00] BASH: And Eva, let's turn to the question of immigration. And we want to give our viewers a sense of where this poll shows voters are. Who do you trust more to handle immigration? This is again among likely voters, Trump 49 percent, Harris 35 percent, neither 15 percent.

      "sentences": "So, I understand why the campaign thinks that this is a good strategy to put her down there, to essentially argue, look, I care about this issue. The former president, he was the one that squashed that bipartisan border enforcement bill. He only wants this for politics. He doesn't actually care about this issue.But I think that when you speak to voters, they really crave authenticity. They want to for all of the former president's issues, you'll often hear the caveat, well, he is who he is. The vice president has a long history, a well-documented history of really being an ally to these immigrant communities. She has two chapters in her book. I say we fight, and we are better than this, where she really makes a robust case for undocumented immigrants. During the Trump administration, she talked about a climate of fear. She dismissed the border wall as ineffective and a waste of resources. And so -- and even her guest at the joint session of Congress was a DACA recipient, was a dreamer. And so, for her to go down there and characterize herself as tough on the border, it -- to me, it isn't consistent with a lot of the policy positions that she previously has espoused. And so, I think it's really important why she was so strong. I think before the Hispanic Caucus, when she talked about the havoc, it would wreak in this country if another Trump administration enforced mass deportations, was because it felt authentic. It felt real. And so, I think that is the challenge when she engages in sort of this, this border theatrics.",

We're not hearing a lot about that, and I think she should really talk about that a lot. I totally agree with you, though, on the potential flip flopping, but she doesn't have a choice right now.She's 15 points down on immigration. She has to own this narrative. She has to try to take it back. And one way she does it is to also talk about that bipartisan bill that Trump completely killed.

And the senators aren't doing it.I mean, they are saying, we're not. They want -- the key senator yesterday came out and said, he was not changing his position, which led Trump to then attack him on Truth Social as a grandstander. But it was an effort to make it easier to get a path to 270 for Trump and to get these votes. And it's sort of interesting to me because Trump has been able to strong arm. So many people in the Republican Party, even people who really don't like him to do whatever he wants. But the state senators in Nebraska just said, no. They stood up and said, no.",

He urged world leaders not to grow weary.In the Middle East, where U.S. officials have raised some doubts about whether Israel and Hamas truly want to reach a cease fire deal. President Biden called on Israel and Hamas to accept the terms that the U.S. and Egypt and Qatar have negotiated. And with Hezbollah, he urged them to accept a diplomatic detente, which he says is the only option going forward. But perhaps in the most poignant moment of this speech, Dana, President Biden talked about his personal decision, not to seek re- election in November, and had a message for autocrats in particular when he said some things are more important than staying in power, and that's the people -- those are the people you serve, Dana?",
