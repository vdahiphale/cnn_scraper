The president is absolutely not considering stepping aside even as an ally tells CNN that the president has privately acknowledged it has moves over the next several hours and days will determine whether he can salvage his reelection bid. Furious attempt to quell some panic inside the Democratic Party since Thursday's debate involves radio interviews, calls with congressional leaders, convening governors at the White House and preparing as well for a network interview. Will it be enough? We should note that the president himself commented on this today at a campaign stop saying the following: Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can and is simply and straightforward as I can. I am running. We begin with CNN's Stephen Collinson. Stephen, an ally told CNN today about what it would take for the president to acknowledge his campaign is not working. And that is a scenario in which the polls are plummeting, the fundraising is drying up, and the interviews are going badly. He's not oblivious. But I have to say, Stephen, you've already hit some of those marks, have you not? Perhaps not plummeting, but the polls certainly do not look good. They didn't look good prior to the debate, some of them look worse since. And there are genuine public questions from members of his own party.",

That's up to 74 percent, not too dissimilar from what but CNN polling found among Democrats and eight point swing on that question since the debate. It's interesting, Molly Ball, the ifs that CNN's reporting is that the Biden team has set up is if polls are plummeting, if fundraising dries up -- I mean, that's defining bad in a fairly extreme term, right?

Because a week ago, the plan was the debate.

There's a whole lot of different forks in the road that would emerge depending on what he does and how he does it.

Certainly something that we have not seen in my lifetime, and something that we've seen very rarely over the course of this country's history. I should note that to that question, resigning the presidency if that's at all on the table, Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about that, the press briefing and immediately took that off the table as absolutely not under consideration.
