And what is clear is that some missiles, either after being intercepted or not intercepted at all, struck ground. We certainly saw some impacts here in Tel Aviv. Our Jeremy Diamond visited the crater impact site from another one and others have been visible around the country.Thankfully, no deaths inside Israel. One death reported in the West Bank could have been much worse, no question. But it does appear that some may have hit, if not their target, but they hit Israeli territory. Right now, our understanding is that the cabinet is making a decision as to how Israel is going to respond. They made quite clear they will respond. They call this a serious attack, and they say it will have serious consequences, and that response is likely to include an attack on Iran. So the question becomes, what in Iran? Is it oil facilities? Could it be nuclear facilities? It's quite clear that those options are at least on the table. It is not clear if Israel chooses to strike those targets, but we have been told that a decision could made and could be made, and perhaps even the action could take place, Wolf, as soon as tonight.",

And earlier today, President Biden was asked about both what he saw as the appropriate response by Israel and the appropriate consequences for Iran, and he suggested that both of those were currently live discussions with no decisions made. But when he was sitting there in the Roosevelt Room with his cabinet for a meeting that was preplanned to discuss the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, I asked him if he had a chance to speak to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he said, I'll be talking to him, and my message will depend on what we finally conclude is needed. Now, the White House has been swift to describe this attack as defeated and ineffective, thanks in no small part, to the coordination between Israel and the U.S. and other partners in the region.But the question is, what happens from here? Because the Biden administration has been working feverishly for the better part of a year behind the scenes to try to reach a diplomatic solution, all while assuring Israel that it would assist in its defense, but urging it not to escalate the situation into a wider war. The administration has appeared more frustrated and conflicted in recent weeks as some of this escalation has taken place and Israel has ramped up its operations on Hamas and Hezbollah targets. So, it is unclear exactly how the U.S. will come down on this, and whether their suggestions to the Israelis will eventually be heated, Wolf.",

He's a former Israeli National Security Adviser, retired U.S. Army, Lieutenant General, Mark Hertling is with us, and Seth Jones, National Security Expert and Senior Vice President over at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And Eyal, let me start with you. Israel now saying there will be a, quote, \"significant response\" to what Iran has done after it fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. What do you think that response potentially could look like? EYAL HULATA, FMR. ISRAELI NATL. SECURITY ADVISER, SERVED IN MOSSAD INTEL AGENCY: Well, Wolf, you know, this is the second time that Iran has fired such a massive attack on Israel. I happen to be on your show after the April 13 attack as well, which was unprecedented. This is the second time they do this. Israel has responded very minorly, I would say symbolically, after the attack of April 13, this was a part of the consultation between the U.S. and Israel to do something that was meaningful, that would prove to Iran that we can penetrate their defense systems, but would not drag the region into a full escalation of war. Iran just did this, and I think important to have everyone understand, unprovokedly, Israel did not attack Iran. Israel has conducted its attacks in Lebanon very surgically, only on the leaders in the operatives and Iran decided to fire some 200 ballistic missiles in Israel. Israel has a very good defense systems and a good collaboration with the U.S., so the outcome is very minor. But Iran intended to do something very substantial and major, and to inflict not only a lot of damage on infrastructure, but potentially to kill many civilians. So of course, Israel has to respond. What exactly that response will be, and I will leave to the cabinet to decide. I'm sure that all of these security establishments are putting all the options in front of the cabinet to make their decision. But Wolf, if I may, I think the question about the response needs also to come to the United States of America, not only to Israel. We heard Jake Sullivan, my dear friend and former colleague, say that there will be severe consequences to Iran. I think he may have meant not only severe consequences on behalf of Israel, but also on behalf of the United States. Iran has violated all of the norms. Iran has violated all of its obligations. President, United States said don't so many times, and yet they do this time and again. So there must be a response, and Iran must be pulled back or pushed back to their place where they cannot do this again and think they can and get unpunished and unharmed.",

      "sentences": "General Hertling, let me get your response, because the Iranian president is now saying this Iranian ballistic missile strike against Israel was, in the Iranian president's words, \"only a portion of our power,\" end quote. What else might Iran or its proxies, for that matter, do in addition to this ballistic missile attack? [17LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), FMR. ARMY COMMANDING GENERAL, EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY: Well, Wolf, first, what I'd say is the proxies of Iran have been hurt tremendously over the last several months, and especially Hezbollah over the last several weeks. The proxies are in Iran's forward presence. They are the ones that do the fighting. Iran attacked today because they thought they needed to, first of all, to support their proxies, but also to get domestic support for the Shah within Iraq, I'm sorry for the Khamenei within Iran. What I'd suggest is 180 missiles today, ballistic missiles that are very difficult to push down Israel probably fired a whole lot more than 180 arrow or David's Slings weapons to knock them out of the sky. So this was certainly an overwhelming force by Iran, much more than we've seen before. Iran has close to estimates of 3,000 of these ballistic missiles. This was an element of that, and they could certainly do more. I think incumbent upon Israel to respond to all of this. They will do so in a time and matter of their choosing, but Iran has an over mad capability in ballistic missiles. They don't have much else in their military, and their proxies have been hurt over the last couple of months, so we're going to see a very dangerous situation right now as Israel responds, I believe, in not a proportional manner, it is going to be a much greater than proportional manner. They are going to have the assistance of the United States in defending is the territory of Israel with some of the Navy ships that are in the region that have great air defense capability. But there was a significant effort today by Iran to breach the Israeli defense systems, and it was borderline whether or not they did that today. They could certainly do worse, and I'm hoping that we can continue to tamp this down so there isn't a full scale regional war in the area.",

VICE PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTL. STUDIES: Well, I think it was a failure by Iran to hit any targets. I suspect part of what the Iranians were also doing is signaling that they have the capability, in this case, ballistic missiles, to conduct strikes. As we've seen over the last few weeks, Hezbollah's command and control capabilities have been severely degraded. Hezbollah also has ballistic missiles, both guided and unguided. The fact that we haven't seen Hezbollah fire back, I think does say something about what Hezbollah is capable of doing or actually incapable of doing at this point. So Iran is the response. It has failed to hit any meaningful targets in Israel. But I think we're likely to see more of this over the next several days and weeks, Wolf. And really, there's going to be a lot of work that the U.S. Navy is going to have to do with its Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and a range of air defense that the U.S. is going to provide in the region.",

That he has debated more, that he has more of a public persona and we know that actually J.D. Vance has been preparing with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, someone who's also from Minnesota, someone who has known Walz for 10 years. But on top of that, actually studied all of Walz's past debate performances as well as public appearances, trying to get down his mannerisms, the way he pivots particularly I'm told by these advisors trying to make sure that they present a person or a person for J.D. Vance to practice against who would not dissuade or move Vance away with his kind of, quote unquote, folksy charm. That is something they believe that could be disarming for J.D. Vance. But all in all with all these level of setting, with all these expectation management, I am told that they feel like they're in a really good place.

On the issues as it retains on Russia and its invasion of Ukraine as it also pertains to Chinese aggression in the South Chinese Sea including with anchors on our very network.We have not seen our Governor Walz have to answer those tough question. And I'm a bit skeptical if the Governor even has the experience to answer those questions thoroughly enough to convince the American people that if Vice President Harris were to become president, and God forbid, something occurred or happened to her and Walz had to step in, can this guy actually do the job?

They want somebody who is not going to be throwing out inflammatory rhetoric in a moment when, you know, these things can turn on a -- on -- on a dime. So, you know, I actually think the backdrop of -- of what's going will give Governor Walz an opportunity to really showcase the contrast. I mean remember when Donald Trump was President, you know, he was kowtowing to Kim Jong-un. He was standing next to Vladimir Putin and saying he trusted Putin over our own intelligence agencies.

They've -- they destabilized the entire Middle East, funded the enemies of Israel.J.D. Vance needs to every five minutes try to get back to Tim Walz voted to give Iran $10 billion. That -- that's the -- that's the trick tonight. It's not to insight your own base on Twitter, it's to drive home a point that matters that swings voters and that's the task. SIMMONS: You know, Wolf, I will say the one thing about a night like tonight, a day like today is it kind of wipes away from the table some of the silly arguments we've been having in this campaign. These made up arguments about immigrants are doing in Ohio or all the silly things they're saying about Tim Walz's masculinity. It really puts all that stuff into context because now we're talking the American people. We're talking about the Israeli people. We're talking about kind of America's role in the world.

And -- and what you get in a second Trump administration versus what you get in a Harris administration.I'm not sure J.D. Vance is going to do that as much, it seems that if you take and listen to what he's been saying on the campaign trail about Walz, I would imagine we're going to get a more aggressive posture from Vance trying to take it to Walz on his biography and -- and issues that have come up about him on the campaign trail. AUDIE CORNISH, ANCHOR &amp; HOST, THE ASSIGNMENT WITH AUDIE CORNISH PODCAST: These are also two figures who if you think about it have been incredibly effective, for better or worse, messengers for their campaign. Vance has been out there doing dozens of interviews, left and right, representing the Trump ticket. And Walz is the person who's the roots of the weird talking point that Democrats started to use and mask.
