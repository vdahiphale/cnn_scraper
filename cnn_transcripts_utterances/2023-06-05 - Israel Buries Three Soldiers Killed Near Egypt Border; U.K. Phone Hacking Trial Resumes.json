The two countries say they are working together to determine what happened in spite of conflicting counts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling for a full investigation.

      "sentences": "Yes. This is a highly unusual incident on a border that compared to the other borders that Israel shares with other countries is relatively quiet and safe for drugs and weapons smuggling.What we know is that Saturday morning, after two soldiers who were manning a guard post along the border -- when they didn't respond to a check-in that prompted backup to come check in on them and that's when these two soldiers' bodies were found shot to death. That triggered a manhunt. And then, Israeli soldiers encountered what turned out to be an Egyptian security officer and an ensuing gun battle. Both the Egyptian security officer and a third Israeli soldier were killed. Now, Israeli officials believe that this Egyptian security officer crossed the border by using an emergency opening. It's a small -- probably two-meter by two-meter square in the fence that was actually held together only by those plastic rings that he -- so it's likely that he cut those open somehow with a knife, entered the territory, killed those two soldiers, and then he, of course, was ultimately killed. Now, the Egyptian security officials say that this security personnel was chasing drug smugglers. He breached a security barrier and exchanged fire. So slightly conflicting reports of what happened. There are still unanswered questions why if the security officer was chasing drug smugglers. Was he by himself? Why did he not notify Israeli officials about what he was doing? Because Egypt and Israel have peace? They work together to try to thwart drugs and weapon smugglings along this border. Now, the officials from both countries say that they are cooperating together to find out exactly what happened in this situation. And it is clear from the messaging we're hearing from both sides they do not want this to turn into a bigger incident. We are hearing from the Israeli defense forces saying this is a very unusual incident that does not represent the relationship and joint action between the two countries -- Rahel.",

And it took all heart, all gas, no brakes in an epic fourth quarter to rally back in game two.But they got off to a rocky start in Denver. The Nuggets stealing the show in the first half on a 33-9 run. Max Strus whacks Jamal Murray in the head but he still throws down and tells Strus to get on up out of here afterwards. How about Nikola Jokic, though? Seven-foot, 285 pounds of runaway walrus just rambling his way to 41 points, joining LeBron and Larry Bird as the only players with 500 points, 200 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single post-season. But here come the Heat. They're unlikely heroes rising again. Duncan Robinson mean-mugging, scoring all 10 of his points in the fourth. Then Bam Adebayo with authority. After the game one loss, Jimmy Butler said they needed to pressure the rim -- attack more. Enough said. But the Nuggets still had a chance with 15 seconds to go. No timeouts called. Murray just takes the shot and it doesn't drop. Miami scores 36 in the fourth to win 111-108, pulling off their seventh double-digit comeback in this post-season. That ties for the most in any single playoffs in the last 25 years. Here's Butler. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The European markets mostly flat at this hour. Eurozone business growth slowed in May as factories really struggled in the region. Asian markets up this morning. European exchanges mixed, as I said. On Wall Street, though, the picture is a bit more mixed. You can see Nasdaq futures are off -- let's call it one-third of a percent -- but Dow futures and the S&amp;P are up fractionally. Markets, though, are coming off a positive week after a strong jobs report and a critical debt ceiling agreement. The Dow and Nasdaq finishing two percent higher. The S&amp;P notching its best week since March. On inflation watch, meantime, gas prices held steady overnight at $3.52 (sic) per gallon. Data on U.S. factory orders, consumer credit numbers, and weekly jobless claims all on tap this week. We'll also keep a close eye on Apple's annual developers conference that happens later today. And while some products have gotten cheaper at the grocery store lately, Americans are still feeling inflation hit their wallets. According to the USDA, food prices are predicted to increase 6.2 percent in 2023. And one item in the spotlight, beef. A recent Wall Street Journal article noting that beef prices have climbed 20 percent since 2020 -- 20 percent -- and that they could go even higher. Let's bring in Bernt Nelson. He's an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Bernt, good morning and welcome to the program. So you know this industry inside and out. Let's talk about beef prices first. What are the main causes that are increasing the price here? BERNT NELSON, ECONOMIST, AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION (via Webex by Cisco):  So, to look at the price rises we've first got to start with supply and demand, and supplies have really tightened up in the last couple of years. We've had some profitability issues stemming from drought and inflation and they led us to where we're at today.",

That pushed feed prices up early on -- a year back. And now here we are today. We're looking at drought issues kind of continuing in some core production regions, so supply costs like feed are way up for producers. This caused a profitability pinch.So drought and profitability have caused a lot of guys to really burn into their equity that they've spent their entire lives building. And when this happens people start to get out while the going is good. So that's why we've had a lot of cattle going to market and a reduction in cattle supplies, which results in tighter beef supplies.",
