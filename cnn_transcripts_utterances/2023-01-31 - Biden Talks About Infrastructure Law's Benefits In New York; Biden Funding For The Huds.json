Today, he traveled to New York where he spoke about funding for the Hudson Tunnel to improve the rail commute between New York and New Jersey.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: For too long we've talked about assertive American leadership once again building the best economy in the world, but to have the best economy in the world you have to have the best infrastructure in the world. People don't build factories that are not rail stations, where they're not ports, where they're not access to highways, they don't attract businesses unless you have the best infrastructure. To get products to market, to create thousands of good-paying jobs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the most responsible thing to do is that we sit down. We've got time period between now and June, and we find places that we could find savings for the American public. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, the president says, as part of these debt ceiling talks, the negotiations, cuts are off the table. But the president, then as vice president in 2011, led the talks for the White House on this very subject. And I want to read what he said at the end of the negotiations. He clearly valued them, the statement from his office, as the president and I have made clear from the beginning, the only way to make sure we begin to live within our means is by coming together behind a balanced approach that finds real savings across the budget, including domestic spending, defense spending, mandatory spending and loopholes in the tax code. We owe it to the American people to take every responsibility step to do right by our economy and the nation's future. That's part of the debt talks in 2011.Are those values and virtues not important this time around? BEDINGFIELD: As president, he has put forward a program that has cut the deficit and that has put in place programs that are growing the economy, that are creating jobs, that are growing wages. As you just saw, he's in New York talking about how we are fixing tunnels and bridges and roads that are helping communities all across the country. He's done all that while living by those values, of fiscal responsibility, lowering the deficit. And what's going to ask Speaker McCarthy tomorrow is, are we going to see a plan from you that does the same? Be candid with the American people about where you want to make these cuts. What he's not willing to do is jeopardize the progress that we've made over the course of the last two years in bringing our economy to a more stable and growing place by playing these political games around the debt limit. So, that's a big piece of the conversation that he is going to have directly with the speaker tomorrow.",

We put out multiple statements from the president's personal attorney describing the process and being clear that the president takes this seriously, and that he cooperated and will continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department in full.And, you know, the other thing I would say while we are on this topic is, you know, over the weekend, CBS had a poll out that showed that the majority of Americans think President Biden is handling this well, and we've also seen that it hasn't impacted his approval ratings because while he absolutely takes this seriously and continues to cooperate, he's also continuing to focus on things that matter in peoples' lives, like visiting the tunnels today that is finally getting those infrastructure dollars after so many years of not being to get it done.",

      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, Victor, you know, the Fed is still in the middle of this war on inflation, but we have gotten some signs recently that maybe the Fed is starting to get the upper hand here. Because we know inflation itself has actually cooled off. The jobs market remains sturdy. And today, we learned that wages are slowing down a bit.So, wages up by 1 percent in the fourth quarter. That was a slight slowdown from the third quarter. Slower than expected. Year over year the wave growth stayed at just over 5 percent. Now, it's worth noting that wages are still hot here historically. I mean, this is like twice the pace of the pre-COVID era of wave growth, but they are not going straight up anymore, which, I think, you can see on the chart. And that is exactly what the Fed wants to see. Because Fed chair, Jerome Powell, his big fear is a wage price spiral, right, where high prices at the grocery store cost consumers to demand higher and higher wages, which force companies to pass on the clause through higher prices. It can become a negative feedback loop and can lead to runaway inflation. So, today's report is encouraging because it suggests that is not happening here. Of course, from a worker perspective, you can't be happy about the idea that wages are not going up by that much because you are not keeping up with inflation. And so, perhaps, that's one reason why we learn that consumer confidence took a bit of a hit in January. The biggest declines for consumer confidence were felt by families, low-income families and those under the age of 35. And those, of course, are two groups that are really exposed to the cost- of-living.",

Clayton, good to have you. I read your piece to these anonymous thoughts from members of the Academy. And we will put one up here. I'm not going to read the whole thing. But someone said, do you know how many movies and studios break the rules? And I'm talking about blatantly e-mailing members in a chain and saying, OK, team, it's voting day. You know what to do.

So, I believe that is the problems, that they were very specific in telling people how to vote and that's what has been alleged. But unless they have a smoking gun, I don't think we're about to see her nomination rescinded, not to overbake this or overplay this, if they did rescind it without any concrete evidence, it would essentially be the end of the Academy.
