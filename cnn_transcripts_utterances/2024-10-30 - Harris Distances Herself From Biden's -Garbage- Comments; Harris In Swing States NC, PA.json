And that really is his -- his people tell me, is the most pressing thing they want to get across to voters going into these final days, something that they had hoped to make a bigger part of the campaign in the debate that these two had, and in their advertising, and in the messaging that they have delivered. And instead, it's been lost in the shuffle with all the other controversies that have come up. But today in North Carolina, he is really pushing that message.

The one that I focus on most for Pennsylvania is organized labor union members because they do vote, they do participate.They're particularly eager to vote this time. And if you're a government worker or a teacher's union member, you are voting for Harris overwhelmingly. But the people who work with their hands, the Teamsters and the trades, Donald Trump is drawing an unusual percentage among these people and it not only makes him viable in some of these states, it could be the difference. The other group I'm watching are Latinos, but we've seen a wide variety of polling there. In some cases, Harris is up by 10 points. In other polls, I've seen it up by 22. That group matters in Arizona, matters in Nevada, as well as in the industrial states. So you have to look at this by group. For Harris, nothing matters more than 18 to 29-year-old women. If she can make them a higher percentage of the total vote than they normally make up, that's her road to victory. For Donald Trump, it's key to him to ensure that his own vote turns out in record numbers, because 2020 is not enough for him. He's got to do something that he hasn't done since 2016, which is that everyone who says they support him actually go out and vote. And one last thing, the early vote right now suggests that the Republicans are doing better now than they have in either of the last two elections. I'm not convinced of whether that is cannibalizing the eventual vote on Election Day, but I tell you that it's got Democrats worried as hell, because something clearly is happening out there.",

The men are more interested in immigration. Women prioritize healthcare and they prioritize women's rights, women's health. And even in the ads, you see who she's focused on. So if it's okay for her to do that and surround yourself with women that up to now have been left out of the political process, then isn't it okay for Trump to surround himself with men who feel like they are being left out right now? In the end, Trump has been very unsuccessful in reaching out to working women. But this election may actually be determined by men in their 40s and 50s who were Democratic voters in 2016 and 2020 and simply feel like the Democratic Party has left them.
