And we're watching several breaking news stories this hour.In Russia, fast moving developments on the shooting at a Moscow area concert venue that has left more than 130 people dead. And in the U.K. and around the world shock and sadness over news that Catherine, the Princess of Wales has cancer. CNN anchor and royal correspondent Max Foster is standing by outside Buckingham Palace. I will take you there in a moment. But first, the massacre near Moscow. A short time ago, Russian state media reported that the suspected attackers are all foreign citizens. ISIS claimed responsibility for the rampage on a concert venue yesterday. The death toll rising, once again, today, to at least 133 people. And in his first video message since the attack, President Vladimir Putin called it a barbaric terrorist act. CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is monitoring developments from Berlin. Fred, good morning to you. Have authorities given any more details about the suspects in this attack?",

Of course, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack that happened late last night. They offered an additional social media post still earlier today.And then, you had the U.S. that came out and said that they have absolutely no reason to doubt ISIS has claimed of responsibility. Of course, the U.S. coming out very early. Now, the Russians have a bit of a different take on all of that. They say that they have, at this point in time, apprehended 11 individuals in total that includes the four shooters, whose they say went into that concert venue yesterday evening outside of Moscow in the town of Krasnogorsk, and started shooting up almost everybody that came across their path. The Russian saying some of those people shot at point blank, we're seeing some of the aftermath. on our screen right now. The Russians are saying as you pointed out that none of those individuals are Russian citizens. They do say, and this comes from Vladimir Putin, who went on Russian state TV earlier today that apparently these individuals tried to make a getaway to Ukraine. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): All for direct perpetrators of the terrorist attack, or those who shot and killed people were found and detained. They tried to hide and move towards Ukraine, where according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border. A total of 11 people were detained.

And so, U.S. intelligence passed the information they had about terrorist chatter about an upcoming attack in Russia. And then on March 7th, four Americans in the region, actually posted that on the embassy web site. And yes, right, as you said, Vladimir Putin came out and said, this was an attempt to destabilize, you know, Russians feelings of safety. Yesterday was the fog of war. Today, what we have is the fog of propaganda. So, let's break it down. For Vladimir Putin, it's going to be very important to try and leverage this not into a massive intelligence failure, massive security, failure, confused response, but rather to make this Russia's October 7th. Innocent people slaughtered, and who better to push that blame to even tacitly than to the Ukraine. So, we're seeing that unfold now, in a mix of propaganda, but also information coming from official channels and Putin himself. From the U.S. standpoint. ISIS claimed responsibility through -- for this, through its official channels, but out more material today, and has a history of animosity towards Russia, going back to the Russian bombing of its camps and fighters in Syria on behalf of Bashir Assad, its actions in the caucuses against the Chechens and other Muslims in the region. So, it fits, but we're going to see a tug of war in the propaganda space right now.",

He's certainly not really concerned about, you know, the loss of -- the loss of Russian life. You know, if that were the case, he wouldn't be sending tens of thousands -- hundreds of thousands of young Russian men to die for no good reason on Ukrainian front line. So, that's not his main concern.His main concern is that he's got a deal with the Russian people. And the deal goes something like this. Russian society is prepared to say, look, we don't need all of the -- all of these freedoms that they have in the West. You know, these things that you guys call elections, they are not really elections in Russia, but that's fine. We're not going to speak out too strongly against that, and in return for a limiting of those civil liberties that we're used to in the West. Putin is supposed to provide security. So, when he fails to do that, as he clearly did in this case, and it's made worse by the fact that he knew about it beforehand, from intelligence, that could cause the Russian people to say a whole lot of second, how come we're being repressed when we try to protest? How come people like Navalny are dying, and all these resources are going to control these sort of so-called opposition forces, and we can't even go to a concert without getting slaughtered? That gets into that -- it starts to erode that agreement between Putin and Russian society. And that's what I think he's got to be very worried about right now.",

And they finally did it at 2:00 a.m. It now heads to the president's desk where he's expected to sign it. So, we're not expecting to see any lapse in federal funding. This bill funded the remaining government agencies. So, that includes the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services, among others. So, now, that the government is funded through this fiscal year, we can just take a step back and realize how chaotic and tumultuous this was. We always knew it was going to be challenging to fund the government in a divided Congress. But this really was next level. Republicans have such a small majority in the House and Democrats control the Senate. And what made this really challenging was Republicans tried to put a number of partisan policies into these appropriations bills, which set up a stalemate and long painstaking negotiations with the Senate. So, we saw lawmakers passing this short-term extension is usually, right up until the 11th hour, until we got to this point. I mean, think about it. Kevin McCarthy essentially lost his job for his handling of this back in October, when Republicans ousted him as Speaker. House Speaker Mike Johnson now is facing a threat from Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene over his handling of the appropriations process. We'll have to see how that plays out. But now that lawmakers have funded the government through the end of this fiscal year, they have time to reflect before they have to do it all again soon, Fred.",

He was on a monoclonal antibody. And those are very tailored types of chemo. So the traditional ones, like you're mentioning with an IV port are still around and still very effective. So we've come a long way, though, side effects are better tolerated, because we have medications and treatments, you know, women don't lose their hair as much because we have these caps that can help them.So we have come a long way. But I think it's very, you know, it's very informative to us that she's sharing with us what she's going through. And chemotherapy is part of it.",

But I think human nature, is there still a lot of questions about abdominal surgery. That could be a lot of stuff. There's a lot of soft tissue in there, right? You've got stomach, you've got liver, you've got pancreas, you've got reproductive health, any -- and all of those areas could be impacted, I guess the target of abdominal surgery and thereby a discovery of cancer.",

      "sentences": "Correct. So it sounds like she had something going on. They went in, did the surgery, whatever it was, remove whatever part of an organ or whatever was wrong. And when we do surgery, I do this, we take the tissue, we send it to pathology. They will then look under the microscope and diagnose what's going on. And this happens where it was a bit of a surprise clearly that they thought it was non-cancerous and it turned out to be cancerous.So it then changes what happens going forward, obviously. So had it been benign, process tumors, she probably would obviously need chemo. And this was turned out to be a cancer and sometimes we do miss it. There are also tumors that can be borderline where they cannot be a cancer but then turn into one or be one that you're worried about that maybe if you left it in longer, it could have become a malignancy. So she could be dealing with something like that. Could be ovarian, uterine, could be colon. But I think what's another thing that's important I think her coming out helps us with this. We've seen a lot more cancer in younger people.",

Go to your health care provider, get those cancer screenings, know your family history, because that's something that can really impact getting cancer at a younger age. I think living a healthy lifestyle. Definitely don't smoke, exercise, be active and eat a healthy diet can all help us try to figure out, you know, ways to reduce cancer risk. But also those are things I think young people need to focus on because we are seeing more cancer in people below 50.",
