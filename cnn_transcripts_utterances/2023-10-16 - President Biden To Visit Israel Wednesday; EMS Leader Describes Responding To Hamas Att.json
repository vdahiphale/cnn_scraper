And welcome to THE SOURCE.We start with breaking news, here tonight, as President Biden will be going to Israel, on Wednesday, a critical trip that comes at a critical time. The major announcement was just made, by the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, following the nearly eight-hour long meeting that he had, with Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his Wartime Cabinet that he has recently formed. This trip, for President Biden, is going to amount, to a massive show of support, for America's closest ally, in the Middle East. But it is also going to be extremely high stakes, both politically and security wise. Secretary Blinken previewed part of what will be on President Biden's agenda, when he lands, in the grieving nation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: Aides have told CNN that the President expressed a strong interest, in making this trip, after he was invited, over the weekend, by Prime Minister, Netanyahu. For more, on this breaking news, I want to go straight to CNN's Anderson Cooper, who is live, in Tel Aviv. Anderson, obviously, this is a massive development, one that we knew the White House had been weighing. It will certainly be seen as a sign of solidarity. But it also comes as President Biden has been warning other groups, other countries, not to take advantage, of what is happening, on the ground, in Israel, right now.",

And right before she left to Israel, she dropped off this pink prayer book. And in it, she inscribed a little note that states that \"This is for your daughter, Hannah (ph), with love from both of us, Judith, and Natalie.\" The fact that someone, who lives next door to us, and is a part of our community, is a hostage, in Israel, makes the devastation, and the pain, and the grief, that all Jews around the world are feeling, that much more real, and brings it home, in a way --",

We're learning more about what has been happening, on the ground, what he is going to learn more about, when he's there, the horrors of Hamas' attack, and the first responders, who were there, racing to help the victims, as that day unfolded. And joining me now is Eli Beer, the Founder and President of United Hatzalah, the largest emergency medical service, in Israel, whose volunteers were among the first people, to respond, to the attack, by Hamas. Eli, I'm so grateful you're here, tonight, because you're personally there, you're responding to this. Can you just kind of describe to me what you've been seeing? ELI BEER, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, UNITED HATZALAH: Well, I'm involved with life-saving, for the last 35 years. I started volunteering on a back of an ambulance when I was 15-years-old. In my first terrorist attack, I was just a couple of days, after starting volunteering, it was a terrorist, stabbing people, in Jaffa Street in Jerusalem. And if you take 35 years, and you put them all combined together, of the most horrific terrorist attacks, in the restaurants, in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, in the bus bombings, and all the other terrible tragedies that I saw, all combined together, it's nothing compared to what I saw, in the last 10 days. And the first day was, it was horrific. Unfortunately, after being part of this, in the first day, and my wife, Gitty, who is a paramedic, and my daughters and my settlements (ph), were all there, rescuing people, seeing little babies chopped up to pieces, seeing how these terrorists, the Hamas terrorists, who are so evil, they just wanted to kill any Jewish person, no matter who they are, how old they are. And they were going from babies, to the mothers, to the fathers, and grandparents, and then shooting the pets, shooting little parrots, just for fun, because they're owned by Jews. And I remember seeing, hours later, when we were able to go into places, and seeing, in these little kibbutzes that were all peaceful, little villages, seeing a whole family, just murdered, and chopped, and the situation, the conditions that they were in. It's when I went out of there, and my family, my wife went out of there, we felt like we just came out of the Holocaust. That's how we felt, after one day of seeing --",

And the second one was an Arab volunteer, of United Hatzalah, Muslim, Arab volunteer from Nazareth. Nazareth, you all know from Bible. He was down there, because he was protecting these people, who were having, these young kids, who were having a fun time, in this festival. And he went to volunteer, to save, if someone gets hurt, if someone gets injured, he was there to help them. And when he saw the massacre happening, he ran over, to evict them. Instead of running away, he was running over to stop bleeding of these young kids, not knowing that you're talking about hundreds of the most horrific, terrible terrorists in the world, ISIS, Hamas, and they attacked him. And then, when they found out he was an Arab Muslim, and he was wearing the same exact vest, I'm wearing now, with the Israeli flag? We're all proud. We have Jews and Arabs, working together here, in Israel, volunteers with United Hatzalah, 7,000 people are working together, Jews and Arabs, Christians will all work. No difference.
