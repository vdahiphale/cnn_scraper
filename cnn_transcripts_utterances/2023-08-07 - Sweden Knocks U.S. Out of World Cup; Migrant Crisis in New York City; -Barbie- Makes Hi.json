BLACKWELLlist of what they need from the state to help deal with the city's dire migrant housing crisis. According to the Legal Aid Society, a judge set the deadline in an emergency court conference on Friday. And she also demanded the state must do more to help with the crisis.

However, we should mention that it was late last week that New York City Mayor Eric Adams closed out the week by warning that those scenes that we witnessed play out just last week at this very location could very much become quite common as the city's migrant shelter system continues to buckle under the pressure of rising numbers.We should mention, the city was eventually able to find shelter space for the individuals that were kept outside of the Roosevelt Hotel here, that's now serving as the primary intake center. And also we know that at least two recreation centers in Brooklyn are now being added to the growing list of shelters that are being used by New York City. And there's still the question of whether or not the city will turn to Central Park and temporary facilities there to serve as shelter space as the Adams administration maintains that all options remain on the table. And, finally, Victor, we should note, that this weekend marked one year since the arrival of the first migrant bus chartered by the administration of Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Since then we've seen about 10,500 asylum seekers arrive by those means. That is - sure, it's a fairly large number, but it's still just a fraction of the over 95,000 asylum seekers that have turned to the city for help. That's a number that continues to grow this morning, Victor, and which is precisely why the city continues to call from not just state but also federal assistance amid this migrant crisis. Victor.",

I mean, credit to Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul for trying to do what they can, but ultimately they don't have the resources, they don't have the expertise. They need to rely on the federal government. And the federal government needs to do a better job of coordinating here. They can't just say, well, these people are out there, you deal with them when they arrive. The federal government needs to take responsibility.And we also need to look at this sort of grand standing where, you know, this ridiculous stunt of putting people on buses and shipping them from state to state. There's responsibility there, too. I will say the Biden administration has tried to enact tougher asylum rules and make it more difficult to come here and apply for asylum once you're here.

During Covid, they shortened that to three months. And then finally this year they unified these rules for everybody.
