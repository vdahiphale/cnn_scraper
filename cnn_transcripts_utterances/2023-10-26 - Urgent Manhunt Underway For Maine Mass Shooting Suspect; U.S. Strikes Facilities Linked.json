And he's armed, he's dangerous, the gunman who killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine. Law enforcement is urgently searching for Robert Card, the person you see on the screen there, at this very moment. And we're more than 24 hours after those fateful shots rang out in a bowling alley and also at a bar and grill. It left at least 18 people dead and another 13 injured. Earlier tonight, investigators said that they detected something inside or near the home. They don't know what or who they may have been detecting. They warned on a loudspeaker at one point, come out with your hands up. There was no response. And now, Card is still on the Lewis. I mean, imagine what it would be like to be in the area of Lewiston tonight, fearing that the suspect in the killing of your neighbors, your friends, your loved ones, is out there somewhere under the cover of now darkness. The police do not know for sure where this man is right now, but they do know he's a trained firearms instructor, he's a member of the United States Army Reserves, and he is one of the best shooters in his unit who's so far completely managed to evade them. And law enforcement sources say that Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend. And so, investigators are now pursuing the theory that he went to the bowling alley and to the bar where 18 people were shot to death possibly because they were places the couple used to frequent. Can you imagine? Let me get right to CNN's Brian Todd, who was on the scene near the suspect's last known address. Brian, a dramatic scene unfolding this evening at Robert Card's house. What did you see and hear tonight?",

This occurred about 250 yards behind me where the home owned by the suspect, Robert Card, is located. Starting at about 7 p.m. Eastern time, law enforcement really just poured assets into this area, on this street, came right up to the house with tactical vehicles, armored vehicles, air assets like drones and helicopters converged upon the scene.They had several personnel on the ground. They had canine teams and other technical assets. They also -- we noticed them fanning out in a field, in a farm field, just adjacent to the house for a short period. It might have been in an effort to surround the place. At about that time, where we are, the media is at this position on a driveway overlooking this place. Law enforcement came up to us and said, you guys need to shut your lights off, your camera lights off. So, we --",

Couple of hours before that, they had shown up not with the same kind of -- kind of overwhelming presence but with some tactical vehicles and officers, and they kind of approached the house, not quite rushing it, but they approached the house, and then we heard flashbangs going off. Again, we're told that's standard procedure. When you're not sure something or someone is in there, you go in with force, you go in with flashbangs to kind of keep that element of surprise. After they did that, they kind of withdrew, and then they came back a couple of hours later.",

And it's not just Lewiston here, but it's parts of two pretty big counties totaling about 100,000 people that have been told to shelter in place.And that will extend now through tomorrow, assuming there are no dramatic developments overnight, which means that schools will be closed in these communities, a lot of businesses will be closed, banks have been closed throughout the state. L.L. Bean, as I've been talking about all day, was closed today. It's open on Christmas Day but it was closed today because of safety concerns. So, people are having to alter their lives. And by and large, they are obeying these suggestions to stay indoors. Really, the roads are mostly deserted as you drive through here. Occasionally, what you will see is, you know, a police car drive by or a sheriff's vehicle, state police. We saw investigators behind us. I'm by Schemengees Bar right here in Lewiston. And this is one of the crime scenes where eight people were killed. And we saw investigators, including FBI, going in and out all day there.

That's a river that's navigable. I mean, you can take a boat up and down that river.The Kennebec River is another river a little bit north of here. You can take a boat up and down that. We know the Coast Guard was operating on the Kennebec River, searching for this suspect today. And then not far from here, 15 miles east or so, is the Atlantic Ocean. And not just the ocean, but all kinds of inlets. As you were alluding to, there are so many cut-ins to the main coast all up and down the coast. There are a lot of possible places where he could run to and get in a boat. Now, once you're in a boat, it's a different situation in terms of being on the run. Obviously, you've got no cover from the sky. You can't hide under trees when you're in a boat. And one reason we expect that there have been so many helicopters up in the air searching, drones up in the air searching, is to have eyes on these waterways, on the rivers, and further out maybe even on the coast. The Coast Guard, very much aware of this, very much involved in the search operations now, Laura. You know, it's an all hands on deck. You know, no pun intended with the water references here, an all hands on deck search effort going on in this part of the state.",

The tactical operations specialist at the command center being led by the state police, and all the other entities are all there together, gathering every piece of evidence and every piece of lead.They're looking at -- they're talking to Army CID, Criminal Investigated Division, looking at his army life, his personal life, his online presence. Everything that he has touched within the last five to ten years, they're looking into it, thus creating the lead. So, looking into not only determine what his motive was but what his next steps were. You know, as Chris was saying, he absolutely -- he left it -- he left his vehicle at where there was a boat launch. He could have got into a second vehicle. I think the theory of him going out into the open ocean on his small boat, it's going to be a little difficult because he would need fuel. So, I think the theory of either him taking the boat downriver and then getting off where Chris was saying, where he's got, you know, supplies set up, and he can go into the woods. I also think about Eric Rudolph manhunt. He, you know, was captured by a patrol officer five years after he was put on the 10 most wanted. So, this man knows these woods. He's trained. He is expert at this -- at urban, in the woods. He can -- and he's got his weapons. So, he's a danger, but all the investigators are putting all the leads together to try and determine and get inside his mind before the events in which they occurred.",

And he has been digressing for a while, incidents at work, lost his job, supposedly broke up or had a breakup with his girlfriend, been hearing voices, just got hearing aids, and those voices were in his ear in those two places, apparently. And these are places that he frequented. So, this could be part of just a slide, a gradual slide, and then a trigger. And I think that happens very often with mass killers like this.

That's why we took the badge, that's why we took the job, is to make sure we, even if we run into a danger, that we are getting ourselves out there to prevent it from someone in the community -- an additional person getting hurt. There at that lies the sacrifice that some of these law enforcements. The most important thing is capturing and mitigating this threat, getting out there and moving through the area. Now, once they determine a location, whether it's woods or like in Pennsylvania where there's an area, that's when other assets will start focusing on that area, whether it be canine, whether it be aircraft, infrared looking down, you have also drone. So, lots of different assets are being brought in. FBI Boston, FBI Albany, I'm sure New Haven, all the other federal assets, ATF, HSI, they're all coming in. I'm sure countless law enforcement agencies in the area are flooding the area saying, how can we help? And there -- and there lies where the Incident Command Center will then start pushing them into areas once they determine leads. At this point, the investigators are out there, interviewing people, looking at data, looking at possible leads, looking at (INAUDIBLE), looking at suspicious activity, anything that could possibly provide a lead as to where he has gone. Those investigators who then develop the leads, send it back to the Incident Command Center, and then they'll start focusing the search teams in that area.",

Is this, in the narrowness of the strikes that Secretary Austin was mentioning, is this the correct approach to get that attention and get that message across?JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER U.S. MAJOR GENERAL: Well, I think the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is what we're talking about, and look, there isn't a thing that takes place in Iran that doesn't have their fingerprints on it, they're in all aspects of society and, obviously, it's a military arm as well. So, the IRGC understands clearly that we know that the linkage of what they're doing with Hezbollah as well as Hamas is crystal clear. And then their attacks after our support, U.S. support to Israel, both diplomatic support and in military presence, as Oren has laid out, is crystal clear. And so, they were going to go after U.S. presence both in Iraq and in Syria. And realize that the Syrian Democratic Forces, those forces that are fighting against the existing Syrian government, are in northeastern Syria. And the United States has been there. We've had troops on the ground since about 2016 in support of their efforts to go after ISIS. It has been very successful. The United States has drawn those numbers down to about a thousand. That's what's there right now. And this -- you know, the Shia Crescent that goes from Tehran all the way into Syria, is crystal clear, and the United States understands that we're right in the middle of a very hostile environment doing what needs to be done to keep that expansion.
