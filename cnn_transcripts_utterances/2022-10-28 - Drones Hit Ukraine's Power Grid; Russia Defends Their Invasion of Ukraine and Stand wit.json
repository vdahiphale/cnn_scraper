So, it was a nearly three hour speech of many of the usual claims, but he was interestingly at one point pressed by the moderator on the war in Ukraine on the invasion. Remember that at home, we've seen the conscription efforts cause a huge backlash. It is an unpopular invasion. We've seen those many hundreds of thousands of young Russians fleeing the country altogether. In answer, he claimed that things would only have been worse if Ukraine had been allowed to continue being armed by the west and that he'd had to act when he did. But again, a speech that comes at a time where on the ground we're seeing a much greater determination on the part of Russia after the nomination of that General Surovikin at the helm of Russian efforts in Ukraine to really take on that civilian infrastructure.

Earlier this week, they exchanged warning shots at sea, and earlier this month we saw South Korean war planes scramble in response to North Korean military jets that were inching too close in South Korea's view to their shared and highly militarized border. Fear and concern also rising about North Korea conducting another nuclear test. Even when it does, it would be the first one since 2017.

Now, despite the beautiful backdrop, the U.N. is painting a grim picture of what's at stake ahead of the meeting.So, for the second time in two days, the U.N. is sending a warning to the world's largest economies. Commitments to cut emissions are inadequate and will only reduce emissions by less than 1 percent by the end of the decade. Well, there's no easy answers of course. Agriculture accounts for nearly a third of all global emissions, mostly from equipment and transportation, which means food security has to be taken into account. But to head off a climate disaster, the IEA says the world needs to dramatically slash emissions and begin investing 4 to $6 trillion per year in alternative energies. Now, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres didn't mince words as he laid out the consequences of failure. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL:  The global and national climate commitments are falling pitifully short. The window to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is closing fast. Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by 45 percent this decade, but as today's emissions gap report confirms, they remain at dangerous and record rise and still rising. And the current policies, the world is headed for 2.8 degrees of global heating by the end of the century. In other words, we are headed for a global catastrophe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, this is such an important time for the United Nations to come out with this emissions gap report. And I want to highlight what the details are of this critical, critical report leading up to COP 27.Basically, the Emissions Gap Report, what it's doing is analyzing the pledges that countries have already made, and analyzing the difference that what is needed in order for us to curb, global warming below that 1.5 degree Celsius threshold that we agreed upon in 2015 at the Paris Climate Accord, the COP 21 Conference. We already know that since we started releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, these heat trapping gases, we have warmed since the industrial revolution, 1.2 degrees Celsius. Our goal is to limit that warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less. That's what we agreed upon over 200 nations in the Paris climate accord back in 2015. But according to this latest report, the Emissions Gap Report, it says, under our current climate policies without restriction. If we were to go forward with no major cuts in emission, we'd warm to 2.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. So, you can see the pitfalls there. And as Guterres was talking about, unfortunately we are failing pitifully, falling pitifully short of what the emissions should be looking like as we speak. And unfortunately, this leads to more devastating landscape altering wildfires, droughts, and food scarcity issues. So, what needs to be done? Well, according to the report, in order to get back on track to that one-and-a-half-degree goal, the report actually states that we need to cut our current emissions by 45 percent by the end of the decade. And if that's not good enough, well at least to limit warming to two degrees, we have to cut our current emissions by 30 percent. That's a very tall order considering the trajectory that we are on the past seven years have been the warmest seven on record and of course 2022 looking very hot as well. Kim?",
