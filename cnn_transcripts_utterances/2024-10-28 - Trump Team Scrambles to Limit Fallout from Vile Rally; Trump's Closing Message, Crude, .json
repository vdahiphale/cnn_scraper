Live at the Table, Scott Taylor, Mehdi Hasan, Ryan Girdusky and Ashley Allison. With eight days to go, Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, indecent exposure. Tonight, Donald Trump's campaign is mad. They're worried that what was supposed to go down as a triumphant moment in his hometown, here in New York, at a mecco (ph) for star power, will now end up hurting his campaign. Sources tell CNN that Trump and his inner circle, they are concerned that voters didn't hear a closing message. You've probably seen the headlines about this comic who made the joke about Puerto Rico, among other things. But it wasn't just this one comic. As many people took that stage, they all were saying vile, reprehensible, sexist, racist things. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

LINDA LOPEZ, ANCHOR AND REPORTER, 1010 WINS NY:  You know, it's one of the things that we can say right away is that this is nothing new, right? We've all seen the Trump rallies in the past. We know the rhetoric that's been coming out of Trump and the Trump campaign. There's a lot of this that is not new. But I really noticed something last night that one thing did feel new and it was that after the comments about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage, about Latinos and how crude and vile those comments got, the backlash that seemed to come almost immediately within the community, it felt instantaneous and it felt like everybody wanted to make sure they were sharing these videos and sharing these comments and making sure that everyone in their circles knew that this was happening in real time and that it was something they couldn't even process for the level of how crude and vile it was.
