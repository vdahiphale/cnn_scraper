The app is already banned on federal devices, and nearly half of all States have banned it on state owned devices. REP.

Earlier he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to Polish soldiers who have died in conflict.He also met with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda. And a short time ago too, the Prince spoke with young Ukrainians at a food hall who shared how they resettled in Poland after fleeing the war in their own country. CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster is joining us live now from Warsaw, Poland. Max, great to have you with us, the Royal Family have been, I think, unusually forthright about their views on this war and in support of Ukraine, his presence there, just reinforcing that.",

So he's in the food hall, behind me meeting refugees who have settled here, 1.5 million of them in this country.And it really does feel as though they are fully integrated here. He met some Poles outside and had a chat with them. And they were talking about how they were very grateful that he was here showing how much Poland continues to do and as you say, just before that he met the president as well. Again, a conversation based on Ukraine and Prince William, interestingly, seeing his position as a global statesman, if you like coming here to thank the President and the Polish people for everything that they've done to protect in his words, the freedoms, all our freedoms. So it's quite you know, it's not a political issue in the sense that the U.K. is fully behind Ukraine in this war effort, of course, but globally, it's very political issues. So it's interesting to see how he's stepping up to his elevated title of Prince of Wales in this way. So he's going to go forward and not be unafraid and I think Julia going into some quite sensitive issues in future.",

In the meantime, France is bracing for another nationwide strike against the government's controversial changes to the pension system that will push through Parliament without a vote.Thousands of Police officers across the country have been mobilized in preparation for those planned protests. Just a few hours ago, dozens of people blocked the entrance of one of the terminals of Paris's main airport. And CNN's Melissa Bell joins us now from Paris. There is a futility to these protests, particularly like to what the President said this week, and that he's simply not backing down. But it doesn't mean that these big unions can't make life very difficult for people in the interim.",

In fact, I think the words of the President yesterday on French national television, if anything; Julia will have further encouraged the people that you're going to see out here on the streets of Paris, but other French cities throughout the day.The record that we saw after these many weeks of protests came on the 7th of March, when there were more than 1.2 million people out in the streets of France. That's according to the Ministry of Interior figures. There's always a discrepancy between what the union say and what the official figures are? Today, we're expecting to see more than that bigger crowds still, because it comes at the end of a week, Julia, when we've seen day after day is spontaneous protests, unplanned eruption on the streets of Paris, and again, other French cities as well, in the wake of that decision to force through parliament this particularly unpopular reform. It will now become law before the end of the year. We heard the French President say so yesterday, its last step is passing in front of the Constitutional Council, which will rule on its constitutionality and barring any massive reversal of fortune there it will now become law. The retirement age in France will go from 62 to 64. And that is exactly what these people are going to be out on the streets protesting throughout the day. Also nationwide strike studios that are crippling are lots of different aspects of life in France today. Schools 20 percent of teachers are on strike. Transport network seriously impacted as you said a moment ago, that terminal a child aboard even now being blockaded.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it was interesting even actually, before all the turmoil we've seen in the banking sector. There was some expectation that perhaps this rate rise could be delayed or actually just canceled altogether.And then we had banking turmoil plus the inflation reading yesterday, which came in at 10.4 percent for February, which means that the U.K. versus the U.S. and Europe is actually seeing inflation tick ever so slightly higher. There was an expectation that it would fall below 10 percent for February. So that pretty much baked in then the expectation that this would happen. So no huge surprise, we're seeing the pound and U.K. government bond yields ticked slightly higher on the back of this news. This is the 11th hike in a row. So the question is have we hit the terminal rate yet? They're saying as ever, that future moves will depend on inflation data, so not really much of a hit there. I'm just reading through some of the economic outlook in the report that's come with it. It's interesting, you know, the budget was announced last week by the Chancellor with quite a lot of fiscal support. They're saying that could actually raise GDP by 0.3 percent over the coming years. They now think GDP will come in slightly higher for the second quarter versus a decline of 0.4 percent. So that's a slight improvement there. We'll have to pick through the whole report prefers move next hour. But overall, I would say no huge surprises here. I think there is quite a lot though, in terms of the monetary outlook on SVB, Silicon Valley Bank. So that's also something we'll get into more next hour.",
