This is in an area of Russia called Mordovia, which, as you said, is about 300 miles away from Moscow here. And I was looking at the village that this penal colony, which is called penal colony two, is in, and there really doesn't seem to be very much there except this penal colony. Now, Brittney Griner's lawyers tell us that, you know, despite the circumstances, she's doing fairly well. She's, obviously, happy about the support that she's getting from the United States. But definitely the situation for her has become a lot more difficult as she is now in that very remote place, Don.",

Also the food there really a very difficult situation as well. But then you also have to look at the psychological effect on Brittney Griner right now. And you pointed this out, she's looking at nine years in that place. She was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. She's, obviously, already served some time. So, just the prospect of that must be soul crushing.

Well, Krasner responded saying, quote, history will harshly judge this anti-democratic authoritarian effort to erase Philly's votes, votes by black, brown and broke people in Philadelphia. Let's bring in our friend and CNN political commentator and host of \"SMERCONISH\" right here on CNN, Michael Smerconish. Michael, good morning and thanks very much for - for taking the time. I -- when I think about what's going on here in Philadelphia, I think about what Robert Jackson, the former U.S. attorney general said back in the '40s about prosecutors. He said, the prosecutor has more control over life, liberty and reputation than any person in America. And that power is often unchecked. But this is what Larry Krasner ran on.

If I still lived in the city of Philadelphia, I think he's soft on crime and I think that he bears some responsibility, not all responsibility, but some responsibility for the revolving door of perps who are let out and commit more crimes.Having said that, I don't see the case for impeachment because, to your point, this is the way he ran for office. He received nearly 70 percent of the vote. He was then re-elected again with close to 70 percent of the vote. There's no corruption evident. And there's this very vague standard in Pennsylvania in the state constitution. The question being, did he misbehave? What the hell does that mean? So, I read the case that Republican statehouse members have assembled against him. I find merit in it. But I think misbehaving and impeachment is for corruption. So, I have to say, it does seem like the overturning of the will of the people. You want to get rid of Larry Krasner, then vote him out.",
