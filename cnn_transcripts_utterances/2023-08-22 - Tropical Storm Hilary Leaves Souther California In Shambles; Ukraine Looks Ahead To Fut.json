So there is just genuine desire to really expand the influence by, potentially, for example, discussing new members into this grouping, to have the global South, as you mentioned, to have more say on international affairs. That, of course, is also beneficial to Xi Jinping and China because of China's leadership role in this grouping. So we have seen Chinese officials and state media drumming up this narrative of the growing importance of the BRICS grouping to counter what they describe as the U.S. policy of unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdictions. But Xi Jinping's trip comes at a tricky time for him at home with the economy here, the rebound after the COVID really not doing nearly as well as officials had hoped for. You have a deepening real estate crisis and burgeoning local government debts, not to mention inflationary pressure and, of course, youth unemployment hitting historic highs several months in a row, so bad that the government here has stopped releasing data on this front. So Xi Jinping is facing more constraint when it comes to what kind of projects China is able to finance and invest across the global South, but especially on the African continent. But of course, experts say the Beijing leadership may be now adopting a so-called low cost, high impact strategy of improving party-to-party relations to tout China's power structure here, but also having more African military officers come here to be trained in China. Not to mention soft power. The Chinese central television network, for example, just launched a -- the second season of a TV show called the classics, quoted by Xi Jinping across Africa.
