In fact, you know, a lot of people characterized the overall course of the war so far as, you know, being overly pessimistic the first year, as you'll recall, Kyiv is going to fall within, you know, a week or two. Then the second year, a degree of over-optimism as the anticipation of the offensive loomed. And now this year it's much more realistic. It's just a very sober appraisal of what is becoming quite a long war. There's still the absolute determination. There's still the reverence for the Ukrainian military. Everyone is still going about their efforts with an enormous sense of purpose.But Russia has generated very substantial additional forces. They don't care about the casualties that appears. They take colossal losses for small pieces of ground. But that's the situation on the front lines at this point in time.",

And at least the prime minister acknowledged it, accepted responsibility for it and so forth. But Jose Andres has ever reason to be outraged. But these things do happen in war. We had terrible episodes at various times and - when I was commanding in Iraq or Afghanistan. The key here is keep your eye on the overall objective and then make sure that the way you go about achieving it is appropriate. And that's where I think the challenge is. Again, Hamas does need to be destroyed. There are at least four battalion size elements still that are down in the south around Rafah. They have to go after those. The other - the challenge though is how to do that without civilian casualties, without these kinds of mistakes. And, by the way, while flooding that area with humanitarian assistance, which they have not been doing. They've got to get much more serious about that. At the end of the day, hearts and minds matter. They're not going to love the Israelis, but you can't have the entire population against them when - when ultimately Hamas is destroyed. You want to make their lives better. There should be a commitment to that, even as they go about the very challenging operations in an area that has 1.1 million displaced persons that have to be moved somewhere else and have to be taken care of much more effectively.",

If that's good, you take them outside and you look at something that might be shiny, like a reflection off the car from the sun. And that should be the only thing you can see. If that's good, then take a brief glance at the sun. It should be comfortable to look at. If you're still not absolutely positive that you have real eclipse glasses, only look at the sun for two to three seconds at a time every five minutes. Eclipses don't move that fast. You are not going to miss it. You will get to still see the cool crescent shape. But you should be really careful. I mean real injuries can happen. These have been documented during eclipses before.
