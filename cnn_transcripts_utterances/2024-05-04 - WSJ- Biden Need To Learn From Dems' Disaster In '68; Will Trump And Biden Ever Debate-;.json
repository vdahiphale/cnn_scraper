      "sentences": "Is it 1968 the sequel? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.This week in a deja vu of the Vietnam era, police officers in riot gear across the country were called in to disperse anti-war protesters from college campuses. When they cleared out Columbia University's Hamilton Hall, it was on the 56th anniversary of police arrests ending a student takeover about the Vietnam conflict in the exact same building. And this August, even more deja vu, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago, the same city which hosted the 1968 DNC which was famously disrupted by both chaotic radical anti-war protests and the violent response of the police. A bit of history, in 1968 included LBJ deciding not to seek reelection because of Vietnam, four days later, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. race riots, then the assassination of Democratic front runner Robert F. Kennedy. The Republican challenger, Richard Nixon, who had lost to JFK in 1960, was promising to end the Vietnam War and restore law and order at home. As my next guest recently recounted in the Wall Street Journal, in August of '68, when Hubert Humphrey was about to take the podium to accept the Democratic nomination, the television networks abruptly cut away the footage of National Guardsmen in armored jeeps, firing tear gas and swinging their billy clubs at Vietnam War protesters in Grant Park across town. The video lasted 17 minutes and eternity, both for the 89 million Americans watching the broadcast and for Humphreys candidacy. The Democratic Convention was a catastrophe for Humphrey and for a nation that it left more polarized than ever. The only beneficiary politically speaking was Republican candidate Richard Nixon. And even though history has sided with the Vietnam protesters at the time the unrest boomerang. As David Brooks recounts in the \"New York Times,\" \"In 1966, Ronald Reagan vowed to clean up the mess at Berkeley and was elected governor of California. In 1968, Richard Nixon celebrated the \"forgotten Americans, the nonshouters, the nondemonstrators,\" and was elected to the presidency. Far from leading to a new progressive era, the uprisings of the era were followed by what was arguably the most conservative period in American history.\" And the title of David Brooks piece, \"Why the Protests Help Trump?\" Meghan McCain warned in a tweet, the DNC convention this summer going to be a blanking s show. And today happens to be the 54th anniversary of the Kent State massacre, that fateful day in 1970 when the National Guard shot and killed four students on that Ohio campus during an anti-Vietnam War protest. This week, Bernie Sanders told CNN Christiane Amanpour the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDSERS (I-VT): This may be Biden's Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson, in many respects, was a very, very good president domestically, brought forth some major pieces of legislation. He chose not to run in '68 because of opposition to his views on Vietnam. And I worry very much that President Biden is putting himself in a position where he has alienated not just young people, but a lot of the Democratic base. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At one level, he had a sense of identification with them, because he thought of himself as a reformer, but also that was so much the source of the energy and the idealism in the party. And so Biden faces a similar problem.The kids who are demonstrating today are a tiny fraction of the Democratic Party. They're even a small fraction of young people, most young people are well, more conservative than they are. But he already seen as a kind of stodgy and solid candidate, he doesn't want to completely cut his ties to that more youthful and progressive wing of the party, even though I argue that the political danger, the electoral danger, is those people offending the much larger group of voters to Biden's right. And so the narrow path is to find a way to modify that group, ideally, by some statement -- some action, I'm sorry, in regard to Israel that will show that he shares some of their concerns. And to do that in a way that does not identify him with the demonstrations.",

So we probably all remember that youngster that seemed to be annoying everybody in class, we didn't realize that a lot of times those youngsters were struggling with ADHD or anxiety and other things.So I think there's increased awareness.

So, a few of the things that happened during the pandemic as families were together, there were more opportunities for families to spend time together. The other issues that are plaguing us really have to do with creating sense -- a sense of community in places where young people are, schools, their communities, recreational activities, all of those things. Family spending time together in the outdoor environment, all of those things are really important to supporting mental health, and preventing emotional challenges.Some of the things that are happening though, as we understand there are lots of things happening in the world that young people are exposed to, through media through social media, there's a lot of stressors in school environments with many kids being bullied and marginalized and not necessarily being able to find those communities. But those are the things that maintain and support mental health. And the goal would be how do we create an environment for young people to thrive, and for resilient families to be OK. And were there many approaches were taken to doing that. Some of them is better education about mental health. You know, better education for providers and for communities. And so, we're looking for ways to integrate mental health into settings where children and families are every day, for example, schools, it's an excellent opportunity to reach more kids in the environment that's not stigmatizing. We're also starting to integrate more behavioral health providers in primary care practices. So when families go to receive their medical services, they're able to receive their mental health services as well. And we're looking at other community partnerships. We're partnering with churches, recreational centers, athletic programs. But the challenge is the one you identified at the very beginning, there just are not enough clinicians to care for all the young people in need.",

Elie, I've read the transcript, but I can't see the body language. Yesterday is the argument as to why we ought to be able to see it for ourselves. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST/FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Oh, I hundred percent agree. I'm with you now, Michael. I probably wouldn't have been with you five years ago when I was a prosecutor, but now I think we have to have cameras in the courtroom, and you can see why in the coverage of this. There's this sort of effort to tie Hope Hicks' crying to some specific motive, some specific thing that she testified about. I don't buy that. I've seen plenty of people take the stand in a courtroom. Testifying is scary. It's emotional. She's sitting there in front of a person who is she respected and admired, who she sort of grew up under, became a professional under. It's a dramatic moment.

She's going back to a time in her life 10 plus -- almost 10 years ago now, when she was 20 something, and Donald Trump started employing her. And she sort of came up through the ranks. I mean, you can understand how it's emotional.I just wanted to stress -- again, I'm going to use our friend and colleague, Anderson Cooper here as an example. Now, Anderson has interviewed presidents, kings. He has been in warzones. He had to testify in a fairly low-level trial last year or so. And he has said -- he said publicly, he said privately, he was terrified. It was emotional. It was scary. It was a routine court case, but getting up on that stand can really evoke emotions. And I just think it's a mistake to say, Hope Hicks cried because she knew she just ended Donald Trump's career, because she knew she just sunk him. Or she cried because she had just collapsed on cross- examine. It was neither of those things in my view. SMERCONISH: Transcript number three. Again, just three things that I read and I circled. Here we go. This is now the defense. There's reference to Melania Trump. That's the first highlight. Now go to the end. And Hope Hicks says, so I think he was just concerned about what her perception of this would be, meaning the hush money payment. This is what the defense wants, which is to say Donald Trump paid that money to protect his family, Barron, his wife, et cetera. It's not because of the campaign.
