Hear what her answer did not include is she prepares to head back out on the campaign trail in just a few hours.And top Biden cabinet secretary said they have a very productive meeting with the Mexican president and his cabinet. How they plan to slow border crossings as a huge caravan moves north through Mexico. This hour of CNN This Morning starts right now. And we start this hour with Donald Trump's battle to stay on the ballot. It is playing out in multiple states, and big decisions could be coming down at any time. The Colorado GOP is now asking the Supreme Court to keep Trump on the ballot. That, of course, comes after the state's top court ruled that he engaged in an insurrection on January 6th and was therefore disqualified. Trump himself could still appeal. HARLOW:  Also, at any moment we could hear from the secretary of state of Maine, will she keep Trump on the ballot or remove him? She's a Democrat and she could make the decision as soon as today. Trump's lawyers are demanding she recuse herself. They sent a letter accusing her of having a personal bias against a former president. And Trump is coming off a legal victory in Michigan. That state's Supreme Court has rejected an effort to try to kick Trump off their primary ballot.",

It seems fairly straightforward.But the question that leaves open is, how does this get decided? Who gets to decide? Well, if you flip ahead to Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, it tells us that Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article. Now, Congress here means the federal United States Congress. They have the power to pass legislation. What that leaves open the question to is do the states have the power to come up with their own procedures? And if they do, are those procedures adequate to protect the due process interest of whoever is at stake? So, that's where the Constitution itself leaves us.

If we look at the broader landscape here, it's not gone well for people trying to kick Donald Trump off. We've seen secretaries in these states decline to kick Donald Trump off. They've said, we don't believe we have the constitutional power to do that. That includes Democrats, prominent Democrat Jocelyn Benson, secretary of state in Michigan, and Republicans, Brad Raffensperger. We know he was on the receiving end of one of Donald Trump's efforts to try to flip an election result.

Those legal challenges have been rejected by courts, some by the state Supreme Court, some by lower court still pending. But in these six states, they're 0-6, these six states have rejected it. Most recently, just yesterday, the Michigan Supreme Court said, no, we're not throwing them off the ballot.There have been about a half -- excuse me a dozen or so other cases where plaintiffs have brought lawsuits and then withdrawn them for various reasons So, those lawsuits have not gotten anywhere. Colorado, at this point, stands alone. They're the only state court that has thrown Donald Trump off the ballot. But, of course, they're not going to be the final word. Just a refresher last week, the Colorado state-level Supreme Court, seven justices all appointed by Democratic governors, 4-3 ruled that Trump is disqualified. The next step is the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, yesterday we saw the Colorado Republican Party file suit in the Supreme Court. I think Trump himself is going to follow soon. And I think, ultimately, just given this map and all the chaos on it, I think the U.S. Supreme Court will intervene and has to intervene to give us some clarity here.",

So, basically, what we know so far, and I do want to make this clear of all of the legal battles that Donald Trump is facing, this is the one that he and his team are the least concerned about. And that is because of what you just saw when Elie laid out that map. One, there have been multiple cases that were put forward and then withdrawn. And then in key states, like Arizona, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Florida, Georgia, now Michigan, they've all rejected this idea that Donald Trump can be thrown off the ballot.So, last night in an interview, we heard from Donald Trump essentially saying that he hopes the Supreme Court sides with him when it comes to the state of Colorado. Now, we do know that this is now at the Supreme Court because the Republican Party has brought it there. We also believe that Donald Trump will still be filing his own appeal. But the interesting thing about Maine, as Elie said, there is a differential here. Some of these states, it goes directly to the courts. The other goes to the secretary of state. In the case of Maine, Donald Trump is now asking that secretary of state to recuse herself, pointing to former social media posts that he believes or that he is saying a show that she is anti-Trump. And that's unlikely to happen. Again, even after the secretary of state in Maine rules, it will likely go to the courts. But that's where the steps are being taken right now.",

So, one of the things, as you noted, this time around, that's different from 2016 and 2020, is not only this team very disciplined, it's also very small. And what they have done, it's led by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. They are two veteran Republican strategists. They have, one, worked on the math. They've been traveling the country meeting with state parties, working on the delegate math. The other part of what they have done is really worked to manage the messaging.What they don't want is the internal leaks that hurt Donald Trump in 2016 and plagued his presidency to hurt his chances of going back to the White House. And to be clear, they know who their candidate is. They know he is going to do what he wants and say what he wants. But what they're trying to do is manage the people around him and have a cohesive message coming out of it. And there is one part of this. As Donald Trump has grown in popularity, as it looks clear that he's going to possibly be the GOP nominee, people have started to come out of the woodwork. And what I'm hearing from so many people who are very close and who have stood by Trump throughout this time, it's hard to manage that messaging from the people outside, because Donald Trump's orbit is very big, and there are a lot of people who want to show that they have power in case he does win a second term.",

The meeting comes as the southern border has officials that are scrambling to respond to really an unprecedented level of illegal crossings, especially in recent weeks. Joining us now for more on this is former Defense Secretary under President Trump Mark Esper. Secretary, I appreciate your time this morning.

We all know 100,000 or so Americans a year are killed by fentanyl.But the other challenge we have on the border is just 2.1 million people crossed last year. Many, many more escaped. Of those that crossed, over 15,000 are non-citizen criminals with convictions. We have hundreds or at least over 100 on the terror watch list. I mean, there's just a lot of concern across the country, and certainly in the Republican Party, my party, about border security. So, Trump is tapping into all these things. And his view was, if we could knock out the cartels with missiles, then that would take care of the criminal problem. And as you noted, I think, he thought nobody would find out. But, of course, it wouldn't. That would have been an act of war. But we need Mexico's cooperation to deal with the border problem and not their antagonism.",

And in this case, if you define it as going after their top leaders, getting rid of their munitions and their armaments, and then, of course, in my view, you have to get rid of the logistical support system, which is the tunnels, then, yes, I think that's possible. They could do that. That would allow them some control. I said on many occasions as well, you have to cut off that supply chain of money and arms and munitions coming from Iran as well.

Recently surfaced video appears to show Palestinian men and at least two children stripped down to their underwear and detained by the IDF in Gaza.Now, CNN is unable to verify when the video was shot, but geolocation data shows it was filmed in a stadium of Gaza City. The IDF has not responded to CNN's request for comment on that video. The incident, though, resembles an account shared by a Palestinian poet and writer, Mosab Abu Toha, in a new piece published in The New Yorker. Abu Toha claims he was forced to complete the undress at gunpoint before being detained and interrogated by the IDF earlier this month. He was trying to cross the Rafah border with his wife and three kids, including his three-year-old son, Mustafa, who's a U.S. citizen. Abu Toha said he was terrorized and beaten while being questioned about whether he had ties to Hamas. The well-known poet and writer has studied at Syracuse and Harvard and denies repeatedly any ties to Hamas or terrorism. The IDF gave a statement to CNN noting that it's a partial response and that they are still looking into the allegations, saying in part, during IDF operations in the Gaza Strip a number of individuals were detained on the basis of intelligence indicating significant communications between them and terror organizations in the strip out of suspicion of affiliation with terror organizations there. Mosab Abu Toha was found to be mistakenly identified in this regard and was thus released after questioning. The individuals detained are treated in accordance with international law. Mosab Abu Toha joins us now live from Cairo, Egypt. We appreciate your time. And I want to start with what the IDF says in their statement because what they don't discuss in the statement is what transpired between when you were detained and when they realized or came to the conclusion it was a mistake and you were released.
