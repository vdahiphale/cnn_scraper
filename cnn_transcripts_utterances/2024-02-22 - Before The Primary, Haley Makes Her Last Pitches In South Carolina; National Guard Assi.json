I'm told from a court official that this jury consists of 12 people, that's seven men, five women, four alternates were also selected.Now, the court moved through this at a pretty fast clip on Wednesday, getting this all wrapped up in one day. I'm told that 70 residents of Santa Fe County were brought in for questioning, both individually as well as a larger group. Now, the contents of those solo sessions, that's private. But I'm told by a court official at one point, the judge addressed the entire audience asking them, who in this room has heard about this case, either from the news media, or the internet, or by word of mouth? I'm told that the majority of people in that audience raised their hand and said, yes. Of course, there's this misnomer in criminal law that if you've heard about a case, you can't serve on a jury when in reality, what the judge is looking for is someone who can render an impartial verdict regardless of what they know about the case. At least according to the court official, they now have their jury. We could hear opening arguments begin as soon as this morning.

He enlisted back in 2008. Serving on three different U.S. destroyers, so three different U.S. Navy warships. Most recently the USS Higgins.In fact, Navy prosecutors say that back in November 2022, Bryce Pedicini had begun transferring classified information to a foreign government. Something as you point out, he did a number of times over the course of the next several months, according to prosecutors. In November 2022 and then again in December, January, and February. It was in May 2023 when Pedicini was serving in Japan that Navy prosecutors say he took a picture of a classified screen and was ready to transfer that information to give that over to a foreign government. This is when in mid-May of 2023 he was arrested, taken into custody, and he has been held since then in pretrial confinement. At this point, a Navy official tells us in San Diego. Pedicini now faces 14 different counts of espionage and attempts to transfer classified information, as well as other charges here. As his court-martial moves forward, it is worth noting a couple of things about his Navy record. First, he's been given three good conduct medals and a National Defense Service Medal. He was also promoted in August '22 to chief petty officer. That is when, according to, Navy prosecutors, several months later, he began to transfer a classified information to a foreign government. The charge sheet, the document we have here does not specify which foreign government. John, it's also worth pointing out that this basically played out as the entire Jack Teixeira saga was unfolding. That's when, according to prosecutors there, Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Teixeira was posting leaked information online in a Discord server.

Instead, it seems to be related to what's known as peering, which is, how the industry hands off cell phone calls from one network to another.So, it appears to be, you know, something technical in nature and not something malicious. But you know, again, these companies are still trying to get to the bottom of it. Verizon says that its network is unaffected, but they believe that this issue should be resolved fairly soon. T-Mobile also reporting that its network is unaffected. And you know, if you're a Verizon or a T-Mobile customer who's, you know, having trouble making calls, it's likely because your phone is trying to contact someone who is an AT&amp;T customer, and that's the reason why you're having issues. Now, what can AT&amp;T customers do about all this? Well, even if your cell phone service is down, you can still access Wi-Fi through your Wi-Fi chip in your phone. So, if you're, you know, inside a building or in an office at home, you could use Wi-Fi to still make calls in many cases over that technology without using the cell phone signal that is currently out of service for tens of thousands, if not more, you know, across the country.
