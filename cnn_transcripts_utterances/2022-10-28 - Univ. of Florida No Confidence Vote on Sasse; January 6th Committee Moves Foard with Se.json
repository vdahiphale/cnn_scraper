If you think about it for a minute, the act of disqualifying a candidate, just sort of saying, look, this person is simply not fit for office, that's relatively difficult compared with riding on the prominent national issues that people think about every single day, like crime, like the economy, like the inflation that they deal with every time they make a purchase.So, for Fetterman to be disqualified - I watched the debate from end- to-end. I think anybody who's ever dealt with somebody who's had a stroke, or had a heart attack, or maybe dealing with the early stages of dementia, elderly relatives, it wasn't that far off from, you know, different experiences that a lot of people have had. So, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Pennsylvania voters didn't really move one way or the other based on that particular performance. I mean, you know, there are two senators right now that had strokes earlier this year, and they're serving with no problem in the Senate right now. So, the idea of knocking out Fetterman, I could easily believe that that's not necessarily going to be how voters react.",

Everybody knows that there are problems here, just like there are around the country. But they really differ in the dimensions of it.So that the challenger, Lee Zeldin, which a challenger has to do, has to say, look, things are really, really, really bad and we need to replace the leadership at the top of the state. Kathy Hochul was relatively more sedate in sort of saying, like, listen, we've got problems but here's what I've done about this one, that one, this one, that one. Laid out a real broad menu for New Yorkers about which version of reality they want to subscribe to. So, that, to me, was very, very striking. I mean Lee Zeldin is saying we have to save the state. And there are a lot of New Yorkers who are saying like, well, we've got problems but it's not like we're going under for the third time. Of course, a lot of people do feel that way.",

So that's the faculty's take, really taking issue with the process.We talked to students who echoed what you were talked about there, Alex, the - the issues with the senator's stance on same-sex marriage. They take issue with that, fearing what that could mean for inclusion on campus. For the senator's take he has said that he can put politics aside. He has been the leader of Midland's university in Nebraska. And he is also someone who has not necessarily always toed the party line.

Number one, why are they deleting all their text messages? Where did the text messages go? Who's in charge of this place? And I think government at its best is when you have a Congress that is not just trying to bring criminal charges but actually trying to make an agency, a very important public safety agency like the Secret Service, work better.

According to the agreement, West denied the executive's allegations. According to four sources who spoke with CNN, West, who now goes by Ye, even suggested naming his album after the Nazi leader in 2018. Universal Music Group, which owns Deaf Jam Records, said in a statement to CNN that its relationship with West ended last year, writing, quote, there is no place for anti-Semitism in our society. We are deeply committed to combatting anti-Semitism and every other form of prejudice. These revelations come just weeks after West tweeted he was, quote, going death con three on Jewish people, resulting in Twitter locking his account. A former TMZ staffer, Van Lathan Jr.,  claims West made anti-Semitic comments during a 2018 interview. VAN LATHAN JR., FORMER TMZ EMPLOYEE: He said something like, I love Hitler. I love Nazis.
