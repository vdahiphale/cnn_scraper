And they say at this time, they have not received any patients. So that's also another detail that's interesting to note here.But obviously, word spread, the students took this very seriously that this was a real threat and we're hunkering down. Now, at this point, what we know is that authorities are really working to help get all of the students, staff and faculty off of campus. And so they have set up a place for everyone to be unified with their loved ones. And that is going to be at the convention center, the North Hall of the convention center, and they're going to slowly begin moving students there. We also know the police at the same time are going building by building. And from what we understand, this is a large campus, they're going building by building, floor by floor, making sure that they can go in and clear each floor, making sure that there's no one else that may be injured, making sure that if there are people who are still scared, still hunkering down, that they are helping them to get them out of the building and get them to safety and get them back with their loved ones. So these are all some of the things that we have been seeing as long with some of the images that we've been looking at coming out of Las Vegas, where they're showing armored vehicles, SWAT vehicles making their way into the scene as they expanded the perimeter around the campus. All of that, making people very nervous in the area, but at the same time police are saying this is now a time where we don't have any other threat, but they still want people to avoid the area. And also looking at just everything else that has been happening here around the community. We can also now tell you that UNLV was expected to play a basketball game versus University of Dayton and that the team is actually in Ohio, but that game has now been canceled. It was supposed to be played at 09:00 p.m. Eastern Time, we now know that that has been cancelled at this point. But looking at what these people have been through, it's no surprise that UNLV and the rest of the higher education institutions throughout the entire state of Nevada have canceled school for the rest of the day. And this all during a study period where the students are supposed to be hunkering down and preparing for those final exams before they go off on their winter break. So all of that is what has been happening here, Jake.",

And finally, what you've got is concurrently with the investigation going on about who this guy is and why he did this. You've got to go through every building where somebody might have received that warning text, and make sure that you still don't have people hunkering down in their fearful for their lives.

Secondarily, though, you have to identify the person, you have to find out if they have friends, if they have associates who might be a part of something like this.

You're going to go in and find any life stressors, you're going to find out what their writings are.

The good news, if you can call it good news, are -- is that the numbers we're getting are these single digit numbers, maybe three with one deceased being the shooter. We don't know the condition of those other people, those numbers can change.One of the factors about, you know, Sheriff McMahill, the fire chief and the chief of the university police coming up to the microphone and saying so little is having been in these situations myself, the information changes, the numbers go up, the numbers go down, they're adjusted, the facts shift, because different facts are coming in, literally as you're walking up to the microphone, so you try to say what you're sure of. But those numbers are fairly reassuring in that we've seen so much worse. The governor has been in direct touch with them talking about things like the halting of classes in all the other state universities across Nevada, they were clear that was an out of an abundance of caution. But they wanted to do that in a way so that if this incident were perhaps connected to a network of other planned incidents, and that is not what we are seeing, that those schools would have already reduced the number of people there and the activity to make themselves safe. Interestingly, Joe Lombardo, the governor who is in close touch with the sheriff here used to be the sheriff here. During the last Las Vegas sniper incident, he was the man in charge. So, this is not a politician who's got some vague awareness of the dynamics here. He's been in the thick of it himself many times. So what happens now? First is suspect has been identified, they have a name. They are working with that name to go backwards now. Where did he come from? Where did this weapon come from? Where was he bedding down and laying his head? Is he a resident there? If so, let's get that house locked down by patrol, make sure that no one has been hurt or injured inside there, then secure that for a search warrant because they're going to want to look. Where's his computer? Where's his phone? Where are, you know, any evidences of a manifesto or a message boards or chat rooms he's been in. So those wheels are all turning backwards. The two major developments, we have some victim numbers and they are thankfully small. We don't know their condition. And two, we believe there's only one gunman and he is out of the picture right now.",

The problem, this is all fake, even though it looks like a ceremony, it's not.And this became part of the charade of the 2020 lie. And so the attorney general in Nevada has now announced these indictments handed down by a grand jury. What has happened to these Republican leaders, many of them leaders in the state party, we found them still basically leading that party in the state of Nevada.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION: Well, the first question, they're very serious. These are felony charges. You can face incarceration for several years. As to whether I'm surprised about the duration that it took to bring these charges, yes, a little bit. In other words, this was an election that happened, you know, about three years ago. And the fact that it took this long to bring what a relatively straightforward charges, they're basically false attestation false documents signing charges, it is a little curious it took three years. I think what that reflects is that in these intervening three years, there's been some developments. So we have witnesses who participated in this scheme, not necessarily the people under indictment, but other people, people that have been in the news and Georgia, for example, who may well have been cooperating or have started to cooperate with the Nevada attorney general.

Will this aid package pass before you all go home and wish each other a merry Christmas? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Jake, we should not go home for the holidays without passing this urgent supplemental funding bill that would sustain Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression, provide critically needed assistance to Israel, fund humanitarian relief for innocent civilians from Gaza to Ukraine to a dozen other countries and support our partners and allies in the Indo Pacific who are standing up to Chinese aggression. It's a big and broad package. And it also includes the single largest investment in border security. President Biden's request would include 13 billion for border security, they would hire 1000s of Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection agents, asylum officers, and significantly improve border security. My hope is that after today's vote, we can get down to the business of crafting a compromise that can pass. Leader Schumer gave the Republicans a path forward by promising them the First Amendment vote on this package. I know that's procedural. But the point is that if we can get 60 senators between the two parties to agree to a responsible compromise on border security, Leader Schumer has guaranteed that we'll get a vote and what to get attached to this package.

Ominously, it refers to Noah's warning that a flood was coming. The flood overtook them, it reads, while they persisted in wrongdoing. What isn't flowing into Gaza is enough aid. The Biden administration has sharply warned Israel, they aren't doing enough. And the U.S. hopes to see a change in Israeli military tactics. During this new phase.",

And the latest episode, Anderson reflects on his brother who died by suicide. And he spoke with President Biden, who also knows quite a bit, quite a lot, in fact, way too much about what it's like to lose someone you love.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): A few days before I spoke with President Biden, I was going through a box of stuff in my basement that belonged to my brother, Carter, who died by suicide when he was 23. I don't have a lot of pictures of my brother on display in my house. His death is still so painful to me that I find it hard to see his photos. These two pictures really stunned me. They were taken shortly before Carter graduated from Princeton in 1987. He looks so young and happy. There's no hint that 15 months after this picture was taken, he'd killed himself in front of her mom. Looking at these photos, I don't recognize my brother. And I realized I don't think I ever really knew him. I didn't allow myself to. And I didn't allow him to know me. When her dad died, Carter was 12 and I was 10. And it slapped us both into silence. We never spoke about my dad with each other or with anyone. I think my brother would be alive if we had. Why is it so hard to talk about loss and grief? We all go through it, so why do we keep it hidden away, cry in private, speak the names of our loved ones in hushed whispers only we can hear. That's why I wanted to talk with President Biden. He's been more public about grief than any American president in history. And this is his most personal interview yet.",
