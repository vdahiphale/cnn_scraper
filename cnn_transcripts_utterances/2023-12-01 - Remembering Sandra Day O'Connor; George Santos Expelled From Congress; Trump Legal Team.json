And he disregard, sometimes even refused to see them. And we know what happened next.Let me just say that, in hindsight, we all know what happened. In real time. It was not just about the inability to believe that Hamas is closing the gap between the Jericho Wall plan as they -- where they wanted to be in their competence and where they were. And only one analyst, only one woman analyst, veteran analyst, that spends years studying Hamas. At a certain point said, this is not an imaginative scenario. This is not a dream that they have.",

She met that challenge with undaunted determination, indisputable ability and engaging candor. Let's bring in our own Joan Biskupic to talk a lot about this. You covered her and knew her well.

She was the deciding vote on abortion rights. She was the deciding vote on racial affirmative action on campuses. She was the deciding vote on the separation of church and state.
