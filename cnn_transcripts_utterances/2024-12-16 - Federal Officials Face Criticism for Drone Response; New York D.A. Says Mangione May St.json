A critical military base forced to close its airspace.Plus, Donald Trump promised to do everything in his power to, quote, hire American. But new CNN reporting shows his own businesses tried to hire more foreign workers than ever this year. And later, Luigi Mangione might be ready to drop his fight to stay in Pennsylvania and return to New York to face charges in the CEO murder. Hello. I'm Jim Acosta and you were live at the CNN Newsroom. All right, eyes in the skies, anger on the ground this morning. There is growing frustration with the federal government and the lack of answers over the rash of presumed drone sightings over New Jersey and neighboring states. Federal officials say they pose no security threat, but more were reported this weekend on the East Coast, and some did cause some problems. Stewart International Airport in Upstate New York had to shut down its runways for a short time on Friday in an Ohio drone activity forced Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to close its airspace for almost four hours. Here is a recording of air traffic controllers obtained by the military news website, The War Zone, discussing the UAS, or unmanned aircraft system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks for coming into the studio. We appreciate that as well.What's the latest on this? What kind of information are you getting? Might you be getting more new information this week? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  I mean, what we know for sure, and then Secretary Mayorkas explained this over the weekend is that we do know that some of what people are seeing are airplanes. We know that. But we also know that some are actually drones. And so we know that drones are out there. They're highly unregulated. We've asked for a classified briefing this week from Homeland Security. And I think what's really important here is that if you are in your neighborhood, you're a resident, you're in New Jersey, you're in California, and you're seeing something in the airspace that seems unfamiliar to you, or maybe it's not the normal flight pattern that you're seeing, and you're concerned, those folks have a right to know what's actually in the air. And so I think Congress has got to do a better job of regulating drones, and more importantly, the government has to do a better job of getting more information out to people. People deserve answers and we've got to ask those questions.",

I mean, if the government comes out and says, okay, it's X, Y, and Z, but this is classified, you're not going to be able to tell the public what this is, and that might cause more frustrations.

I mean, first, what's really important is obviously our agencies, the FBI, Homeland Security, Department of Defense have said that we do not have a national security threat with these current drones. So, we know that. That's important to tell the public. But classified briefings also get us a lot of information, and it gives Congress the ability to pass laws, write legislation, and you do get some information that you're able to put out in the community and declassify. So, I do think that both the White House and certainly Congress have got to do a better job of getting more information out to the public.I was a mayor of my city for eight years before I got to Congress this last term. When you're a local mayor and your community is saying, what am I seeing in the sky? I want to know what that is. People have a right to know and we've got to do a better job.

It's not just in New Jersey and New York, but in California and across the country. Drones are becoming more and more popular. But we've also got to pass smart legislation so that drones can be reported in the right way. Local communities, ports, cities need the ability to intercept drones.Right now, there is no system for a commercial pilot to actually report whether it's drones or whether it's a UAP or something that they see that they don't know what it is, there's no actual system to do that. We have a bill in Congress to do that. So, there is legislation that's working its way through Congress, but we've got to get more reactive. So, we're going to see the drone problem, by the way, is not going to get better. It's going to get worse.",

And there are drones out there that obviously have incredible capabilities to do really interesting things. But the government needs to be able to document those and tell the public what's going on. If you are a private company in the United States and you are testing some kind of drone or you are participating some kind of activity in our airspace, we should be regulating that.

He is trying, through his network of folks, essentially move science and our knowledge of medicine backwards.I think what he's able to do with that department, the damage he can do to, for example, NIH, our Health Institute, the CDC, is extreme. Health and public health is so important for people to have security within their own families and communities. And I'm very concerned that he's going to move us backwards and put us decades behind.

That will take a few weeks, maybe a month or more, and it's very easy for the prosecutor to come in and make their showing. They don't have to show you're guilty. They just have to show this person who's in court, this is the same Luigi Mangione who we've charged. It's a very low burden.

People say that he's changed significantly at these health issues and so forth. His appearance is substantially different. There has been a deterioration in him that likely is mental in nature.

It is really hard to look at a judge, to look at the lawyers, to look at overwhelming evidence that someone shot someone in the back and say, I don't care.
