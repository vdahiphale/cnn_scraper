So, you're right that this is a little bit bigger than that. But I can - I suspect that they are going to be pretty pleased with this.You know, that goldilocks number that we talk about, they wanted something that wasn't too big, like what we saw in the month of January when the economy added more than 500,000 jobs. That was, frankly, shocking to a lot of economists. But they, obviously, also always want to see strength and robustness in the jobs market. And so much of this has to do with being on Federal Reserve watch. They knew and very much took note inside the building behind me when Jerome Powell said in recent days and suggested that if there are more indicators that the jobs market is just too hot, that the labor market is too hot, that, yes, the central bank could bring back more aggressive interest rate hikes. That's not something that the White House wants to see. But at the same time, this has almost sort of been a good problem for the White House to have. You know, they know that the labor market being too strong and being too hot can lead to more aggressive interest rate hikes. But at the same time, they're always going to say, look, more jobs being added, more paychecks going to Americans, that is essentially a good thing. And, you know, I don't have to tell you, the issue of the economy, the issue of inflation, those are some of the most important political issues for this White House and for Democrats heading into 2024. So, they're always going to sort of root for strength in the jobs market and they do basically feel like they have a good story to tell on the economy. But, again, inflation is the one sort of intractable problem that this president has faced, and they very much want to see that trend to continue in a downwards manner.",

Republican Senator Marco Rubio has reintroduced a bill that would make Daylight Savings Time permanent nationwide, which mean no more - it would mean no more changing back the clocks.

I am not at all looking forward to losing an hour of sleep this weekend. It means one extra less hour of sleep and it also means the weekend has one less hour in it.But here is the issue, Kaitlan. Here is the issue. We can't agree on a solution. So, Americans don't like changing the clocks, but they can't agree on a solution. Look, 38 percent want Daylight Saving Time, no \"s,\" all year-round, 26 percent want standard time all year-round and then there's 32 percent who like the current system, which is a minority.
