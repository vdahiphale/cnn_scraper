Donald Trump had a much better day yesterday, the Supreme Courts signaled skepticism about Colorado's right to remove him from the ballot over his role on January 6. And later in the day, Trump easily won the Nevada caucuses, further cementing his path to the Republican nomination. Plus, fake videos generated by artificial intelligence rampant disinformation campaigns, even violence at polling places. All nightmare scenarios that U.S. national security officials are preparing for as the 2024 election approaches. We have a CNN exclusive report ahead. Good to everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, February 9. There are just 15 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 269 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. When books are written about the 2024 presidential election, I'm pretty sure we can count on reading about yesterday, February 8. Special Counsel Robert Hur's report did not indict the President as a criminal for mishandling classified documents, but it did indict his memory and mental capacity in a way that could hand a brutal sentence to President Biden's reelection campaign anyway. Hur's report claims that in interviews Biden couldn't nail down the dates he served as Vice President and had trouble remembering when his late son Beau died. Hur, seen here, decided not to charge the President because he believes a jury would be sympathetic to what he described as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" A defiant and visibly angry President struck back when he was questioned about that last night.

But, it was what came afterwards, taking the questions that he was clearly prepared to take from reporters about his memory, age issues and everything else.

And let's just pick up there, Jackie, because Dan Pfeiffer did come out and basically say, look, like if you're out there all the time and you make these little mistakes all the time, then it stops being something that people remark upon. Now, I do think that this happens a little bit more frequently than a lot of times breaks through. This was a very high-profile instance. President Biden has messed up other names, as Matt was kind of -- and Mo was talking about that Trump has done the same thing. Right? But, that said, Donald Trump actually uses this to great effect. Right? He says outrageous things all the time to the point that the outrage just becomes noise. I mean, is there an argument to be made for Biden to just go out there and make the mistakes? I mean, it does feel like the administration, the people around him are doing this from a defensive crouch. JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, the bubble wrapping him is not going to help him get to -- I mean, you can do that. They are running against former President Trump, who just says a lot of stuff all the time. And some of that breaks through. But, keeping him cloistered, feeds into another unfavorable narrative, right, that they're trying to hide him from the American public. And that's not going to fly going into this deep general election, which we're essentially traipsing into right now. And you really haven't seen. Last night was the first time I can remember that Biden actually seemed to confront the age issue head on, even a little bit.

CNN projects that he won the Nevada caucuses with almost 100 percent of the vote. OK. That was him and one nominal candidate, Ryan Binkley, although his supporters in Iowa wouldn't want me to call him that. Nikki Haley did not participate in that contest. She had put her name on Tuesday's primary ballot where she lost to the option \"none of these candidates.\" That does sting a little bit. Meanwhile, here in Washington, there was that pivotable -- pivotal, excuse me, Supreme Court hearing. Questions from the justices seemed to signal that they were pretty skeptical of Colorado's right to remove Trump from the ballot, and they largely avoided the merits, the topic of the insurrection, which is all pretty welcome news if you're Trump.
