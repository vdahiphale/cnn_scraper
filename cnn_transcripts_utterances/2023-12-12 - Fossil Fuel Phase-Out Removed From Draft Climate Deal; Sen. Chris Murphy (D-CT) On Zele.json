But that's absolutely remarkable to listen to Vladimir Putin's mouthpieces on Russian state TV celebrating Republicans' decision to hold up aid to Ukraine, which they say they support because they want to get Trump border policies put into law -- something that the American people don't support. I just think this is too important to play games over. Yes, I'm in the room trying to figure out a path forward on these Republican demands because failure cannot be an option. But we shouldn't have to be here. If we all agree that it would be terrible for America and terrible for the world for Vladimir Putin to march through Ukraine and potentially into Europe, then let's stop him from doing that. I have lots of domestic political priorities. I would like to see universal background checks or a ban on assault weapons passed. But I am not conditioning my support to stop Vladimir Putin's march into Ukraine upon the resolution of my domestic political priorities because if all of us did that Washington would grind to a halt. We've got to get things done when we agree. And Republicans say that they support Ukraine funding, so I wish they would just put their votes where their mouth is.

But there is some good news. We passed, last year, the first bipartisan major change in gun laws in 30 years. We broke the back of the NRA. And overall gun violence rates in this country are actually down by a significant number since we passed that bill over 10 percent. The mass shootings are still high but there are far fewer people dying from guns this year than last year because we passed legislation making it harder for dangerous people to get guns. Now, that means there's 100 people, not 110 people dying every day. That's still far too high. But it shows what is possible, and what is possible is real changes in gun laws because we've built a movement since Sandy Hook of kids, adults, community members to make sure that we are more powerful than the NRA.
