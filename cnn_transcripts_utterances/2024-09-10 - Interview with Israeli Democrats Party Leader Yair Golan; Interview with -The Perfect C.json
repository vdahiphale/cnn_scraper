I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, it's been more than 11 months since the brutal attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7th, and still the war grinds on. Health officials are counting the many dead after an Israeli strike on a designated humanitarian zone in Southern Gaza. The Israeli military claims that it struck significant Hamas terrorists in a command and control center. Hamas denies placing fighters in the area. Meantime, living conditions within the enclave are intolerable. Communications diseases -- communicable diseases spreading, including polio, as sanitary conditions collapse. Reports of wounds infested by maggots in Gaza hospitals are becoming almost routine. And still, more than 100 hostages remain in captivity. We begin our coverage of all of this with correspondent Matthew Chance for more on the Israeli strike on Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As rescue workers scramble for survivors, eyewitnesses say the Israeli strikes targeted what was meant to be a safe zone in the Southern Gaza Strip, ripping through tents and makeshift shelters, leaving deep craters and dozens of killed and injured. They told us this area was safe, says this man. I swear the people here were just normal, he says, not fighters. By daylight, you can see the extent of the destruction. Israel's military says it conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists, operating a command and control center inside this humanitarian zone. An IDF statement says prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. But this was a heavily populated area and civilians were caught up in the powerful blasts. This man says he's two daughters were completely buried under the sand. Only one survived, he says. And he says he found the body parts of his neighbors strewn around. This 12-year-old girl is nursing a broken shoulder, suffered when her tent collapsed, she says, trapping her and her mother inside. I was scared because the strikes were so close, she says. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields and insists the Israeli military takes extensive measures to enable civilians in Gaza to avoid combat zones. But there's little real security in this brutal war. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And no doubt, according to all polls for the last -- since the war erupted, that the coalition has a very low number of seats in the next Knesset, according to the polls. So, we need to change this government because this government has no legitimacy to keep its rule over Israel. The other side -- the other part is the trauma. The Israeli public is under terrible trauma. Think about it. The scale of the Hamas attack on October 7th comparing to the Israeli people, you know, comparing to the event of the September 11th is much, much bigger. So, it's a different scale. So, Israel is under terrible trauma. And people in time of trauma tend to adopt a more, I would say, a vigorous stance. And this is not exactly what we need right now. Right now, we need to keep thinking from our minds and our brains, rather than from our stomach. And no doubt that the most desirable situation for Israel is to free all the hostages, because freeing all the hostages that symbolizes the ability of the Israeli people to keep a sense of solidarity. And I -- you know, I think about the days after the war, and in order to recover, we need solidarity, a strong sense of solidarity. And there is no other thing, no other issue like the hostages' question, which symbolizes the importance of solidarity.",

What do you say to Israelis who argue that leaving Gaza is what got Israel in this place to begin with on October 7th?

We have tens of thousands of Israelis living like refugees in their own country. This is the most devastating blow the Zionist project ever got.\" You know that is not the position, at least not right now, of the U.S. government. I do want to ask you, though, where you are in agreement with the U.S. government and more so than the current administration under Prime Minister Netanyahu, and that is what the day after in Gaza will look like. Because you said, yes, that you do need to fight all militants there and build an alternative that includes working with the Palestinian Authority.

So, what is better for Israel, working with the one who want to kill us or working with some sort of a moderate element, although not Zionist in the Palestinian society? So, I think the answer is quite clear. So, therefore, in our region, you need to work with the people who are willing to work with you.

And I saw that Rochester, New York was facing an especially stark example of this challenge. A huge drop in enrollment since the pandemic. They've lost about 10 percent of their students since 2019, and as a result, we're having to think about closing a lot of schools and embark on that process. We're basically already into this process that a lot of other cities around the country are going to be facing.

And so, you just had a lot of families that chose to leave the public schools during that period. They left for private schools, parochial schools, many of which had stayed open for most of the pandemic. They left for homeschooling. And then, even after schools reopened, many of these districts, when families -- when some families came back, when some kids came back, they found that things were so unruly. A lot of schools were really wrestling with very kind of just kind of crazy behaviors in classrooms, kids coming back after being away for so long, being kind of unsocialized. So, a lot of families made the decision at that point that they are going to move their kids out of the public schools. And so, we've had this really unprecedented drop nationwide, about 1 million kids off of the public school rolls. And that very naturally leads many cities with more space, more staff, more buildings than they need, and they're now then having to consider this really, really difficult upheaval that's involved in closing schools in certain neighborhoods.",

Seattle is facing the closure of many of its elementary schools. Ann Arbor, Michigan, a quite wealthy city, is facing a huge budget deficit as a result of having lost about a thousand students there.

And then on top of that, there's research that is showing, even in prior years, when districts set out to close schools because of under enrollment, that seems to fall disproportionately heavily on black and brown majority schools, even beyond what one would expect from the enrollment numbers and the school performance numbers. It just seems to, unfortunately, kind of cut that way. There seems to be a bias, really, in the way that districts end up closing schools. And the research also shows, unfortunately, that kids whose schools have been closed, to have to move to other schools, that that has a consequence, a lasting consequence on their academic performance. That doesn't mean it's a mistake to close the schools. Many cases, it's unavoidable. If your numbers get so low, it's really hard to justify keeping schools open.

And you -- and the district -- the kids that remain in the district are very disproportionately have special needs designations. And so, you just have a very high special needs population.

And so, it was -- there was this real plea coming up in those parents in Rochester as much as possible keep the kids and their educators together. As they are -- as the school or many that were going was being shut down, and it was just very hard for the district to actually do that when it came time to make assignments.

There are similar programs in some other cities. And so, you've had these dynamics that are going on for some time now that have made things tough for urban schools.
