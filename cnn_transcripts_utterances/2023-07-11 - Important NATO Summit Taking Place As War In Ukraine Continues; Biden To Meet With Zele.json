Now, there are some reforms, good governance, rule of law, political reforms that Ukraine still needs to work on. And we understand that pretty hard to work on some of those reforms when you're at war. And of course, they are at war right now.So, NATO membership in the immediate future isn't likely because that would put NATO at war with Russia. Now, what the allies will do over the next couple of days is talk about a pathway to get Ukraine there eventually, and what that pathway needs to look like. And part of that path, Phil, will be making sure that the allies stay united on two things. One, supporting Ukraine in the fight they're in so that they can succeed in this war against Russia. And two, that we look at their long-term self-defense needs. What kind of security commitments are they going to need from the United States and from allies and partners as they work towards that path towards NATO membership? Eventually, they'll get there, but there's a lot of things that still need to be done before, you know, we are -- we reach that point.",

And we don't know exactly what those needs are going to be for Ukraine. But one thing is sure, they're going to still have a long border with Russia that they're going to need to protect, and they're going to find in the United States, and they're going to find in now 32 members of the NATO alliance.

This is a terrific modern military that we're used to working with. We know they use western equipment and systems. They're really going to really add to NATO's eastern flank. We're grateful that President Erdogan was willing to make this bold step and move forward. And I think a lot of it was, frankly, to your question, a lot of it was based on conversations and dialogue between Sweden and Turkey over Turkish concerns and making sure the concerns were appropriately addressed.

It's an artillery fight and they're trying to get through minefields while being shelled by the Russians. So, it is a very heavily dependent -- it's a heavily -- it's a fight that is heavily dependent on artillery, and they are going through many thousands of rounds per day. And it's difficult for the west to keep up with the artillery shell production that they need, what we call unitary shells. Single explosive shells.And so, while we are ramping up our production of those shells, and we are, we aren't where we want to be. So, as a bridge so that they don't run out of shells, so that they can continue to fight in this gun fight, we're going to provide them with a bridging solution of some cluster munitions. Now, the cluster munitions do add some capability to them. They do allow them a little bit more flexibility in breaking through some of the Russian defenses. But the main reason is really to get us a bridge to a larger production rate of unitary normal artillery shells that they can continue to use in this counteroffensive.",

They've met in the evidence phase of this investigation to gather evidence in this Trump probe. And they've already handed over their charging recommendations to Fani Willis. Willis will now take those charging recommendations to one of the two grand juries that will be selected today. Those -- that grand jury, it'll be up to them on whether or not they decide to bring an indictment against the former president and some of the biggest names in his orbit.

But look at this walking bridge, this trestle bridge just to the west of where we are. It's starting to overtake that bridge as well. Keep in mind, we're a block from the state capitol here. The Wrightsville Reservoir is just north, on the north branch of the Winooski River. That went up 42 feet in about 12 hours.

And people who are merely white nationalists, who believe in the supremacy of white people. But this is not a difference, this is not a difference. A distinction without a difference, it doesn't make much sense.His comments make more sense, when you consider what he said in October at a campaign rally with the most abjectly racist thing I've heard from a U.S. Senator in decades. and I'm quoting here, and he said this on tape. So, at some point later today, you can roll the tape and he said Democrats quote, want crime because they want to take over what you got. They want reparations, because they think -- they think the people that do the crime are owed that. Now, as we all know, reparation is there's a debate going on about whether the descendants of former slaves should be paid reparations because of the -- of that history. But the idea that he defines the people that do the crime as the descendants of slaves is nakedly racist, that Senator Tuberville's own words. And I think that there are serious questions about his views when it comes to matters of race and white supremacy. BROWN: Yes, that was really illuminating. I remember what he said that. Wow. Let's talk about something else in the news today, Jake Tapper, and that is what Donald Trump's legal team is seeking to postpone the trial and the classified documents case. They're even signaling that they may want to wait until after the 2024 election because they argue it would be unfair to do so while he is running. Clearly, this a delay, a potential a delay would be advantageous for the former President.",

So, it's not anything that I would not expect his lawyers to be pushing.And in fact, it suggests that his lawyers, at least in this case, have some idea of what they're doing and are aggressively representing their client. I do not expect the judge in this case to go along with that. That is -- that's not a legal argument, to say. I want to be able to push this off because I'm going to be busy running for President.
