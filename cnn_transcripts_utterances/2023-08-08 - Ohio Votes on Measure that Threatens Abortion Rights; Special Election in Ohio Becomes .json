I know you'll be on top of all of it. And we'll probably see you interviewing a voter at a diner sometime soon. Good to see you.John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. This morning, Former Vice President Mike Pence says he has met the requirements to take the stage in the first Republican presidential debate, which really is just a few weeks away. Pence says, he reached the 40,000 unique donor threshold. He's already met the polling requirement. His campaign released this statement, Mike Pence made quick and easy work of the donor threshold, and he is looking forward to a substantive debate about the issues important to the American people. Hopefully, Former President Trump has the courage to show up. With us now, CNN Political Director David Chalian.

Now, he runs more as a pseudo-incumbent, which is a different position, and he runs as much more solid frontrunner, John, than he did there.There you see on the screen the eight Republican candidates who have qualified for the debate stage. We should note, John, that's according to them, to their campaigns.

That is what Ron DeSantis is doing. He's about to have his third consecutive weekend on an Iowa bus tour, not put on by his campaign, but sponsored by his super PAC, again, that he can't legally coordinate a strategize with.So, this is a real test of how campaigns are run. But to your point, I think the other candidates clearly are going to want to take some more out of Ron DeSantis if they can. But I don't think you're going to see the kind of focus on him and just him as a Trump substitute if Trump is not on the stage.

There is lithium in Thacker Pass, the northern part of Nevada that is creating great tension there. There is a copper mine in Arizona that some tribes are fighting back against as well.
