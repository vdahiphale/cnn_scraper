Those are the markets and these are the main events. A new agreement to cap Russian oil prices comes into force with fallout across insurance, shipping, and energy. Foxconn revenue falls 29 percent as it grapples with COVID issues. And Brazil has a commanding lead over South Korea on the action underway at the World Cup. Live from New York. It is Monday, December 5th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest, and I too mean business. Good evening. Tonight, Western allies have launched their biggest assault get on Russia's oil revenue. The EU has now banned new Russian oil shipments. It is also working with the G7 and Australia to impose a price cap on Russian crude. The move aims to choke off funding for Moscow's war machine, but Russia says that it will not recognize the price cap, even if it means cutting production. Still, global oil prices are lower. You can see WTI is off about three-and-a-half percent, Brent off about 3.2 percent. The price cap was set at $60.00 a barrel. It will be implemented by shipping and insurance companies. Under the new rules, they will be barred from handling the oil unless it is sold for a price that is equal to or less than the price cap. Shipments that meet that test can still be delivered to countries outside the EU. Now, given that the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, well, it could be difficult for major buyers like India and China to get around the price cap. However, Russia may also try to use its own ships. So far, the rollout has been difficult. \"The Financial Times\" reporting a backlog of ships is building in Turkey. Clare Sebastian with us now. Clare, lots of moving parts here. Oil prices were higher earlier, as we said they are now lower. I think there are so a lot of questions not only about the impact of these measures, but also how it will work. Walk us through that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think look, this is obviously a very delicate balance that the EU and G7 have tried to strike by settingthe cap at $60.00. They are trying to keep Russian oil flowing all through this crisis, Rahel, it's been clear that the US and its Western allies, Ukraine's allies do not want Russian oil to come off the market because of the destabilizing effect it will have on the global economy. It could cause another supply shock. So the $60.00 barrel mark is designed to leave some profit for Russia. We think the breakeven is around thirty to forty, possibly slightly lower. There are various estimates of that, but they should still make a profit, although it is slightly below some estimates of what Euro's crude is trading for right now, so it will still eat into some of Russia's potential revenues. But in terms of how it will work well, this should be seen really as sort of a market mechanism to reduce demand for Russian oil, which sells over the price gap, if that makes sense. It is not so much a ban because if you're going to use shipping services or insurance that comes from non-EU or non-G7 countries, you can still do it. Russia, as you say is looking at ways to circumvent this by amassing according to reports a shadow fleet of its own, apparently slightly rickety old tankers to try to get around this as well. So, there are loopholes. Russia, though, has said that it will potentially retaliate. It has threatened to cut off customers who comply with the cap. If they do that, then the delicate balance struck by the setting of the price cap at $60.00 might not work. We might still see some destabilization to the global market.",

Actually, it is the price Russian oil companies were dreaming about in 2016 and 2018, when the prices were at $45.00. So $60.00 is really quite comfortable, and even if the mechanism is working properly, which is not actually clear, then we might not see the real results of oil embargo and oil price cap regulation until mid-2023. The Russian oil companies will definitely try to adapt to use all the bypassing routes to develop these shadow fleets to create Russia's own shipping insurance company, so they will look for all the ways how to bypass this regulation, and I would say, Russian economy anyway would not collapse in half a year due to the lack of oil revenues. It is still quite resilient, and financial resources accumulated in the National Welfare Fund during the previous years are definitely sufficient to cover the budget deficit, at least for one year or so.",

It's a relief from scenes like this, Bakhmut's Ukrainian Field Hospital. He has been defending this Ukrainian town from Russia's most intense assault along an 800-mile front. Artillery duels and trench warfare have almost destroyed Bakhmut as Russia throws its Army at a bid for victory after months of defeats to the North and South. Defending Bakhmut against the Russian Motherland is a religious imperative for Cesar. (CESAR speaking in foreign language.) KILEY (voice over): \"The fighting is very brutal now,\" he says. \"There are very few prisoners.\" When you see those Russians in your gun sights. What do you think? And what do you feel? (CESAR speaking in foreign language.) KILEY (voice over): \"I believe that these people who have broken the law of man and the law of God, I have no pity for them.
