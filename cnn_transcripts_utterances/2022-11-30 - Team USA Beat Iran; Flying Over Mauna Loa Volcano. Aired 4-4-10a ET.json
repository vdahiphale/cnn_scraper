A tie wouldn`t cut it this time around. And into the 38th minute, this place just exploded when Christian Pulisic came through with that goal to give the USA the 1-0 lead.

But today, there are only 15 full-line Sears stores still open across the country and the company filed for bankruptcy years ago. We`ll hear now from CNN`s Rachel Crane on the slow demise of the iconic chain and how it was once both the Amazon and Walmart of its day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sears is in trouble, closing thousands of stores and losing billions of dollars. But once upon a time, Sears transformed the way Americans shopped. Back in the late 1800s in Minnesota, Richard Sears was spending his days as a railroad station agent, until one day, he sold some watches from a local jeweler and realized he was really good at selling. So, in 1886, he started a mail order company, the RW Sears Watch Company, and eventually hired a watchmaker Alva C. Roebuck. And in 1893, Sears Roebuck and Co. was born. Sears then became a very successful mail-order catalog company. This business model broke the mold. Remember, most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores. They often made their own clothes and furniture or did without. Sears early catalogs only featured watches and jewelry. But soon these catalogs were more than 500 pages long, people could buy anything, from shoes, wagons, stoves and musical instruments. Sometimes, people even bought their homes directly from Sears. And because Sears bought in bulk, the company was able to charge customers lower prices. In 1925, Sears opened its first retail location in Chicago, and it wasn`t just retail. Sears had a radio station, a mortgage business, a credit card. Sears was everywhere. Annual sales hit one billion dollars in 1945. The next year, sales doubled. Once Americans started to move to the booming suburbs after World War II, Sears began investing to help build malls. By 1970, Sears was considered untouchable by its rivals. But not all stories have a happy ending. As the 20th century came to a close, so did Sears` reign. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
