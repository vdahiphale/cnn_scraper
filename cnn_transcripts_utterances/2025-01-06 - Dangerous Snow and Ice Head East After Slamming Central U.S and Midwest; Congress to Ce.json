Snow and ice emergencies have been declared across several states, with the worst of it about to hit Washington, D.C., where even a small dusting can normally shut things down. And this is way more than a small dusting.This morning, three inches of snow could fall each hour. Unclear if it will slow down the count of the Electoral College votes. It is after all January 6th and Congress has work to do. Washington could get 16 inches of snow by the time it's done, which would be nearly double the snowfall for 2023 and 2024 combined. Travel is extremely dangerous this morning. Interstates are paralyzed with trucks jackknifed everywhere. Thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled. So, it is a mess. Let's get right to Meteorologist Derek Van Dam to find out how things look at this moment, Derek.",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. Even the National Weather Service warns that the primary roads could become impassable with the snowfall rates that they're expecting in and around Washington D.C. This is coming out of Kansas City, Missouri. The ice part of the storm then snow fell on top of this. It slid cars off of the highways. It jackknifed 18-wheelers. This is an intense, very powerful storm as people return home from their holidays and they're left with this mess.And the storm spans about 800 miles from St. Louis all the way to the nation's capital. I want you to see the winter weather alerts that are in place for millions of Americans as it stands this morning waking up on Monday morning. It is going to be difficult travel conditions. And I promise you this is the Lincoln Memorial here way in the distance in D.C. It's just shrouded in cloud and snow that is currently falling in and around D.C., 28 degrees right now around the nation's capital. I do want you to see the heaviest band of snow is just setting up south of Washington. So, that's something to consider. There is some drier air starting to settle in and then another round of snow will impact not only the evening commute in D.C. but overnight tonight as well. So, if they see over a foot of snow, this will actually eclipse the Snowzilla. That was the term that they gave the last major snow storm that was over a foot in D.C. But it looks like with latest radar trends, the heaviest snow will be just south of the city into Southern Maryland and into southern sections of Delaware. And into the spine of the Appalachians, of course, that's where we'll pick up a good foot of snow in some locations. Can't forget about the ice potential of this, this is going to create very slick roadways, especially Interstate 70, the I-95 corridor, as you travel north and south. And with the ice accumulating on the, well, let's say, the tree limbs as also and also the electrical wires, this is taking down some power and locations, 250,000 customers without power as it stands, there's a secondary band of snowfall behind this first walloping of snow in D.C. So, as you get that low in the midday parts of the afternoon, plan ahead. Because as you head home from work this evening in and around the nation's capital, another round of snow will greet you just in time for the evening rush, John, something to consider.",

At 1:00 P.M. this afternoon, as dictated by the Constitution, lawmakers will begin counting the electoral votes to certify Donald Trump's November victory, which also means that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the one presiding over the certification and presiding over her election loss. CNN's Lauren Fox has it all for us. It is going to be an important day. It always is an important day, but one that takes on so much more significance now. What are you expecting, Lauren?

Traditionally, viewers at home maybe would have been paying minimal attention to the certification of the election on Capitol Hill, in part because it was not traditionally that transformative of a day in Washington. It was really an opportunity to simply count the votes that had already been cast. Obviously, that changed four years ago.But today, what we expect is a return, hopefully, to normalcy. What we know is that the president of the Senate, who in this case is Vice President Kamala Harris, she will preside over a joint session of Congress. At the same time, what she will do is she will open each state's envelope, then she will hand them to four tellers. That's the top Republican and the top Democrat in both the House and the Senate, who are going to be counting the votes today. And those are the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Administrative Committees. But then, that's it. If no one challenges the election, which we don't expect Democrats to challenge any of these results, then they basically go through that and it could be over in just under an hour. Obviously, Kate, that is very different than what we saw last year, where even after that historic attack on the Capitol, there were several Republicans who challenged the results of the election as they were trying to count and certify.

I mean, what we have seen over the last several days is Republicans really cementing around a different strategy than they had cemented around in December, which is that House Republicans, the speaker in particular, are pushing for one large package using a process known as reconciliation, which essentially just means that it is something that they can pass with just 51 votes, a simple majority in the United States Senate.Here's why that's a little bit different than what they've been talking about before. Previously, they had thought of doing two separate bills, and John Thune, who's the incoming majority leader in the Senate, he had been arguing for trying to pass something in the first hundred days dealing specifically with border security. His hope is that you could create some kind of momentum around passing something quickly for the new president, Donald Trump. Now that strategy is shifting. They want to do a larger tax and border bill in one. The challenge with that, Kate, is you have narrow majorities in the House and the Senate. That's a lot to pack in one single bill. And you heard the speaker yesterday setting out a very ambitious deadline, saying he's hoping to finish it by the end of April. That doesn't give them much time. Kate?",

The FBI has now confirmed the man who carried out the terror attack that killed 14 people, visited New Orleans twice in the months before New Year's Day and wore a pair, and you're seeing it there, of smart glasses to film the French Quarter and plan out what he would do. He also wore those same glasses during the attack, though they had not been activated.CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe got up early for us this morning. I appreciate you coming on. Investigators also found that he traveled to Egypt and Canada. Would they be looking into who he met in those places to see if there are further links to ISIS?",

And the reason is this is the only lead, investigative lead that we are aware of right now that could really bring the government, particularly law enforcement and intelligence communities, closer to preventing other attacks. If this attacker, Jabbar, met with individuals who were in any way related to his attack in New Orleans, in helping him think about it, helping him plan it, helping him pick a target, providing him any sort of training, financial support, whatever that might be, this is the opportunity for the government to identify a potential terrorist node that could lead them to identifying other operatives who have attacks planned here in the United States or in other countries.So, this is a crucial detail.

And that's based predominantly on the videos that he created during his drive to New Orleans. But if you listen to the choice of words, he actually says in one of the videos, I joined ISIS, which is an odd thing for someone to say who's only been following them online and consuming their propaganda. The use of I joined suggests to me that he actually had some contact with someone in ISIS.Now, that's a stretch. We don't have any evidence to back that up yet.

You're just looking at a small sliver of the facts that you'll have eventually. But in the immediate aftermath, we knew that he had traveled to the attack site literally hours before, right, within the day preceding the attack. And that suggests a certain like hastiness in terms of maybe target selection and methods and things like that.But what we know now is he's been planning this for months, not one but two trips to New Orleans in the lead up to the attack, conducted extensive surveillance with those Meta glasses that have been talked about a lot since the press conference. The simple fact that he was riding around surveilling the area, creating videos that he could look at later, as he was actually sketching out the details of his plan, very significant there. And then, of course, the rental truck, he knew at least six weeks in advance exactly what type of vehicle he was looking for to do this attack. So, it all shows a very high level of organizational capability. He's the type of guy that could do this sort of disciplined approach.
