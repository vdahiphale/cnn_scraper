Nineteen children and two teachers were killed that day two years ago.Now, Pete Arredondo, the police chief who led the botched response, is indicted on ten counts of child endangerment and criminal negligence according to an official at the county jail. Another officer working under him is charged as well. It took 77 minutes, as a reminder, before police finally moved in to stop the killing. Joining us right now is Jesse Rizo. He is the uncle of one of the children killed that day. Little Jackie Cazares. He also was recently elected to the Uvalde School Board. Jesse, thanks for being here. These charges -- charges is something that you have been calling for in every conversation we have had over the last two years. What's your reaction to this?",

He walks away from the situation. That's an individual that I'm perplexed about, that I cannot understand why he wasn't indicted.

And they choose that alternate path where you deny. All you're doing is tearing up the town, you're tearing up the families. You're ripping everybody's hard apart.So, it is going to be up to them. You know, they have to accept the fact that they failed on it. They -- and whatever consequences they're faced with, they must accept them. And whether it's prison time, you know, three years, ten years, whatever it is, you got -- you have to -- you just have to allow their processes to take place. It is going to -- it is going to take a lot of time because there are people, obviously, that still support Mr. Arredondo and the other officers and you can't get past the point of, they're such nice people. They were such nice guys. And we don't take that from anybody. But it's hard to make those type of individuals understand the magnitude of the failure on May 24th.

And I do also just want to quickly make clear that even though Donald Trump's team had declared before the debate even ended that he had won it, remember, he lied repeatedly during the debate. He lied about his role in January 6th. He lied about the -- about immigration, economy, the national debt, a number of things that our team has been fact-checking. But the impression that many voters got, and we've seen from our initial polling on that, is that by and large they agree that they think Donald Trump won.And so I think to your point about needing to stay tuned to see how Americans over the next week feel and how this resonated with them will be a very important footnote in the larger debate of looking forward to November.

Of course, this goes further.CNN's Ed Lavandera is joining us now.

So, he issued this edict yesterday saying that the Bible and Ten Commandments is expected to be incorporated in all classrooms in Oklahoma starting next school year, that all teachers must teach from the Bible, that the foundational documents used for the Constitution and the birth of the country, that these are necessary, historical documents for students to understand western civilization. As you might imagine, there's been a great deal of pushback on the superintendent. The Americans United for Separation of Church and State says that Ryan Walters is abusing his power, that this edict is unconstitutional, and that he is trampling religious freedoms in the country. Other critics, non-Christian critics, are coming out against what Walters has said as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
