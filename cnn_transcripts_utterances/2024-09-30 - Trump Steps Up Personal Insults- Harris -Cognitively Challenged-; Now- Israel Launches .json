There's something wrong Kamala and I just don't know what it is, but there is definitely something missing and you know what? Everybody knows it.

They are characterizing it as, quote, limited localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah targets along the border. I've been told that these operations are concentrated on Lebanese villages close to the border, where these really military has gathered intelligence and belief that there are indeed Hezbollah targets there. Now, I've reported earlier today that the Israeli military had already begun carrying out special operations in recent days to gather intelligence in preparation for this ground defensive. And tonight what the Israeli military it is confirming is that of force of its troops is indeed crossing into Lebanon supported by artillery fire, supported by the air force, and is indeed carrying out this ground operation. They want to characterize this, of course, as a limited ground operation that was the understanding that Israeli officials reached with the White House making clear that it would remain limited. But of course, once you have troops going from one country into another country, there is no telling where this can go from here, Erin, and certainly with Israeli troops now, going into Lebanon, going after for Hezbollah on the ground, following the major escalations that we have watched over the course of the last two weeks with the enormous increase in Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon and eastern Lebanon in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, I think its very clear right now that this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has indeed escalated into war -- Erin.",

And one of those things is that first of all, the, special operations had already been happening in the days before this.And when the Israeli military has coming out and saying and ground operation has begun in the last few hours. They are no longer just talking about special operator ration. They're talking about something more significant. Now, I was cautioned by some sources that this is not a very large force going into Lebanon, but they wouldn't say exactly how many forces there are. And as I've said before, they are incentivized continue to characterize this as limited as targeted, as small. And I would also note that when Israel began its ground operation in Gaza, which, of course, we've now seen Israeli troops pour throughout the Gaza strip invading the entire strip effectively, at the time, they also characterize that as a limited ground operation that was slowly, slowly expanding. And of course, it ultimately expanded into an all-out invasion. I'm not suggesting that's going to be the case here with Lebanon. We don't know how deep this is going to go. Some former generals who I've spoken to suggested that Israel should perhaps capture eight miles of territory into Lebanon to remove the threat of anti-tank guided missiles from the area of northern Israel where some 60,000 residents have been evacuated. It's not clear if Israel is going to go that deep yet, but again, we will see, I expect that we will see in the coming days, has this operation will likely expand it will go deeper into southern Lebanon.

They were trying to figure out what to do and they took this calculated gamble that the Iranians were going to be at the end of the day more cautious, that the Houthis were going to be more cautious, that Hezbollah would not be able to quickly retaliate. And so far, that has proven right.I think what you are seeing is that Israel is the superpower militarily of the Middle East today. And it is able to strike at will in a way that it's very hard to retaliate. You raise, Erin, the crucial issue. It's one thing to be able to get rid of bad guys. It's another to figure out what to do with the space, the land. That's what we discovered after Saddam Hussein, after Moammar Gadhafi, after the Taliban. It's what Israel is discovery in Gaza after they got rid of the initial -- the initial ground invasion.

Vance's former Yale Law school classmate and close friend for a decade. Many of our viewers, Sofia, remember you from the last time when you were on talking about your long friendship with J.D. Vance and his wife. Now, you have also been a vocal defender of trans rights. And when we last spoke, you share that Vance had supported you when you had your own gender affirming surgery, he brought the baked goods as you recovered. This was in 2012. So what's your reaction when you hear Mark's reporting that Trump and Vance are going all in on this issue and obviously you could see for yourself and ad like that, was airing during football yesterday. SOFIA NELSON, JD VANCE'S FORMER YALE CLASSMATE AND FRIEND:  Thanks for having me back, Erin. I have two reactions to this strategy. First and foremost, Kamala Harris is a lifelong prosecutor. She was attorney general of California. She understands the law deeply and she understood that the United States Supreme Court made clear that to deny medically necessary care to incarcerated people is unconstitutional and violates the Eighth Amendment. And she, when she was answering that question, she was aware of Ninth Circuit precedent, which covers the state of California, I'm sure, that that extends to providing the medically necessary gender affirming care. So I suppose she could have said, no, we should violate the law and not do this, but that doesn't strike me as the kind of person that she is and the lawyer that she is. But more importantly, Erin, this is just not an issue that affects everyday people. I don't go around asking people what medication there on what surgeries they have had because like Tim Walz, I know how to mind my own damn business, and I don't think that whether I've had surgery or whether someone else has surgery is important to everyday Americans. This election is about freedom. It's about privacy and it's about everyday economic issues, kitchen table issues, and that's -- this is just a distraction. It's another way of dividing us. It's another way of spewing in hate and fear and to distract from the important economic issues like which side is pro-union? Which side is going to help Americans afford their first home with down payment assistance?",

But it is a test for how Americans connect with them and what they hear policy, but also connection.And that's why I want to ask you in the context of how well you knew J.D. Vance. You had shared a message that he sent with a sent with us -- and he sent to you in 2016? He apologized for describing you in his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy\", as an extremely progressive lesbian that was a quote in the book. So in this message that you shared, he writes, you, he calls you Sofs, says nickname and he says, I recognize now, but this may not accurately reflect how you think of yourself. And for that, I'm really sorry. I hope you recognize that the description came from a place of ignorance. When I first started writing years ago, I hope you're not offended, but if you are, I'm sorry. Love you, JD.
