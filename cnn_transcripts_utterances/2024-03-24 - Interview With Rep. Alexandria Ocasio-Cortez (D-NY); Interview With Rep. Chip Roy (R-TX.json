They don't want to do the things the American people want us to do. I think we should. And I think Republicans should stand up on that platform and advance it. And we should not use as an excuse -- and this is going to be the big -- to answer your question, the big decision point for the speaker. We should not put Ukraine funding on the floor of the House unless we have come to an agreement that we're going to make sure that Israel is taken care of properly, that we pay for this stuff, and that we do what we're supposed to do to secure the border of the United States. Not $1 should go to the Ukraine funding, not $1, if the border of the United States is wide open to allow Chinese foreign nationals, people from all over the world, dangerous individuals... J.

I disagreed with it. It was a mistake. Kevin was actually honoring most of the agreement that we came up with. We were actually having bills that we had 72 hours to read. You know what? That got violated this last week. Mike was wrong. We were actually putting bills on the floor with amendments. We had 1,100 amendments processed.

Appropriations bills were being passed, yes, not in full agreement with my Democratic colleagues, but then you should have gone to the Senate, we should -- they should have passed bills and we should have conferenced them. That's what's broken in this godforsaken town, while the American people wonder why their businesses can function and their nonprofits and their homes, they can manage budgets. But, in Washington, we just print money and we retreat to our corners and shoot at each other. Look, I think Speaker Johnson -- I have been public about this -- made a mistake when he walked away from the bipartisan caps and a C.R. that could have put pressure on my Democratic colleagues to come to the table. That was a mistake. I don't think this bill was reflective of what the American people want. It expands government, increases spending, increases debt, doesn't secure the border, doesn't do what we need to do, advances a radical agenda, doesn't make our defense focused on mission, instead of social engineering. I think we should have changed those things. Now let's get busy. But I can promise you, if you put a Ukraine bill on the floor and you haven't secured the border, there's going to be a problem within the -- within the ranks on Capitol Hill. So let's focus on doing our job. There are people across the spectrum. And here's another thing. All last year, we had great conversation, Brian Fitzpatrick, some of the New York delegation, myself, Mike Garcia in California, moderates, conservatives, figuring out how to advance the ball. And we passed the Limit, Save, Grow. Conservatives voted to increase the debt ceiling. We have never done that before. We passed the strongest border security bill we have ever passed. J.

This lawfare, if you want to use that framing and phraseology, this targeting of the former president, whether you're talking about impeachment, which was done, whether you're talking about all of these cases, there's multiple cases, all of that is having an inverse effect, right? The average hardworking American is out there are saying, what are you doing? All of this politics is going on. And then they complain about whether Jeff Yass is going to buy up the TRUTH Social and whether that's going to happen. Look, when you play these lawfare games, then you're going to win stupid prizes. And the fact is, right now, the president, the former president, is gaining in popularity against a feeble current president destroying our country, attacking Israel, undermining our country with open borders. And President Trump is actually gaining popularity because they're just focusing on trying to go after him. I think that's -- we're -- you're seeing the product of that in real time. And what we need to right now is to focus on the issues the American people care about, secure the border, stop spending money we don't have. Look, if you're going to stand up, stand up with Israel. Do not fund Israel until you have dealt with your own border, and stop destroying the American dream and making it impossible to afford health care. I saw Barack Obama out championing Obamacare. We have had a quadrupling of the price of health insurance since Obamacare was passed. Nobody can afford it. And nobody can get coverage. A woman in my district who can't even go to M.D. Anderson when she's got stage four cancer under coverage because they have forced it through this crappy health care coverage. I'm a cancer survivor. I couldn't go back to M.D. Anderson on the Obamacare I have currently as a member of Congress, or that I would have under the policies. So, look, the American people want us to fight for them. That's what we need to do for the next six months. And if we do that, if the president who showed up to drain the swamp and build the wall is the guy running, he will do fine. J.

A lot of folks, though, that are getting in front of the camera and have the leverage in the Republican Party are just there for performance. It seems like they want to grow their X or Instagram followers more than pass bills. And I think that, when you get to a point and you see, man, we even have the majority as Republicans and we can't even work together, it's frustrating. I would be frustrated too. And so maybe these folks are leaving, saying, there's another path for me to help the American public. I also think, though, you -- they have a one-person majority because people are resigning, but the Republican majority was not that large to begin with at the beginning of this conference. And when you're an adult and you realize that the numbers don't always work in your favor, you have to work with other adults that are congresspeople. And that's not what the Republicans want to do. And so, at this point, I think some folks are just saying -- I will note, though, Democrats aren't really resigning, because they also are saying, if we get the majority back in the fall, we can get some things done. J. TAPPER:  So, big story tomorrow is going to be Donald Trump and whether or not he's able to pony up for this almost $500 million bond. And, if not, the attorney general of New York, Letitia James, could start seizing his assets. Trump did say on TRUTH Social, his social media app, that he does have the money. He wrote -- quote -- \"Through hard work, talent and luck, I currently have almost $500 million in cash, a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president,\" though his lawyers told the judge earlier this week that he does not have the money and that posting the full bond of the size was a practical impossibility.

Do they want a president who's a cheat? And, hopefully, they see what it was like under his presidency, what it's like under the Biden presidency, and we will give President Biden four more years to finish the job, and just even looking at what's been accomplished in his short time, whether it was the CHIPS Act, whether it's the IRA, which is creating jobs, the economy is doing well, even if people don't feel it. We have got to go and remind people that we need time to implement all those laws, so they are going to feel it, because prescription drug prices haven't even started being negotiated yet.
