They made their pitch to voters in their only debate just five weeks out from election day. It was a notably amicable and polite debate, a rarity for modern American politics, though there were a few contentious moments.Joining me now, Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor of government at the University of Essex. I think I can be impartial in saying it was quite refreshing to see a presidential debate or election debate which was largely focused on policy.",

People could say Vance won the first part of the debate. Walz was much stronger in the second half of the debate.But usually the second part of the ticket doesn't matter much. I think people are already pretty hardened in their views. I think it was good for Vance because his approval rating was around 34 percent. It's incredibly low, and he presented a slicker, more palatable image of himself. He was definitely able to articulate the Trumpian views, but he wasn't able to really answer any questions. In fact, I've never seen someone so slick and smooth in not directly answering questions. What I think this debate did was amplify the support for Republicans, if you're already Republican, and the other way around for Democrats. I think both sides were probably very pleased with how the debate went.",

He's also able to deflect and not answer questions, and he never seemed particularly rattled by anything. So I'm sure, as I mentioned, on the Republican side, they're probably thrilled about his performance, and he was probably able to resonate with people who are already meaning Trump or are already Republican voters.Whether or not he was able to change the mind of independent voters, I don't know, because he came across to some people as overly smooth and trying to gaslight people on issues of whether or not Trump would support an abortion ban, whether or not Trump was the one who fixed Obamacare. And particularly on the last issue, the last part of the debate, when they were talking about January 6th, Vance was saying that there was a peaceful transfer of power on January 20th. I think for people who care about what happened on January 6th, they're not going to buy what Vance was saying about the peaceful transfer of power there.",

He always does come across as likable. His strong suit isn't really debating.It is when he's on the campaign trail when he's meeting and connecting with voters. That's where he is really the most comfortable. On the debate stage, he started off a little bit rough. He got better as the night went on and he was able to clearly communicate that vision. But again, I think the reactions to this debate are going to be incredibly partisan. If you already like one candidate or the other, then you're going to be happy with how they performed.

There are many, Ronny, in this region who say it is a region that is now in a full-fledged war. And given what we are witnessing, it is very hard to argue with that, not least from the perspective where you are, which is Beirut in Lebanon. Lebanon does feel like it is the current battlefield in this war, albeit other things going on around. What's your perspective at this point?",

The sounds of bombs and echoes thundering throughout the city. Of course, watching the news as everyone is around the world, seeing ballistic missiles being flown from Iran to Israel. But in Lebanon, the strikes continue. The southern suburbs were hit again. [04:45:00] And this is days after Hassan Nasrallah was killed in southern Beirut, the war continues. And I sense, unfortunately, none of this is in Lebanon's hands. And when I say that what I mean is there is no Lebanese voice at the table. Unlike July and August 2006, when the Lebanese state tried to insist on Lebanese interests, trying to bring Hezbollah from the brink and trying to negotiate a ceasefire deal, which is 1701, which we talk about day in, day out. Unfortunately, this time Lebanese are in Beirut, Lebanese are in Lebanon, and the diaspora at large around the world are simply watching and waiting and unfortunately expecting more escalation to come.",

      "sentences": "The risk, I think, is twofold. And I'll narrow it to Lebanon, with your permission. The first, obviously, is that civilian casualties will rise.The Israelis have begun their invasion, albeit they keep calling it a limited scale invasion. It is yet to be determined what the Israelis will do once they effectively cross the border and civilians getting killed in Lebanon, even with Hezbollah being a fairly unpopular party in this country, does bring Lebanese back to the gravity of what we refer to as resistance. Meaning once the Israelis are in, it's not necessarily the re- legitimization of Hezbollah as Iran's paramilitary force, but it's something else. It's that Lebanese have the right to defend themselves by force. And I sense this is very familiar territory. This goes back, obviously, to the 1970s as well, before Hezbollah existed, when the Palestinians and the Israelis are fighting it out in Lebanon and Lebanese too. So that's the first risk, is that this conflict continues and Lebanese veer back to something that is less state-oriented and more sub-state. The second factor, in my assessment, is that we're witnessing in real time the end of Lebanon. And without serious international engagement and not just words that are tossed around, meaning it's OK to say everyone wants 1701. My understanding is that Hezbollah at some point would have accepted 1701 under duress as surrender. That's what they did in 2006. And it's fine if the prime minister says it too, or for that matter, the French foreign minister, or the Americans, or whoever, perhaps even Iran, and Israel. That's fine. But without international engagement, that gives the Lebanese state some political cover. And when I say the state, not the failed institutions, not the collapsed state, I mean the Lebanese army, to actually regain what it lost long ago, which is full authority. Sorry, just to add this, full authority over its geography. Without that type of international action, you will see the end of Lebanon.",

Of course, in the past, there was support for institutions, not least the Lebanese armed forces by Saudi, which has been absent of late, as has other GCC countries.One thing that really has changed significantly, and I just wonder whether you want to just close with this, is the absence of Syria and Assad, once an arbiter in Lebanon. Let's be quite frank here. What do you make of the near silence from Assad and the Syrian regime in all of this? Of course, the presence of Hezbollah on the ground in defense of Assad and his government during the past decade or so has proved significant in his staying in power. We are hearing an almost absent narrative from Syria at this point. How do you read that? And what does this say about the sort of tectonic sort of power shift in the region at this point?",
