But I would urge everyone to look at the female vote and what happens on Tuesday, because we have been seeing, obviously, a big gender gap in this race. And that means that's not just Harris's advantage with female voters, but also Donald Trump's advantage with male voters.But look here on the screen. This is our most recent polls of the blue wall states that we released yesterday afternoon. This is among female likely voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. You see Kamala Harris has a significant advantage among them. In Pennsylvania, it is closest. That is also where our overall horse race found the race closest. And it is interesting to note that in Michigan and Wisconsin, Donald Trump's advantage with men is not nearly as great as it exists as Harris's advantage with women. In Pennsylvania, they are equally divided between the two genders. But there is -- remember, women make up a larger share of the electorate, so that small increase in the overall share will matter if Kamala Harris performs on Tuesday with female voters in a turbocharged way.",

That is her Joe Biden problem. So I'm not sure that this moment, his garbage comments, did anything other than perhaps give the Trump campaign something to seize on from a message perspective, put him in garbage truck to take questions from reporters, and allow them to try and get off their back heels where they had been for a few days based on the Madison Square Garden rally, Kate.

One is called the R-FBI, which stands for the Foundation to Battle Injustice a rather illustrious name. And the other is Storm-1516. And these are relatively new efforts, but they have very familiar origins. They can be traced back to the infamous Russian troll farm called the IRA, which was founded but Yevgeny Prigozhin, the long-time ally of Vladimir Putin, who was the founder of the Wagner mercenary group. He then mounted that rebellion against Putin last year and then mysteriously died in a mid-air collision. But Storm-1516 and R-FBI have been pumping out dozens of narratives that these Clemson researchers have been tracking over the past year. Many of them focusing on Ukraine and Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance in fact, picked up on one of those fake stories that the Ukrainians were using American aid money to buy yachts. But lately R- FBI and Storm-1516 have been focusing more on the US election, pumping out fake stories, fake videos. One, that spread across the internet like wildfire was about Governor Tim Walz sexually assaulting a minor. That was a fake story, of course. There were two more about Kamala Harris that she carried out a hit and run, that she killed rhinoceros while on safari, both wildly false. And then, John, moments after we interviewed these Clemson researchers last week, there was yet another one that you could see really could have an impact on this election of ballots, mail-in ballots being torn up in Bucks County in Pennsylvania, of course, a critical swing state. That was fake, but it spread across the internet tens of thousands of shares in just the first few hours.
