      "sentences": "It is putting the company on blast. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, so just hours from now, we could get the answer to the one -- well, one of the main questions we've all had in Donald Trump's criminal trial. Will he actually take the stand and testify in his own defense? Now, Trump, he has previously dangled the possibility. But, now, we're getting to the point where it's put up or shut up. Now, his attorney said that they don't call -- they're not going to call any more witnesses. And so, based on that, it seems like they're not going to call him. But in Trump world, you really don't know until the very last second, do you? And they really don't have to tell us until that very last second. Now, if he doesn't, it will put a lot more weight on Michael Cohen's testimony. And today, Cohen's credibility took quite another hit with the revelation that he had stolen money from a Trump Organization. More on that in a \"New York Minute.\" But there was another person on the hot seat today, this time an eye- rolling, side-eye giving witness who annoyed the judge so much, the judge cleared the courtroom to dress him down. I'm talking about Robert Costello. A former adviser to Michael Cohen took the stand for the defense today and described an April 2018 meeting that he had with Cohen about the Stormy Daniels payments. Now, from the transcript, and I'm quoting a question, \"What did he say about that specific topic?\" Costello answers, \"Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times.\" Now, that disputes, as you're aware, Cohen's assertion that he paid off Stormy Daniels at the direction of Trump and that Trump was aware of the alleged scheme to disguise reimbursements to Cohen. Now, the D.A. has provided documents and checks and invoices to try to support their 34-account case. But the D.A. has still relied quite heavily, even though it was pre-corroborated on Cohen's testimony to connect all of these different dots. Now, throughout the entire trial, the jury has heard a lot of nasty things about Michael Cohen from various witnesses. Here is just a sampling on your screen. And today, they got one more bit of unflattering information to consider, because on the stand today, Cohen himself admitted to stealing from the Trump Organization. Cohen admitted that he -- when he said he needs to be reimbursed $50,000 from paying an I.T. firm to help Trump for polling and such, it turns out he only paid them 20 grands. And by the way, it was in a brown paper bag, I can't make this up, meaning he was selling $30,000 for himself. Now, point blank from the transcript question, \"You never gave the $30,000 that was owed to the guy that owned Red Finch, did you? Answer: No. No, sir. Question: So, you stole from the Trump Organization, right? Answer: Yes, sir. Well, I want to bring in a reporter who was in court today, law enforcement reporter for \"The Washington Post,\" Devlin Barrett. Devlin, I have been looking to you as my -- well, not the David Pecker type, but my eyes and ears into the courtroom day in and day out in Manhattan. It was another dramatic day. Let me read for our audience what happened after Judge Merchan cleared the courtroom. Okay? Judge Merchan told Costello, \"I'm putting you on notice that your conduct is contemptuous. If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand. I will strike his entire testimony. Do you understand me?\" Defense attorney Bove replied, yes, judge, I understand. Then the judge said, \"Listen to the question and answer the question.\" Costello then chimed in, \"Can I say something, please?\" The judge, \"No. No. This is not a conversation.\" Now, frankly, this could also have been in my house talking to my children. But peel back the curtain for us because this point tells us so much. What was the atmosphere like?",

He's quite in control.There was even a point in time, a few weeks ago now in the trial, where the defense counsel asked the judge not to, if Trump were to testify, bring up any ruling that he had made about holding in contempt of court or fighting a violation because it looked they respect you so much and they're going to -- if you say it and tell them that you ordered this or rule this, it will be very prejudicial.

And like I said, it was very clear that what Costello was doing was infuriating to the judge, so much so that when he did he starts yelling -- yelling at the witness, right? And then, at some point, he gets so mad that Costello was angrily staring at him. And to be clear, I was in the room, he was definitely angrily staring at him that he ordered the courtroom cleared so that he could yell at the witness some more without all the reporters around which -- to be honest, I haven't seen that before. You know, plenty of people like to yell at each other in front of reporters in my experience. But he -- COATES: You know what, I don't think that was clear to the audience.

To clear the courtroom to have someone and a witness be dressed down, have you ever seen anything like that, Elliot?

Listen, if you keep quiet, you know, I'll take care of you. And it sounds like the defense thought that was significant enough that they needed to rebut it. But I agree to disrespect the judge like this, particularly given that Trump and his posse are out there trashing the judge every day after court. We've got multiple contempt citations for Donald Trump for disrespecting the judge.

Video I'm about to show you again. I must remind you, it is very disturbing, because it shows a woman cowering on a hotel floor in Los Angeles as Diddy was kicking her and dragging her, throwing objects toward her.The L.A. County D.A. said it cannot prosecute Diddy for this incident because the statute of limitations on domestic violence cases is five years. And recall, this was 2016. The public fallout is snowballing. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" says that streaming activity for Diddy dropped by as much as 50% last week compared to December of 2023. New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, is considering revoking Diddy's key to the city after watching the video. Remember, Mayor Adams is a former police officer.

As an apology video, I'm assuming. It began a whole lot about him. His dark place, he said, that he was in. His feelings about being disgusted by it. I do know that Diddy not mention Cassie in the apology. Apparently, neither of them is allowed to speak about the other publicly because of the terms of their settlement. But did he Approach this or apologize in a way that demonstrated remorse?

And the answer is clearly no, because he had several months since the lawsuit was filed in December to come forward with remorse, contrition or some accountability. So, we didn't see any of that. And I think pretty consistently until this moment, he has denied all of these allegations.So, now, we have this video, this very clear video of violence. And now, we have an apology. And so, I think that's why it kind of rings hollow for so many people, because there have been so many opportunities before this moment to make amends or to show some remorse or accountability. In fact, what he has been saying consistently is that these people are liars, that she's, in fact, a liar. So, that's -- that's one thing. The other thing I want to say, too, is that, as you pointed out, according to the settlement agreement, they can't speak about each other. But it does seem to me that if you're genuinely honest in your desire to make amends, to tone, to be held accountable by some standard, you may want to go back and look at that, and maybe have her -- release her from her inability to speak about you publicly. So, it doesn't really seem like there's any actual attempts to make amends with the victim of the violence, in this case, Cassie, and there's no attempt to really show a systemic way of -- toning -- toning oneself in public. It just seems like the video is the only form in which we're seeing contrition.",

      "sentences": "Well, one of the things I find striking about this video and people now suddenly believing that she may have been, in fact, telling the truth is that the lawsuit was so detailed in its description. And so, detailed in the repetition of the behavior that it seemed to me that it would be hard not to believe her.But now that we have this video evidence, I guess there are more people who are seeing that this, in fact, may have happened and that at least in this one moment, that she wasn't telling a lie. For me, when I watched this video and probably for you and many other people out there, I also see a woman who's trying to escape a violent situation. And so, oftentimes, domestic violence victims are blamed because people say, why didn't they leave or why couldn't they get out? And so, what you see here repeatedly is someone trying to escape a really, really, really deadly -- almost deadly or very violent situation, right? She's going to the elevator. She's on the telephone. She's literally on the ground trying to avoid blows. And so, if anything, and I think this is a really humiliating video to be released, I think this is something that she would not have wanted to be in the public sphere for us to see. And yet, I do think it proves how difficult it is and how many individuals and institutions cover up or basically allow this behavior to happen, right? So there had to be someone who watched this video and didn't send it to the police. I mean, there's just so many layers to that video and the ways in which she remained trapped in that situation despite the fact that she was trying to escape. So, that's one thing. I just want to say that we have evidence of her leaving and being pulled back literally into a situation that she could not offend herself or defend herself from. But then the other question is, why wasn't she believed when there's -- there was someone had physical evidence of this? And I think it goes back to this idea that very few survivors, when they come forward, are believed. Most people, I think, you know, are identified with the people who are the perpetrators of the crime or the people who are -- the allegations are against. Very few people identify with the victims.
