Now the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq futures were all up but now were seeing a reverse but a whiplash in the market at the moment.And it did take a beating on Wednesday after the Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced a 75 basis point hike in interest rates. So that sent markets tumbling. The Dow closing down more than 500 points. Now this is the sixth rate hike this year and the fourth one at that we've had that's been 3/4 of a point. Powell addressed why the Fed moves have been so aggressive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that would be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast. I think it's been a good and a successful program that we've gotten this far this fast. Remember though that we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases and we have some ground left to cover here. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They do it for two hours every week and they've been doing this for over 7 years. Under the leadership of a man who is a lawyer by profession. This has been his project. It's been his passion for years. It's because of this man, Afroz Shah, and his team that you see the beach being as clean as it is today.I mean, let's just go back to the picture that have shared with the team this from 2015. If you look at the image, that's what the beach looked like about 7 years back. Completely messed up, completely full of plastic. I spoke to Afroz this morning, he did mention that open defecation is still a problem here. That's something they're trying to resolve. Along with that it's also the effort to make a behavioral change in the people. To make them aware, to educate them of the perils of plastic waste at the beach. Here's what he had to say.

Full of green forests, temperate rain forests, has lots of glaziers, rivers, lakes. And the coast is very steep.The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent area so the diversity we find on shore is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann, I'm a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I'm studying the marine biodiversity of the Chile's Patagonia. Starting in Patagonia we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers which is twice around the world. There are only a handful of scientists working there so even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don't know yet. Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time. But in the 80s when aquaculture moved in it started to be impacted. Life in the shores has been reduced and abandoned. There are species we hardly don't find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and their equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost.
