There will be discussions about what kind of long-term security assistance these two allies could provide to Ukraine down the road. And it comes as President Biden has approved those controversial cluster munitions to be sent to Ukraine. Cluster munitions are something that have been opposed by more than 100 countries. But the president said it was a very difficult decision, but one that was necessary at this time, as Ukraine needs more ammunition as they're waging that counteroffensive against Russia. Now, another issue that will be a hot topic and potential flashpoint at the summit is the prospect of a determining a pathway for Ukraine to join the NATO alliance. There are some allies who want to see a more concrete timetable for that to happen. But President Biden has said that now is not the time for Ukraine to join due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and his belief that there are still some reforms, still some commitments that Ukraine needs to make in order to join the NATO alliance. Another issue of a country who's trying to get into NATO is Sweden. Their bid to join the alliance has currently been on hold due to the opposition by Turkish President Erdogan. He believes and is frustrated with Sweden for what Erdogan describes as harboring groups that they consider to be terrorists. Now, President Biden has said he has optimistic Sweden will eventually join the alliance and he held a phone call with Erdogan as he traveled here to London on Air Force One on Sunday. The two men did talk about the prospect of Sweden joining NATO, as well as potentially selling F- 16 fighter jets to Turkey. That is something Turkey has been seeking for quite some time. And there are speculation, there are people who want to make sure that any type of sale of F-16s to Turkey would come with a condition that Turkey would accept Sweden into the alliance. All of these issues will be center -- at the center of discussions at that NATO summit, which President Biden heads to on Tuesday. Arlette Saenz, CNN, traveling with the president in London.

So, Nic, the war in Ukraine will clearly dominate President Biden's upcoming meeting today with Britain's prime minister. How likely is it that Rishi Sunak will raise the controversial issue of Mr. Biden's decision to send Ukraine cluster bombs?[03:04:48] NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, you could say that Rishi Sunak is already dealt with that by releasing a statement on Saturday where he said Britain is a signatory on convention on cluster munitions which prohibits it from producing or supplying those munitions and indeed is obliged in some ways as part of that convention to discourage others using the weapons. So, perhaps he's nipped that in the bad, but I think very likely if there were to be and we're not it's not clear whether the British Prime Minister will give a press conference following the meeting. But if he were to give a press conference, it would very likely be a question, have you addressed the cluster munitions with President Biden? So it seems in some way that it would be likely to come up. We heard from President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on the flight over here, saying, look, as far as with the United States is concerned, we're not hearing from NATO partners criticizing us for this. We're looking at a united position where we are all nations trying to support Ukraine in this fight against Russia. So from a U.S. perspective they're not saying that they are hearing directly themselves specific criticism on this issue, but again it will be a sensitive issue and people likely to ask Rishi Sunak if he brought it up.",

Well, not all countries, all the 31 members of NATO, want that model. Some want an even stronger version. Others perhaps want something a little weaker. So perhaps the language that emerges is something that goes in some way to giving President Zelenskyy what he wants, which is firm commitments of NATO security guarantees, which President Biden is sort of tying up in terms of, you know, if there is a peace agreement finally agreed, then these are the things that we can consider. So you can expect to see the potential for some language that ties Ukraine up. If you get to have these guarantees, whatever they may be, this will be part of a peace process, which of course is part of what Ukraine wants, a peace process, though, on their terms. So you may get a number of different countries signing up and giving longer-term financial and military commitments, not too dissimilar to what's been given already but a more codified version and then of course trying to get a language that embraces all of that in the NATO communique. I think that's what to look for and there will be strengths and weaknesses in it and it doesn't go as far it won't go as far as what President Zelenskyy actually has said that he wants.",

And President Biden spoke with President Erdogan on his flight on Air Force One on the way over, and there's a likelihood that they will have a bilateral meeting, a pull-aside or a full bilateral meeting in Vilnius.Whatever is decided in that discussion, it couldn't make Sweden's accession to NATO immediate because this is something that would have to be ratified by the -- by the parliament in Turkey. The Hungarians are also blocking at the moment, have said that if President Erdogan waves his opposition, then they will as well. So I think perhaps the strongest again to look for there, if everything went really well at the NATO summit in terms of the conversation between President Biden and Erdogan, then perhaps you could be looking at a language that indicates that it won't be long before Sweden becomes a member. But, I think, when President Biden spoke on the phone as he did last night to President Erdogan, on the one hand talking about Sweden and NATO membership and on the other hand as well talking about F-16 fighter jets which is what President Erdogan wants for Turkey or upgrades of those. You can see how these things are relatively intertwined and of course you know it's all about keeping a balance at NATO. Greece also is interested in its F-16s as well, so Turkey and Greece will also look for a balance and parity there. as well. So it's a complicated maneuver.",

He is showing here in a video that was just published this morning by the Russian Ministry of Defense.They say that it was a meeting that took place on Sunday. He is said to be getting a report from the chief of staff of the Aerospace Forces on Russian air defense having thwarted an attempt by Ukraine to hit targets in both Crimea and inside Russia in the Rostov and Kaluga regions. He is then instructing them to go after the storage sites of those missiles and preemptively destroy them. But I think, that the appearance here is much more important the content of the appearance. We have not seen Gerasimov since that attempted mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner 16 days ago. Now, rumors have been swirling and intensify that he may have been dismissed by Russia from his post. So this is clearly an effort by Russia to show that hasn't happened, that he's still in charge, everything is under control. One more thing to note in this video is that the man he's getting the report from on that video link there is Viktor Afzalov, as I said, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian -- of the Russian Aerospace Forces by the way. He is the second in command, the head of the Aerospace Forces, Sergei Serevikin, that general who we also haven't seen since that Wagner mutiny. That will I think raise more questions around the state of the leadership of the Russian Armed Forces even as Russia clearly attempts here to restore some kind of clarity.",

They expedited the appeal of the preliminary injunction. The judges say they have the goal of resolving the matter no later than September 30th this year in an effort to mitigate any potential harm from that possibility.To reach their conclusion, they granted a stay of a lower court injunction, which had been blocking enforcement of the state's ban on health care providers performing gender-affirming surgeries and administering hormones or puberty blockers to transgender minors, pending the duration of the appeal. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Scrimetti, who is a Republican, acknowledged Saturday after the ruling was announced that this case is far from over, but this is a big win, he said, adding that the Court of Appeals lifted the injunction, meaning the law can be fully enforced and recognize that Tennessee is likely to win the constitutional argument and the case. On the other side, the American Civil Liberties Union blasted the decision in a statement, also saying that this case is far from over and calling the ruling disappointing and heartbreaking. As we and our clients consider our next steps, the ACLU said, we want all the transgender youth of Tennessee to know this fight is far from over, and we will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Tennessee is made a safer place to raise every family.

The summit comes just after Mr. Biden approved giving controversial cluster bombs to Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL O'HANLON, SR. FELLOW IN FOREIGN POLICY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Well I think the decision on cluster munitions will be controversial but is a pretty tactical decision. You know, the Russians have been laying landmines here and there, left and right, and this decision will not demonstrably change the basic situation. So, you can agree with it or not agree with it. It is not a strategic level change in the basic military situation. The military situation, unfortunately, is relatively stalemated with or without the cluster munitions. And I think that's going to be one big piece of NATO's, you know, basic conceptual framework going forward. How do we think about the future of this war? Can Ukraine really liberate all of its territory? I don't yet know the answer to that question. We're going to find out more in the course of the summer. The cluster munitions debate should be seen within that context and probably not viewed as a litmus test about the morality of the overall cause, which I think we all agree is basically on Ukraine's side regardless.",

Would that be the sentiment of the majority of NATO members that the war needs to end before Ukraine's membership is even considered here?O'HANLON: I think so because realistically, are we really going to give Ukraine a security guarantee and come fight in its defense while the war is ongoing? Even President Zelenskyy is not really asking for that. So the real question here is not so much about whether we say we might want Ukraine and NATO someday. It's what do we do about the current and near-term future with this conflict? And I think that, right now, we're going to have to watch and see how the battlefield plays out in the summer. I think Ukraine will make some gains. None of us know how many. And then we have to reassess in the fall and winter, how can we help Ukraine make more gains? That's going to be the question. The NATO membership issue is really, you know, it's a nice ideological debate. It's really not that pertinent to the short-term question of how do you help them win.

Rina fought back, taking her battle to social media. An online petition generated more than 100,000 signatures, a call to action that forced the military to reexamine her case. The review found Rina was a victim enduring physical and verbal sexual harassment daily. Rina's entire saga prompted a wide-sweeping defense ministry investigation on sexual harassment. It led to this remarkable moment, military officials bowing in apology. UNKNOWN (through translator): This resulted in so much public outrage, surprising many people in the defense ministry. Without the power of public opinion, the chief of staff's apology wouldn't have been possible. STEWART (voice-over): In addition, several officers have apologized, but were dishonorably discharged. Three officers faced charges. But now, as Rina pursues a civil suit, four of the five officers have denied ever abusing her, despite their previous apology.

I want a sincere apology from the heart and for them to admit responsibility for what they did.
