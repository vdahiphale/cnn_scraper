That plan quickly cobbled together by Republicans after Donald Trump blew up the previous bill. That bill is expected now to fail amid a conservative revolt and Democratic, very strong Democratic opposition. The speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is about to address the news media. We'll bring that to you in just a few moments as soon as it begins.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin our coverage tonight with the breaking news up on Capitol Hill, very important, very dramatic breaking news that could affect millions of Americans, the last-minute scramble to avert a government shutdown after Donald Trump tanked a bipartisan agreement. Our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill with details. Manu, so what is happening right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, frantic negotiations all day long, trying to meet Donald Trump's 11th hour demands that led to the collapse of a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown. A 1,500-page bill was unveiled just a couple of days ago as a result of bipartisan negotiations between the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, as well as other congressional leaders gave with the support of the White House, look like it was on the glide path to become enacted into law until Donald Trump and after Elon Musk came out to oppose it, came out and said he too was opposed and also inserted some 11th hour demands, that one critical demand, to deal with the national debt limit.Of course, if the debt limit is breached, that would lead to the first ever debt default in U.S. history. But that was not expected to be dealt with until the middle of next year sometime. But Donald Trump came in late and said that must be dealt with now to take out of his plate so he doesn't have to deal with it in his turn. That has led to a whole day of back and forth among Republicans, trying to make sure that Donald Trump is satisfied, but also trying to get the support of Democrats. But Democrats are indicating they are not on board. They don't like the late changes. They don't like how they were excluded from the talks. And they are concerned by agreeing to this change on the debt limit to suspend it for two years, as the Republicans are now trying to do, that that essentially would green light their efforts to push through a major tax plan for Donald Trump in the New Year. All of this is making it very clear that this vote on the floor of this revised plan that Donald Trump himself supports will fail in just a matter of moments, not just because of Democratic concern, but because conservative Republicans are revolting as well. They don't like that debt limit suspension. They believe there should be more cuts, spending cuts as well, meaning that Donald Trump will fail to win over most -- some members of his party on the far right. And one thing to watch, Wolf, the process that is being used here would require two thirds majority of the House, all members of here, that would mean 290 votes. That is a very high threshold to get to, which means that, at the moment, this looks like it's going to fail. And they're going to have to figure out what to do next, because the government shutdown looms by 11:59 P.M. tomorrow night. That is the deadline to avert one. What happens next? A major question as Washington once again is in a crisis mode.",

Speaker Johnson will have to either come up with even a narrower plan, maybe try to keep the government open for a short period of time. Will Democrats go along with that? Will Donald Trump go along with that?Donald Trump, all day long, has been demanding that debt limit increase because he does not want to deal with it next year. Will he be okay backing off that demand? Those are all key questions they're going to have to confront, or will Speaker Johnson defy Donald Trump in some way, potentially putting his own speakership at risk when he votes on the -- House votes on January 3rd to reelect him as speaker or find a new speaker. All questions for Johnson's future, all questions for the GOP as they try to grapple with Donald Trump coming into power, and all questions, of course, for the millions of Americans who could be affected by what could be a crippling government shutdown. If there is one, it could take some time to come out of one. So, huge questions right now, Wolf, is this is a jittery Congress, an uncertain future, and a bit of a panic that's happening on Capitol Hill as they confront what's next. [18:05:08] BLITZER:  Yes. And it wouldn't just affect federal workers, it would affect millions of Americans who rely on various levels of support from the federal government.

Democrats, for the most part, were going to support this. We would expect some Republicans on the right to oppose this. But then more and more Republicans started to come out against it. Conservative Republicans started to go through this bill. They started to find things they didn't like. Elon Musk came out and opposed this plan as well. And then when Donald Trump came out and made those demands, that changed things all together, Wolf.So, this has led to this chaotic moment for Speaker Johnson to try to figure out something that could appease Donald Trump, something that could get his party mostly in line. We'll hear what the speaker says in a matter of moments as he comes out. Will he get a majority of his conference? And what's next for him? It's unclear if he knows what's next as well, Wolf.",

So, he does have a large amount of influence. On the other hand, so does Elon Musk, who blew this bill up too. And what they've offered on Capitol Hill, Chip Roy called it a watered down version of what Trump had rejected before.And so I think people -- Republicans are going to have a bunch of Republicans opposing it and Democrats who were shut out of the process and were for the bill beforehand are now going to probably vote largely in unison against it, and Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of influence with them.",

He pointed and shouted through a large megaphone that clearly had impact here. But who has influence with these members? That is Donald Trump. I think there's no doubt about it.I think what you see happening here, you know, Donald Trump loves to talk about a mandate and a landslide, and there is no doubt Donald Trump had a decisive win in a close election that emerged with close margins in the House now going forward into the next Congress, but there are close margins in this one as well. And I think what we're seeing on display here is a reminder of the tension that is going to exist, that even Donald Trump, at his most politically popular and enjoying a bit of a honeymoon right now, is still going to be intention with the need to have a government that functions, the basic things that need to occur, because his most stalwart supporters are just not for doing business the way it's been done. And so that tension of the need to govern with Donald Trump's popularity being emboldened, it doesn't -- just because you had a decisive victory doesn't make all the need of the government functioning to go away.",

There's obviously some of that is done to get under Trump's skin. Whether it actually starts to at a certain point, usually, that's how these things end with Trump.But Musk comes with a different set of attributes than other people have, namely, you know, gazillions of dollars that he has been willing to spend not just on Trump's behalf, but against people who are standing in Trump's way.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  An extraordinary scene. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione shackled, wearing an orange jumpsuit, his first time back in New York City since police say he fled after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was horrifically gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4th. Mangione evading police for days before eventually being arrested at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. Today, surrounded by NYPD detectives and FBI agents wearing bulletproof vests and carrying long guns, even New York City Mayor Eric Adams was there addressing the support Mangione has received. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY):  We don't use a gun. And anyone that celebrates that, it is vile and it is sending the wrong message. And you're celebrating using violence to solve an issue.",

His attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifolo, saying in court that this was a, quote, highly unusual situation that she'd never seen in 30 years of practicing law. She also said she had never seen a situation play out like this and asked for clarification on whether federal and state prosecutors are conducting two separate investigations.

An entry marked August 15th said, quote, the details are finally coming together and the target is insurance because it checks every box. Another entry in October, quote, describes an intent to, quote, whack the CEO of one of the insurance companies at its major investor conference.

Remember Republicans hold 219 votes in the House and we expect a sizeable amount of Republicans are going to vote against it. It's unclear exactly how many and we expect most Democrats to vote against it.So, they're going to get nowhere close to the 290-vote threshold. And there are reasons why this has done it at two thirds threshold. They could also pass it by a simple majority, but that means getting their whole party in line to do that. And the party is simply not in line on this issue, Wolf. So, this is going to go down, and then the question is, what's next. Wolf?",

And he's the sitting president of the United States. Doesn't that say something right now? Donald Trump has a right to have his opinion heard on this matter. He wanted the debt ceiling increased as part of a continuing resolution. I'll reiterate what Manu just said to you, Wolf. The reason Democrats are upset about this bill is not the CR, not the disaster relief, not the farm aid. The reason they're upset about this bill is because they want to use the debt ceiling increase as leverage down the road. That's what they're upset about.

The fact is that we have a number of Republicans that have never voted for a continuing resolution, have never voted to lift the debt ceiling. This bill requires two thirds of the House, not an absolute majority. It requires two thirds.So the fact that you have Democrats who normally would vote for this, refusing to do so, not because they disagree with the clean CR, not because they disagree with disaster relief, not because they disagree with aid to our farmers. No, they're doing so because they're upset that the debt ceiling increase is being taken off the table as leverage for them in future negotiations. That's what they're upset about. And you know what, Wolf? That's why Washington is broken. Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, came out today and said she agrees with President Trump that debt ceiling increase should stop being used as a political weapon. And I agree with that. This is not helpful to anyone. The fact is, we are literally 24 hours plus away from a shutdown. Democrats are now voting against keeping the government funded. They can say it had to do with the bipartisan agreement being broken. They can say that they're upset about, you know, Elon Musk weighing in. The fact is a bill is on the floor right now to keep the government funded to provide disaster relief to Americans. And they are voting no, not because they disagree with that, but because they're upset that their leverage in a future negotiation may be taken away.",
