Our top story right now Moscow is claiming that Ukraine tried to assassinate President Vladimir Putin with drone strikes on the Kremlin last night. Videos are circulating purporting to show the alleged attacks but at this stage, we cannot verify them. Here they are. Take a look at that drone. Moscow is calling the alleged strikes a terrorist act and says it reserves the right to take retaliatory measures. Ukraine denies any involvement saying it does not attack other countries. We've got team coverage on our story standing by for us. I'd like -- we've got -- I've just got confirmation that Matthew Chance with us from London, and we've got Nic Robertson as well in Eastern Ukraine. Great to have you both with me today! Nic, I want to start with what we've been hearing from Ukraine in particular distancing them from this attack. But I want to sort of take a step back here and talk about the potential impact of these accusations and the information that we're getting through from the Kremlin at this stage.",

      "sentences": "Typically, in the past, the Kremlin has said things that are then used to act upon things that haveproven not to be true, but have given them the pretext for an attack a false flag operation. Ukraine appears concerned that this may be such an instance, they feel that perhaps the Kremlin will use what happened over the Kremlin, where these two alleged incidents were drone 16 minutes apart over the Kremlin last night, to use that as a pretext for some sort of attack on Ukraine. They're concerned because Russia has a track record of doing that. Ukraine says it is not connected to these drone incidents. It says it will use all means to diff on its own territory to defend its own territory. It describes the Russia's claims that this was an assassination attempt on President Putin as part of Russian trickery that they suggest is the Kremlin trying to drive up support for the war in Ukraine ahead of the very important Mayday celebrations outside the Kremlin on Red Square. Very big annual celebrations on the 9th of May they celebrate and commemorate the huge loss of life 10 million -- tens of millions of Russians who lost their lives during the Second World War. This is the Kremlin President Putin trying to sort of build up support for that parade for the war in Ukraine. But I think when you do step back and try and analyze the situation, it is a particularly tense situation because Russia is expecting the possibility of Ukrainian counter offensive. And there have been over the past couple of weeks, a noticeable uptick in the number of incidents that have targeted Russia's supply lines and ammunition and fuel depots inside of Russia, but near the borders with Ukraine. So when you take that picture in its totality, Ukraine, whether or not it was involved, the fact that the Kremlin escalates whatever it was to the level of an attempted assassination of President Putin, Russia has taken this up to the maximum level that it can, and that's what would cause the concern of how Russia may then use this incident for its own purposes.",

You know, the Ukrainians do have drones that are based onold Soviet models, that the drone weaponized, but they in essence, move them into a much of more sophisticated realm technologically. They use these drones and attacks against angles to airfield, for example and that's a bomber airfield in southern Russia, that a base where the Russians have for use to mount attacks against Ukraine from. So it is certainly technically possible for the Ukrainians to do this. The Russians also have these drones, and they could very well be masquerading them as Ukrainian drones, even if they are in fact Russian. So there are a myriad of possibilities here. But the Ukrainians are definitely capable of doing this either from inside their territory, which is a bit of a distance about 600 kilometers at the closest point to Moscow, and then also, of course, they could be using a sympathetic forces with Russia, which probably getting to be a bit more numerous now than was previously thought.",

So Saudi Arabia and Iran are really these are the two heavyweights that have been waging proxy wars, in Syria, in Yemen, in Lebanon, in other places. On the whole, I think we are not really seeing any transformation, we're not seeing a paradigm shift. What we are seeing is that more and more regional powers are prioritizing their own security, the security of their regimes, the economic well-being of their people, because the economic pressure following COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But this is only one of a number of trends; we've seen some really alarming decreases in certain countries that are not just based on technology. For example, in Turkey, which is down significantly stopped 16 places this year; we're seeing a severe crackdown in the run up to the elections, which will take place in just 11 days. And in particular, a severe targeting of Kurdish journalists with 25 new arrests of Kurdish journalists last year and active cases still continuing.

Now the judge overseeing the civil casesays the jury could start deliberating as soon as today Sheeran is accused of copying Marvin Gaye's soul hits, Let's Get It On for his song Thinking Out Loud. On Tuesday, a music expert called by the defense testified the gay song was not the first one to use the chord progression at the center of the case. Entertainment Reporter Chloe Melas is standing by in New York. And he was just in court for us. What a drama? I mean, look, I have to be honest, I've been watching what Ed Sheeran has been tweeting and he's saying, look, I'm going to quit music. And why would I be so stupid to even use the song on stage and do a mash up? The plot thickens.",

      "sentences": "I mean, look, I got to tell you, things are riveting in there. And we are all learning so much about musictheory for those of us that didn't play music growing up. Its Ed Sheeran took the stand earlier this week. And like you said, he was very passionate in his conviction that he did not plagiarize from Let's Get It On. And they have a musicologist who is -- Dr. Ferrara and he is currently being cross examined by the Townsend family's attorney. And they are really putting him to the test. Because this musicologist says, look, there were about 80 songs that had the same basic four chord progression, as well as something called anticipation in songs long before Thinking Out Loud. So Ed could have been influenced perhaps by none of those songs or several songs outside of Let's Get It On, and that maybe there were about 30 songs that he cites before. Let's Get It On, that use that same chord progression. I just got to say, it's all going to come down to the jury. I've been looking at them. They seem very engaged. You know, as early as today, there could be closing arguments and things could be turned over to the jury. Today, tomorrow, I think, you know, maybe there's going to be a verdict pretty quickly. You know, but who knows, but again, Ed Sheeran took the stand now a couple of times. And he has said loosely that he would perhaps not do music anymore if the Townsend family owned that four chord progression, because it's so common. And therefore, how could he continue to make music if he can't use that for chord progression? So look, everyone's talking about this case, social media is like hinging on every moment. And hopefully, we'll have some answers very, very soon.",
