As you mentioned, it is exceedingly rare that the top U.S. diplomat would be able to speak with a detained American while they are still detained. This is the second time, we're told, that Blinken and Paul have spoken. The first time was back in December, according to a source.On the call yesterday, Blinken was able to relay that message that Paul should keep the faith and know that the United States is doing everything they can to try to bring him home as soon as possible. We don't have a lot of the details around the logistics of how this call was set up. We do know that Paul is able to make calls from that remote prison camp out in Mordovia, Russia. And this was a significant call also in the timing. It comes when Russia has not responded in a substantive way to a serious proposal that the U.S. has put forward to try to secure Paul's release. This is something that was raised with them more than eight months ago. It is something that Secretary of State Blinken has said that he raised with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in their brief meeting on the sideline of a major gathering back in March. And it's something that the U.S. tends to consider a live offer. But given the fact that Russia has not responded in a significant way and given the fact that they have also now detained another American, Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, the U.S. is looking at other options to try to bring both of these men home -- Danny.",

So I want your perspective. What's the strategy for the rest of the GOP field? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, for people like Tim Scott, the strategy is remain likeable, drum up support, and hope that, at some point, voters -- Republican primary voters start to look for an alternative to Trump. For DeSantis and some of the others, they're trying to create the message that they are just as Trumpy as Trump -- just as conservative and maybe even more conservative -- but they're not Trump. Also looking to be an alternative should voters start looking elsewhere. So those are kind of the two approaches we're seeing among the other Republican presidential candidates. But so far, what we're seeing in the polls from the voters are that they're not yet -- most of them -- at least half of them are not yet looking for an alternative to Donald Trump.",

But, of course, the RNC won't be happy if that happens.So what do you think the game plan is here from Trump's perspective and also from the GOP candidates' perspective if he's not on that stage?",

      "sentences": "Well, from Trump's perspective he's not seeing much upside to sharing a stage with his opponents, and that's been an approach of his throughout this campaign. You don't see him, for example, attending these cattle call Republican events where all the other candidates will be there. He does that very rarely. He just doesn't share the stage as a policy.So for him, it doesn't make sense to do this debate where he could say something that offends people or he could be on the stage and all the other candidates just spend the whole time attacking him, which is what usually happens to the frontrunner. So for him, there's no upside. For the other candidates, though, they wish they did have that opportunity to take Trump on face-to-face. Again, they know they can get a lot of earned media by getting a good sound bite or a good jab at Trump on a debate stage. So now they're going to have to focus on the others. For example, everyone's been talking about Tim Scott. How likeable he is. How he could be an alternative if Trump falters. I could see some of the candidates looking to bring Scott -- Tim Scott down a bit by attacking him and sullying that good reputation he's been building. Also, DeSantis. With Trump not on the stage DeSantis becomes the one that's polling highest on the stage. And therefore, you would expect he'd get that frontrunner treatment in the absence of the true frontrunner. That could mean a lot of attacks coming DeSantis' way as well.",

It is currently a strong tropical storm but it is likely -- and this is explicit language from the National Hurricane Center's latest update, which was issued about 15 minutes ago -- or, rather, 45 minutes ago. This storm expected to become a hurricane within the coming hours, and then a major hurricane, potentially, by later tonight. And why do we care about this storm in the Eastern Pacific? Well, it not only threatens portions of Mexico but also the Southwestern U.S. We've got our first tropical storm watches. This is across the Baja California peninsula. The popular tourist destination of Cabo San Lucas under that tropical storm watch. Now, this particular tropical storm is being directed northward -- north-northwest - by two different systems. We have high pressure that's causing the heat over the central U.S. and an upper-level low. These are going to work together. This is not a typical type pattern. So this will actually drive this storm system to more of a northerly direction, basically running parallel with that Baja California peninsula. Does it make a landfall there? That would certainly help kind of deflect this system a little bit. But the point is that this will certainly bring impacts to the Baja California peninsula but also into southwestern portions of the U.S. So, Southern California into Nevada -- even into portions of Arizona, a rain and wind threat. And here's the timeframe. Late Sunday into the day on Monday. That's when we anticipate U.S. impacts from this particular tropical system. So earliest arrival of tropical-storm-force winds into San Diego. That would be late Sunday evening and perhaps into Los Angeles as well.
