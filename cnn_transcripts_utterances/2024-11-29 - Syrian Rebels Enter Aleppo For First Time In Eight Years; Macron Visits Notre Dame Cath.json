The McLaren racing chief tells me what gives his Formula One team the edge all the changes that he's made, engines and drivers and the like, but only after you and I have talked about the news, because this is CNN and on this network, the news always comes first. The British lawmakers have approved a bill to legalize assisted dying after hours of debate today. The Lower House, the House of Commons, voted to support it. High profile figures gave emotional first time testimony. Under the legislation, terminally ill people would be able to take a substance to end their lives. The bill must still now go through Parliamentary Committees and also go through the Second Chamber, the House of Lords. The World Trade Organization has appointed Ngozi Okonju-Iweala to a second term as its DG. The organization is facing broad challenges due to the rise of tariffs under the protection measures. The WTO called her reappointment a recognition of her exceptional leadership and strategic vision. She will now lead the organization until August 2029. Protesters clashed with police in Tbilisi in Georgia for the second day over the government's decision to suspend membership talks with the European Union. The country has been in turmoil since last month's disputed elections in which the pro-EU opposition said the results were falsified. Michel Barnier, the French prime minister is calling for stability after the far right leader, Marine Le Pen threatened a no confidence vote because of a budget dispute. Investors are noticing French bond yields are now on par with that of Greece, and even briefly surpassed that on Thursday. German bunds, by comparison, the yields are much lower, as you can see. Michel Barnier's budget includes 60 billion euros worth of tax hikes and spending cuts. It faces opposition from the far right and the left has managed to get both together. The tax increases would hit France's right, as the Eurozone inflation is heating up. Christian Schulz is the Deputy Chief European Economist at Citi with me now. ' Always good to see you sir. I am grateful for it. So can he get this budget through? I mean, at very best, Michel Barnier's government is unloved by all, and is a marriage of possible inconvenience.
