In response, Russia is announce the creation of an anti terrorist operation regime in Moscow. Officials are also advising to drivers to avoid a major highway in southern Russia, which is being used by Wagner's convoys.

He said this was like 1917. That is when a rebellion erupted and overthrew the czarist government during World War I and lead to a fratricidal civil war. He certainly invoked this and he vowed to punish the people behind this mutiny. Take a listen to what else he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translator): I repeat, any internal turmoil is a mortal threat to our statehood, to us as a nation. This is a blow to Russia, to our people, to our actions to defend the fatherland against such a threat will be severe. All those who deliberately chose the path of treachery, who prepared an armed mutiny, who chose the path of blackmail and terrorist methods will face inevitable punishment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They looked almost like hostages, surrounded by Prigozhin and his armed men.He was demanding that the general chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, be delivered to him as well as the defense secretary -- defense minister, rather, Sergei Shoigu. He said that until that happens, he would blockade Rostov and also move on Moscow. He had claimed to take over an airbase. Wagner has since claimed to take over some military facilities in the central Russian region of Voronezh. We cannot independently confirm that. We know the governor in that province has ordered people to stay away from the highway leading south from Rostov to Moscow. There have been reports, unconfirmed, of clashes taking place around there. This is a very tense and fragile moment, because, initially, Prigozhin was basically declaring war on senior Russian military commanders, accusing them of corruption and bad management of the war in Ukraine. Now Putin has stepped up and declared war effectively on Prigozhin himself. So it will be a question, could we see a confrontation between Wagner mercenaries and Russian security forces? Wagner mercenaries have been in the trenches for months, fighting the Ukrainian military. These are seasoned, battle hardened warriors with heavy weaponry. I cannot even imagine what would happen if such a conflict were to erupt.",

But the narrative is still in Putin's court on this.Prigozhin has been effective on social media and we are witnessing the abilities of Prigozhin to get his message out. However, as long as the state media institutions are effectively behind Putin, which they are at the moment, then Putin's messaging wins out. And I think that if, as long as the state organs of information stay behind Putin, it's an indication that Putin still remains in control and power. But how does he stand side-by-side with Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister? You know, for a long time, Putin has been allowing Prigozhin to speak out aggressively against Shoigu, against Gerasimov, these strong men of Russia's military if you will. I know, they have been put there by Putin but Putin has been allowing them to be criticized heavily. It is only when Prigozhin has stepped over the line by questioning the war that -- and putting his troops on the streets, that the situation has risen to this level. How are those defense chiefs going to respond to Putin when to Prigozhin is out of the picture? So Putin's own power, his ability to wield power, his ability to have influence over the war in Ukraine, those things will be called into question. If we go back and remember the Kherson offensive by the Ukrainians in the fall of last year, Russia retreated out of there. Why? At the time we understood the reason why they retreated was because the military got control of the tactics on the ground from Putin and said it did not make military sense to stay and keep forces over the Dnipro River and pull them all back. So if the military have a stronger say in how the war plays out, this will affect Putin because if Putin does not achieve his aims in Ukraine, then his term in leadership would seem to be over very quickly.",

What we've seen until now is fairly small advances by Ukrainian forces. They've taken just eight really small villages -- villages is perhaps an overstatement of the kind of communities that are down there. But certainly the Ukrainians, this is a golden moment, perhaps a game- changer for the Ukrainians, as they are prepared to really carry this counteroffensive through. So they're really watching what's going on in the Kremlin, where it seems to be in a situation of chaos, to see whether this is really their golden moment to take full advantage of the instability amongst the ranks of the Russian military and the political elite as well.",

And therefore, really, it is a question of can he hold on to power long enough to perhaps, somewhere down the line, come to the table?

But it now seems that his aims are expanding because President Putin's speech earlier this evening has basically challenged Prigozhin, branded him a criminal. And so Prigozhin has come back and said, well, we will have a new president soon enough. So that suggests to me that his aims are expanding. He sees this as a direct challenge to the Putin regime. And that does suggest that he needs to actually march on Moscow to achieve that. And so the question in my mind is, how practical is that, given the size of his forces?

And it may make it easier for them to move north from Rostov-on-Don to Voronezh and ultimately to Moscow.

So that could make it easier for him to get to Moscow. But then, of course, we are talking about potential risk of major fighting occurring in the streets of Moscow between Prigozhin's forces on the one hand and those forces loyal to Putin on the other. And so that, I think, is where we talk about the prospect of civil war. It gets to that point that we've got fighting in Moscow. I think at that point, you're at civil war.",

They are clearly seeing the writing on the wall, that essentially Russia is not winning this war and it could quite easily lose this war.And if anything, the Prigozhin uprising is making a Russian defeat more likely because it could open up opportunities for the Ukrainians to exploit gaps in the Russian defenses there. So the siloviki and the oligarchs will be thinking about, how do they protect their interests? How do they protect their wealth, their position, their power? If they can't protect it through Putin, they would seek to have another leader come in that could replace Putin. I don't think it would be Prigozhin but it could be someone from the shadows that could come in, that would be loyal to the siloviki and the oligarchs and protect their interests in return for being given access to the Kremlin, having the top job. And Putin, well, he would be finished. So I think that that is where you have to look in terms of who is the puppet masters here, who is pulling the strings. It could be that Putin is facing his own demise. And so we are now in a desperate struggle between, on the one hand, Putin, who is seeking to hold onto power, hold on to his own personal well-being, and Prigozhin's forces, that, shall we say, could have some sort of assistance from within elements of the Russian military, if those elements feel that their future is better held if Prigozhin succeeds.",

Let's be clear: there is no potential followon leader after Putin, whether it's Prigozhin or someone else in the siloviki or the oligarchs or someone that particularly could come out of the Chechen area. There's none of them that really are, shall we say, friendly to the West. They're all hardline nationalists. So I'm not seeing any happy endings here in terms of a color revolution emerging in Moscow that ultimately leads to a new leadership that wants to end the war in Ukraine and restore relations with the West.
