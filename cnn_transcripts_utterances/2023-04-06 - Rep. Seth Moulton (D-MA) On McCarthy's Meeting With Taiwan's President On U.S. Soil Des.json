They say that the investigation into the death of the 30 -- 43-year-old tech executive is still in the early stages. No arrests have been made.The city has been grappling with an uptick in crime as it is attempting to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk tweeting, quote, \"Violent crime in San Francisco is horrific and even if the attackers are caught, they are often released immediately.\" Joining us now for perspective on all of this, CNN anchor and senior national correspondent, Sara Sidner. And for our upcoming new Sunday show, \"THE WHOLE STORY\" with Anderson Cooper,\" she went to San Francisco to actually uncover what's going on in the city. You lived there also, so you know -- you have a good perspective on this. Is this an anomaly? Is this something that people should be concerned about?",

It -- there's a marked difference. That is not a surprise.The one thing everyone says to you when you go into that city is watch where you park your car because almost inevitably, your car is going to get broken into. If there is anything visible it is going to get broken into at some point in time. But when you hear comments like that from Elon Musk, he is referring to the former district attorney who was recalled -- Chesa Boudin -- because the city decided they didn't want somebody who was going to be in a position of sort of being softer if you will on crime, for lack of a better word, and being more lenient. And so they decided that this was such a big issue in the city that, by the way, is very small in space -- seven-by-seven square miles. So you see things in that city. You're forced to because everything is compressed, right? But when you hear Elon Musk saying something like violent crime is out of control, here are the numbers -- and that's not what the numbers show. In 2020 -- that's the most recent FBI data -- San Francisco police reported 544 violent crimes per 100,000 people in the city. Houston is double that. More than double that per 100,000. So there are about 1,200 violent crimes in the city. So people need to understand that some of this is coming from San Francisco wasn't like this a few years ago and it has gotten worse. The mayor there, Mayor Breed, is fed up. I mean, she said, and I'm quoting her, \"We've got to do something about this BS,\" but she said the whole word. Let me let you listen to her.

So you've got to do this from a very young age.It's a big deal. I mean, we don't pay enough attention to skin cancers and to what we can do to prevent it. If you look at the numbers overall -- and this is just in the United States -- you're talking about the numbers of these basal cell or squamous cell-type cancers. About 5 1/2 million are diagnosed every year. Eight out of 10 -- 80 percent -- are the ones that Hugh Jackman was talking about -- the basal cell carcinomas. Death is uncommon -- very uncommon -- but they can spread. They can lead to the necessity for procedures as you just saw there. Let me just give you a quick primer here, Poppy. I think this graphic of what your skin looks like is really important. The epidermis -- that's the outer layer of your skin -- it's basically a thickness of like a credit card. And you're seeing that in this image here where these cells are specifically -- the squamous cells and the basal cells -- they lie there in that epidermis. That's what can be affected by sun. They can be mutated and they can turn into cancer even years later. You also have another type of cell known as melanocytes. If they become mutated that can turn into melanoma. Much less common but potentially far more serious. So that is why you were sunscreen, Poppy.",

Clearly, there's a lot of excitement but also a fair bit of fear right now about the state of artificial intelligence and the pace things are evolving at. So this statement calls attention to the important conversations we need to have at a national level and the conversations we can expect to have at a national level. But I think it's important to point out that President Biden mentions both benefits and risks of the technology. To me, that's a nod to tech companies that the administration isn't here to just regulate innovation away. They know AI comes with a lot of benefit and they expect to capitalize on that.

I mean, this video was created simply by typing in the prompt 'aerial drone footage of a mountain range'. And then this one was created by typing 'late afternoon sun peaking through the window of a New York City loft'. This is fascinating.",

So just using a short description -- a few words -- AI will generate a video in an instant.Right now, the videos are quite short with Runway. They are about four seconds and the quality is pretty good. But we can expect the pipeline of this technology to evolve where we can generate long-form, realistic videos from a simple description.
