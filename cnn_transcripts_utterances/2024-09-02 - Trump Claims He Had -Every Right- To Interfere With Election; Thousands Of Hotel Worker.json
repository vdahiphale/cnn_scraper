The irony there, of course, is that Mike Pence is not endorsing Donald Trump this go- around and Trump's supporters actually stormed the Capitol, some of them saying \"Hang Mike Pence\" on January 6. So the choice of words there is quite notable.I also want to point out that over the weekend he did respond to the news that several of the hostages have been killed by Hamas. And he said, \"That there was a total lack of leadership\" by the Biden-Harris administration on that front. He also linked it back to his own legal cases and saying that because they are focusing on \"weaponizing\" the Justice Department against him, they didn't take care of business on these foreign affairs, Sara.",

How much do you think election interference in his attempts to overturn the results are playing right now? MATT BENNETT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CO- FOUNDER, THIRD WAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY ASSISTANT, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. You know, to your point, John, it's very clear that the Harris campaign has not made that a central plank in their argument in this race, and I think that's probably wise. The Biden campaign ran on that in 2020 and it worked. You know, the restoring the soul of America. I think what we were seeing by the end of the kind of Biden run here was that was no longer resonating as deeply as it had been. It's amazing. I mean, Trump is threatening essentially a coup and saying that he had a right to take away America's most fundamental democratic rights, but it just doesn't seem to land with voters. So I think Harris is smart to make this a future-oriented campaign, to warn voters that Trump is extraordinarily dangerous -- Project 2025 is a 900-page blueprint that would fundamentally alter the country -- but not focus as much on that particular issue.",

So I think it's smart to put him out there.And the vice president has not tried to distance herself from Biden in any way. We saw that in the CNN interview last week. What she's going to do is talk about her plan for the future because elections are about the future and not the past. So she's not going to dwell too much on the things that she and Biden have done, but she's not going to try to in any way push Biden aside. And I think it's important to note that there has been a real consolidation around Harris in ways that we weren't seeing with Biden earlier in some constituencies even that Trump is strong in. I mean, we're showing far less weakness with white male voters, for instance, than we were before she took over the race.",

If you look at these numbers from the ABC News poll -- well, no, that wasn't this number. This is among likely voters. You can see Vice President Harris is up six among likely voters. She's up four among registered voters.The numbers I'm looking at right now talk about vote preference by gender. There you go. You can see that pre-convention among women she had a six-point lead. Post-convention with women is a 13-point lead. And among me, a little bit of a shift for -- in the Trump direction, but not a -- not as statistically significant one. She trails now among men by five points. Before the convention it was three points. But that chasm among women, Scott -- how problematic is that for Trump?",

There are more women than men in the country, so I'm only moderately good at math but you can see how it would fundamentally work out.I mean, that -- but it is true. We are heading, I think, towards a huge gender gap in this election. It doesn't mean Trump can't win on it, but you do have to then find those votes elsewhere. And so it's kind of fascinating. I mean, if you look at the two characteristics in this country that best determine how you're going to vote, it's gender and educational attainment. That was true for the last several years but it's very true right now. So it's that working- class men versus college-educated women sort of cohorts that probably are most divergent in the data that you're looking at.",

I mean, who knows where he stands anymore on those things, although we do know fundamentally what his party wants to do because we've got the blueprint in Project 2025. The other thing that women are very concerned about -- like all voters, they're worried about the economy, and they certainly don't like the idea of 20 percent across-the-board tariffs that would immediately increase prices. I mean, the idea that Trump is doing to lower prices is exactly backwards. All of his plans would increase prices and that really worries women.",

He never has, As you pointed out, he's been more moderate on it than some ardent pro-lifers probably personally want him to be. He does have a record a president. He operated a pro-life administration. Directionally, he's a pro-life guy who is going to have a pro-life administration. Directionally, Kamala Harris is pro- abortion, and she'll have a pro-abortion administration. His position is no different as I understand it than Ronald Reagan, which is he's pro-life. He believes in some reasonable limits. He also believes in the three exceptions of rape, incest, and life of the mother. And he's been a strong supporter of IVF no matter what any of Kamala Harris' surrogates want to say about it or lie about it repeatedly hour-by-hour on cable television. [07:40:02] So he's got what I think is actually a pretty moderate, mainstream position. And again, in the Republican Party there are some people who want him to go further, and in the Democratic Party there are some people who think he's gone too far. Also, one other issue on this thing. In the next administration no bill banning abortion can pass the U.S. Senate. He's never going to have to deal with this as president. And so this is largely going to be left to the states. And he's expressed his personal preferences about it, and I think his personal preferences are kind of center cut for most Americans. Reasonable limits, three exceptions, support IVF -- that's a mainstream view.",

DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Sara, good to be with you. He's in the same kind of political trouble he's been in for more than a year now, even before the October 7 terror attack. It's the same workers union which had been critical to the establishment of Israel that actually ran the strikes that forced Netanyahu to back away from his judicial reform effort which, of course, was last year. In the past 11 months we've seen other moments of big protests and some strikes, although the strikes this time have been halted by a court -- at least temporarily. But the question is does any of this register with Netanyahu himself since his own political future is really on a different timetable than the one that Spider referred to before. The IDF does indeed have the options to go use their intelligence and so forth to make sure that Hamas doesn't reappear as a threat, but Netanyahu has argued for something even further than that -- that Israel must remain in Gaza as part of this deal. And, of course, that's been one of the hangups. Hamas has thrown its own obstacles. Remember, it was only six weeks ago we were told by Secretary of State Blinken that the deal was on the 10-yard line, and they just haven't been able to get it over.
