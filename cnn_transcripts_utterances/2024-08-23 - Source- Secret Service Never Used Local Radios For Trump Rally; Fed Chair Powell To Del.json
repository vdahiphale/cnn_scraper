She clearly had so many Democrats already around the country excited and supporting her.What she needed to do last night with the speech of her political life and with the audience that was just millions of Americans that were tuning in to see who was Kamala Harris, she accomplished that. The way that she did it was because it was an artful architecture of a narrative that started with her personal bio for those who didn't know who she was; her professional bio, getting to what you were talking about, Shermichael, in terms of well, what is she going to do for me? Then she followed that up with her own values and then talked about what she wants to do for the American people. And ended up with a very sharp contrast with what her opponent is doing in Donald Trump. And the strength of it, both visually as well as verbally, was exactly what she needed to do for those voters -- Independent voters, men across the board, Republican who do not want to see another four years of Donald Trump but perhaps aren't sure about a Kamala Harris. She did exactly what she needed to do for those voters as well. But now, you know, let's make no bones about this, the hard work starts because this was just the beginning, and it was a fabulous beginning for her.

Even Thomas Sowell, the conservative, you know, philosopher and thought thinker wrote a piece, I think in The Wall Street Journal, pretty much saying Republicans need to get their stuff together because the messaging just isn't sticking. The momentum is obviously shifting to the vice president. The former president needs to figure out a way to shift things back to himself. I think he has an opportunity. I think you can make the argument. Credit card defaults are at an all-time high. I think CNBC had an article that came out a couple of days ago talking about the number of Americans who can't afford to pay their mortgage on a consistent basis or their rent on a consistent basis. So there are some elements that he should be talking about and if I were advising him, I would say focus and hone in on those points.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate. We're learning that local officers did set aside radios explicitly for the purpose of communicating directly with U.S. Secret Service before Trump's July 13 rally, but Secret Service never picked those radios up. And if they had, Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger tells us they would have likely heard that warning about a man on the roof before Thomas Crooks opened fire at Donald Trump, killing a rallygoer and hitting the former president.I want to read what the district attorney in Butler County told us when we asked him about these radios and why they were never picked up. He says, \"I can confirm that the Butler County ESU team made radios available to the Secret Service and that they were not utilized by the Secret Service. It is safe to assume that if a holder of an ESU radio was paying attention, they would have received the call.\" And he's referring to that warning minutes before Thomas Crooks opened fire. And that's really been the prevailing question over the last month as we have looked into how Thomas Crooks was able to get off eight shots before he was ultimately neutralized by a Secret Service sniper. The acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, has even acknowledged that they just needed seconds of a heads up or a warning before the shooting occurred and that they could have prevented it from happening. So this is going to raise a lot of questions. This is something that was initially pointed out by Congressman Clay Higgins who served on that congressional task force that's investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. That task force is scheduled to make a visit to Butler County and the rally site next week where they're going to meet with local officials in, really, their first investigative step. So this is going to raise even more questions about the communication breakdowns that occurred and that led up to the shooting and allowed Thomas Crooks to open fire at a former president.",

But as you mentioned, this is a serious lapse, it appears, in the preplanning process that did result in someone getting killed and a former president being shot.The Secret Service has made some changes following the Trump -- assassination attempt of Donald Trump. They've added its own mobile communications apparatus to try to create this private cell network that can sort of facilitate communication between Secret Service officials on the ground and local officers that are there to help provide security at events -- big events like the Trump rally on July 13. They've also added ballistic glass around Trump when he gives speeches. You saw just yesterday when he was giving a speech, he's now encased in that glass casing of ballistic bulletproof glass. And they've also increased the number of agents on Trump's security detail trying to provide more of a security presence around the former president. But at the end of the day, it is -- it does go back to maybe just simple things like picking up radios to where you can speak to your local law enforcement partners.",

How much do they cut rates in September? It's been an ongoing conversation. And then, how quickly can they bring rates down from thereon because that's what matters ultimately to borrowers out there? I think the first one is pretty easy. Again, he'll signal that a quarter of a percentage point rate cut is what's expected in September. It fits with the data.
