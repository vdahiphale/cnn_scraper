Although this is an effort the Russians have been making for some several weeks to try and get all the round -- all the way around this town to cut it off.It will be an extremely symbolically important win for Moscow, strategically as well in its attempts to take the whole of the Donetsk region and therefore the whole of the Donbass. And yet Ukrainian soldiers say they're holding firm despite terrible conditions we've seen on videos that we've geolocated there, Kate, the muddy conditions, the flooding, the impossible roads for many of them. What they're saying as well is that they're coming under hundreds of artillery barrages every day, rocket fire as well as the Russian forces trying to break through their defenses encircling the town and cutting them off. That is not for the time being the case, Kate.",

They're essential for most modern tech phones, cars, computers, medical equipment, you name it. And now, the Biden administration is making a big bet to try and beat out China to be the global leader in producing these chips.Jeremy Diamond has more on this from the White House for us. Jeremy, you spoke with the commerce secretary about this CHIPS initiative? What did she tell you?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, one of the things that the commerce secretary wanted to be crystal clear about is that this is a national security initiative. It is about out-competing China in chips production and also ensuring that the U.S. isn't reliant on other foreign producers for these advanced chips, which are essential for a whole range of issues in terms of commercial applications, but also key military technologies as well.But one of the things that Secretary Raimondo told us was also that in order to meet those national security goals that the United States needs to invest and make sure that there is a workforce that can meet the moment. And that's why as of today, the U.S. opens up nearly $40 billion of funding and subsidies for Chips manufacturers here in the United States. They're also making sure that these companies that are applying for these funds, that they have to lay out how they're going to meet some of these workforce development goals in terms of planning to work with educational institutions and to provide the kinds of training to ensure that there is that kind of highly skilled workforce able to produce these chips. Also, looking to ensure that there is diversity in terms of both the chips manufacturing, but also the construction of these chips, manufacturing plants, which is going to require something from 120 to 140,000 construction workers to build all of these plants, according to the commerce secretary. They're also trying to meet some key domestic policy initiatives with this CHIPS plan as well. And that is that any applicant that's applying for more than $150 million in funding from this CHIPS program is also going to have to ensure that they lay out how they intend to provide some kind of access to childcare, whether on-site or childcare subsidies for their workforce. All of this is with the goal of diversifying that workforce and ensuring that these are attractive jobs so that the U.S. can have enough people in these positions to meet those national security goals. But again, that is the big picture is the national security implications of this are so key and that's what Secretary Raimondo really wanted to stress to us. Kate.",

But the national security reality is that we don't want to be overly reliant on any country for critical supply chain goods, materials, parts, components. That's what's happened here with CHIPS. It was a wake-up call.The questions that I'm bringing to this committee as a manufacturing policy expert from the Midwest is, what do we need to get in front of for the next round of technology, the next round of R&amp;D, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, technologies that we see going into our automobiles? This is an exciting moment for us. But it's also definitely part of a wake-up call. 90 percent of the graphite -- I've just did a science committee hearing and we just heard from the council on competitiveness, 90 percent of the graphite that we're relying on for batteries and for anything that that is supplied by graphite is coming from China. We're also in raw materials in a rare earth minerals race. I've been talking about this since we -- the days we were doing the auto rescue, Kate. Now, here we are about to hit the quarter 21st-century mark for this nation, and we've got to think about industrial policy in a new way.",

Certainly, they're calling for an end to the war but not by any means in which we're calling an end to the war. And you saw the president speak to that recently and saying that it didn't really make a lot of sense.Now, we're looking at them potentially sending arms to Russia, which would be quite mind-blowing and disappointing. And the steps that I think that we need to take in response are going to have to be serious. They're going to have to be aggressive. And they're not going to be singular. We're going to have to act alongside our Western allies and our -- and our allies to the -- to the south of us. Certainly, what is taking place in Ukraine with Russia's illegal war one year on is not acceptable. It has never been acceptable. And democracy must prevail. We cannot condone lawless autocracies going forward in the way Russia has. And if China does want to sell arms, that certainly asks a lot of questions and begets action.",

They've been going back and forth for roughly 15 minutes here sort of on this agree to disagree on these findings. But this is part of what the defense continued to do during its case presentation to try and poke holes and create doubt around the state's narrative they've created about what happened on June 7, 2021. I can tell you that court has been a little bit for lack of a better word, Kate, spicier today with the attorneys before the jury even came in. The defense really protested on the length of time that this trial has taken. We're talking about what was supposed to be a three-week trial. We're in week six now. And the state said that they are going to call seven witnesses in its rebuttal period, rather than the initial one to two or three to four that they said yesterday evening.

They're about bringing the jury to where the -- where the incident occurred, where the crime occurred. And so, you do that by showing pictures. You do that by video. There's nothing more probative, more important, more relevant than actually bringing the jury there.Now, you can argue that some jurors will have formed conclusions and they will, based upon the visit to their property, really confirmed some of the notions that they believe happened or you could argue that some minds will be changed based upon how it's laid out. But I think the defense certainly wants to bring them there to go into their narrative. Could it have been two shooters who actually did this as opposed to one? Is that even possible? Well, the layout and scope of the property and based upon what Alex Murdaugh was testifying to, in terms of him using a golf cart to get down to the kennels back home, could he have done that? You know, was that proper? Does that raise reasonable doubt? So, the defense certainly wants to show them how it's laid out, how it's situated to propagate their narrative as to what specifically happened on that day.
