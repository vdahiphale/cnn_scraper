It wasn't too long ago that a Jamaal Bowman win shortly after a win by AOC, people were talking about sort of the pendulum swinging to the progressive flank when it came to the Democratic Party. In this era, since Biden has gotten elected, there have been questions about that shift moving back to the center. But again, when you're -- when you're talking about the flaws of this candidate, it is a little hard to pinpoint whether or not there is something broader happening there.",

That is moving up in the trend. Trump tends to pick the candidate either early or late, that will eventually win. This time last night, there were three candidates who lost last night, even though they had the former president's backing and in Utah in particular, that is to replace Mitt Romney in the Senate. John Curtis, the winner in that, the Congressman there, more moderate than the Trump-aligned wing of the party. What do you take away from that?",
