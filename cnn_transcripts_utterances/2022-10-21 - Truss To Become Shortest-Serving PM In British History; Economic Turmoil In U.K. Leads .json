A big question right now after the sudden resignation of British Prime Minister Liz Truss. The biggest of all, who will replace her? The ruling conservative party wants a new leader in place within days.Remember, Truss' leadership campaign took about eight weeks, which turned out to be longer than she spent in office.

      "sentences": "Christine, so there are no candidates who have officially declared themselves in the race. But the leadership race is well underway happening though largely behind closed doors. And that is because candidates will be horse trading, negotiating, trying to persuade their parliamentary colleagues to actually support them, because the bar to even get into this race is quite high.There are more than 300 Conservative MPs and it'll take the support of at least 100 to even get into the race. This does not favor more minor candidates who are popular maybe with a certain wing of the party or popular with party membership. This favors the known quantities already, people who already have a well-established track record already. And it's possible that there could only be one, one candidate who actually reaches that 100-vote threshold, in which case we'll have a new prime minister of Britain on Monday. Otherwise, there could potentially be up to three in which case the Party MPs would whittle down the list to two and then put those to a party vote. But because of the shortened timeline, that we're talking about choosing a party leader by the end of next week, it would have to be an online vote of the party membership which brings up all kinds of concerns about reaching members and also about cybersecurity as well. The odds-on favor, Christine, at this point is Rishi Sunak. He's the former chancellor. He has plenty of economic and financial credibility, especially considering the fact that he seemed to predict correctly what would happen if Liz Truss' disastrous policies were actually put into place. But he is also known as the architect of Boris Johnson's downfall. And so there is some particularly bad blood between them. Penny Mordaunt is another possible contender. She's the leader of the House of Commons right now. And Boris Johnson, if you can believe that, Christine, is also potentially putting his name into the race as well. But he comes with an enormous amount of baggage as you can imagine. He was forced out of office. He resigned only six or seven weeks ago after scandal, after being found to have held parties at Downing Street in the depths of lockdown. I should also mention quickly that there is a parliamentary investigation into whether or not Boris Johnson misled MPs over that party gate scandal. It hasn't even had time to start yet. And so, if that investigation were to find that he did actually mislead MPs, then potentially he could be suspended as an MP altogether, which of course, would throw this country into even more chaos.",

And then afterwards, he met up with Senate candidate John Fetterman at a sandwich shop before going to a closed-door donor event. Now that kind of new strategy represents a political reality for this White House, which is the fact that although things that this President has passed, like student loans with executive order, or like the bipartisan infrastructure bill through Congress, he still remains an unpopular president and one that some Democratic candidates in those tighter races don't exactly want to be on that big stage with.

So rather than an attack across the border of troops coming in from Russia, from the north, into Ukraine, they now think that the threat is shifting West, and that these troops could potentially cross the border from Belarus into Ukraine. And that would be a huge worry and concern. And part of this may be, Russia trying to distract and stretch Ukrainian forces, take them away from the offensive in the south, make them deploy more forces to the north, but that's a concern. Electricity here also a concern. Not so many overnight strikes on power infrastructures across the country, although there were several in the center of the country. Here in Kyiv, for example, rolling blackouts began or sort of set blackouts began at 9:20 this morning.
