This is so notable because in the first trial, the first 10-week trial of the Oath Keepers that occurred in the fall, only 2 members out of 5 were convicted on seditious conspiracy. This charge is very hard to prove. It is very rare that it's even charged at all and rare that it results in convictions. So, this case represents a huge win for the Justice Department.More specifically about this case, this involved three members of the Oath Keepers. One person who's associated with this far right militia. Those four men are Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel and Edward Vallejo. They are accused of plotting to stop the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 Electoral College victory. The DOJ said that conspiracy culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. Again, this char is rare. It is severe and it represents basically, a slam dunk for the Justice Department knowing they were able to secure this conviction against all four defendants in this case. In the previous case they were able to secure seditious conspiracy convictions against Stewart Rhodes who was the -- basically a leader of the Oath Keepers, the head of the entire organization and another man named Kelly Meggs. In both cases key evidence came from the defendant's own words that were sometimes caught on video. Other times they had put these words in text messages to groups, in emails, to open letters. In this latest case a prosecutor cited one defendant saying millions will die. Get your f'ing soul ready. That was the language and actually a piece of video that prosecutors used in the closing arguments in this case. Minuta, Hackett and Moerschel and Vallejo all face additional charges and were convicted on some of those charges including obstruction of an official proceeding.

In this press conference, again a short time ago, the NATO chief saying he is confident that decision will come soon, that consultations are ongoing with allies. But absolutely over the course of the last couple of days we've seen pressure piling on Berlin. And I'm going to point to Poland here in particular.
