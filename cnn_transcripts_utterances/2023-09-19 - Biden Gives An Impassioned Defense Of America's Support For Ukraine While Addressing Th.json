Now, all eyes on Ukraine's President Zelenskyy as he takes to the podium this very hour. Then a murder investigation forces a diplomatic rift, Canada says there are credible allegations India was behind the assassination of a Sikh leader. And then the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin left a power vacuum, so what has taken Wagner's place in parts of Africa? We have a special CNN investigation. But first this evening, it's all eyes on United Nations this hour. I want to show you the live pictures, because we are waiting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address leaders at the General Assembly. Right now, His Excellency Sedar Berdimuhamedow is speaking, he's the president of Turkmenistan, of course, when that starts -- when we see President Zelenskyy, we shall bring that to you. U.S. President Joe Biden took the podium just hours ago, he calls for unity and reiterated a familiar message that United States and its allies will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Italy is calling on the United Nations to help with the migrant crisis unfolding on Lampedusa. Authorities say the tiny island is becoming overwhelmed after 7,000 people arrived in just two days. The EU has pledged action to help, but Italy's foreign minister says Europe can't solve the crisis on its own. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO TAJANI, FOREIGN MINISTER, ITALY (through translator): We are absolutely convinced that the issue of migration is an African issue, but also, the Middle East issue, must certainly be addressed at not only in Italian level, but at the European level. But we also believe the United Nations must also play their part, since this is such a vast phenomenon that can't be solved at the European level alone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we've seen for instance last month, rather in July, the EU and Tunisia concluded an agreement to try to deal with the migrant issue, but there is opposition within the EU to actually providing the funds to make this agreement possible. So, it's simply not working out, and what we're seeing is that for Italy, which is of course, led by a hard-right government, that while in opposition was talking very hard about things like Naval blockades to stop migrants from reaching Italian shores. Now, Italian leaders particularly the Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, are having to deal with reality. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He pushed back against suggestions Ukraine could, should see some territory in exchange for a cease-fire, saying that, if it happens, the independence of no nation would be secure. Away from the United Nations, there was welcome news for the Ukrainian president when it comes to supplying the country's war efforts in Germany. The U.S. Defense Secretary led a meeting of countries to talk about providing Kyiv with weapons as well as equipment. And he promised American M1 Abrams tanks will enter Ukraine soon, adding that Ukraine's ongoing counteroffensive is making, quote, \"steady forward progress.\" World leaders have been weighing in all throughout the day really on the war in Ukraine but few understand the dynamics quite like Finland. It shares a land border with Russia on the east but has been a key ally to the West. Since abandoning a decades-long policy of neutrality, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has donated hundreds of millions in aid as well as munitions, as well as artillery to Kyiv.

Homicide investigators say two masked suspects described as heavier set males fled on foot and then possibly in this 2008 silver Toyota Camry.
