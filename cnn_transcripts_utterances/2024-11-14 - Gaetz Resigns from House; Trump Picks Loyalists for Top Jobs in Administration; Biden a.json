I mean, this is a complete joke, and it's also dangerous for America for him to be in charge.Think about all the divisions he'll be working on. Think about our civil rights. Think about hate crimes.

A lot of these pics have tried to own the libs as it's called over the years. But this is serious. Gaetz has made a lot of controversial remarks during his time in office, particularly on January 6. Let's listen to some of those, followed by what he's told January 6 defendants outside the D.C. jail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  We know this, January 6 last year wasn't an insurrection. No one has been charged with insurrection. No one has been charged with treason, but it -- they very well may have been a fed-surrection. I just wanted to say how sorry I am that there are any Americans that are having to ignore this two-tiered justice system. (END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA:  Now, Gaetz has introduced legislation to limit sentences for January 6th defendants. Marc, I mean, is that why Trump is putting Matt Gaetz -- is that part of the reason why he's putting Matt Gaetz at the Justice Department to help him with all these pardons that he wants to issue for those defendants? MARC LOTTER, FORMER TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, AMERICA FIRST POLICY INSTITUTE:  Well, I can't obviously speak for the president-elect, but I think what you see in all of his cabinet picks, including Matt Gaetz, including some of the others that he's named is that he wants people who are going to go out there and are going to be supportive of the America first agenda, that a majority of Americans voted to support. He doesn't want to see what happened in the early years of 2017 where we had a lot of people who were not in a fully aligned with the president's policy agenda, trying to invoke their policy views on the president rather than actually executing the plans of the president and the duly elected leader of the free world. So, I think all of these pics are about that. And it's really, I would say, a warning shot to the deep state, to the bureaucracy that remember, it's the people's elected representatives that are in charge, not you.",

I think what you see right now in the Trump picks is this is the next generation of America first leadership. You see younger folks who didn't necessarily come up through the traditional career paths of Washington, D.C. They're outsiders. And I think they need to bring an outsider's view into some of these agencies to ask questions about, why are we doing this way? Is this the reason why, because we've been doing something this way for the last 40 or 50 years we have to keep doing it this way, or should we start adjusting and making the, government, the bureaucracy, a little more responsive to the people rather than responsible to Washington D.C.?So, I think it reflects the president's commitment to put America first and make sure our government is actually delivering on behalf of the American people not just serving --",

And I would say maybe, yes, we're bringing outsiders in. We're bringing in Russia's influence is what this is because we have people like Tulsi Gabbard who are spreading Kremlin talking points and spreading conspiracies.And so, quite frankly, to me, who's someone who served in our national security community and to actually takes great offense to the term the deep state and I always have, because all of us serve for the greater good of the country without really truly what they accuse us of being a partisan lens. We're actually just trying to follow our constitution, our oaths, and obey the rule of law. And so, when I see this cast of characters, I worry. I worry about what it's going to look like for intelligence sharing with our country. I worry about how our allies view this. I worry that they're no longer going to share that intelligence when they worry about where it's going to end up. And I worry about what that means for our homeland security. And whether that means we're more susceptible to attacks like what we saw at 9/11 when this happens.",

So, I think, first and foremost, even if you're a Democrat who felt uncomfortable when you saw those photos, then, you know what, I'll cop to being one of them. I looked at the photo of, you know, President Biden smiling and I felt a little uncomfortable.But I think it is incredibly important that he sends a signal to the country, to people who -- many of whom -- the majority of whom voted for Donald Trump. Then he sends that message that says, you know, we as a government will continue to function. I think that's important. We obviously did not get that in 2020 when we were coming in. President Trump did not extend us, the incoming Biden team, to say the least, did not extend us that courtesy. But it is an important signal. I also think it is a show of unity. I mean, again, we have to accept the majority of the country who voted voted for Donald Trump. And I think it's important as a show of unity, which is something that President Biden does feel very strongly about, that he was sending that signal. So, I think as a Democrat, you can feel uncomfortable with the photo and also recognize that it serves an important purpose for our country. I -- also, can I just quickly respond to what Marc was saying about outsiders coming in? ACOSTA:  Sure.",

So, it's one thing to say you're going to bring in people who are going to look at all of the government with a new lens and shake it up, it's entirely another to say you're bringing in people who are going to be willing to do only what Donald Trump wants when there is a long history of Donald Trump asking them to do things that are at odds with the constitution of the United States.

InfoWars and Alex Jones, is all about fear, fear of immigrants, fear of Democrats, fear of government. He is a disinformation artist. And it was his defaming of the Sandy Hook families that caused all of this to happen. That lawsuit, it was that $1.4 or $1.5 billion judgment against Jones that sent this to auction. And as of today, a judge has ruled that The Onion, a satirical news website, gets to own all of the InfoWars assets. So, as we speak, Jim, infowars.com, the website's already been taken down.

Very important story this morning.In the meantime, President-Elect Donald Trump has announced many of his cabinet picks this week, including the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Hasn't gotten as much news, but this is also fascinating. Former Republican Congressman of New York, Lee Zeldin, in 2014 he was asked about climate change, and this was his stance.

You remember Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who spent most of his career suing the EPA, put in charge of it, and then he flamed out during ethics scandals. Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, replaced him there. And probably wanted that job back again, from what we understand.But Lee Zeldin, like all these picks, a true loyalist, of course, voted against the 2020 election certification, sat with the Trumps in the box many times. He -- former New York from Long Island. Put himself actually on climate solutions, caucuses, and estuary committees because the environment matters very much to folks on Long Island there. But if you look at his voting record, 50 times he voted against climate change legislation, against clean water legislation, 11 times clean air, eight times. The League of Conservation Voters tracks the voting records of every member of Congress, and on a scale of 100, he gets a 14, which is actually better than most Republicans who are in the single digits. He did vote for regulating PFAS, Forever Chemicals, at one point, and to give Native American tribes some money to -- you know, to actually release wild buffalo. So, that boosted his League of Conservation score a little bit. But it just seems like if these other picks, Jim, that you're talking about are in the indication, these are pressure tests, you know, for the American and for the Senate. And when it comes to environmental rollbacks and what -- you know, what he would hope to do and gut from day one on, you got to imagine the sky is the limit for Lee Zeldin and that agency. And there's a lot of folks who were there, survived first term, who are terrified today, Jim.",
