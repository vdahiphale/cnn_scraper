We're getting new information on both candidates and how they hope to score points on the debate stage.Also tonight, the judge in the Trump classified documents case apparently isn't buying new defense arguments that the FBI warrant to search Mar-a-Lago back in 2022 was invalid. We'll take you inside the sometimes heated hearing. And police in Kenya open fire on protesters who stormed parliament and set it on fire. CNN is on the scene of the deadly clashes and the growing chaos. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. Tonight with only two days left before a CNN's groundbreaking presidential debate Biden and Trump campaign insiders are revealing new details about the candidates game plans going into this pivotal moment in the race for the White House. CNN correspondents are working their sources. MJ Lee is standing by for us over at the White House. But first, let's go to Kristen Holmes. She's near Mar-a-Lago down in Florida. Kristen, you just got off the phone with Trump's campaign advisors. What did they tell you?",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, there was a lot of level setting bolts. They talked a lot about how they believe that President Joe Biden can show up, that he has proven himself a formidable opponent, that he showed up at the State of the Union, that in debates past he has also shown up. This is very different from what we have heard from president -- former President Donald Trump and his advisers for several months as they have painted Biden as incompetent. Donald Trump often mocking Joe Biden as he tries to get off the stage saying that he can't find his way to the stairs. Now all of a sudden, they are changing the expectation level.This is something that we anticipated would happen particularly as over the weekend, we started hearing from more and more of Donald Trump's allies talking about how the bar was set too low for President Biden. Now the other thing I want to point out is what I've been told by multiple advisors, which is that they are hoping and working with Donald Trump to stay on message particularly to focus on three things, immigration, the economy, particularly inflation, and crime rates. They believe that Donald Trump based on recent polling is more favorable in these areas than Joe Biden. And they want Donald Trump to continue to go back even if he's answering questions about abortion, even if he's answering questions about democracy, about January 6, all of which they anticipate they are hoping that he will pivot back to that messaging on the economy, on inflation, on immigration and on crime, keeping him in the zone. Now, of course, we don't know which version of Donald Trump is going to show up. But I did talk to a number of his advisers who said that even though they originally thought that this lack of audience will be harmful to Trump since he feeds off of an audience, that they actually have come to believe it could be helpful because he won't go on these kind of rants and tirades that he does to entertain a crowd. Now, obviously, how this plays out, we're going to find out on Thursday, Wolf.",

And I do agree that President Biden has got to take the opportunities that he has presented to go after Trump because of exactly what Gloria said, there is a certain amnesia in the American population about what Trump did, about how horrific the economy became, when Trump denied the science of COVID, when he told people to inject themselves with chlorine, there were millions of jobs that were lost, more than a million Americans died, the economy was in a tailspin when he left.And I think importantly, even before COVID on an issue, for example, like immigration, the President has got to remind people that Donald Trump ripped babies from the arms of their families, separated families. It was a policy that he implemented that he was proud of. He has talked about implementing that policy yet again. And I think on that issue of immigration, the Trump team and Trump himself is going to go full bore, xenophobia, anti-immigrant, trying to scare monger and fear monger, connect it with crime that will probably bring families that have suffered at the hands of some undocumented migrants. And Donald Trump is going to go for the jugular on this, I believe, against President Biden, because it's one of the issues that Donald Trump has said he needs in this election. And I think it's going to be a desperate attempt to paint Joe Biden as somebody who's very weak on immigration. And so, President Biden has got to answer that with the actions that he has taken and underscore that Republicans have turned their back on any real resolution.",

And so, now they're taking a completely different tack, right? Now, we've gone from sleepy, decrepit Joe to jacked up Joe. He's gone as far as to suggest that Joe Biden's on cocaine, completely baseless.And I think it's very irresponsible, I think it is Donald Trump doing what Donald Trump always does, which is to try to lay the groundwork so that if he has a bad night, he can claim something was rigged. There was something rigged against him because it's not possible that he lost on his own. So it's either because Joe Biden's jacked up on cocaine or drugs or God knows what, or because the moderators are -- you know, the last one is that the moderators are bias, you name it, it's Donald Trump trying to put the playing field in a way that he can blame somebody else if he has a bad night.",

And I see no realistic prospect of them actually succeeding on this motion to defeat the search warrant. Now, it's quite common in cases where someone has been subjected to a search warrant, they challenge it. But what you have to show in order to defeat a search warrant is basically that the government, the FBI, DOJ lacked probable cause to get in the premises or then did the search in an unconstitutional way. For example, if they were authorized to search a bedroom and they went on their own down into the basement and did a search beyond what they were allowed to do.Neither of those is present here. Trump's team hasn't even alleged either of those things. Instead, they're sort of picking around the margins, as Katelyn said, arguing well, the affidavits could have been more specific, the documents were not necessarily maintained in order which DOJ rejected. So, I don't think that's nearly enough. I don't think Trump's team has any realistic chance of getting the evidence or the case thrown out based on the search warrant.",

But Wolf, there is so much to do, and this timeline is a huge question mark. There's no trial date on the schedule still. And then in these proceedings, she just had three days of proceedings on four different requests from prosecutors and the defense. She's going to have to rule on all of those very likely write lengthy legal opinions about them, make those decisions. And then there's so much else to do. There are things that they're doing in confidential parts of court working with classified documents preparing for that case. It's a reminder of just how much is still out there.And then on top of that, Trump's team isn't just asking for up down yes or no deny or grant from Judge Cannon. They're asking her for look -- to look at the question of whether there should be even more hearings. Every single hearing cheese that they've had over the past couple of days, they've reiterated that, how about you have more hearings, how will we see more evidence?

But bigger problems still remain on shore. And that's because right now, there's about 6,000 pallets of aid that are just sitting on this open airway warehouse on the Gaza beach. And that's because the World Food Program, which is supposed to be the one picking up those pallets of aid, say that there are major security concerns at this moment, and they are not able to pick up that aid and actually distributed to Gaza. And so for now, none of this aid is actually making it into the hands of Gazans who need it the most at a time when that need is growing extraordinarily with warnings of a high risk of famine, once again in the Gaza Strip. And we were also able to see, Wolf, from our vantage on this pier was the enormous destruction on the Gaza coastline, a very rare vantage point at a time, when of course we cannot go into Gaza unilaterally because the Israeli government does not authorize us to do so. I've been in a few times with the Israeli military. But this is once again been a rare vantage to see the coastline.

He's someone who can elevate very quickly and we saw that in a different way during the State of the Union address, which I thought was first rate. You've seen the Trump campaign now fall over themselves trying to reset expectations because they made the mistake of suggesting Joe Biden wasn't going to have a strong debate. [17I think he's going to go right at Donald Trump. And let me tell you three easy things, he should hit Donald Trump very, very sharply on undermining American democracy and being extremists on taking away the rights of women, the right the rights of women to choose, and on a huge tax cut for the wealthy and for the big corporations, at a point where Americans are really hurting at the kitchen table economically, Biden has so many perfect attack lanes to go at Trump and one thing we know about all bullies, they don't do well, when you smack them in the face rhetorically, I think that's what you're going to see from Joe Biden.",

But this one for him, if he tries to be aggressive, it's just going to emphasize the extremism, which is obviously hurting him with a lot of moderate voters, including moderate independent and Republican voters, particularly women voters, in the suburbs in those key states. So an extreme like nasty approach will backfire. On the other hand, if he tries to be sweetness and light, who's going to believe that. And Joe Biden has so many effective attack lines, I guarantee you he's going to use them.Donald Trump is going to be turned into a punching bag, which isn't going to serve them well. Or if he acts like he normally does in a debate, that also hurts him. So he's got a tough road, Donald Trump. I think Joe Biden goes into this in a very strong position.",
