An ROV would probably be the fastest method if they can get one out there in a rapid method. The problem is they have to have a vessel to land it on. Getting it -- say they're bringing it from the States, they have to bring it out to Newfoundland. Find a vessel to bring it out. You know, how fast it could get out there. They may be able to fly it out 400 miles with a helicopter, you know, you know, refueling. There's a lot of logistics involved here. And given the dire situation, I'm sure that everyone is trying to expedite the gear out to them in a rapid method. The ROVs are very capable. That's probably what they will use for searching for this vessel. As far as the surface, the Coast Guard is very good at doing this, so it's the Canadian Coast Guard. They're very capable.

That's because Justice Department officials want to ensure that all of the information they hand over as part of this discovery process in this prosecution is kept private.So, Donald Trump and Walt Nauta and their lawyers would be barred from several things. First of all, sharing any information they're given with anyone other than their lawyers or people involved in the defense. In addition, Trump and Nauta will only be allowed access to this material under the direct supervision of their attorneys. Now, they can take notes, but their notes must be kept in the possession of their attorneys and stored securely. And finally, nothing that DOJ gives can then be shared on social media. This sort of protective order is definitely standard in criminal cases like this. And the order, it must be signed by all parties who are privy to the information collected and then handed over by prosecutors. And it really protects against the disclosure of sensitive information, like grand jury transcripts. Especially when other investigations we know are still ongoing. Of course, the special counsel's probe continues into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. So, DOJ really needs to make sure that information about those other investigations is not disclosed publicly. And that's what this protective order does. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.
