I'm Christine Romans.Just moments ago, you watched live Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking in a video link in an event in Berlin marking one year since Russia's invasion. One year ago today, Russian troops invaded eastern Ukraine, believing they were overwhelmed a smaller country in short order. Instead, as the war has dragged, a straightforward Russian victory has become less likely by the day. This morning, instead of dwelling on Ukraine's losses, President Zelenskyy released an inspirational video, urging his people to face the enemy, racist, and fight. His tweet ends, we know that 2023 will be the year of our victory. CNN's Melissa Bell is live this morning in Kyiv. What is the mood there on what we think is an unhappy milestone here?",

On one hand, Ukrainians are bracing this morning, Christine, for more Russian strikes, that is what the head of Ukraine's military intelligence has been warning about on this grim one year anniversary. But there is also this sense of resilience and hope really after the show of support and solidarity from Ukrainians on the part of the international community, over the course of the last, year and again specifically this week, with a visit of Joe Biden.In fact, the last couple of hours, what we've seen here just outside St. Sophia's Church is an extraordinary show of force on the part of the Ukrainian president. President Zelenskyy speaking to soldiers and families of 400 soldiers about the extent to which weapons over the next few months is up to them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  It is you who we decide whether we are all going through this. Whether Ukraine is going to exist, every day, every hour is as you Ukrainian soldiers which will decide it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And whilst we don't have the specific figures on the losses on either side, recently, Mark Milley put them at about 100,000 soldiers on the Russian side, 100,000 soldiers on the Ukrainian side, and there are of course the some 40,000 civilians who have died as well. The cost to them, no one has been spared in this country by this last year of war, and I think that is at the heart of summer commemorations were going to see this afternoon -- Christine.",

This is an important relationship for Russia right now, as a question for many diplomats, particularly in the West, those who support Ukraine, is China going to use this unlimited agreement with Russia that it signed just before the war, if you're going to use this unlimited agreement to put his fingers on the balance here in this war, and tipped him in the favor of Russia?This was a question that innocence was asked of Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general at the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. They were at the ceremony of the independence day of Estonia today, but talking -- both of them talking about the war in Ukraine, this is very much part of the remembrance of year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. And they were asked about China's 12-point plan, and they said, to be clear, it is not an independent actor in, this and it is clearly taken a position and support of Russia. There's a real concern that China may be -- there isn't the evidence to support it yet, but there's a concern China may be considering sending weapons to Russia which would be significant. It could significantly tip the effects on the battlefield. We know Russia is running out of some of its military hardware, even had to buy drones from Iran. I think the bigger broader message, and what we've heard today, from President Zelenskyy, from the Russian deputy chairman of the national security council, Dmitry Medvedev, who used to be prime minister, used to be president, is a real hawk in Russia, saying Russia will have a victory, President Zelenskyy saying Ukraine is going to have victory. I think when we step back and look at this one year position of where we're at today, it is very clear that it is everything to fight for the battlefield. There's every intent to fight for it on the battlefield. There's no indication, either side is really going to peace, because neither side views the other as meeting the terms and conditions for peace. The West has said very clearly, that Russia can't have peace, and there can be peace if Russia withdraws from Ukraine. That is not happening. So really, this year is going to be about Ukraine getting the united and sped up support of his allies, the United States, and heavy sophisticated weapon equipment, and that should enable it. Ukraine hopes to take territory, take its own territory back, and break the -- that would be their road and path. President Zelenskyy's road and path to peace. I think we should be clear at this along anniversary, we are looking at another year or many months during the summer into fall of war. That is where we are at.",
