I would note that just this month, in the month of May, we have seen 17 rounds of attacks in Kyiv. Now, these attacks are designed primarily to go after civilians. We have seen the Russians attack civilian infrastructure throughout the winter. We've seen them go over residential buildings, schools, and hospitals. And so, this is a tactic that the Russians are increasingly relying on, they have not halted, or stopped their attacks on civilians. And this is our focus, we want Putin, the guy who started this war 15 months ago, to end it. He could end it today if he so desired.

They now have Patriots, as you well know, in addition to other air defense systems. We continue to have the UDCG, the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, or sometimes referred to as the Ramstein Group, meet on a monthly basis so that we can sit down and assess the requirements that the Ukrainians have. I have no doubt my mind that air defense will continue to be at the top of the Ukrainian's list of needed capabilities. And I am confident that the NATO allies here and the other countries that are providing security assistance will continue to seek ways to address those requirements so that the Ukrainians can be successful in defending themselves against these attacks on civilians.",

We have ways in which we can monitor the equipment that goes into a country. We are focused on accountability measures, so that we can track how the equipment is being used and to ensure that it doesn't get into the wrong hands. This is something that the administration has focused on from day one, not just in recent weeks or months.

We're very enthusiastic about the fact that two European allies have come forward to lead such an effort, and we salute those countries that are interested in starting up the training immediately. Just last week, Secretary Austin convened the UDCG where they were able to focus on the F-16 training, and this will be a medium-term commitment. Right now, we are focused on the training. We'll have to shift to a situation where we'll have to determine which countries are able and willing to actually provide the aircraft. But that is not something that will happen in the short-term, this is something that a collection of Transatlantic partners, including the U.S. and our European allies, are looking at over the medium-term. But I don't anticipate that changing. I've seen no evidence that countries are second guessing the decision on the training of the F-16 pilots, and we do hope and expect that to get underway in the not-so-distant future.",

We know that democracy only exist as a construct, and we have to fight to keep it. The challenge is, we can become so jaded about its existence or its inability to be perfect that we forget that we have to protect it. And for me, the conversation that we have to have right now is, how do we grow the next generation of defenders of democracy? How do we arm them, not only to defend it here in the United States, but how do we have a broader conversation about the international status of democracy? As you know, we have seen a decline in democratic states worldwide. I was recently privileged to observe the elections in Nigeria. There were deep issues there but there was also such a deep passion to hold on to democracy, which is fairly new.

I did stand for office twice, and it's important, I think, to try to secure the jobs that have the greatest impact. But not getting the job does not exempt you from doing the work. And the work of protecting democracy, the work of expanding democracy belongs to all of us. As a young student at Spelman College years ago, I signed up people to vote. Now, I'm trying to protect that very right. And for me, these are of a piece. I can be a candidate for office, but I am always a citizen of not only the United States, but a citizen of a global democracy that requires protection. And when I think about the young people I'm going to get to work with, my job is to show them that, yes you may lose something, you may not get the thing you seek, but that does not exempt you from doing the work that needs to be done. And even more, it creates opportunities that you didn't see. When I didn't win the 2018, I did not imagine the full consequences, but I knew I had the responsibility to keep acting, to keep pushing.
