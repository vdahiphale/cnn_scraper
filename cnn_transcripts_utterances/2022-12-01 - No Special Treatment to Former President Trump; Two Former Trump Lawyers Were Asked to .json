A federal judge is ordering the former Trump White House attorneys Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin to now testify in the DOJ's criminal investigation of the then president's effort to overturn the 2020 election. Plus, the Georgia Senate runoff is only now five days away and a sign of just how crucial this race really is.

And what we know is that abortion was a motivating factor in the midterm elections. It's one of the reasons why Democrats were so successful. Yes, those pocketbook issues, inflation, the economy, number one for voters on both sides of the aisle. But abortion was way up there and a lot of voters said it mattered when it came to which candidates they supported in the general election.

Remember different awards ceremonies, people starting to question, do we really need things like this? This is a time when diplomacy is being questioned and sometimes its effectiveness. Liam, what do you make of the need to still have things like this. DONOVAN:  I think it's an important signal that we're back, you know, we're back in business. I think it's a sign of normalcy. Normal things like bilateral diplomacy on our soil, with key allies. Allies that might have been antagonized by the previous presidency, allies who had bumpy early stages of the Biden presidency.

He wasn't even talking about the actual photo and what he thought about Jerry Jones. What he was talking about was, where's the media coverage? Where, where is the firestorm?

I would probably say LeBron James is probably the athlete that it's -- that was, has been asked more questions about non-basketball related things more so than any other professional athlete. And so, to say, you know, what do you care? He was expecting the question, and it's a shame that the media coverage for Jerry Jones in that photo wasn't the same, and it wasn't as aggressive as for Kyrie Irving. Kyrie Irving is still going through backlash. They suspended him, he lost money, all of these things, and all he did was tweet something. And I get it. Was it right or wrong?

Well, it seemed like the top of, you know, the food chain in the NFL is pretty segregated. So, if we really were to get in into the issue, we can -- we can talk about that and, and then that'll fall on Jerry Jones' show. OK.
