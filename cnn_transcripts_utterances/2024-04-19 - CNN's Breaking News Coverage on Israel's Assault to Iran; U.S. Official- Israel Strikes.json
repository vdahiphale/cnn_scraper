      "sentences": "Well, John, we've certainly been hearing certain talk from the Iranian side. I mean, just a few hours ago on CNN, the Iranian foreign minister saying that if there is an Israeli response, if they do target assets in Iran, then there would be a response and it would be immediate and at a maximum level saying it would also be decisive.And this is really the message that we have been hearing over recent days. We heard it from President Raisi as well, saying that if there was an attack on Iranian assets, then it would be a more severe reaction than what we saw last Saturday, that unprecedented attack from Iran with over 300 drones and missiles launched at Israeli territory. So if you take it at face value, I mean, we certainly have heard Tehran say there will be a significant response. But what we're also seeing from state media, from semi-official state media in Iran is that they're almost downplaying what has happened. They are saying there has been no ground explosion. They're saying that the nuclear facilities are completely secure, that there is no impact on the ground. So potentially laying the groundwork for this to be something acceptable for Tehran. So that's really the question. When you ask what's coming next from Tehran, we have to try and figure out what Tehran is able to live with. Now, they say that what they did, that unprecedented attack last weekend, Saturday into Sunday morning, that was in response to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Damascus. And they said fairly quickly afterwards, in fact, as the attack was still ongoing, the matter is concluded. They wanted to respond, and as far as they were concerned, and that was it. Now, of course, that wasn't the case for Israel. They didn't feel that they could leave that unprecedented attack unanswered. So the question now is whether or not Iran will feel that this was a low-level enough attack or strike from Israel that they are able to not necessarily ignore it, but not feel the need to retaliate. Of course, it is still early days. We don't know exactly what was hit, if anything was hit, what the target was. And potentially we will hear more about that in the hours ahead. John? Paula, stay with us. Let's go to Nic Robertson in Jerusalem for a moment. Nic, is there any word from the Israelis on precisely what they hit? What do we know about the attack and the fact that it was limited? And what are they saying about any possible Iranian response?",

      "sentences": "There's pressure being put on Israel. We know that when President Biden called up Prime Minister Netanyahu just over two and a half weeks ago when seven members of the World Central Kitchen were killed in a number of Israeli drone strikes inside of Gaza as they were trying to deliver food, that pressure actually had a result. The Israelis started putting more aid into Gaza. They opened a crossing into northern Gaza. Now, there's a long way to go on that. But it shows that U.S. pressure pays off to a degree.And I think that pressure, it seems, as we understand, is exerted by the White House on Prime Minister Netanyahu not to escalate. Quite clearly, President Biden publicly saying that he was not, the United States was not going to take part in offensive action against Iran. There's some context to put here. Israel misjudged Iran's response to the strike on the consulate in Damascus. They didn't think that they were crossing a red line. Iran thought they did cross a red line. And I asked a former, very senior intelligence official here why he thought that Iran had decided to respond. And his assessment, this was backed up by conversations I'd had with his former senior official earlier this year, was that Iran previously had been afraid of a U.S. and Israeli response on Iranian territory if they struck directly inside of Israel. Now, the perception seems to be from Iran that they see a weakness, a pressure and a gap between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu and the internal political pressures on Prime Minister Netanyahu because of the way that he's fighting the fight in Gaza at the moment, because so many Palestinians are being killed. And the sense is that Iran felt that it could exploit this weakness of the prime minister. So the question was always going to be, could the prime minister actually judge and gauge Iran's new red lines correctly? Maybe today we're looking at a picture where he has. But the dynamic in the region and the read of the red lines for both sides has changed, has changed because Prime Minister Netanyahu is perceived as being weaker. Absolutely, he needs U.S. support, as we saw at the weekend, to defend the country against Iran's strikes.",

And now they are saying that they have been able to intercept some flying objects on the sky.But what is important for Iran is to maintain that deterrence, you know, equation, because Iran, in terms of the scale of its retaliatory operation against Israel, used hundreds of missiles and drones. And this is somehow incomparable to what even if there was a limited action today with the Friday morning's incident. So this doesn't seem to be changing that balance. And this is quite important for Iran. But this somehow is interpreted in Tehran as Israel trying to save face, but not to engage in a significant direct conflict with Iran.",

Some thought that if Iran didn't respond sooner or later, maybe in future there could be a war. But they could see this somehow stopping that process. That's why they somehow supported that response. And also that's the matter of the national pride. And whether they are reformists or conservatives, critical of support of the government, because that's the issue of the security.

You're watching CNN's breaking news coverage on the very latest here on Israel's counter strike on Iran.Flights have resumed in Iran after being suspended in the wake of explosions being reported in the Isfahan region. A U.S. official has confirmed Israel launched attack hours ago, but Israel's military still not commenting. An Iranian news agency says the explosions happened near an army base where fighter jets are stationed. But the report says the target could also have been a nearby military radar. Iranian media report nuclear facilities in the region are secure. The U.S. official says those facilities were not a target. Reports of explosions in Iran sent oil prices surging nearly 4 percent, with U.S. oil prices climbing above $85 a barrel. Prices then recovered slightly. Right now, Brent crude, the world benchmark, is at $88.58. That's up by just over 1.5 percent, while WTI crude is at $83.53, up by 1.75 percent. There we go. Meantime, the news drove U.S. stock futures lower, with the Dow futures sinking 480 points. There we are. Currently, it's at down just by .5 percent. Nasdaq futures down by almost one percent. And if we look at the S&amp;P 500 futures, down by just over half of one percent. Live now at Istanbul, Turkey, CNN's Scott McLean standing by for regional reaction there.

Obviously, markets don't like any kind of uncertainty, and neither do countries in this region. You have many countries struggling with their economies. You have inflation surging in places like what has been for some time.Lebanon, and Egypt, here in Turkey also struggling with it. And it's very difficult to get any kind of foreign investment to remedy that situation when the world looks at your region as this tender box of volatility. And that is why we have been seeing messages over the last almost three weeks now calling on the Israelis and the Iranians to turn down the temperature and take a breath here before deciding on your next move, because none of this is in any of the interests of any of the countries in this region. You have many dividing lines in the Middle East, of course, but most of the countries here seem to be pretty united on the fact that they don't want to see any kind of escalation or any kind of regional war getting out of hand, because since the war began in Gaza on October the 7th, you have already seen an inflamed situation in Iraq and Syria, this proxy war between the Iranians and the Israelis playing out largely there. You've seen U.S. strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. You've seen attacks on the shipping in the Red Sea. You've been seeing a back and forth between Hezbollah and the Israelis across the Israeli-Lebanon border. The list goes on. And so no one wants to see this get even worse than it already is. And so you've seen this flurry of diplomatic activity over the past few weeks. First, it was urging the Iranians not to strike back against the Israelis. Then it was urging the Israelis and the West not to strike back against the Iranians. And at the moment, though, John, you can sort of hear a pin drop in the Middle East, because it seems like no one is eager to comment on this until we have all the facts and we know precisely what happened. Obviously, the two players here that we're waiting to hear from most directly are the Israelis and the Iranians, hoping that perhaps there's not going to be a further escalation, because obviously the Iranians had warned very clearly in the time leading up to this that if the Israelis were to do nothing, that this was all over. But if the Israelis were to strike Iranian territory, that the response would be even bigger. And so many people are holding their breath, hoping that that is not the case.",

But there are so many other items on the agenda that they've got to get through these next and last three hours, which includes the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which includes sanctions targeted sanctions on Iran, and obviously back to Ukraine. You know, we had a big focus yesterday on Ukraine with Antony Blinken meeting with Ukrainian foreign minister who was a special guest there. So they're really, really have a lot to discuss. All of this, of course, leading the way to the larger G7 meeting, which will be held in the southern region of Puglia with President Biden and the other leaders of the G7 nations in mid-June. And, you know, the scenario could change a lot before then -- John.",

They don't all agree on the language.And that yesterday was the topic of conversation was the language around these sanctions, what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, if its just going to be to sanction, those who make the drones, for example. That's something that had been discussed. Today, though, that's probably not going to be the topic of conversation, the high -- the top of the agenda. It's really hard to see exactly what they are -- what their priorities are going to be until they come out now that meeting in about two, three, 2-1/2, three hours time, John.",
