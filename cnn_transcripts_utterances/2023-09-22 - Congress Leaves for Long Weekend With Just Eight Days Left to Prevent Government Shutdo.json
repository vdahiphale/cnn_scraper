But it is up to one man, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to decide to put that on the floor.And if yesterday was any indication of where he's at, he feels like he has to assuage his right flank right now at every turn. I mean, he didn't even walk Zelenskyy into the meeting in the House of Representatives. That was done by Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, and just to contrast that with the pictures of Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell walking, flanking Zelenskyy as they went into the Senate chamber for their meeting with members of Congress. So, it just gives you a sense that this is up to Kevin McCarthy, and he is not there yet. I pushed him repeatedly yesterday on if he would commit to putting this money on the floor. He said they got to get their fiscal House in order first, and that there are other priorities to focus on right now. He would not make that commitment because he knows it could mean the end of his speakership if he took that step. Phil?",

They're fighting for their wages, specifically residuals when it comes to streaming. And they're very focused on artificial intelligence as well. What they're saying is that it's people, the writers, that need to write these scripts and not the machines. And so what WGA is saying is that they're going to come together. They're asking as many members as possible to go out to the picket lines today. And they're encouraged but they're also a bit skeptical. They're waiting to see exactly what happens.

We even got a statement from General Motors who said that they believe, no matter what they put on the table, that the union was going to strike anyways. So, not looking good. But at 10:00 A.M., we will hear from UAW President Shawn Fain, who will announce possible targeted strikes at other plants around the country, could be one automaker, could be multiple automakers. Right now, there are less than 13,000 members on strike. But Shawn Fain has an arsenal of 145,000 members that he could send out at any time. And we know that there's a ripple effect from this, right? When you send out striking workers, the big three have announced that they've had to lay off other workers because those jobs no longer become part of the supply chain. So, General Motors idling 2,000 workers, Ford, 600 workers, and Stellantis, 68 people laid off immediately with 300 more to come. So, as these targeted strikes increase, you're going to see these ripple effects of layoffs continue to happen. These numbers will grow if there's more targeted strikes.",
