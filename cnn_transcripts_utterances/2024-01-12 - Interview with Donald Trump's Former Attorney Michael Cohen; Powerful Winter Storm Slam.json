It was snowing very heavily earlier, about an inch an hour in the Chicagoland area. It's lightning up now, but this does not mean it's over. This weather advisory goes until tomorrow afternoon, John. And the problem here is that this is turning into rain and it is going to get Arcticly cold over the next few days as this cold air seeps down from Canada into the Great Lakes region. Let me show you a normally highly visible skyline in Chicago, blanketed with a thick layer of fog as this warm air mixes with the precipitation in Chicago. The other factor here, John, why it is snowy but it is not horribly cold, is we have a plow run right by us. See how wet this is, John? It's so wet here because it has been unseasonably warm in the Chicago area.We have not seen a high of below freezing since November 28th. That means the ground is warm, the lake is warm, and that's really lessening the snow impact here in Chicago. Suburbs are a very different story. As you go west on 88, the roads are atrocious, and they're expecting up to a foot or more of snow in the western and southwestern suburbs around Chicago. We're thinking about four to eight inches total through Saturday. Next week will be absolutely horrible, John, because our weather team is saying that with the wind chill in the Chicagoland area, it could get to 30 below, that is dangerously cold temperatures, John.",

BURT JONES, (R) GEORGIA:  They had shot their spouse and that they had somebody else tied up. MARSH (voice-over):  And Georgia Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones, both police say targets of a dangerous trend on the rise called swatting. It's a hoax where the caller makes a panicked false report to 9-1-1 about a violent crime in progress at their target's home, triggering a large police response with armed officers.

Many of them viewed by Trump supporters as political opponents. This Sunday, D.C. police responded to a 9-1-1 call for a shooting at the home of the federal judge in Donald Trump's election interference case. The police report says, once units arrived, they realized the judge was not injured and there was no one in her home. Last month, Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel overseeing two federal cases against Donald Trump, was swatted, a law enforcement source tells CNN. So, was Maine secretary of state after she ruled Trump ineligible to appear on the state's ballot.

The strikes in response to the recent surge of attacks by the Iran-backed militants on commercial ships in the crucial Red Sea. President Biden said he would not hesitate to take further measures.Joining us now from the White House, retired Rear Admiral and National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. Thank you so much for talking to us at a time when there is just a lot of tension that is rising in the region. The strikes do come in the heels of Secretary of State Blinken's trip to the region, one of many that he has made over the past several months. He was, of course, trying to cool tensions. Iran condemning the strikes. But this is such a volatile environment. Is the Biden administration prepared for potential retaliation? And what would that look like?",

The Houthis have a choice to make here today after these strikes last night, and that choice ought to be to stop these attacks. All the targets that we chose were targets that were meant to go after their exact capabilities to guide, to launch, and to store those kinds of missiles and drones. And again, they have a choice to make. We don't want to see an escalation. We don't want to see a broader conflict. In fact, everything President Biden has done since the beginning of this last couple of months, since the beginning of the attacks on October 7th, has been designed to try to take the tensions down and to prevent any other actor from escalating or widening or deepening this conflict.",

It is the Houthis who have escalated over the course of attacks, almost 30 attacks since November. It is the Houthis that have decided that they were going to step up the intensity and the volume of those attacks. As recently as just Tuesday, a massive attack against U.S. vessels, commercial vessels and naval and naval warships in the Red Sea.
