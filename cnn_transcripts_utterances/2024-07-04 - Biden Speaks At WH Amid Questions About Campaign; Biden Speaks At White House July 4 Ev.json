They didn't really notice. They were told to go inside because there was some lightning. But that's not really a hardship here, because what that means is you have to walk into one of the many awesome bars and hockey talks that line broadway here and hear other live music in there. But now everyone's back out. The rain has stopped. This thing is delayed like a couple minutes. That's all.We're going to see the fireworks soon, and when you talk about fireworks, they brag here about their 8-inch shells that shoot 800 feet up into the air and explode with a diameter of 800 feet, which is pretty good. But here's the real kicker. There are eight pyrotechnicians that sit in a steel bunker for the duration of the show to run the whole thing. Those guys are pressing all the buttons, Boris and Dana, to make sure that all the things go boom exactly when they're supposed to. And, again, the people here could not be more excited to see it get back and get started. We're going to see the musicians on the stage here in just a minute, guys.",
