      "sentences": "Well, hello and welcome to what is the second hour of \"Connect the World\" with me, Becky Anderson, live fromAbu Dhabi. This hour, a new proposal for a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners is being presented to Hamas. Now, this is a melding of different proposals from Hamas itself, from Israel, Qatar and Egypt. The United States also weighing in. Now, multiple officials are voicing optimism that if this succeeds, the plan would be compelling, strong and filled with hope. And frankly, Gaza and the wider region are in desperate need of some hope right now, especially as we wait to see how the Biden administration will respond to the widening of this conflict after a deadly strike on a US military base in Jordan carried out by Iran-backed militia based in Iraq. Fears of a widening war coming against the backdrop of the daily horror of war inside Gaza, especially for women and kids. Now children like this little girl, six-year-old Hind (ph), was trapped inside her family's vehicle for over 18 hours after it was fired upon by Israeli forces. She was in the car with six of her family members, all of whom were killed in that attack. The Palestine Red Crescent has dispatched a team to rescue her, but contact with them has been lost. Well, in Gaza City, Palestinian state news reporting at least 25 civilians killed in an Israeli strike on Monday and several others injured when a family home was hit by shelling. CNN cannot confirm reports coming out of Gaza but the IDF has confirmed it is once again operating in the northern part of the enclave. The Israeli military says it's fighting pockets of what it calls resistance three weeks after declaring Hamas command structures there dismantled. As you can see, parts of the north are already flattened by earlier battles. On the diplomatic front, as we've noted, Hamas saying it is, and I quote them, here studying this new international proposal for a truce with Israel. But it is warning any deal must include the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. For the latest on all of this, Alex Marquardt joins me from Washington, Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. Alex, let's start with you. Let's talk about what we understand to be the parameters of this deal, and this is really important. What does it include? And ultimately, what's the nth degree at this point?",

We also know that Hamas has been indignant about the fact that they are looking for a permanent ceasefire at the end of any proposal. So, what do we understand to be Israel's position on all of this?

And those comments by the Israeli defense minister have also been echoed by theIsraeli prime minister himself, who has made clear that he is not backing off his objective of trying to destroy Hamas, to dismantle this militant group inside of Gaza, and to ensure that it is no longer in power in Gaza the day after this war ends. And so, that is why, even as Israeli officials say that they've seen this summit in Paris as constructive, that significant progress is clearly being made, they're also cautioning that there are still significant gaps that remain between these two sides. And that is the main thrust of those gaps is this notion of whether or not this next truce between Israel and Hamas is going to be a truce over a period of weeks, over a period of months, or whether it is going to actually lead to an end to the war altogether. That is the position that Hamas is taking. Even as they are saying that they are studying this latest framework agreed to by Israel, the United States, Egypt and Qatar. They are also cautioning that they are viewing it and reviewing it in the context of whether or not it is going to ultimately see Israeli troops leave the Gaza Strip and ending the war effectively. So a lot of optimism, but a lot of caution as well that certainly seems to be warranted.",

The US has about halfa dozen hostages who are still believed to be held in Gaza. US, of course, wants to see those citizens out. But at the same time, what we hear from US officials is that they really see an agreement as the key to unlocking not just a longer pause in the fighting, a longer truce, but also a pause that would allow humanitarian aid to get in. Of course, that's been very difficult for the past few months. That will allow Palestinian civilians to go home or what remains of their homes. And then, Becky, during that pause in the fighting, that's when some of the tougher discussions would take place in terms of Palestinian governance. What would the revitalized Palestinian authority that the US wants to see, what would that look like, would it be a technocratic government, that's something that has been discussed. What role, if any, would Hamas have in that government. So the sense that I'm getting is that essentially the US wants to get to that pause in the fighting, get to see the hostages released as many as possible, and then go on to tackle some of the more difficult discussions while the fighting has stopped. But, Becky, what you're not hearing from the US is we want a ceasefire. The US is being very careful not to say that there needs to be an end to the war. What they're saying is there needs to be a pause in the fighting to allow for everything that I've just mentioned, the hostage releases and aid to get in. But they're not certainly being as firm as other countries about the need for an immediate ceasefire that would lead to an end to this war, because the US continues to support Israel's position that they need to get rid of Hamas in Gaza, Becky.",

They went to the third floor. And there, they brought out their weapons. And according to what we're seeing on the CCTV footage, they went to the room where Mohammed Jalamneh, and two others were. This was very early in the morning. It appears they were in bed at the time. We have seen pictures of the bed in which one of them was killed, and there's blood on the pillow. So it appears that they were shot point blank by this Israeli hit squad. Now, one of the people who was killed, Basil Al-Ghazzawi, was somebody who was in the hospital because he was wounded in an Israeli airstrike on the Jenin refugee camp back in October that killed four people, among them a 15-year-old boy. Now, according to the doctors at the hospital, he was partially paralyzed in his lower body, so he was bedridden. Nonetheless, the Israelis are saying that these three were planning an imminent attack on Israeli targets. That they were ticking time bomb, and perhaps that's their justification for this rather unorthodox operation. Now, we did hear from Hamas that all three were members of the so called Jenin Brigades. These are fighters from the Jenin Refugee Camp, who by and large, have spent the last few years really just fighting Israeli troops, as the Israeli troops, as I said, have repeatedly raided that refugee camp. I was there in November at that hospital, and also at the refugee camp, and I see the level of destruction the Israelis wreak on the camp every time they go in. Now, the modus operandi of this operation, this raid, was not unique. We know that the Israelis in other instances have gone undercover. For instance, a few years ago at Birzeit University outside of Ramallah, an Israeli squad went in disguised as a Palestinian television crew and nabbed a student leader there. Becky.",

But all of the potential options they have are pretty bad when you play them out and how they may affect the situation. In this case, in the Middle East. The President has to either try to reestablish some kind of deterrence to stop these attacks from pro-Iranian militia against US facilities in the Middle East, stretched all throughout the region, or he has to try and degrade the capacity to do so. At the same time, he's trying to stop this war as he's been all along, erupting into a much broader, more dangerous regional conflict. That's why perhaps the option of actually attacking Iran directly to send that kind of message, as many Republicans are calling for, is a very difficult one. And he has this political tightrope as well at home, which is especially acute because of the 2024 election looming. He has to look strong. American troops have died. Americans are looking for someone that is in control of the situation. The problem is that the Middle East is a very uncontrollable region, as you know, and there are all sorts of pitfalls. And he really, for political reasons, as well as strategic ones, really wants to prevent this spiraling into this much bigger conflagration. Because politically, the idea of the US avoiding Middle East entanglements, especially, has been very important in presidential elections dating back to 2008, in President Barack Obama's election.

He gets accused of abetting genocide by pro-Palestinian protesters. This is a very, very dicey political situation as well. If you could look back into last year and if you could say, if there's one thing that Biden did not want to have as he's running for re election, it's the specter of another war abroad, especially in the Middle East, one that splits his coalition, his democratic coalition that he's relying on to beat Trump, and it's all come to pass.

All the new Vatican guidelines have received strong support from bishops across Europe, including catholic clergies in France, in Austria, and in Germany. Well, in Nigeria, the LGBTQ+ community is being targeted through online dating apps. They are lured into relationships and then ambushed with physical or verbal assaults, and often extorted. This is a practice called Kito. CNN's Stephanie Busari brings us an investigation as part of our as equals ongoing series on gender inequality. And a warning, parts of her report may be difficult to hear. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Musk did say that the operation took place on Sunday and that this patient is recovering well. But, of course, getting through this implantation surgery is really just the first step in this larger effort that Neuralink is undertaking right now to test the safety and efficacy of these brain implant chips. Ultimately, what the company wants to do is to use these chips to connect human brains to computers to, as you said, help with things like allowing people who have been paralyzed to regain access to their limbs. Over the past couple of years, Neuralink has been facing regulatory scrutiny and concerns over the safety of its procedures for animal test subjects. But the company did receive this approval to start human clinical trials late last year. I will say too, Neuralink is not the only company working in this space, which experts say does hold promise for people who are facing neurological issues. But the proof will really be in how this first human trial subject fares over the coming weeks and months. And certainly, we'll be watching with interest to see if Elon Musk has anything more to say about how this person is doing.",
