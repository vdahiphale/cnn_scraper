Wade.\" He's proven there's a fine line between catching the car and being run over by it. So they may be 500-some miles apart, but it appears that Texas' controversial immigration law has spread to Iowa. Governor Kim Reynolds has just signed off on a bill that's similar to Texas. It gives state law enforcement this power to remove some undocumented immigrants.",

But the law also sometimes allows Americans' communications to be collected. And critics from both parties want more done to protect civil liberties. Yesterday, after former President Trump called on the GOP to kill FISA, 19 House Republicans blocked a key vote on it, revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson. Joining us now to discuss is Republican Congressman Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin. Sir, thanks for being with us. You'd posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the federal government should not be spying on U.S. citizens without a warrant, get a warrant. Obviously, you have concerns here. You seem to be against Section 702 as it stands. You did not, though, join your colleagues in tanking what was a rule vote, a procedural vote yesterday? Can you tell us why? REP. TOM TIFFANY (R-WI): Yes, that's correct. I just wanted to get to a vote. That's why I voted yes on that procedural rule vote. Because I want to be able to hold on the amendment that stops these warrantless searches. And I believe we have the votes in the House to be able to pass this. I mean, look at the Judiciary Committee, which I sit on. We passed that, our version of the bill, out of Judiciary, 35 to 2. I think there's broad bipartisan support for these reforms to 702.",

I was disappointed that that's not the base feel that we got. But anyhow, that was the negotiations that went on through the House.We have the amendment before us. I do think we have the votes. And that's why I voted yes on this. Hopefully, leadership and the recalcitrant 19, at this point, that voted no, hopefully, they're working out their differences and we can get this to the floor and be able to vote on it.

We have not been told that, in fact, it is over $16 million that was stolen between 2021 and just recently. The money allegedly stolen in order to finance the interpreter's gambling habit and, apparently, I've been told by people connected to the case, he was not a very good gambler. So to finance his habit and to finance the losses that he made. One interesting little nugget that we were given is that the money used to place the bets and pay off the debts, that came from Shohei Ohtani's account. But when there were any winnings, those went into the interpreter's account. Now, one of the questions that's really been unanswered is, how on earth could this interpreter actually access this money from Shohei Ohtani's account without being noticed? Well, we have just been given an insight into how that happened. Apparently, the interpreter set up the bank account for Shohei Ohtani, denied access to that account to any of Ohtani's other advisors, claiming that Ohtani wanted that account to be kept private. And we were just told in this press conference that the interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, would also impersonate Shohei Ohtani in dealings with bank officials in order to get these massive transfers of money approved. So he is being charged with bank fraud. We are told that that carries a sentence -- maximum sentence of 30 years. Now, \"The New York Times\" has been reporting that Ippei Mizuhara is already in negotiations for some kind of plea deal here. We have not confirmed that as yet -- guys?",
