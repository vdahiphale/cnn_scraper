And I remember going to a restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And I had a American Express credit card and maybe a visa or whatever. And I had a lot of what they call traveler's checks. I don't even know if they still have traveler's checks, but traveler's checks. And there was a sign that said, you know -- with a credit card, for whatever reasons, the man would not take my American Express credit card. So, I pulled up my Visa card, and he wouldn't take my Visa card. So, then I pulled out my traveler's checks. He said we don't take checks. Now, this was -- (INAUDIBLE) traveler's checks. This was money. I had a $10 bill. I'll never forget this as long as I live. And he said, the bill for my wife at the time, Fani's mother, Fani, and myself was like $9.95, and I had a $10 bill. It was all that -- I always remember that. But even before that, I've always kept cash, you know. And I've told my daughter, you keep six months' worth of cash always. For example, I had three safes in my house. I put some of my clients' stuff there too, things I didn't want other lawyers to be. I mean -- because you're always in a firm, and I knew that there were special conditions. So, some of my clients' things I would bring home, put them in the safe. But I've always kept saves.
