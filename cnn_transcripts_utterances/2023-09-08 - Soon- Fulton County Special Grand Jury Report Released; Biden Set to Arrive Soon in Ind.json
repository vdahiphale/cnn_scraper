      "sentences": "To those of you joining us here in the United States and around the world, welcome to EARLY START. I'm David Culver.In just a few hours from now, we expect the release of the full report from the Fulton County grand jury that investigated the election subversion with the 2020 presidential election. Ultimately, it led to the indictment of former President Trump and 18 co-defendants. It is important to note that this is different than the grand jury that actually returned the indictment last month. And this comes as Trump tells a judge that he might try and move his case from state to federal court. So, there is a lot of moving parts with this as this is obviously one of several cases the former president is facing. But here to help us break it all down and make sense of it is Katie Cherkasky. She's a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Katie, thank you for being here nice and early. And there are so many elements to this and I know if we looked specifically at what was redacted earlier this year, perhaps some of that will come to clarity with what is coming out today, is that right? What kind of information do you think we can get here?",

      "sentences": "Well, the special grand jury report was essentially the first look of the January 6 case in Fulton County. That report and that special grand jury did not have the authority to issue an indictment, so it will be interesting to see what types of recommendations, what types of defendants are listed in that report. As of right now we haven't been able to see that.So it's not that it has any practical impact on the case, but it is more so an interesting aspect of what types of charges were recommended by that grand jury versus what was actually indicted in Georgia.",

And so, that is why the judge had not allowed that report to become public. At this point, everybody has been indicted that's going to be in that case. There's no reason to further keep the report redacted.",

      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "sentences": "I think with the Meadows removal, it will be a good indicate of how amenable the federal courts are to taking these January 6 cases. It is interesting though with Donald Trump because the question for the federal judge in removing the case is whether the official was acting under the color of their authority.And that is really what the ultimate question is in the January 6 prosecution in Georgia in general. Was president Trump acting under his official capacity or was he outside the outer perimeter as they say of his presidential duties. So I think that is the big question, but for removal purposes, I think he has a strong argument that that is at least at play. So I would anticipate that he would make that request and I think he has a strong chance of getting it, but ultimately the judge will make that call. CULVER:  Can I get you on former Trump adviser Peter Navarro has been convicted of contempt of Congress charges for not complying with the January 6 subpoena.

All we know is that the second in command from China, the Chinese premier will be attending the G-20 meeting instead of the Chinese president. Now, it's very important to note here that the Chinese president has never missed a G-20 summit ever since he came to power back in 2012. This would be his first.Now, why is this? There is a wide area of speculation after Beijing's reticence really over why Xi Jinping will not be in New Delhi for the G-20 Summit. Could it be because of the border tensions that have escalated over the years with India? Could it be because Biden is going to be there? Or is it because there is a disillusionment in terms of Beijing here with the current global governance system in the global order? Here is what a foreign affairs expert Michael Kugelman had to say about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL KUGELMAN, DIRECTOR, THE WILSON CENTER'S SOUTH ASIA INSTITUTE: I also would argue that perhaps President Xi is trying to send a message to the U.S. and other Western members of the G-20 that Beijing is simply not inclined to participate with the Western powers and Western players at this moment and he would prefer to spend his time focused on global forums that are meant to provide -- or serve as alternatives to the West such as the BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

But like I said at the top, there is no inherent explanation that Beijing has offered. In terms of India and their reaction to the absence of both Putin and Xi Jinping from the G- 20 summit, which we are hosting this year, they say this is not the first time that prime ministers and presidents have skipped the summit.So whatever they need to say, whatever the position is, it will be relayed through their representatives. But I doubt if any big ticket measures can really be announced by their deputies that the point. Back to you.",

That $1 billion promise you mentioned from the United States. And also, quite a lot of successful diplomacy from other countries as well. Just yesterday, he also had phone calls with the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also talking about security, British again promising more security and more cooperation with Ukraine going forward. All of this shows the gathering of allies, the Western support around Ukraine in this war.

And fast forward to this latest finding, it seems that technology and A.I. content has improved to the point that it is very difficult for average users to tell the difference between what is real and what is fake, hence all the engagements from real users. That of course something long warned by U.S. officials and experts especially in this current polarized U.S. political environment. So Americans are easy prey. But the Chinese have pushed back on this latest allegation where the spokesman at their embassy in D.C. calling this report full of prejudice and another example of malicious speculation against China. But the fact is, just last month, parent's parent company Meta actually took down thousands of China based social accounts that were connected to Chinese law enforcement, targeting not just Americans but also people in Taiwan and elsewhere as part of a cross platform covert influence operation. So this is definitely not the last time that we'll be talking about cases like this and the concern, the of course, of course is that A.I. is deepening the threat posed by cyber attacks and misinformation campaign, increasingly launched by America's adversaries -- David.",
