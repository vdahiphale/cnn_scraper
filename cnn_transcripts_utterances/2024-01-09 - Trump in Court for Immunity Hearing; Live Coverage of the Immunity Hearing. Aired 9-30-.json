We saw the former president's motorcade arriving at the courthouse just a few moments ago. I should note, there are no cameras allowed in court today.  You won't hear Trump himself answering any questions. He's actually not required to be there. He is choosing to attend today's hearing.CNN's Kristen Holmes is joining us from Washington this morning. Kristen, it is -- obviously, you know, an incredible time for him when it comes to what this could mean for him legally. It is incredibly significant. But also we're less than a week now away from the Iowa caucuses. And the former president is making this choice to be in the court instead of on the campaign trail.

But this doesn't go to -- this goes to his narrative that all of this is election interference, that this is political prosecution. And, in fact, he sent out a text message last night, a fundraising text message, in which he said that he was burning the midnight oil but not because of the election, instead because Joe Biden was forcing him to go to court. And this is what he wrote. He wrote, \"crooked Joe is forcing me into a courtroom in our nation's capital to defend my right to presidential immunity, a right granted to every other president in history.\"Of course, as we know, no one is forcing him to be there. And, of course, this has nothing to do with President Joe Biden. But that's the narrative he continues to sell. And he's selling it not only to his base, but to Republicans broadly, trying to say that this is a two tier justice system. The other part of this is that he knows he can suck all the oxygen out of the room a week ahead of those caucuses if he is in court. And that is something they're trying to do. But, Kaitlan, as you noted, this is not the kind of circus that we see when he goes to New York. He's already gone in underneath, in a garage --",
