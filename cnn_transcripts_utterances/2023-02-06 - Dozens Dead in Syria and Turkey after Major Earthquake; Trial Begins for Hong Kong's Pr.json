They are always expecting -- this is a country that sits on multiple fault lines. This is a country that has been hit by earthquakes. You have the capabilities. You have the teams that are not only deployed usually to deal with earthquakes in this country. Turkey is one of the first countries to offer assistance and send teams to deal with earthquakes in other countries. So they are capable in -- to deal with these search-and-rescue operations. But it is a very challenging time, as well. This is -- we're in the middle of a winter storm right now in that part of the country, in Southern Turkey. They've had snow, freezing temperatures over the past few days. And if you look, as well, at the time that this earthquake hit, at about 4 a.m. in the morning. This means a lot of people were in their homes when this happened. So of course, there's going to be a lot of concern about how many people are trapped underneath the rubble. I mean, Turkey is preparing for the worst right now. They are at the point where you have this country that has dealt with so many earthquakes, they're so experienced in dealing with natural disasters, saying that it is requesting international assistance to deal with this.

So in Turkey, most of the new -- most of the newly-built buildings are like under the requirements for being -- to be able to handle earthquakes. In the neighborhood I was in, I did not -- I walked for about -- walked for about two kilometers, but I did not see any buildings that were cracked or destroyed. But I've seen some photos from the old sector of Gaziantep. That's where there -- there is the most damage. I am not hearing any -- anyone who got injured, or dead in my neighborhood. But I've heard a lot of ambulances. I've counted nine so far. And there are also a couple of -- I've seen also a couple of firefighting trucks.

We're also getting reports of people in Tel Aviv feeling the shaking, in the West Bank, in Amman. All feeling the initial shake just before 10 -- just before 4 a.m. And according to Israeli police, they received 3,496 notices of the earthquake. But so far, they say there have been no injuries and no damage. And we aren't seeing any reports of any damage either in the West Bank, as well, but just a lot of reports of people waking in the night, to what they say is their entire home shaking. I spoke to somebody. He said he was woken and said just everything around him was shaking, but thankfully, no damages, no injuries so far. Israeli authorities, and authorities elsewhere, just reminding people of what to do in an earthquake. I do have to say there has been a long-standing fear, especially here in this region, that a big earthquake is coming and going to affect, specifically, the Jerusalem area, specifically Israel and the West Bank, and the Palestinian territories. And so I think for a lot of people, seeing this earthquake not too far, only a few hundred kilometers away that they could actually feel, only further reminded them of the fact that this big earthquake that scientists have been talking about could be coming for sometime, could be coming any day and likely will be hearing from authorities here about what they will be doing, and kind of reminders of preparations for -- you know, this happened not too far away.

They were very much involved, for example, in that apartment building in Miami that collapsed some time ago, going and doing search-and- rescue there. So I will not be the least bit surprised if Israel sends out a team to the place in Turkey, to Turkey and try and help with the search-and- rescue.

The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake was centered in Turkey's Southern Gaziantep province.

These are the people that they can count. But the numbers are almost certain to rise, to give you a sense of things. The -- one of the deadliest earthquakes in Turkish history happened in 1999. And in that case there were 17,000 people were killed in the Northwestern part of the country. You had some half a million people left homeless, and that was a 7.4. This is a 7.8 that we're talking about. So you can only imagine the scale of things that is to be expected. And that is why authorities are asking desperately for international help, for rescue crews to come over, for aid, for assistance, for all of those kinds of things. It is also why local authorities are asking for people throughout Turkey to be donating blood. That's the sense of the scale of the emergency that they're going to be seeing in hospitals across the region, as well. Look, people in this part of the country, Laila, they feel earthquakes on a regular basis. Every couple of months or so, there's a small one, a tremor, things like that. And so they're not -- this is not an unknown for them. But this is on a whole new kind of a level. And so you have local authorities telling people to go outside. Remember, this happened just around 4:20 in the morning or so. And so virtually everyone would have been sleeping. They are telling people to go outside and wait there, but that's a pretty difficult ask, considering that the weather at the time is right around freezing. It's very difficult to be outside in your pajamas for long periods of time without coats, without supplies, without things like that. They are also asking people not to use their cars, because they say that there's traffic jams in some areas and, frankly, emergency services can't get into those areas, which is also a big ask, considering just how cold it is outside. So you mentioned already that this earthquake took -- after this earthquake took place, there have been several aftershocks. But these aftershocks are quite strong, as well. You know, in the sixes, on the -- in magnitude, we're talking about. And so this -- even the aftershocks are absolutely terrifying. That's why people don't necessarily want to go back inside their houses anytime soon, despite the weather, despite the conditions. Surely, if people have cars, that's what they're getting into. And also, there is this massive rescue effort. We're already starting to see plenty of videos of people being pulled out from the rubble in Syria. We're also seeing a lot of the similar things. The White Helmets there doing their work. Remember, this is a team that typically has been made famous by responding to airstrikes, responding to missile strikes in the country. Now they're putting their skills to use in an entirely different way. And those skills are going to be badly needed over the hours to come. It's obviously starting to become daylight in Turkey now, and I think very soon we're going to get a real sense of just how bad things are.",

And so oftentimes, you have Turkish first responders who are going to other countries because of their expertise in this area.

And he said, obviously, when they woke up, they went out, outside, and they've been there ever since. And you know, there's some damage to buildings in his city, but it's not, you know, on the scale, necessarily, or at least in his local area on the scale that you're seeing in other places. And so this affects a whole heck of a lot of people who are suddenly finding themselves homeless, suddenly finding themselves thinking I don't want to go back inside of that building, because I don't know how structurally secure it is. Maybe there's a bit of damage. Maybe there's some broken windows. Maybe you know, there's other signs of damage. Maybe there's doors that have been jammed. And so they don't want to necessarily go back inside. And now all of a sudden, they're finding themselves on the street. And temperatures that, as I mentioned, are right around freezing.

She spoke about the impact this disaster could have on Turkey. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ASLI AYDINTASBAS, VISITING FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION (via phone): I was also in Turkey when the last major earthquake took place, which was 1999, of the same magnitude. And that led to the death of 30,000 people. Now, this one also seems to have a similar magnitude, and unfortunately, all expectations are that this, too, will be very costly in terms of human life. We don't have a full picture yet, but it is the case that people have felt the earthquake from the Black Sea all the way to Damascus. And that tells you that a very densely-populated and (UNINTELLIGIBLE) part of the world is hit by an earthquake once again. Turkey is historically at the crossroads of various fault lines, and there has been an expectation for a big earthquake for a number of years, for at least two decades. But that was thought to be -- the expectation was that would happen -- take place in Istanbul. This is certainly the other fault line, and it's going to be equally, I think, devastating. Can you tell us a little bit about the area where the epicenter of the earthquake has been?",

Small size or medium-size cities. But you also have refugees. You also have an ethnic mix of, you know, Turks of Sunni background, Alevi (ph) background, or Kurdish Turkish citizens, of Kurdish backgrounds, and Syrian refugees. [00:40:25] So actually some of these areas are also rather poor. Some are more richer urban areas like parts of Gaziantep, but other parts that we're talking about that seemed to have been devastated are relatively lower-incomes areas. And as always, this is -- this is a national disaster, but part of the tragedy comes from human error, in terms of building, construction, and actually buildings where contractors do not really go with Turkey's building codes. Because -- after devastating earthquake in 1999, Turkey had really changed its building laws and regulations, and forcing contractors and architects to build earthquake-proof residential buildings, particularly in residential areas. And this was a big focus during Turkey's succession process with the E.U. But these things, you know, when there isn't enough focus, they tend to taper off. There is and has not been as much concert tradition on quality of materials and enforcing building codes over the last five, six years. Turkey is no longer really that set on its E.U. track. And you also have a country that has a severe economic downturn, which means that people are willing to be a bit less than perfect in the construction business. So I think that is a huge part of the problem, because you can see, in your footage, in some of the footage that is coming out, the building -- one building standing still, and the next one is entirely gone. And that can only be, you know, a human error, which is why this is so sad. But this part of the country is not the richest part of Turkey. It's a mix. It's also a part of the country, while you know, that's definitely a warmer climate than Northern parts or Istanbul, has been experiencing a cold -- a cold front. You have snow in many parts of Southern Turkey and Southeastern Turkey. People have to leave their buildings right now. That can't go in. And you know, when you are -- I don't know if you've ever been in an earthquake, but when you do, you run out of the building. You stay out, but you always want to go back in to get your phone or get your wallet, or something. Or maybe some water. Or you left in a hurry, and you -- you are in your slippers. Or you need a coat, et cetera. There are announcements being made, urging people not to go in, not to go in to pick up. Because you constantly have remnants, you know, smaller tremors continuing. And they can be very deadly, as well. When we say -- when I say small, it's still been in the magnitude of six something over the past hour. So that is a pretty dire situation, even for the standards of -- even by standards of a country that is somewhat used to earthquakes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
