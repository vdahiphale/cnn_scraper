Finally after 22 days, more than three weeks and four nominees, Republicans seem to be rallying behind somebody who a lot of people were Googling overnight, Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson. We are standing by for the vote.I want to go to Lauren Fox, who has been there as well, with the rest of our team, reporting on this surprise development last night. Lauren, I know you have been talking to some of the hold-outs. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. There were a number of members, a handful of them who voted present last night in that private Republican meeting. But Johnson was able to change minds, including the mind of Representative Mark Amodei. He was a Republican from Nevada. I spoke with him this morning and he said, he voted present because he and Johnson have not run in the same circles before.He did not know him well and his argument was that if he's going to go back to Nevada and argue he supported someone for Speaker, he needed to know that person was open and amenable to some of the issues that are really important back in his state, specifically some lands issues that he wanted to talk to Johnson about. So, he had about a half-an- hour conversation with Johnson last night. Then he had a meeting with Johnson's staff this morning. And he said after the conversation with Johnson, he felt comfortable saying yes, committing to voting for him on the floor. But it just shows you, Dana, the work that has gone into getting the votes that you need to become the Speaker. Now, Johnson started with just a handful of people who are outstanding. Obviously, that was a far cry from the more than 20 that Jim Jordan had to convince and never could, that Tom Emmer had to convince and never could, but it shows you how much work Republicans have been putting in behind the scenes to both air their grievances, but also try to convince members to vote for them if they are vying for the speakership. Mike Johnson on track to likely win this gavel. We're waiting for that vote to begin shortly. Dana?",

We can see Mike Johnson there hugging a fellow member, working the floor as he awaits the beginning of the vote. First, he will be nominated of course, and they will start to vote on whether or not he should be Speaker.As we watch that, I want to bring in our panel here. And Charlie Dent, you are the only one of us sitting here who actually served in Congress, and you served for one term? FMR. REP. CHARLIE DENT (R-PA): Yeah, with Mike.",

He doesn't have a long track record, not a lot of tape, so think they'll find him acceptable. Now, this is certainly a win for the Trumping (ph) populist wing of the party. And I think there's also a question, if I were an Emmer person, I would be a little upset that Emmer beat Johnson, just as Scalise beat Jordan, but the small Trump (ph) wing of the party tries to impose its will.And so now, Johnson is going to step into a tough situation because now he's going to have to tell many of his long-time allies that he needs to cut a deal on funding come November 17th and then probably again to finish the funding bills some time after that.",

He did tell me he doesn't see any daylight between Mike Johnson and Kevin McCarthy. He went on to say, I don't believe his politics are more conservative than Kevin McCarthy. He said that McCarthy and Mike Johnson voted to overturn the presidential election. He talked about their position on abortion. He talked about their position on social security and Medicare. He says there's no daylight between Mike Johnson and Kevin McCarthy on those issues.So you're seeing a bit about how Democrats plan to message this. Also, there's a question too among some, (inaudible) was it worth the vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, given that the ideologically on some these issues Johnson is more ideological than Kevin McCarthy on some of these social issues in particular. But Hakeem Jeffries said, no, he told me he has no regrets for the vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from this speakership. He also made clear if Mike Johnson tries to move forward on any spending bill to keep the government open and seek deeper spending cuts, he said that Democrats will not go for that. So that is one of the big redlines and the big fights that will be coming under the Johnson's speakership. So here, just in a matter of moments too, Dana, on the House floor, we expect that Elise Stefanik, the Conference Chairwoman to give the nominating speech for Mike Johnson before they kick off this roll call vote. But, as you can hear from comments from Hakeem Jeffries, the moment he assumes the speakership, big fights ahead with Democrats. Dana?",

He's the Speaker Designee by the House Republicans and there will be a vote shortly on whether or not he can just move, I don't know, a couple feet to the right and actually get the gavel in a formal way. We're going to watch for that.And as we do, we are going to keep talking to my panel here.

The back story here that we're going to be hearing a lot more about is he is an attorney and he helped lead the effort to sign what's known as an amicus brief, a friend of the court brief, to push a Texas lawsuit to overturn the election results, not in Texas, but in other states -- swing states. The Supreme Court didn't hear that. They said we're not even going to hear this case. It was something he is very, very involved in and at that point, he did not answer the question. It was a very legitimate question.",

He's look ahead to the next year and what the Republicans have to do. And so he's going to know Joe Biden is the president because he's about to sit across the table from him shortly as the Speaker of the House.",

Now, this is a -- he is a serious guy, Mike Johnson. He is smart. He is policy oriented. The question that he's going to have is, can he lead the Republican conference with a real policy agenda while also taking care of Donald Trump, who is really not policy driven? It's a populist movement. That's the real issue. But the people in the conference who have a policy governing agenda were the ones tanking Jim Jordan. They weren't allies of him.And so, this is where I think Johnson is going to have a really difficult challenge. He's going to have to answer the election denial question and he's going to have to prove that he's going to be a governing Republican. If he can do that, he's going to be back in the same boat where Kevin McCarthy was. I mean that's the problem, unless these guys are going it give him some slack that they would have never have given McCarthy or anyone else.

Johnson is going to have to learn on the job and we hope that he can get it done. And it's not going to be just to appease Donald Trump, it's can he appease the eight folks that ousted Kevin McCarthy. We are going to, in the next couple of weeks, have to negotiate and keep this government open and will he be able to do that or do we go into a forever shutdown?",

Some of them are taking selfies with him. They are handing him personal written letters. Someone handed him a book that had Jesus scrawled on the front of it. And also, another sign of growing confidence that they might be able to finally select a new speaker, the Speaker Kevin McCarthy sign that had been hanging over the speaker suite for weeks was finally take down yesterday. And I also saw boxes of Kevin McCarthy's old belongings being moved out just this morning. So, Republicans really being driven here by an overwhelming sense that they want to unify and put this very ugly chapter behind them. But I can tell you, Dana, that the wounds are still very deep inside the GOP. It's going to take awhile to heal. And they have all these other challenges that they are immediately going to have to confront, whether that's government funding or the White House request to tie Israel aid and Ukraine aid.

As we await for the speeches to begin, what's going through your mind here? CHALIAN (voice-over): Well, seeing Patrick McHenry up there, the Interim Speaker who has been overseeing this chaos for the last three weeks, it is such a reminder that he really did not want this job in the long-term. There was a lot of discussion over the last three weeks of trying to find some way to actually elevate him to the role for some temporary period of time to get the House open. And he just didn't want a part of it. And the conference, the Republican conference made really clear, they were not interested in working with the Democrats or even considering Democratic entreaties, some way in a bipartisan fashion to open up the House. They believed this was a problem for the majority to solve and they believe they are on the cusp of solving it today for the notion of opening the House. But as we discussed earlier, solving today's issue is not solving the long term.",
