So, the democratic nominee's message in the closing weeks of the presidential race squarely focused on warning Americans, particularly the undecided independents, moderate Republicans, that Trump poses a threat to the nation's core principles are the voters that she wants to reach listening. Are they grasping that message?EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well Fred, they are confident in the strength of this argument. They are under no illusion that they are going to capture voters firmly in Trump's camp, but they believe that the former president is exhibiting behavior that indicates that he is too extreme for the job. And they think that that can resonate with moderate and independent voters. The Mayor of Waukesha, Wisconsin today that is outside of Milwaukee. Those are very much the suburban voters that they're trying to reach. He is a long-time Republican, now Independent. He came out and endorsed the vice president, and he said that his key reason for doing so is because he is concerned about the threat of fascism in this country. So, they wouldn't be doing it if they didn't think that they were making some in roads with these types of voters. Now, the vice president asked about her weakness last night at our Town Hall, take a listen to how she responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She constantly talks about her love for Gen Z, and you could even see in that response there that she is open to having -- you know a whole number of people in her ear to make these vital decisions for the country.

And we're live in the battleground State of Georgia, where CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now from Atlanta. Alayna, great to see you this morning.

      "sentences": "That's right. I think, look, I mean, when I talked to Donald Trump's top advisers about this yesterday, Fred, they said that, well, one they pushed back heavily on this. We heard from a number of campaign officials, but also Former White House officials who are still close to Donald Trump and had served with him when he was in the White House, people like Mark Meadows and Kash Patel.But mainly they believe that this isn't going to change much. You know, particularly when it comes to rhetoric and whatnot? They think that this isn't going to have much of an impact on the election. We'll see. I mean, I think it's clear that the Harris campaign thinks the opposite. Last night during that Town Hall with Anderson Cooper, she went back to what John Kelly had said multiple times. And so, we'll see how this plays out moving forward. I know that. I don't think Donald Trump's team plans to focus on this at all. They want to move forward on this, and that's kind of what you heard some of Donald Trump do last night. For his part, he did a route -- he had a rally in the Georgia suburb, in Duluth. I was there, and he spent a lot of time, of course, attacking Kamala Harris. But one interesting line of attack was he really harped on one of her answers on the view recently, where she was asked -- you know what would you do differently about the last four years? And they actually played that clip during the rally. But the reason I find it notable is because that is an answer that Anderson asked Kamala Harris last night again. And it's an answer that many of Donald Trump's top allies also were sharing. I think it was the most notable video clip I saw of Trump's campaign and his allies, like Stephen Miller or his son Donald Trump Jr., were sharing repeatedly, following the Town Hall. I want you to take a listen though to what Trump said exactly in Duluth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: After all the catastrophes she has caused Kamala Harris can say one thing that you do differently. You saw that. What would you do differently? I can't think of anything. I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. This will be America's new golden age. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So Fred, part of the reason I think that Trump's team is focusing so much on that idea of how she wouldn't -- she said she couldn't think of anything that she would do differently over the last four years, is because that's a key line that they are trying to drill into the minds of voters that -- you know this question of, were you better off four years ago, when Trump was president than if Harris was?And they've been seizing on that even more so, I'd argue, in this final stretch, I guess 12 days now, until November 5th. I also want to take a step back at some of the other things that happened at that event last night, because, as you know, I go to multiple Trump rallies a week. Last night was felt a little bit different. It almost felt the vibe in that arena felt like a mini-Republican National Convention. They had a lot of high-profile speakers there, including people like RFK Jr., Tucker Carlson, Ben Carson, Marjorie Taylor Green -- even had -- even saw the. The Country Music Star Jason Aldean, introduce Donald Trump. So, they were trying to make this a massive event. [08:10:00] But one thing that I found notable was Tucker Carlson, when he was speaking before Trump took the stage, gave this analogy where he said that, essentially that if Donald Trump were to win, it would be like dad is coming home. And he said, like a dad, Trump loves all of his children. He was referring to the media and Democrats, and said that he would need to give them a good spanking. It was a very odd moment, and something though, that later on, a lot of the crowd kind of picked up on and they started cheering when Trump came on stage Daddy's home. So just wanted to leave that with you, because I have not heard that yet at any of these rallies, Fred.",

Israeli hostages are 101 of them still being held in Gaza. Get more of them released. But in fact, the situation has got even worse it seems. Israel has been intensifying its bombardment of areas of Gaza. It's been going in hard in the northern part of the of the Gaza Strip, where it says Hamas has started to re-emerge in the Jabalia Refugee Camp, for instance, where hundreds of people have been killed over the course of the past week or two. And then, of course, in Lebanon, we've seen an upsurge in Israeli attacks. There, in southern Beirut, the Lebanese capital, and in areas of south and eastern Beirut, which are the strongholds of Hezbollah. Israel has been stepping up its attacks to try and degrade the infrastructure and to kill Hezbollah members inside that nation as well. What we are a long way away from, it seems, is any kind of pull back from the brink, any kind of ceasefire and certainly no hostage release on the horizon.",

The question, of course, is, what exactly are they there for?The U.S. won't be specific about what kind of training they're receiving, but of course, the key concern here is that they end up on the battlefield in Ukraine, and that's something both South Korea and Ukraine have said that, that's effectively where they're headed. Now, Russia is suffering about 1200 casualties a day, according to the U.S., that is killed and wounded together on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, in that perspective, 3000 is a fairly small number. It's not even three days of troops for Russia as it fights and takes losses in Ukraine. But beyond that, it is a bigger statement to the U.S. about first, the desperation of Russian President Vladimir Putin as he needs more bodies to essentially feed his war machine there.

North Korea has tried to push forward both its nuclear program and its satellite program. On the latter, they have had some successes and some failures. The Russians could certainly help them with that, and that would be even more concerning, especially as it would involve, perhaps the involvement of North Korean troops, far East troops, that is in the fighting in Ukraine. It's also worth noting that the White House said to be reaching out to China to see, to share the U.S. perspective, and also see if, if China has their own perspective on this, and could help in some way, given the relationship between China and North Korea.",

And then, of course, there's the connection with China. As I mentioned a moment ago, China and North Korea have a functioning relationship, perhaps even a good relationship, at times. Are they concerned the North Korean troops are fighting on behalf of Russia.

The International Monetary Fund says that in that sort of extreme scenario of trade wars, trade fragmentation, you could see global GDP hit by 7 percent. And of course, the issue here is that countries won't just retaliate to Trump's tariffs. They won't just slap duties on American goods, but they may also slap duties on other goods from other countries because they're worried that the goods that would have gone to the United States are now going to flood their own market, and that is actually what we saw back in 2018, you'll remember that Trump put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the United States. The European Union not only retaliated on some American products like Harley Davidsons and denim jeans, but they also put import duties on steel products because they were worried, and they cited the higher risk of a flood of imports coming into their market.

So right now, sustained winds of 74 kilometers per hour, gusting up to 92 that westward movement there at about 24 kilometers per hour.We have already had a tremendous amount of rain for these areas. You're talking rain for wind up through Wednesday, measuring in the several 100 millimeters, 400, 500, 600 for some perspective, for those who are more on the nonmetric side. We're talking more than a foot or even two feet of rain in just a very short period of time. Additional rain is expected before it finally moves back out over the South China Sea. Some of these areas could pick up an extra 50 millimeters or so, or roughly two inches, before the system finally exits, and it will. Now it's also expected to intensify a little bit more. Once it moves back out fully over open waters, perhaps getting up around that 100 kilometer per hour mark. But then it is expected to weaken as it starts that turn backwards as it edges closer towards Vietnam by the back half of the upcoming weekend. And here you can see that here some of those rain showers likely beginning along the coastline there late Saturday. And then the bulk of the rain and the really gusty winds taking shape on the day Sunday. Here's a look. Another concern is really going to be that rainfall as well for Vietnam, especially the central portion. Obviously, your highest rainfall amounts are going to be right there along the coastline. But even areas outside of that north and south, you're talking widespread totals of 100 to 150 millimeters. Some spots could exceed 200 millimeters before that system finally begins to spread back out. So very significant system as we head into the weekend here, but it's one of three that we're continuing to watch. You also have this area just off to the east. This is the one that's not yet named, but has some potential there, so something we will certainly keep a close eye on in the coming days. And then we also have the system over towards India that's also causing some impact. So, Fred, a lot going on here on the other half of the world.",

So far, the investigations are homing in on the fresh slivered onions that are used on the quarter pounders, but they haven't yet ruled out the beef patties. So, McDonald's says that it is pulling those ingredients from store menus in affected states as this investigation continues and they are trying to reassure folks that it is safe to eat at McDonald's right now. Here's what they're telling people.
