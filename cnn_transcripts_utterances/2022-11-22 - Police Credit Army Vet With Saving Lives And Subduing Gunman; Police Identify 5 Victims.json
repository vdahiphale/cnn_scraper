In their own words, survivors and heroes who made it out of Club Q alive, give a painful bullet-by-bullet account of what happened inside that Colorado Springs nightclub.Plus, no slowing down. The special counsel takes over and moves full steam ahead with the big Trump investigations. Also today, another courtroom showdown between the Justice Department and the former president's lawyers over those documents taken from Mar-a-Lago. And some brand-new CNN reporting this hour on Ron DeSantis. He calls his midterm reelection with a national GOP roadmap, but the governor's go to loan approach, leave some GOP donors and bigwigs with a bit of a sour taste. Up first for us though, a sketch of pure grief emerging from the new firsthand accounts from the survivors of yet another American massacre. This morning, the alleged Club Q shooter remains hospitalized, uncooperative and under investigation now for bias motivated crimes. Today, a snippet of new information just before his 16th birthday, the suspect petitioned a Texas court to legally change his name. Now why he did that and why he barged into the Colorado Springs club and started spraying bullets remain unclear today. But we have learned a lot, learned a lot through halting, tear-filled interviews with the people who made it out of that nightclub with their lives intact, though forever scarred. Richard Fierro shrugs off the title but make no mistake. This is what an American hero looks like. Fierro at the club with his daughter and her boyfriend. He went to the ground at first rifle pop before making a 20-yard dash straight for the shooter, pulling him down and separating him from his AR-15. Last night here on CNN, Fierro angrily, painfully recounting his last-ditch attempt to stop the slaughter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD FIERRO, STOPPED CLUB Q SHOOTING: I got to protect my kid. I lost my kid's boyfriend. I tried. I tried to everybody in there. I still feel bad. I fight people that didn't go home. And this guy, I told him why I was (Inaudible), I will kill you man because you try to kill my friends, my family was in there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Moving on now to new developments in the investigation surrounding the former president the United States. Donald Trump's new reality, a special counsel now helms two federal investigations into his conduct. Today, at two o'clock in the afternoon here in the East Coast, the big courtroom test in one of those cases. The Justice Department and Trump's lawyers are back in court, fighting over the need for a special master that the third-party official to examine the 2200 pages of documents the FBI recovered in Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago home after serving a search warrant. Let's go to our senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, covering this court proceeding. Paula, what do we know?",

But he has personally approved all of the arguments that prosecutors will make in just a short time in this courthouse behind me as they try to convince this panel of judges to do away with this requirement that all of these documents be reviewed by a third party.We don't expect to get a decision today. But some good signs for the prosecution. Previously this same court has granted prosecutors a carve out to this requirement, allowing them to at least investigate classified documents. And just a short time ago, we learned that two of the three judges on that panel are also going to sit on today's panel to decide whether to just do away with a special master all together. And the big issue here, John, is speed, trying to move this investigation along quickly, as there were concerns about how far it will extend into the 2024 presidential campaign. As we know the former president has successfully used delay as a tactic in litigation and other investigations. So, a lot riding on these arguments, and we'll bring you all the updates as they come.",

Sources telling our Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz, there are no signs the pace of the big investigations into Donald Trump are slowing down. As a result of new special counsel Jack Smith, taking the reigns.With me to share their insights on this, the former federal prosecutor Carrie Cordero, and CNN's Evan Perez. Carrie, I just want to start with you very quickly on this hearing here. Do you believe that this special counsel as opposed to the attorney general, is that make any difference in this special master case? Or is this just whether these judges believe it's necessary? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I don't think it's going to make a difference in terms of how the court itself is going to evaluate the issues in the case. What it does is it provides some installation for the Justice Department to show that now the special counsel, the new special counsel is engaged and is making decisions whether to continue to go forward and stay on the path. But it shows that the arguments that the Justice Department is making are consistent from the attorney general being in charge of this investigation to now the special counsel. And the Eleventh Circuit really is going to look at whether the original judge who appointed the special master got the law wrong.",

We know witness testimony and so on was being scheduled. And of course, today's hearing is going ahead without any interruption. So, those are the signs that he is trying to make clear to the teams that, you know, just because you have a new person overseeing everything, I'm going to get up to speed. But you know, everything should continue as it was going along. Now, John, how long that continues, is still up in the air, obviously, because there's still a lot of concern that people have both people on the left and of course, the former president's team, that this is going to drag things out.",

I don't think that the appointment of the special counsel means that there was some imminent decision about whether to bring indictments, whether that's against the former president or others who were involved in these potential conspiracies, and then on the mishandling of the classified information on presidential documents.So, I think these investigations are very active. As Evan describes, they're still doing grand jury witnesses. They're still serving subpoenas. That is the indication of an ongoing active investigation does not necessarily mean that indictments are imminent. And these cases, both the election case and the classified documents case, and the presidential records case, these are cases that are complex. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to be handled quickly.",

Then you have this from Jeffrey Cortese, the acting chief of the FBI, who had some tension. The FBI public integrity, attention with Jack Smith, when he was the head of the Justice Department public integrity, was understood the fastest way for a case to die was to give it to them.

That in some people's opinion, and certainly I wrote stories about this, it made them a little gun shy about when to bring public corruption cases.Now, things have changed. And so, we will see whether the Justice Department has righted the ship when it comes to those types of cases.

We don't want to pass any long-term spending plan in the so-called lame-duck session. Let us get the majority, so we can stand up to Biden.

He managed to work in a probably, Speaker McCarthy/ SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Right, right. Well, and also there is precedent for - I mean, precedent not many years ago, for a Republican House not being able to do the basic function of governing, and Senate Republican, Senate Democrats in the White House kind of had to team up and clean up the mess. We're talking about then Vice President Biden, then and now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. And even if Republican leaders want to present a unified front, at least initially, when we are close to broaching the debt limit, or when we can't, you know, fund the government, you're going to see a pretty delicate kind of puzzle that Republican leaders will have to navigate.
