As the conflict looks to intensify, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will have overall security responsibility for the territory for an indefinite period once the war is over. His comments came during an interview with ABC News, where he once again stressed that Israel won't allow a ceasefire until Hamas releases all the hostages.Meantime, Israeli forces are tightening their advance toward Gaza City. (VIDEO PLAYING) Israeli airstrikes hit near a hospital in Gaza City Monday after large explosions rocked the area the day before. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says there were casualties, including a number of deaths. Israeli ground forces say they have now circled Gaza City and cut northern Gaza off from the south. The Palestinian Ministry of Health, which relies on data from inside Gaza, is controlled by Hamas. says the death toll in the besieged territory has now surpassed 10,000 since the war began on October 7th. A top United Nations official says that number, quote, \"defies humanity.\" And for more we want to go to journalist Elliot Gotkine who joins us live from London. Good morning to you again Elliot. So what are we to make of Prime Minister Netanyahu saying Israel will have overall security responsibility for Gaza after the war?",

Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Golan Heights from Syria, the others are considered to be the occupied Palestinian territories by the international community, including the United States.And since then has been unwilling to withdraw and turn over those territories to an independent Palestinian state. That's the root of this particular conflict over the past more than five, six decades. Now, when you see the tension, as you called it, escalate to the point where we're bombarding the Gaza Strip, which was not only occupied but under siege, and also had a Hamas government, which didn't make things any better, to put it lightly. I find it very difficult to imagine that in the aftermath of whenever this particular escalation ends, it's going to be easy to have some sort of political solution. Your reporter mentioned the idea of some kind of Arab peacekeeping force within the Gaza Strip after Israel ends its bombardment. I think that we have to be aware here, there's very few little appetite in the region to come in and clean up the mess that Israel has carried out in the Gaza Strip and I don't think that people really realize that the level of antipathy towards Israel's policy on the Gaza Strip is incredibly high.",

So Andy Beshear is running in a very red state that Donald Trump won, I think, by 26 points. At this point, it looks like a very tight race. You know, I basically looked at historical data and the chance of Beshear holding on, winning a second term is about 60 percent. That is well within any margin of error, right? Daniel Cameron has a real shot on this race, but at this particular point, it seems like Beshear would hold on and give Democrats at least some leg in a very red state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now that resumption, very good news for the families of those still stuck inside. Overall, when all this began, it was estimated by both Egyptian and American authorities that there were some 7,000 foreign passport holders inside the Gaza Strip. It is now just over 1,000 that have managed to get out. It comes as aid organizations, 18 of them, get together to demand urgently a ceasefire for the Gaza Strip. The U.N. agency in charge of Palestinian refugees says that it has lost 88 of its staff members over the course of the conflict, the largest number of U.N. staff ever lost in a single conflict. And we've had also the call of the U.N. secretary general on Monday urgently calling for a ceasefire saying this is not just a humanitarian crisis but a crisis of humanity. For the time being all eyes very much on who continues to be allowed out of the Rafah crossing and what continues to be allowed in. It is estimated there have now been just under 500 trucks of aid allowed in over the course of the last nearly month of this conflict. It had been before the conflict, about 500 trucks a day that had been getting in.

You saw his sons who testified earlier in this trial said that everything was pretty much done by the accountants, by the lawyers, so they tried to pass everything off on those other professionals. Trump, on the other hand, as you stated, said that he did see financial records. At one point, he said everyone, meaning him and his sons, were responsible for ensuring that fraud wasn't committed or that the records weren't fraudulent. So he didn't serve himself well in the testimony that he gave today, even though you could tell that, based on his ego, that he thought he was one-upping the judge, but I think the prosecutors were very strategic in allowing him at point to just ramble because in his rambles, he did give testimony that was adverse to his case.",

She's also on a mission to have Trump be prohibited from conducting and doing business in the state of New York to have his businesses unraveled, to have his properties sold. And I think attacking the judge, attacking the attorney general, attacking the judicial system didn't do Trump any good. This judge said he was going to make inferences negative to Trump because Trump refused to give answers to many of the questions posed by the attorney general. So I think it's a foregone conclusion that there's going to be a fine assessed against Trump, that his properties probably will be forced to be sold.

And the foreign ministers probably hope their previous more unified reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine could serve as an inspiration and example of them adopting a firm and united approach to conflict.But, you know, already we are seeing differences emerging when it comes to the Gaza conflict because of different concerns, different political loyalties and different economic priorities. The French, for example, voted for a U.N. Security Council resolution late last month calling for a ceasefire even though the U.S. vetoed it and other G7 members abstained. And the host nation, Japan, resisting pressure from its closest ally, the U.S., when it comes to a more public stance of pro-Israeli positions. Instead taking them, quote unquote, \"balanced approach\" because of its own diverse interest in the Middle East, including its heavy reliance on oil imports from that region. And they use mounting civilian casualties in Gaza in a way only reinforcing that approach in Tokyo. So it's going to be a very tall order for the foreign ministers to agree on any wording when it comes to Israel's right to defend itself to the civilian casualties in Gaza and especially when it comes to any concrete proposals to get humanitarian aid into an increasingly devastated Gaza. But I think they're also keenly aware that what they end up saying or not saying is being closely watched by not only allies and partners, but especially by critics and detractors, including Russia, but also increasingly China, both Moscow and Beijing, blaming the U.S. and its Western allies for being the root cause of this conflict and portraying themselves as champions of the developing world and as peacemakers. So the foreign ministers of G7 certainly understand their actions. This gathering has real implications when it comes to the political relevance of this grouping of wealthy democracies. Rosemary.",
