Because it mirrors what a senior strategist to a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate was just telling me, which is this notion, Kate, of a eager Republican electorate for a winner. Now, do you remember back in 2020 on the Democratic side, it was all about electability?Democrats were just seeking for somebody who could beat Donald Trump. And what a lot of Republican operatives are saying to me now is, it may not be quite at that level of what the Democrats were doing to try to oust Trump, but there is an eagerness among Republican voters in this early stage to identify the candidate that can guarantee victory against Joe Biden, that that is going to be an important thing. And part of this Trump fatigue perhaps is a concern that Donald Trump is not that guy.",

So many people are familiar with him more so than other candidates, perhaps because of how prominent he has been.So, he's going to be having meetings here. I'm told this afternoon, also meeting with some other influential Republicans, perhaps also talking to some people who could advise him on a presidential campaign that is expected to come in May or June. So, these key one on one meetings, perhaps even more important than his public gatherings. And then of course, he's going to round out the day here in Des Moines at the Iowa fairgrounds with another conversation with hundreds of Iowa voters. So, it's the what's happening in public, but also the behind-the- scenes meetings that he is taking on, that makes this much more than a book tour.

But also starting to form the narratives that they want to create for their potential opponents. So, you will start seeing some of that as well.But what is key to any presidential campaign is an organization and the financial support to be able to actually go the distance. And so, part of what these early outings to meet with voters, this is also to show through television screens and elsewhere to potential donors that you've got the goods to go the distance. That is an important piece, as well as meeting with potential people who will join your effort to work on and organize your campaign. All of that happens now, in these early stages, long before these candidates step onto a debate stage or try to close the deal upon the eve of voting.",

So, what we're learning is that in multiple instances, the U.S. has seen the Russians actually capture the U.S. provided weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles from the battlefield in Ukraine, and then sending them to Iran. And this is part of the growing defense partnership that we've been seeing between Russia and Iran, which is really intensified over the last year, essentially, with each of them doing each other favors.Of course, Iran is really supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine. Now, Iran wants help from Russia as well. And as part of that Russia has been sending this equipment to Iran, likely so that Iran can reverse engineer it, essentially take it apart and try to reproduce the weapons so that they can make their own and proliferate them, of course, throughout the region. Now, we should note that this is not necessarily a widespread issue. And U.S. officials are able to track when U.S. equipment falls into Russian hands because the Ukrainians actually have made it a habit to inform the Pentagon every time, they are forced to kind of leave something on the battlefield. For example, when they're overrun or they're forced to withdraw very quickly. But this could become a big issue. And according to one expert, if the Iranians are able to kind of get a lot of this stuff -- a lot of this equipment and reverse engineer it, it could pose a serious risk, of course to Israel and other allies in the region just because they're already of course very concerned about the threat posed by Iran and the growing influence of course of their proxy militias there and other malign activities in the region, Kate.",

And it also lets me know that perhaps the Russian capability to exploit these weapons is something that you know is perhaps less than it was -- than it once was.We know that the Russians have been doing this kind of thing for many, many years.
