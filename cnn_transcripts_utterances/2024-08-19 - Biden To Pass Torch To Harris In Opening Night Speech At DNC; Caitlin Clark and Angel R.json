That's a great question, Sara, because I have always said that even if we see a poll that has our person who is now Kamala Harris and Tim Walz 10 points ahead, they need to run like they're 10 points behind, especially now, right? We are now in the home stretch. There is an opportunity for her to continue to define herself with the American people. But we also know Republicans are trying to do the same. I think she has tremendous momentum, as you said.I think she has great advantages with the electorate, and you can see it in these polls as well. She is more trusted on personal values. She is seen as somebody who understands the everyday issues that Americans are going through. She is somebody who is seen as focused on the future -- energetic. And now that Biden is no longer in the race it's Donald Trump that is seen as old and feeble, and the past. And hers is also, importantly, the politics of joy versus the politics of fear, the politics of division, the politics of retribution. And I think we all know -- you know, we've talked for so long about how Democrats have historically been the party of having 10-point plans, right? Ten-point policy papers. We all know at the end of the day that voters vote with their gut. They vote based on how a candidate makes you feel. From what we are seeing, Kamala Harris makes people feel good, and makes people feel hopeful, and makes people feel optimistic. That, I think, is more than lightning in a bottle for a day. I think it's something that she can sustain until November. BERMAN:  You're talking about age. As an aside, I think I just read that today is Bill Clinton's 78th birthday.",

Because if it wasn't for what he did so selflessly, this would not be the moment that we are all living in. This is the bridge that he promised to be when he first ran in 2020.

The report alleges obstruction of justice and abuse of power by the president when it comes to his son Hunter's business dealings in the past. It stops short of alleging any criminal wrongdoing. It also covers familiar ground that has been tread before. CNN's Marshall Cohen has been combing through this one for us and he joins us now. So, Marshall, explain what's in this report and what happens with it now.",

      "sentences": "Kate, good morning.So after a year of digging, Republicans really didn't move the ball forward all that much. Their nearly-300-page report -- it's full of very strong accusations and lofty claims like you mentioned. But here's the political reality. Number one, the Republicans still don't have the votes to impeach Joe Biden. And number two, with Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee, many Republican lawmakers are just moving on. So what's actually in this report? It reads like a greatest hits of recycled talking points. It's heavy on innuendo and circumstantial evidence, but it's light on proof. So as you mentioned, the Republicans looked at the foreign business dealings of Joe Biden's brother James and his son Hunter. They concluded that \"Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family.\" They, the Republicans, say that the Biden family sold access when he was VP to businessmen in China, Ukraine, and other countries. They say these are impeachable offenses. But Kate, here's the rub. As you said, the report stops short of actually formally recommending that the House move forward with an impeachment vote. For its part, the White House -- they have not put out a response this morning, but they have repeatedly denied that Joe Biden was ever involved in his family's business dealings. That's also what Hunter and James said under oath to the committee -- Kate.",

But more noise and more talk about this, conveniently; and no question, not coincidentally on the first day of the Democratic National Convention as they kick off.It's good to see you, Marshall. Thank you so much. And also this that we're tracking. Matthew Perry's overdose death and the criminal charges after the fact that are now facing five different people -- it has brought the -- brought back into the spotlight the drug ketamine. Ketamine has been approved for decades for uses as anesthesia. It also has a long history as a party drug being abused. And more recently, has been studied and shown some promise as a possible treatment for depression, trauma, and more. But there are a lot of questions around it. Let's bring in CNN's Meg Tirrell. She has much more on this. So, Meg, help everyone understand a little bit better what is ketamine approved for and not approved for.",
