So around his age group.But when I say rare, we're talking about hundreds of cases out of millions of people. So when you do the math, .007 percent chance of actually developing myocarditis. But keep in mind as well that the vast majority of those cases were pretty mild. Did not -- did not actually lead to any kind of significant medical problem. And if people developed myocarditis it typically was within several days after the second shot of a vaccine. So is it -- is it a possibility? It's really rare.

And the Fed signaled last month this might not be the last one.Our chief business correspondent Christine Romans is here with more. What do you think? CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"EARLY START\":  Well, 25 basis points -- another rate hike. For everyone watching at home, that means it's going to cost more to borrow money and that's been the tune of the last year -- year and change, right? It will be more on your credit cards, more to buy a new car, more for your mortgage. So that's what we're doing here. And the Fed is doing this because they're trying to kill inflation. Inflation down to three percent now. It's still too high for the Fed's comfort so we're expecting another rate hike. I think what's really important is what the Fed chief says about September. Are they still -- there have been so many rate hikes, you guys, I can't even get them all in the same -- on the same bar graph --",

All we know at this point is that he traveled to Ukraine at some point in the last several weeks to a month and that he was injured there while he was fighting. It is unclear who he was fighting with and when he actually arrived there.But he was transported to a hospital in Kyiv after he was injured and then he was actually evacuated by an NGO to a military hospital -- an American military hospital in Germany. The U.S. government is stressing, at this point, that they really had nothing to do with any of this. That Trevor Reed was there fighting of his own volition and that he was not operating on behalf of the U.S. government. The government has emphasized here that this is exactly why they are urging American citizens not to travel to Ukraine at all, let alone, of course, to participate in the fighting. Now, we know that many Americans and many people around the world who are not a part of the Ukrainian military have traveled there since the start of the war to help Ukrainian forces fight against the Russians. And Trevor Reed, of course, was held prisoner by the Russians -- wrongfully detained for nearly three years before the Biden administration managed to get him out as part of a prisoner swap. But still, the U.S. is saying look, this could actually jeopardize, potentially, hostage or ongoing negotiations with the Russians to try to get wrongfully detained Americans out of Russia. And they are saying that these two issues -- Trevor Reed fighting in Ukraine and those ongoing diplomatic negotiations with the Russians -- need to be treated wholly separately because they are not in any way related. So we'll see how this continues to play out and, of course, hopefully, get more of an update on Trevor Reed's condition at this point, Erica.",

And so, we talked about not just her work around the whales at this time but these villages that she works in. These are substance fisher folks here. They depend solely on the sea, both for whale-watching and fishing. And now, we're reaching a triple whammy with this marine heat wave. Take a listen to her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NATALIA  BOTERO-ACOSTA, BIOLOGIST:  The impacts are really broad and really severe, like for fishing, for biodiversity. It's really good fishing for the first half of the year -- maybe March, April, May when they start the migration, but not so much at this time. So if you add on El Nino and climate change, and all these problems on top of that then definitely, something that is uncertain and it's scary for a lot of us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, there's a lot more freshwater shedding off of the glaciers in the land of Greenland so they're worried that this could break down.The latest study says it could happen as early as 2025 but as late as 2090. And there's a huge uncertainty as to when we hit that tipping point but all the science points to we're reaching a cliff right now. And we have a couple of graphics that are much more important in the near-term to think about, both the temperatures in the North Atlantic where you can see the current year is off the charts going up, and then sea ice down at the bottom of the world where it's supposed to be winter. Where sea ice is going down at an equally startling pace right now. And again, friends, we haven't even gotten into the two hottest months of the year.",

But they will be hearing seven separate petitions on this law starting in September. This is after the court's recess.And actually, the Supreme Court president and other senior justices were on a trip to Germany when these petitions were filed and they cut that trip short. It was an official trip. They cut that trip short to rush back to Israel in order to hear these petitions. But what we're hearing right now, no emergency injunction. This means that this will now be heard fully. This is setting up a major legal battle here because the -- this was an amendment to the basic law in Israel. Israel has no written constitution. The basic laws essentially make up a semi-constitution, as well as Supreme Court precedent. The court will be ruling, essentially, on its own powers. And the Supreme Court has discussed basic laws in the past but it has never ruled to nullify them. So this will be a really fascinating legal battle. But what this also means now -- this law is now in force. It's official, it is legal, and that means the government can act on it. Now, one of the -- one of the things that the government may choose to do is to actually -- and this is being rumored right now -- fire the attorney general. The attorney general here is a little different than the U.S. They're more of an independent legal adviser. But the current attorney general has clashed with the government. She has criticized the judicial overhaul. And she is overseeing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial -- all the charges of which, I should say, he has denied. But all those things together -- there is some reporting and feelings that might be one of their moves. That would have been much harder to do before this law passed.
