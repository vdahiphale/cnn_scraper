And we're still waiting to hear which artists will be performing along with who will be lighting the Olympic cauldron.And for more on all of this, let's go out to CNN's Melissa Bell, who's joining us live from Paris. Melissa, it's been so great to see the sport finally get underway, you know, after so much anticipation. But day one, it seems, came with quite a bit of controversy. We're hearing news of a pitch invasion of the first football match of the Olympic Games.",

You say a pitch invasion, a goal that they scored cancelled, Morocco in the end the winners. But a messy start to the football.Also, we saw the Israeli team being booed as it took on Mali at the Parc des Princes here in Paris. And there are other controversies already. Just one day in, a COVID, a small cluster within the women's Australian water polo team. But also allegations of spying that are dogging now the Canadian women's team. That is the allegations that down further down in France, near Saint-Etienne, where Canada's football team is preparing to take on New Zealand. Allegations of spying using a drone. So already some controversy, even though, as you say, that big opening ceremony yet to get underway, Christina and Max. Some of those controversies hope the organizers will be overshadowed. What they expect will be a fairly spectacular ceremony. 320,000 people who are expected to line the banks of the River Seine along six kilometers, with organizers hoping that the weather holds up and there won't be any issues to do with rain.",

There are rumors of Lady Gaga being in town, Celine Dion, and that has fueled speculation. But for now, they're really not saying very much about it, not confirming either way.I'd just like to show you, Christina, this is Paris's Town Hall, all decked out for the event. One of 26 fan zones that Parisian authorities have organized for ordinary people to be able to come and watch these games. You can see their deck chairs put out, giant screens in these fan zones, and it's expected that many Parisians, those who haven't, for instance, been able to get tickets to some of the events, will be able to come and enjoy them nonetheless. At the heart of these games, from the very beginning, was the idea of inclusivity, that they would be open to as many people as possible. Controversy has also followed about the cost of the tickets, the rising cost of metro tickets. These fan zones are the answer from Parisian authorities, 26 of them around the city, that they hope will widen the access to the event. When it comes to the opening ceremony, that has been very carefully controlled. Along that 6 kilometer stretch of the River Seine, it isn't just that they've kept a very tight lid on the 320,000 people who will be able to come, checking their identities, giving them QR codes. Many of them refused. They've also had to control the identity of 20,000 Parisians that live along the River Seine. Essentially, any windows that give onto the river itself. So it's a huge operation that's taken place over the last few weeks and months to prepare Paris for what should be, say Parisian authorities, hope Parisian authorities, some of the most spectacular games ever held. Not just the opening ceremony held for the first time outside a stadium and inside the city center along the river, but also, of course, those swimming events that they hope, with the weather, if it stays as it is, that they hope will be able to take place in the river itself. So huge ambition on the part of the organizers, and at this point, great hopes that everything will go smoothly -- Christina and Max.",
