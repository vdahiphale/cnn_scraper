And now, we're learning they'll be welcoming a special guest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The U.K. and European Union have already announced new sanctions targeting Russia's diamond trade. And in a key development, sources tell CNN the U.S. will not stand in the way of allies sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, something Kyiv has been requesting for months now. G7 leaders started the day with a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The city, of course, was hit by a U.S. atomic bomb in 1945, killing more than 100,000 people in World War II. For more now, we want to bring in CNN's White House reporter Kevin Liptak, who's live for us in Hiroshima. Kevin, really good to see you and have you there on this story for us. And, you know, I do want to note it was a very poignant moment, of course, when they did lay those wreaths. And again, it brings to the four everything that's at stake here. I want to get right to the news though that President Zelenskyy is now scheduled to participate not virtually but in person. He's going to have a seat at the table. How significant is that?",

It's a very dramatic in-person appeal, almost certainly for more powerful weapons as Ukraine works to regain territory. The world leaders who are gathering here today really hope that that will help Zelenskyy gain some leverage at an eventual negotiating table. Of course, where that happens, when that happens, all remain open questions.Now, the leaders are in a working lunch right now and they will convene a special session dedicated to Ukraine later today. The main outcome from that will be this new package of sanctions, the U.S. targeting 300 individuals, entities really trying to close loopholes that exist in the current sanctions regime to prevent the Kremlin's war machine from gaining any more backing. You also saw the United Kingdom today banning imports of Russian diamonds, really looking to go after any untapped sources of wealth for Russia, really hoping to gain some leverage for Ukraine as this war proceeds. But really the high point will be that meeting with Zelenskyy when he arrives here. He has been traveling more outside of Ukraine, much more than certainly at the start of the war. He was just in Europe last week, gained commitments for billions of dollars in military aid. So the sources aren't specifying exactly when he'll be here, how he'll get here, but that will certainly be quite an important and symbolic moment at this G7, Paula.",

Don't depend entirely on China. China is fine, we all need China, we want China to be part of the global economic system, but let's not depend entirely on it.So, they're trying to find a language that will not get China's backup too much, will not cause too much anxiety among the European allies, but at the same time sends a message that we're all behind the United States, behind Biden, in recognizing that China needs to be, if not put in a box, then certainly needs its wings clipped a little bit.",

You have the threat from North Korea about a seventh detonation of a nuclear weapon and China's rapid buildup. So the importance of dealing with the issues of not only the spread of nuclear weapons, even in the worst moments of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union made progress.

More now on the war in Ukraine, and word that the White House will notstand in the way if U.S. allies decide to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Now, that's according to sources familiar with ongoing discussions who say the U.S. has already signaled its stance to allies. Now, some European countries are considering sending the U.S.- made jets to Kyiv. But those transfers need a green light from Washington. U.S. officials are not aware, so far, of any country formally making that request. Meantime, Britain says its Storm Shadow missiles have already been successfully used by Ukraine. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace made the announcement on CNN Thursday, a week after he confirmed the U.K. sent those weapons to Kyiv. And in the fight for Bakhmut, Ukraine has released this sped-up video saying it shows on Russian troops near the city. You see the video there. Now, Ukraine now claims it cut a new bridgehead west of the city, which could become a springboard for more advances. But Russia's Wagner mercenaries, meantime, claim they've also have been making progress inside Bakhmut. Cedric Leighton is a CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel. And good to see you. F-16's high on the shopping list for President Zelenskyy. Why is it significant that Ukraine receive these jets if they can? And what sets them apart, right? Why would they be a game-changer possibly in this conflict? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, Paula, the F-16 is a really interesting aircraft. It's been around for about 49 years. 40- plus of it was really operational. And it is a multi-role fighter, so it can do both air to air and air to ground combat operations. So what that means is it's really versatile. It can be used in many different ways. And it also is an aircraft, depending on how it's configured, it can potentially use its electronic-jamming capability to go after some of the Russian radars that are active in Ukraine and around the Ukrainian peripheries. So it's a very important aircraft. It's probably the best aircraft in terms of all the different capabilities that the Ukrainians could want. And it's probably the only aircraft that has all of those capabilities in one package.",

The West, and particularly the United States, has approached this whole situation in a very incremental fashion. And that has the impact of prolonging the war. Now, you can also say, though, that the West has provided a lot of equipment, and it has come in at the right time, like the high-mars system and, you know, some of the other weapons systems that the other countries have provided, like the German IRIS-T, for example.All those things have been really important, plus of course the tanks. You know, you have the Challenger tanks coming from Britain, you have the Leopard tanks coming from Germany, and of course finally the Abrams tanks from the United States. So each of these is an example of the incremental approach finally being overcome by the exigencies of the battlefield, but also these weapons deliveries have been the result of Ukrainian successes.

Sources familiar with the matter say Florida Governor Ron DeSantis could file his paperwork as early as Wednesday in a possible soft launch to his campaign, but the big announcement may not come until the following week.Now over the past year, DeSantis has repeatedly targeted the Walt Disney Company, Florida's highest taxpayer by the way, after Disney publicly criticized the state law limiting classroom discussions about gender identity and sexual orientation. And now Disney is scrapping plans to build a new billion-dollar campus outside of Orlando. That would have brought 2,000 high-paying jobs to the state. CNN's Natasha Chen has our details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in a memo written by the Disney Chairman of Parks, Experiences and Products, Josh Tamaro said that given the considerable changes that have occurred since the announcement of this project, including new leadership and changing business conditions, we have decided not to move forward with the construction of the campus. This was not an easy decision to make, but I believe it is the right one. This memo did not mention Governor Ron DeSantis. This does refer to the Lake Nona campus, that was supposed to be the site of this office complex east of Walt Disney World. Now, 2,000 people were supposed to move there, but now they are going to stay in Southern California. Some people had already moved to Florida, and the chairman in that memo said they would work on an individual case-by-case basis on their options, including the possibility of returning to Burbank here in the Los Angeles area. Governor Ron DeSantis' office, through a spokesperson, gave a statement to our colleague Steve Contorno that read, Disney announced the possibility of a Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago. Nothing ever came of the project and the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition. Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures. Now, on the same day, Disney did announce that they are shutting down the Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser at the Walt Disney World Resort. That is a premium experience for families paid thousands of dollars for a two-night voyage through the galaxy. That has only been open for about a year. Despite that announcement, Demaro in his memo did say that they are still going to invest 17 billion dollars and add 13,000 jobs to that Florida resort in the next 10 years. The Orange County mayor said that these 2000 jobs not moving to Florida was a result of Disney not having an inclusive and collaborative work environment. The Florida Democratic Party chair said that this loss happened because of DeSantis unhinged personal vendetta against Disney. Natasha Chen, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

For Palestinians, it marks the beginning of the occupation of East Jerusalem. But in recent years, the march has also become more like a right-wing nationalist rally, and a pretext for violence between Jewish, Israelis, and Palestinians who make up most of the population in this part of the city. While most marchers were peaceful, some groups sing songs about getting revenge on Palestinians erasing their names. Others going even further chanting may your village burn.

People familiar with their relationship told The Wall Street Journal, Lee was in a relationship with Momeni's sister at one point, and about three years ago Mr. Lee was together with a woman that Mr. Momeni also dated. According to multiple sources who also spoke to the Wall Street Journal, they described Lee as a kind and generous friend who loved adventure and was part of an underground Silicon Valley scene, known as the lifestyle, where people use drugs and there's a lot of casual sex. In a statement provided to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Momeni's lawyer said there are many rumors circulating around this case, many of them untrue. A motive or an explanation as to why this happened is still unclear. Both sides say they will not reveal more until trial. But Mr. Momeni's attorney argues there's more to this story than the police report reveals.",

Now, the RSV virus is the number one reason for child hospitalizations in the United States. Most children end up with mild cases though, but it can be especially dangerous for newborns.The vaccine is given to the mother in the second or third trimester to try and provide passive immunization to their infants.

Now, hours after Montana's total ban on TikTok was signed into law, a group of users is suing the state. They say the new law is unconstitutional and violates their right to free speech. And as Tom Foreman reports, more legal challenges are expected. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Nearly half the country, 150 million Americans turn to TikTok for inspiration, information, and entertainment. But now, Montana is turning it off, banning the app, and potentially slapping $10,000 a day fines on App Stores making it available. The governor says with TikTok owned by a Chinese company called ByteDance, the ban is to protect Montanans' personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok is pushing back saying the Chinese government is neither a partner nor party to information in the app.",
