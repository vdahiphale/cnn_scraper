Then, a state of emergency is declared in more regions of Peru as protests continue across the country. And then, millions are traveling across China for the lunar new year, raising fears about a new COVID surge. But first, tonight, a meeting of NATO-Ukraine's task force has ended in indecision. The topic of tanks dominated the conversation, but neither the U.S. nor Germany have decided to send any to Ukraine. Kyiv is planning for western -- pleading, has been pleading as you well know for western tanks to help re-defend itself and to reclaim territory from Russian forces. Germany's brand new defense minister says his country is ready to move quickly if allies reach a consensus. He explains the reason for the hesitation. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BORIS PISTORIUS, DEFENSE MINISTER, GERMANY (through translator): There are good reasons for the delivery, and there are good reasons against it. And given the overall situation of a war that has been going on for almost one year now, all the pros and cons have to be weighed very carefully. Another assessment is explicitly shared by many allies. We cannot all say today when a decision will be made nor what that decision on the Leopard tanks will be. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. military leaders are reiterating their support for Ukraine, but a top general warns the war will likely end in negotiation, not on the battlefield. Kylie Atwood joins me now from the U.S. State Department in Washington, and Nic Robertson is here with me tonight. Kylie, great to have you on the show, let's talk first about the assistance we saw. There was plenty of it, military and air defense. But of course, the thing that wasn't there that everyone was waiting for was tanks, in particular tanks, in particular, Leopard tanks.

So,we heard from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin after this meeting, quoting the German Secretary of Defense, saying there isn't any linkage between the U.S. needing to send tanks in order for Germany to send tanks. He said, you know, he's just not aware of there being that direct linkage. But when you talk to U.S. officials behind the scenes, one senior administration official told me yesterday, that Germany really has caught the U.S. here in a challenging spot. Because the United States isn't fundamentally opposed to sending tanks, they just don't think that their tanks on the battlefield in Ukraine would be effective, because they're logistically challenging to use, they take a ton of fuel and they just don't think that they are what Ukraine needs right now. But they do support Germany sending their tanks, the Leopard tanks, because they are just a little bit easier to use and, you know, get around on the battlefield. And so, there are frustrations behind the scenes about Germany holding this up and creating the appearance that they're not going to do it unless the United States goes forth with it. Now, we don't know how this is going to end, because we had all these defense ministers meeting today and you know, announcing new security assistance to Ukraine. But you heard from President Zelenskyy addressing that group and saying, you know, he can say thank you and thank you over and over again. But thank yous aren't tanks. He reiterated very clearly that they do think that they need more tanks for the battles ongoing.",

CNN's Marc Stewart is in Hong Kong with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This weekend marks the start of a lunar new year here in Hong Kong and across many parts of Asia. Travelers are on the move in many cases to see family members and friends amid months and even years of separation Because of the pandemic. In China, train stations and airports have been busy. By land and on the water, this is described as the largest human migration on earth with the holiday rush beginning earlier this month. The holiday comes as Chinese officials say COVID infections have peaked in many parts of the country. Yet, there is concern about a COVID spread as testing is required to still enter some countries around the world. As China begins to reopen to the world, the tourism ministry will now allow tour operators to resume trips overseas beginning next month. The travel packages were put to a halt in January, 2020, amid a first wave of COVID infections. Marc Stewart, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The match was Ronaldo'sSaudi debut after signing for, remember, reported $200 million contract with the Al-Nassr Football Club. Messi and Paris Saint-Germain ultimately won the friendly 5-4. After the match, Messi shared video on his Instagram of the two rivals hugging. And staying in the world of sport, the buzz surrounding the Australian Open is not about who's winning matches, but who's not allowed to use the loo. Former world number one, Andy Murray, was denied a bathroom break while playing the longest match of his career, a whopping five hours and 45 minutes that went on until 4:00 in the morning. There was also some confusion of Novak Djokovic's permission to use the toilet early on in the tournament. Murray calls the bathroom rule a joke as well as disrespectful, he says, to others. Let's get more on all of this. Christine Brennan. Christine, help us make sense of this. Initially, I thought Murray is just whining. What are the rules here?",

Andy Roddick got onTwitter and said this is so dumb, he's correct. So here's the situation, there's one bathroom break allowed three minutes. The reason for that is because, in the past, it has been abused. Stefano Tsitsipas at the U.S. Open for a year, year and a half ago, was gone for eight minutes, and was accused of using it to change the entire momentum of a match. And it did seem ridiculous that he was gone for that long. So, the -- so the new rule is you have a three-minute break, one of them in the entire match. You could also add two minutes if you've got clothing issues. Need to -- the guys need to change their shirt, the women need to change their shirt, you know, whatever it might be. So that's it. That's the rule. And, of course, when Andy Murray was saying 3:00 in the morning, could he go to the bathroom, as you said, the longest match of his career, seems like a very reasonable request and it seems to me that tennis needs to figure out how to change this.",

So if Andy Murray says that, I think he's usually right. Follow him. But in this case, so he's just won the four set. It's 3:00 in the morning and he's asking, Could I go to the bathroom? This is an extraordinary circumstance. And it seems to me then what the tennis officials should do, Isa, is give the referee discretion. So at that point, when Andy Murray looks at her, the referee, she's able to say, yes, go. It's not momentum shifter. It's not coaching. It's not cheating. The guy needs to go to the bathroom, let him go to the bathroom at 3:00 in the morning. They played another hour of tennis before he was able to finally get off the court.",

So that's the idea, that things get pushed later and later. This was remarkable and they should have definitely stopped it, said, guys, come back tomorrow, we'll figure this out.
