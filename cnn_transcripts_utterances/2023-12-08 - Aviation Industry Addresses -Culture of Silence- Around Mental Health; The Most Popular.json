What year was the first woman elected to that position? 1850, 1980, 2007, 2021? If you said 2007, put your hands up. Nancy Pelosi of California became the first woman Speaker of the House more than 200 years after the position was established. Former House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy is resigning from Congress and will leave at the end of this year. McCarthy made the announcement in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed. This comes just two months after his unprecedented ouster from the speakership post. McCarthy`s decision will narrow the House GOPs already slim majority. Now, let`s turn to a beloved website. One, many universities say you should definitely not cite as a source for your next research paper, though. Wikipedia it`s released this top 25 most viewed pages in 2023, given us a glimpse into the curious minds across the world. Coming in first place with over 49 million views in 2023 was ChatGPT showing the world`s growing interest in artificial intelligence. The second most viewed page was a list of biographical posts about people who passed away in 2023. And coming in both third and fourth places were post related to cricket, highlighting how India and Southeast Asia`s growing audiences are influencing the internet. In fact, Hindi language movies like Johan and Pathan made the list alongside American blockbusters like Oppenheimer and Barbie. I`d love to know what`s the last thing you search for on Wikipedia.
