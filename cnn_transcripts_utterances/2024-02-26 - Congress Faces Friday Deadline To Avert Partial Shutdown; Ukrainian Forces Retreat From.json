We're doing this song and dance all over again. A partial government shutdown will happen on Friday without a funding deal. The short-term compromise that just barely made it under the wire last time around is set to expire. And this time, the White House is adding to the stakes, pushing for that major foreign aid bill to pass.Tomorrow, President Biden is set to meet with the four top members of Congress, hoping to figure out a path forward.

      "sentences": "It's very murky right now. It's possible things could come together very quickly. It's also possible that Congress could stumble into a partial government shutdown. And remember, this was supposed to be done to fund the federal government by October 1st of last year, but at that point, there was no deal.The then-Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, agreed to allow a short-term extension of government funding to be approved by Congress with the support of Democrats. That cost him his job, a historic, unprecedented ouster of the sitting Speaker, leading to chaos within the ranks of the House. Ultimately, Mike Johnson became the new Speaker. He then agreed to another short-term extension of government funding until early January. And at that point, they kicked the can down the road again to this Friday. And now that's what their deadline that they are racing to try to avert. But in a very bad sign last night, Mike Johnson faced some criticism from the Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer. They traded bar back and forth. Schumer and Johnson have been negotiating for weeks to try to figure out a way out of a possible shutdown. And negotiations are still taking place. And there's still some hope that they can resolve some of these last issues that are still sticking points between the two sides. But even if they get a deal by the middle of this week, the mechanics of getting legislation through Congress are very difficult. It takes time. It takes a lot of cooperation, particularly the United States Senate, which is leading to a lot of questions and concerns about the possibility of a shutdown this week and maybe even next week, too, because that's the second deadline for the rest of the federal government. So, so many questions here and looming over all of this aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan, all of that was tied together in a separate spending package, $95 billion that was approved by the Senate earlier this month. Johnson has said that bill will not pass the House because it does not include border security measures. Of course, Johnson killed a bipartisan border security deal that was drafted in the Senate because he said it did not go far enough here. So you can see the complications that Johnson faces, that Congress faces as they return from a two-week break, trying to figure out if they can resolve these major issues or stumble into crisis, Boris.",

We also expect the looming partial government shutdown deadline that Manu was just talking about to come up as well. That deadline, of course, is on Friday.But as far as the White House is concerned, the primary focus of tomorrow's meeting from their vantage point is going to be pressing the importance of passing Ukraine aid. They are going to be talking about this national security package that had some $60 billion of aid for Ukraine that is being held up in the House, though it did pass in the Senate. U.S. officials, of course, in recent weeks have been trying to drive home this point that without additional U.S. aid, we are seeing detrimental effects on the battlefield for Ukraine as it continues to fight off Russian aggression. And we saw Jake Sullivan, the President's National Security Advisor over the weekend, telling our Dana Bash that there is bipartisan support in the House for Ukraine aid and that it is really all eyes on Mike Johnson right now.

It's been well known that the U.S. and Russia have been talking about a possible prisoner swap. The Russians want back this FSB assassin who's serving a life sentence in Germany for murdering a Chechen dissident, Vadim Krasikov is his name. And the U.S., of course, wants back U.S. citizens that are held in U.S. jails, particularly Evan Gershkovich, he was the Wall Street Journal reporter, and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine. That - those talks have been underway for some time, but this is the first time that we've heard, kind of publicly, at least, it was rumored, but publicly that Alexei Navalny was also part of those talks. That's what Navalny's team are saying. They're saying that negotiations have got to a point that they were at a final - the final phase just the day before Alexei Navalny was pronounced dead inside his Arctic penal colony. And the allegation coming from Navalny's team is that in order to sort of torpedo those negotiations and torpedo a swap, the Kremlin killed Alexei Navalny to essentially take that chip off the table, off the negotiating table. Again, that's something the Kremlin have pushed back on, categorically deny, in fact. But nevertheless, it is an interesting twist in this very tragic saga about the death of Alexei Navalny.",

And Trump is appealing not only this dollar amount, but also the other parts of the appeal of the judgment, including the ban on Trump and his adult sons from being officers or directors of the business. So that raises a lot of questions for the future of The Trump Organization and who will be running it, as well as some of the other parts of this judgment, which include continuing a monitor.Now, the big question here is how and when will Trump address the judgment, the money amount in this case. And that still remains unclear. He can either post the money up front in full, the whole $454 million, that's the judgment plus interest or he can get a bond that can be backed by some kind of collateral from one of these agencies that does that kind of work. But that is still a substantial amount of money for an individual. And some of the lawyers I've talked to say this is a bit of uncharted ground because usually a judgment of this magnitude is something that a corporation faces where they have lines of credit. They have large cash piles and that is just not clear what The Trump Organization has on hand that it's a private company. There's not a lot of information that is necessarily public. There are estimates of between $200 million to over $400 million in cash. But this is a significant amount of money. In addition to the 83.83 - $83.3 million he has to post in the E. Jean Carroll case, that was the jury awarded to E. Jean Carroll after finding that that is how much Trump should pay her in damages for a defamation trial, Brianna?",

So what they want to do, starting on Friday, is ask to move his Mar-a-Lago documents case trial, so this is the case in Florida, move it from the beginning or the end of May, when it's supposed to start, into July. And that case is very complicated because of the classified records in it, with the hopes that it'll get on the schedule for July, prevent him from going to trial in the 2020 election case in D.C., and then that case will have to move again, essentially allowing him not to go to trial in either case the whole way through Election Day.

However, that is not yet a reflection of people rejecting Donald Trump. The fact is there are Democrats rejecting Joe Biden because of his age. There were Republicans rejecting Donald Trump because of his these court cases that we have an electorate that's disassembling itself. We have a realignment going on right now in American politics. That's significant. Suburban voters are saying no to Donald Trump, particularly suburban women. You have working class voters, union voters that are saying no to Joe Biden. Latino voters, young African- American men saying yes to Donald Trump, that we have this shifting electorate out of anger, frustration, a feeling that no one's listening and a feeling that no one seems to care, so what we have is, frankly, chaos in the American political system as we close out February of 2024.",
