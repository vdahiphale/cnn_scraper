I'm Fredricka Whitfield.A state of emergency is in effect for Maryland and Virginia as Tropical Storm Ophelia moves up the East Coast. Powerlines exploding in North Carolina where Ophelia made landfall this morning. And so far, more than 50,000 homes and businesses are without power, and that number is expected to grow today. Allison Chinchar is tracking the storm from the CNN Weather Center and Brian Todd is in Alexandria, Virginia. Allison, let's begin with you. What is Ophelia doing?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, it's still kind of chugging along, making its way across the state of North Carolina. But when you look at this expansive wind field here, you can see we've got those outer bands stretching all the way up into places like Pennsylvania, New York, even Massachusetts.The sustained winds right now are 50 miles per hour gusting to 65. But again, those rain bands, that's where we're really seeing how expansive and widespread this storm is. Now, with that said, the heaviest rain is really focused over Virginia and North Carolina at the moment. You've still got some pretty heavy bands, although, the bulk of it is now really starting to push inland and away from the coastal areas, giving them a little bit of a break at the moment. You've got several flood watches, and even some flash flood warnings in Raleigh, and then off towards the east. And these locations, they've already picked up about two to three inches of rain. Now, you're going to get an additional one to two inches on top of that. So, there is the continued concern for the flood threat going forward this afternoon. Then it begins as we head into the evening to spread more into the mid-Atlantic. And then, by Sunday, the concern really becomes areas of the Northeast. That's where the bulk of the moisture will be located, especially Sunday morning and around Sunday at lunchtime. So, a flood threat for both today, and tomorrow, just two separate locations, you'll see today. Again, the focus is more across North Carolina and Virginia by tonight spreading into the mid-Atlantic. And then, by Sunday, again, the main focus really becomes Pennsylvania, stretching over towards Massachusetts. But both of these areas have that potential for very heavy rain. The storm itself will continue to weaken over the next 24 to 36 hours, but that's really more of a determining factor for the winds, not necessarily the rain. So, as that storm spreads north and then eventually out towards the east, the winds component will start to come down, Fred, but the rain component is still expected to be quite strong.",

We're in Alexandria, Virginia, in an area right by the Potomac River that is vulnerable to flooding.Take a look at how close we are to the Potomac River right here. High tide here is going to come in roughly three hours, then, there is going to be another high tide tomorrow morning. This is very vulnerable to flooding, even in normal rainstorms. And when I talked about the kind of weird weather pattern as we kind of walked down the street here and show you some of the homes and businesses down here that really are expected to be flooding -- flooded in the street -- on the street later on today. What I can tell you about the pattern of weather overnight and into this morning is that we started to feel those bands of rain that Allison was talking about overnight. And then, it ultimately, kind of had drizzled and heavy rain and wind, and then, it would kind of fade in and out. But we are expecting, you know, again, more rain later on today. This area is particularly vulnerable because we talked to two business owners near here. And what they say is that the problem in this area of Alexandria, Virginia is it's not only load of the water, and that that surge from the high tide is going to kind of push some of that water up onto the street. But also, the sewers around here are kind of old and antiquated, they tend to flood very, very easily. So, a couple of business owners did tell me they expect this area here and my photo journalist and I will kind of move over this way. They expect this area here to become completely flooded in a couple of hours. Take a look at that sewer opening over there. It's already started to happen again. We don't see a lot of flooding here right now, but it's coming probably in the next couple of hours. Fredricka.",

Now, to the ongoing response to this week's surge of migrants at the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has resumed operations at the international railway crossing bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas after the agency shut it down to redirect personnel because of the influx of migrants. Meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is set to visit the Rio Grande Valley in Southeast Texas today. CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez is joining us along with CNN correspondent Rafael Romo. All right. Let me begin with you, Rafael, first.

So, the first thing that we've noticed is that in the last 24 hours, especially, Friday, the number of migrants being detained at the border has decreased significantly.We were talking to the mayor of Eagle Pass, and he says, anywhere between 800 to 1,000 people were detained. That's much lower than we had seen during the week. So, that's one development. The thing is that we got in touch with the government of Panama. And they are telling us that 10s of 1000s of migrants have crossed through their territory just in the last few weeks alone. And number two, Texas is going to start busing again, many migrants to municipalities around the country, mainly the ones being run by Democrats. Take a look at these numbers, Fred. Just to our nation's capital. Nearly 12,000 migrants being bused there. New York, 14,000 plus; at Chicago, 8,700. So, that gives you an idea of what Texas is doing in. They're specifically sending, according to the office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, buses to two cities. Eagle Pass, and El Paso, specifically, to send those migrants from the border to those cities that are run by Democrats.",

And what the two are expected to discuss is how they coordinate and cooperate when it comes to slowing irregular migration in Latin America.Now, of course, when you talk to White House officials, this is an issue that they see can only be solved with regional partners, as they face unprecedented mass movement in the Western Hemisphere. As you heard there from Rafael, we know that there are still 100s of 1000s of migrants who are moving through Latin America, especially those from Venezuela, coming to the U.S. southern border. And this was a week where I put all of that into sharp focus. As we saw border crossings go up to 8,600 a day. We haven't seen those numbers since the late spring. And in May, as a point of comparison, numbers were around 3,500 daily encounters. So, a market increased this week that really put pressure on the White House and the administration to have to shore up resources to the U.S. Mexico border. And it also underscored not only the logistical challenges and the humanitarian challenges for this administration, but also the political challenges, because as all of that was unfolding, Fred, the administration also announced that they were going to make nearly half a million Venezuelans eligible for work permits who are already in the United States, addressing a major stress point with New York City. So, while they're trying to herald that. They are also navigating the complicated political landscape as they deal with an increase of border crossings.",

When Rupert sold his -- most of his stuff to Disney, that kind of made it pretty much smaller unit, and they've tried to keep true to linear stuff. But the world is changing very quickly.

I sat down with the commanding general for Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south, Oleksandr Tarnovsky, and he tells me strikes like these are invaluable for his troops. BRIG. GEN. OLEKSANDR TARNOVSKY, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): A destroyed commander means a destroyed command link. And if there is no command, then there are no coordinated actions. Hitting infrastructure like factories, bases, warehouses containing weapons is also a factor for victory. PLEITGEN (voice-over): In the past weeks alone, the Ukrainians say they've hit a Russian ship, a submarine, an airbase, and a surface-to- air missile system in occupied Crimea. Still, Ukraine's president faces skepticism, both from many Republican lawmakers and the public about the U.S.'s continued support for Ukraine. Tarnovsky asking for patience.
