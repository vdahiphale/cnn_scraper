      "sentences": "That's right, Kate. I can tell you, look, the court calendar, it just -- it doesn't work, particularly before the election. It is likely that there may only be one criminal trial that is able to go before the election next November, that is most likely at this point to be the Washington, D.C., trial about January 6th. But the other cases continue, for example, down in Georgia, Fulton County where the former president was indicted alongside many other people, only two of the defendants will go to trial later in the month.And we have learned that one of Trump's allies, Bernie Kerik, the Former New York Police Commissioner, he has been subpoenaed by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office to testify ostensibly in that trial later this month. Now, his lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who was also previously represented Former President Trump in his criminal cases, he tells us that he will not allow his client to testify unless he is granted immunity, because Bernie Kerik, he is an unindicted co- conspirator in that case. He is not named. But CNN, through our reporting, we have identified him as co-conspirator number 5. And this shows that prosecutors, you know, while Trump is in this courtroom in New York, they're trying to secure key witnesses who can help them reveal to a jury key details about what Trump allies were up to in and around the election. But they are also up against some challenges because they have indicted so many people and named so many people as co-conspirators, those people are likely to be reluctant to testify and to cooperate unless they are granted assurances like immunity. It is hard to imagine any defense attorney who would put their client on the stand if they were one of the unindicted co- conspirators to testify, to say anything other than, I'd like to invoke my 5th Amendment right unless they get assurances in writing. So, we have obtained a letter that Kerik's lawyer sent to the district attorney earlier today. And in this letter, Tim Parlatore suggest that the district attorney told him, look, don't worry, if we wanted to indict Kerik, we would, but they wouldn't put that in writing. Now, the district attorney's office has not gotten back to us about this new reporting, but it's just a reminder that while Trump is in this courtroom with some of his lawyers who work on some of the other cases, all of these other criminal investigations and criminal cases, they continue. And his legal exposure continues to expand.",

If Donald Trump were to walk out the front door of the building he is in now and look across the street, he would be facing the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building, named for the famed New York senator, Senators Javits, who before he was senator was the New York State attorney general, the job that Letitia James is in now. In 1956, he got this fraud law passed that gave the attorney general and other prosecutors broad authority to investigate companies that were involved in repeated fraud and illegal acts. Now, the Trump defense going into this case was always -- well, statements about financial things that we can argue about, but all the loans got paid and there are no victims here. And Letitia James countered with the idea that there don't have to be victims for repeated fraud and illegal acts. The law doesn't require that.But how did we get to here? First, it went to federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York, two doors down from this courthouse. They looked at it for many months, maybe even a year, and then passed on the case. While they were doing that, the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, was holding back on his investigation not to interfere with theirs. But once they passed on it, he took on the case and brought in a special prosecutor, a special assistant district attorney from the legal firm Paul, Weiss, Mark Pomerantz was his name. An expert in financial frauds, an expert in the prosecution of financial frauds, but also the defense of financial frauds. And he spent more than a year gathering these financial documents and running up against walls. Twice they went to the Supreme Court of the United States arguing to get, not just Donald Trump's taxes which was an uphill battle, but also the underlying business documents that underpinned the claims he made in his taxes, and twice they prevailed. The Manhattan district attorney had those records, and then something happened. Cyrus Vance left the D.A.'s office, Alvin Bragg was the new D.A., Pomerantz presented the case to him. And Bragg's people thought it was enormously complicated. It would be very hard for a jury to understand. It involved a lot of nuances in the law, and that they could look at something simpler as they were being criticized for walking away from the case, and they picked the Stormy Daniels hush money case which is a -- kind of, a one allegation, one thing to prove, one-dimensional case which they indicted Donald Trump on. In the background of the D.A.'s case, Letitia James, the state attorney general was doing the civil version of it. But she always had two assistant attorney generals at the D.A.'s office working in parallel. And they were able to take a lot of these records and a lot of what was gathered in that case, and fold it into the civil case. So, we didn't get here over night. This has been going on since 2018, 2019, through today, and that is how we ended up in this courtroom.",

The judge initially took a sledgehammer to Donald Trump's arguments in the case, ruling that Trump and his three adult children, his three sons, were guilty of persistent and repeated fraud. And I just want to show you what he said because it was such a strong statement. He said that, all of their arguments were exacerbating defendants' obstreperous conduct and their continued reliance on bogus arguments in paper and oral argument.

Ordinarily it would be before the jury can even rule on it, here, we don't have a jury. The judge is going to make the ultimate ruling.But yes, this is not just sort of a run of the mill ruling by the judge. He got out the Thesaurus for some of these words. I mean, he was very aggressive in the way he characterized this. So, the A.G.'s office are -- no matter what happens, even if the rest of this trial goes backwards for them, they've already won on count one. They already will be seeking damages on count one. Now, what's left to be decided over the course of this trial which could take months? First of all, there are six other counts relating to falsification of business records, relating to potential insurance fraud, relating to conspiracy to do both of those things, and relating to falsification of financial statements. So, there are six other counts here. They're similar. They relate to the same transactions, but they're harder for the A.G. to show. They're going to have to show a more specific level of Donald Trump's knowledge and intent. The second big thing that will be resolved here is the damages.
