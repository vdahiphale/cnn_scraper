That is just one of three stops for the former president today. That rally set to start there in Raleigh, North Carolina, at any moment. Thanks so much for joining me here on CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Erica Hill, in today for my colleague, Becky Anderson, joining you from New York. Well, with one day to go, this is officially the final sprint. It may have felt like it has been for some time, but trust me on this one, we are really here this time. The battleground states firmly in the spotlight on this final day of campaigning. The biggest focus, of course, Pennsylvania, that state, which offers a big electoral prize among those swing states we've been following so closely. Vice President Kamala Harris, set to spend the entire day there with rallies scheduled in five different cities. The former president also will be in Pennsylvania following that rally, of course, which is set to start at any minute in North Carolina, and then, he will end the day in Michigan. Campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Donald Trump again, sowing doubts about election integrity even before the votes have been counted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, fighting so hard to steal this damn thing. Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in your state. Every day, talking about extending hours and stuff. What? Whoever heard of this stuff? We should have one day voting and paper ballots. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was her in Michigan on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: From the very start, our campaign has not been about being against something, it is about being for something. A fight for a future with freedom, opportunity and dignity for all Americans. And so, in these final hours, let us remember that there is power in knowing that we are together.

They are really trying to consolidate their various coalitions across the country and run the tape on this message of unity. That's what you hear the vice president leaning into. So, she is going to begin the day in Scranton. That is, of course, the hometown of President Joe Biden, where she is going to rally up canvassers, doing the hard work of door knocking. She then heads here to Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the campaign is noting the heavy Latino population here. More than 30,000 Puerto Ricans living in Allentown. She then goes to Reading, and I think who she is campaigning with there is quite noteworthy, because some on the left has criticized her deep embrace of Liz Cheney and not the elevation of the progressive part of the coalition. But she is campaigning in Reading today with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, perhaps one of the most famous progressives in the country, as well as Governor Josh Shapiro. Then, she has a big rally in Pittsburgh, followed by a rally at 11:00 p.m. in the final hour, literally, over in Philadelphia. And that's going to be a star-studded affair with The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, and Oprah Winfrey. So, the goal of that is really to drive turnout here in the final hour and just get people excited in this key battleground state. Erica?",

I think there is a great deal of concern about the normal, everyday people who put their hands up to fulfill their democratic duty. You're seeing more security this time at the polls. I think the message from the Harris campaign is that this is an urgent moment, and Americans must get out to vote. Trump clearly has always been a bit skeptical of mail-in voting and early voting. But more Republicans actually have availed themselves of those facilities this time around, because they have been pushed to by the Republican Party. But I would expect even though 70 million Americans have already voted, we're going to see quite long lines tomorrow at the polls. And you know, as I said, because of the system, as you pointed out, this is going to take some time. And if Trump is emerging from this declaring victory before he won, and sending off legal suits, left, right, and center, this could be a very acrimonious period in the next few days.",

Obvious fake, his words there. Raffensberger also said the video was likely the result of Russian meddling, a suspicion that was then backed-up by U.S. intelligence officials. But it's important to point out there are a number of voters and some Republicans who remain skeptical. CNN's Nick Valencia, joining me now live from inside the Gwinnett County election center in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Nick, good to see you.

They simply do not believe the message that's coming out that these elections are safe and secure, and among the most safe and secure in the country. We wanted to give you a window, a glimpse into democracy in action, and that's exactly what you're seeing here. Like a lot of states, Georgia, or many states across the country, I should say, are not allowed to pre- process absentee by mail ballots. Georgia, though, is one of the states where you can. So, that's what's happening here. This is a machine that actually physically room removes the ballots from the envelopes, and then, taken over here to a batch of election workers that just left here, where they are organized by precinct in batches of 50. They are then taken to the front of the office, where they are stored and kept on hand until tabulation is allowed to begin. But there is a lot of stuff happens here every day. You mentioned the disputes, there is preparations for those disputes here, right? What you're going to see here, workers are actually keeping on, or holding on to those empty absentee mail-in ballot envelopes. In case there is a dispute about those individual ballots, they have a paper trail here, just in case something happens. Back there, there is a phone bank here. So, it's basically they have those on staff every day. People that call in, have general comments concerns about the election, they can call and actually talk to an election worker. And over here, this is a process that happens every single day. It's a registration of new voters. Of course, those voters will not be allowed to vote tomorrow, but that's work that happens every day. And then, tomorrow is expected to be a very, very busy day here. This is a work room for the board of elections. They are going to be on staff here. They are in charge of certifying the election. So, two Republicans, two Democrats, and an independent, they will be on hand here to oversee everything that happens tomorrow, and it is going to be a very, very stressful day. We can see the stress on the faces of the election workers, something that I found very fascinating. Erica, there is a Zen den here, so if those that are feeling a little bit overwhelmed by the process that happens tomorrow, they can come here for a brief break. Gwinnett County, an absolute fascinating part of Georgia. It is one of the most diverse counties, if not, the most diverse county in the state. And generally, for local or state elections, it's almost guaranteed to go blue, but that's not the case for U.S. presidential elections, and in fact, in the previous decades, Democrats and Republicans have sort of traded off winning this county. In 2020, Trump, by number, got more votes here than any other county in the state, but still lost this county. If Kamala Harris wants to win Georgia and repeat a Democrat nominee winning here for the first time since '92. That happened here in 2020. If she wants that to happen again, Gwinnett County is going to be instrumental to that victory. Erica?",

A police report cited by a university spokesperson claims the woman was under severe mental pressure and had a mental disorder. However, CNN has not been able to independently establish the circumstances behind the incident. In Iran, women can be subjected to harsh punishment for not wearing the hijab or headscarf in public. In recent years, the Iranian regime has faced backlash for the stringent and often violent enforcement of these regulations by its so-called morality police. In 2022, protests erupted across the globe after 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini was violently arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab incorrectly. She later died while in police custody. Iranian officials claim she suffered a heart attack. This latest incident has once again sparked concern for the safety and freedom of women in Iran.

Look, these are poll to polls in the battleground states. No clear leader in any of them, in any of these battleground states. So, this is razor thin. So, what is the path to victory for each candidate? Well, the Harris campaign will say that their best, most direct path to 270 electoral votes is through the blue wall. If she were to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, she'd be at 270 electoral votes and the next president. But what if Donald Trump repeats his 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, then Harris drops down to 251 and she has to go hunting in the Sun Belt to find some more votes, certainly, if she were able to flip North Carolina from red to blue this time, that would get her knocking on the door to 270 and then maybe Nevada behaves like it has for Democrats in recent cycles, and that would put Harris over the top in that scenario. What about Donald Trump's path? Well, let's reset the map. Seven yellow battleground states, and Donald Trump's most direct path is to hang on to North Carolina. That is the state he won by the narrowest margin four years ago. In fact, it's the only state he won of the seven battleground states. And let's say he flips Georgia back. You'll recall, he famously lost it by just fewer than 12,000 votes. So let's say that ends up back in his column. And let's say he does get that Pennsylvania victory repeated from 2016, that's it. He'll be at 270 electoral votes. He doesn't need any of the rest of the battleground states. But what if Harris does pull it out in Pennsylvania? Then, where does Donald Trump go for the next 19 electoral votes? Well, even if he were to win Nevada and Arizona out west, that still would not get him to 270. He would need at least one of the other remaining so called blue wall states such as Michigan, and that would do the trick and get him over the top at 283.",
