I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, what is happening inside Putin's Russia? Is he losing his grip on power? Is he at odds with his own commanders? And how might his forces fare against the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive. We will get insight from \"Puck's\" Julia Ioffe and Russian journalist in exile Andrei Soldatov. And since China opened up its economy in 1978, it has averaged almost 10 percent growth a year. But are we now at peak China? The economist Keyu Jin weighs in. Also, has humanity gotten, well, dumber thanks to the supercomputers in our pockets that can tell us everything we need to know in an instant? I will talk to the author Simon Winchester about the past, present and future of knowledge. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's attacking the Russian elites and threatening their kids. And that seems to be completely out of line. But at the same time, I think that it's quite interesting that Putin is still -- well, choose to tolerate Prigozhin and I think this is because Putin doesn't have a real system of check and balances.So he needs -- especially with this war, he needs to rely on some completely unorthodox methods to keep his people, the military generals and his elites, if not under control, but at least off balance. Prigozhin, who is happy to play a role of a, well, weak jester, while he is happy to provide Putin with these options, so he's attacking these people, sending a message that, look, you cannot be completely safe and nobody has any guarantee in this new Russian system which is Russian 2023.",

And it was not always, you know, the tight ship that we imagined it to be over here in the West.I do think, though, to Andrei's point, that once Putin started the war and immediately didn't win it on his terms, as we know, he did not take -- he did not take Kyiv in the first week. He did not have a victory parade in Kyiv. He is still fighting for shreds of land in the east. And at this point, he needs anything he can throw at it. And Prigozhin does two things. First, he delivered the only kind of significant territorial win in the last few months. He delivered Bakhmut to Putin. It took him seven, eight, nine months and tens of thousands of lives but he did what the Defense Ministry run by the government could not do. And he also, to Andrei's point, he keeps the Defense Ministry in line. He keeps them kind of on their toes and trying to do better. He is the kind of junkyard dog that keeps the elites in line. The question is what happens if the junkyard dog gets off his chain. He has a large army. He has other sources of income that aren't directly from Putin. All of his work in Africa and the Middle East have permitted him to take various mines, refineries, wells of gas and oil. That give him a separate income stream. So he has -- you know, ironically in a country where Putin was trying to eliminate any kind of dissent, any challenges of power, which he did from the liberal flank, he allowed a guy with an army to start criticizing him which, you know, people like Alexei Navalny, Boris Nemtsov never had.",

The small counteroffensives around Bakhmut.But we're still waiting for the main event, and I think it's anybody's guess. People are trying to be conservative and judicious in their predictions. People think that it will be much more difficult than the fall offensive when Ukraine won back Kharkiv and Kherson.

Everybody I know is on it, a reality TV star told the \"Wall Street Journal.\" It's the drug of choice these days for the one percent, a dermatologist said to \"The New York Times.\"They are talking about semaglutide, the active ingredient in two medications flying off pharmacy shelves in the U.S. right now. The first, Ozempic, came on to the scene in 2017 as a diabetes treatment. But the patients in clinical trials reported losing significant weight. And rather than include the reaction as a side effect, its maker, Novo Nordisk, turned it into lucrative selling point. By 2021, the Danish drugmaker started selling Wegovy, a weight loss specific dose of semaglutide aimed at treating obese and overweight adults. Early results seemed remarkable. Company sponsored studies have indicated that those on Wegovy can expect to lose around 15 percent of their body weight after nearly a year and a half of treatment. And as users celebrate their slimmer waistlines, investors and medical companies are eyeing fat profits. The bank UBS thinks semaglutide could be the biggest drug ever. And some estimates project that Novo Nordisk could sell between $3 to $4 billion worth of it in the United States this year alone. After all, diet and weight loss is big business. Americans spent $76 billion last year alone trying to shed pounds. That is money spent on everything from medical programs to gym memberships to diet soda. But behind all of the fads and follies lies a stark reality. Today, obesity is at an all-time high. More than 40 percent of American adults are obese, and obesity is a major gateway illness leading to complications like diabetes and heart disease. The conditions and complications caused by obesity put huge strains on America's health systems and its economy. With the Milken Institute estimating that in 2018 obesity cost the United States $1.39 trillion or nearly seven percent of that year's GDP. And obesity is not just a problem in the first world. Rates are rising quickly in middle income and poor countries as well. The World Obesity Federation projects that by 2035, nearly half of the adult populations of Mexico, Iran, South Africa and Algeria will all be obese. And so as \"The Economist\" points out, these new obesity drugs could potentially improve the health of billions and also make the world wealthier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
