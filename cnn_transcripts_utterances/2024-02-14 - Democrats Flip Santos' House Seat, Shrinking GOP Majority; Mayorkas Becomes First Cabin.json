It was both anger over Santos and direction of the country were the biggest concerns.And that direction of the country was on both sides. Republicans saying they didn't like where the Democratic Party was going and they didn't like Biden very much, but lots and lots of independents and Democrats coming out and saying they don't like the politics of Donald Trump, they don't like the idea of him coming back, and that's what drove them to the polls.

Listen, Steve Scalise returned from cancer treatment, and that is what allowed House Republicans to essentially eek this out by just one vote. But there were some Republicans who opposed this. You had Congressman Gallagher, Congressman Buck, Congressman McClintock, all Republicans arguing that this amounted to a policy dispute, that Mayorkas didn't engage in public corruption or abusing power, and that this measure was not all that appropriate. Take a listen to how members described why they didn't, they did or did not support this impeachment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Video footage, looking at it here, appears to follow the drone as it approaches the warship and then you see that fiery explosion.

      "sentences": "Well, what the Ukrainians are saying is that essentially they've done a disable, Phil, a third of that fleet. Now, this is, of course, significant because of the asymmetry there was. The Ukrainians simply didn't have a functioning navy in the Black Sea, and they were faced with this very substantial Russian fleet that they've managed now to disable a third of. So, that is significant. Also the way by which they carried out at this attack, I think, is interesting. What you're talking about are these highly mobile jet ski-propelled drones that are actually Ukrainian made, have a very long range, have a very long range, 800 kilometers, and really allow the Ukrainians, and this has been an important shift in their strategy, not only to use homemade weapons, but to target these substantial Russian installations, whether they are on sea or on land, in a much more agile and effective way and in a way that the Russians have a lot of great deal of difficulty countering.So, a number of different takeaways here, including the fact that what we've seen is a shift in the Ukrainian strategy as a result of those very static front lines that we've seen over the course of the last few months to really moving their efforts to the Black Sea. That's important symbolically because you're talking about the Crimean Peninsula, where all this began, of course, back in 2014, but also strategically. Because they believe that if they can undermine Russia's strength in that area, then they might be able to cut off some of their supply lines to those front lines in Ukraine itself. It is extremely strategically important, extremely symbolically important, has been the focus of their efforts over the last few months. What's interesting here is that they've managed to combine all of that to take out what they say is an important target. Now, for the time being, the Kremlin is not commenting on this, but we have seen on the Russian side, some of their military bloggers, speaking to the blow that this represents. And, of course, remember that this is also psychologically an important win for Ukraine again at a time when it needs wins after so many months of very little progress on the frontlines themselves.",

We know that House Democrats will be huddling to see if there's a way forward, but it's entirely unclear whether this will ever actually come up for a vote. I think what's also striking about the president's speech yesterday is the way that he went out against former President Donald Trump. President Biden was particularly irked by Trump's recent comments suggesting he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wants to NATO countries who have not met their obligations. President Biden spoke very bluntly about those comments yesterday, calling them dumb, shameful and un-American. And it comes as President Biden has really ramped up his attacks on the former president. And twice in the last month, Biden has stood here at the White House to portray the Republican Party as simply beholden to Trump.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if he responds in less time than that, maybe even today or tomorrow. I think he wants to make a point here that time is of the essence. And I think we'll hear from the Supreme Court within a week or so of that. I think everyone understands that whatever is going to happen with this case, whether the Supreme Court's going to take it up fully or not, time does matter.And the Supreme Court, generally speaking, has really three options. On one extreme, they can just say, no, we're not taking it, we're out, everything goes back to the trial court, you're unfrozen, have at it. The other extreme is the Supreme Court could say, everything remains frozen, we're going to take this case, we're going to set out a briefing schedule, it's going to be deliberate, it's going to take months. And then there's a middle ground where they could say, okay, trial court, you can resume, but we're going to hear things on an expedited basis. They have a lot of flexibility here. And it's really -- I think anyone who tries to predict what the Supreme Court does next is in for a surprise.",
