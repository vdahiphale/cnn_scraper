It's the endorsement every challenger to Donald Trump wanted. The big question now. Can it help Haley overcome Trump's commanding lead, not just here in New Hampshire, but in every early voting state?I just finished speaking to both Haley and Sununu, right here inside the governor's mansion behind me. That interview is coming up. The first I want to get straight to CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is also here in New Hampshire. Jeff, you are in Newport, where Haley and Sununu are going to be campaigning together this afternoon. What can we expect?",

And he is going to try and repeat what he did in four successful gubernatorial campaigns on her presidential campaign, through his organization, through his sheer popularity and making the case that he believes she's the candidate to turn the page. We got a glimpse of that last night in New Hampshire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got the momentum on our side, but this just gave it a speed bump. So, we are excited about going and going fast. And we're just grateful to (Inaudible) CHRIS CHRISTIE (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What Nikki is been able to do and say, I'm not just going to tell you what not to vote for. I'm going to tell you what I bring to the table. I mean that's what you want in a candidate. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: So, there's no doubt that six weeks from today, we will find out if this endorsement is successful. The governor says that this is a two-person race of course that is getting far ahead of things, other candidates in the race. But Dana, one thing is clear. She's not only getting his name brand, which is a golden name and politics here in New Hampshire, as you well know. She's getting his organization and his work ethic. So, they're going to be campaigning around the state at events like this here behind me. The crowd is just coming in now. They'll be continuing on with her throughout the day. Since you said every one of her rivals would have liked to have the endorsement. She has it. Now the hard work begins for the six final weeks of this campaign. Dana?",

Now to my interview with Nikki Haley and Chris Sununu.I started with a simple question to Governor Sununu:  Why Haley? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH):  Obviously, we have been friends for a long time. And I have -- I, more than probably anybody else in the country, have been able to spend a lot of time with all the three top candidates, Chris, Ron and Nikki. When it comes down to it, Nikki connects. And that's what I was really looking for. It isn't about just the policies. Policy can be easy. It isn't just about background, although the background is unmatched when you look at Ambassador Haley. It's about who's really connecting with folks, listening, earning the trust, right, spending the time. That's how we do it here in New Hampshire. And when I have seen her time and time again, whether it's in a diner, or in someone's living room, or in someone's backyard, not just talking at people -- a lot of people like to do that -- but saying, now, what's on your mind? What are your top priorities? What are your issues? And I get excited about the opportunity to have a president that carries that philosophy into the White House, not just big government solutions. We have seen a lot of even Republicans try big government solutions. I know that's not what this is all about. It has to be about going in with the mind-set of, what's the individual looking for? How do I empower them to create their opportunities? And I just -- it's working, and people are galvanizing. The numbers are moving. It's exciting. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Look, I am just thrilled. I truly am. And I knew that, in order to earn his endorsement, we just needed to work. We just needed to work and show that we were willing to do it. And, I mean, how amazing is it to get the live free or die governor in a time where I think we need a live free or die country? And he's the coolest governor in the country. And so to be able to do this, it's great, and now this partnership. I mean, you can feel the Granite State, the energy that we got with hundreds of people and continuing to see as we move through diners and all this. People get it. And they feel it. And they know the responsibility that they have. And I think we're going to see magic here in the Granite State.",

I was a strong conservative governor that brought an 11 percent unemployment down to 3 percent unemployment, that we went and we moved thousands of people from welfare to work. We reformed education. We did tort reform. We did voter I.D. And then you saw me go to the U.N., and I took the \"Kick me\" sign off of our backs and America was respected again. Everything I have ever done has been strong. It's been economic freedom. It's been individual freedom. It's been making sure that I have made people proud along the way. So, he can say establishment or whatever. I don't think labels matter. I think, at the end of the day, this is, we're fighting to save America. I truly believe that. And we're going to continue to do it.

And things are starting to move.So we're going to do everything we can. Does he have a stronghold in Iowa? Of course he does. Do people support Trump? They do. But it's not about whether you support President Trump. I think President Trump was the right president at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies. But chaos follows him. Rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him. And now is a time where we have a country in disarray and a world on fire. We can't afford four more years of chaos and survive it. We just won't. And I think the people in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina are going to see that. It's a different question to say, do you support President Trump and appreciate what he did, as opposed to, what direction do you want the country to go? That's very different.",

And he said, look, I supported -- just like me and Nikki. We supported the president in 2016. We supported him in 2020. But his thing was inflation. He said, inflation, it's killing my family. I can barely get to work. Something has to be done. And he said, I would support the former president, but he's going to be so distracted. I need someone that can give 120 percent of their time to the inflation crisis, or 120 percent of the time to the Israeli or the Ukrainian crisis, or the international issues that are bearing down on us, 120 percent of the time to the border. He's not going to have it. He's going to have constant distraction. So it's not about whether you support him. It's about, we need a president that gets results. And when you have somebody, as a former governor, with the success she brought -- I mean, let's face it. South Carolina was in tough shape in 2010 when she came on board. Turned that around, made that the envy of the Southern part of the country. And then you add the international experience. It's results- driven. And I think, in New Hampshire, people appreciate, we might have supported the former president before. We appreciate what he's going through. It might be political, but we need results. We're so tired of Washington doing nothing and blaming other people. So, this is the opportunity we have to not just galvanize the Republican Party...",

Where are all the pro-Hamas countries? Where is Qatar? Where is Iran? Where are Turkey? Why aren't they taking the people of Gaza? Because they all know the threats of Iran and the threats of their proxies. But every country deserves to know that they can have a secure border and not have terrorists living on there. So it's going to take Israel a while to figure out how they're going to get the Palestinians to find good leadership. But the Palestinian Authority has not been good to the people at all.

They do represent a new generation. And that is the argument that they are making to voters of all ages.And it really is striking when you talk to voters of all ages. Some of the oldest voters we talked to also are looking for a new generation to turn the page. So that, of course is the central argument here, but so many things to break down in there from abortion politics to foreign policy. But I think when Nikki Haley told you, Dana, that she's never going to be anti-Trump enough for those who don't like the former president, she'll never be pro-Trump enough for those who do. That is really the centerpiece of all of this and the centerpiece of their challenge. Yes, he's very popular, but he has been really railing against the former president for years. So, their challenges to pry away some Trump voters as well as winning over some independent and moderate voters. But as you see people taking their seats here, there is a new level of interest in her. He will accelerate that. The question now is, can they overcome the true giant in this race? And that remains Donald Trump. Dana?",
