In Wisconsin, we had Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin up by one. We call that no clear leader. It is well within the margin of error.

Look how far underwater he is, at minus 17 points.Now, Joe Biden is at minus ten points but Mehmet Oz below Joe Biden, who is no popular man himself. And that seems to be the driving result in the Keystone State. Look in Wisconsin. Our poll, if you look at the net favorability ratings, both Mandela Barnes and Ron Johnson are underwater at minus five and minus five.

And there's been a subpoena issued for Senator Graham and he does not want to have to testify. So, lower courts have said he does, but he went to the Supreme Court and what Justice Thomas did was just freeze things temporarily because the court has heard from Senator Graham trying to have the Supreme Court intervene but it's Clarence Thomas has given the Fulton County prosecutor legal team until Thursday to respond to that.

That would be number one for us.The other thing he's got to do is be pretty delicate, I think, about the way he handles Fetterman, because Oz does have persistent image issues. And you don't want to come off looking like a jerk or bully in this system that's going to be, frankly, a little weird for what we're used to seeing in debates on these races.

So, if he does pretty well, he will sort of have the upper hand on expectations. Issues, I think, is the thing that we're talking about the least but it could be most important. Crime has been this very successful message for Republicans to take against Democrats in closing weeks and some of Fetterman's positions, some of his alignments kind of laid over the crime concerns, especially in Philadelphia, could be a little problematic. But I think Scott is right. Oz is a doctor, and you want a doctor being a patient advocate. If he comes across as mean when we've had very good education in the last few weeks, doctors telling us that auditory processing issues are not cognitive impairment, if Oz talks about that in a sympathetic way, he may win public sentiment.

You know Dr. Oz, that's where the campaign has reeled in Fetterman. They're going to throw up macro crime issues but also these micro issues. What did you do in your own record? And so having to absorb that and then rebut it and knowing one false move here on crime, it could be closing ad of the Oz campaign, if you double down, say, on something that's proven to be unpopular on that front.

With this particular individual, what happens is during the investigation as the DPS and Texas rangers are doing this investigation of the police response, they questioned him about his actions that day.

And what they found was that he basically was just on his cell phone for almost the entire time that he was on-scene talking to supervisors and his bosses at DPS, he claims trying to coordinate some kind of response. But in all of this, while all of this is happening, there are kids calling. There's a kid calling 911 to say they're inside the classroom. And at one point, you can hear gunshots on body camera footage while he's in the hallway. And he's basically offering to negotiate still at that point with the gunman.
