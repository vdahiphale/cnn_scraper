I should say, you mentioned that Rafah border crossing, that crucial crossing between Gaza and Egypt that remains closed, the Egyptian foreign minister just moments ago saying there is no progress in any efforts to open up that border, which is so crucial for anybody getting out, but most importantly for humanitarian aid getting in, which would be at the very least what is so desperately needed there. But that is the very latest that we're hearing on the ground here. As, of course, you're in this moment of pause and waiting again, an incredibly quiet and anxious country waiting for the go.

There is only so long you can wait. The real question had been when Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state came back again today, right? Nobody knew that was going to happen until yesterday. He was here at the end of last week meeting with the prime minister. So, the question was, well, why was he returning? Was that perhaps to influence Prime Minister Netanyahu on what he would do in Gaza or when he would go to try to slow it down? Majority leader Chuck Schumer was here yesterday with a bipartisan senatorial delegation, which included Senator Romney. And he said, no, he didn't think that was the reason, that the reason was to keep negotiations on track, which at least if you look at in terms of the border crossing itself, this crucial, very specific thing, there's been negotiations on, there has been no progress as of yet, no progress as of yet. And that, of course, is separate from what we now know to be 199 confirmed hostages being held in Gaza. We don't know the state of their injuries alive, dead, where they're held, anything, but that obviously is the other crucial piece of this. And all of this coming in the context of what is a mass evacuation of people from Israel itself, Gaza obviously with 2 million people and 1 million supposedly moving to the south of Gaza, nowhere to go from there. But here in Israel, Americans being given a means of egress to get out of a country that doesn't have many borders that you can get out of, and an airport where international airlines are not at all or very rarely even serving it. CNN's Sara Sidner is in Haifa, Israel, speaking to American families boarding a ship. Sara, because that's the way that the U.S. is doing this, essentially a military cruise ship, but something that a lot of Americans don't see when you hear about the power of the U.S. military. We don't often see what you're looking at, but that is an incredible ship, and that is being used for evacuation.",

It can carry about 2,000-plus passengers.What is interesting today is we know that there were 20,000 Americans that contacted the State Department, contacted their embassy, who were here in Israel. Not all of them wanted to leave, but they were trying to get information as to whether they could leave or any information from the State Department to make sure that they can stay safe, whether in this country or in order to get out. Very, very hard to get out, very few flights are going. So, this was one of the ways the State Department decided to try and get Americans out of Israel who wanted to leave. What we found interesting today is the numbers look very small compared to the number of people that can get on this ship. And, by the way, this is not free for Americans. Americans will have to pay the government back. They will get a bill of some sort. We are told by the passengers that that is what they were told. But for now, they're able to get on this boat. What we are mostly seeing is families with children and often families with several children who just feel that this is the best thing for their families and especially for the kids who have been quite frightened by this war. Listen to one family's journey as they made it here to get on this boat, by the way, that will take ten hours to get to Cyprus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We should be here to help out in any way possible.So, it is an interesting conundrum for families who are trying to figure out whether to stay or go. A lot of people, obviously, they're U.S. citizens, but they live here in Israel. And those families seem to have the most conflict about what it is they should do.

And in Athens, you know, US commercial carriers, Delta, United are picking up a lot of capacity to get those Americans home. Sara, you know, where you are, what is the feeling? I mean, it is such a small country, right? The distances between where you are, I are, any borders, I mean, it's all incredibly small relative to the American sense of consciousness.

I think, you know, when we have all reported from Ukraine, you get a siren, right? Obviously, those missiles are coming from very far away, so you have time. There's less anxiety when a siren goes off. There's also the possibility that that missile or plane could be dropping that in a very wide swath of space. That is not the case here, right? When you have sirens go off here, it's because they know it's a very tiny space where that rocket could land.So, the other night up here, you know, we did have, we've had plenty of explosions here, but the sirens went off. The former Israeli prime minister was with me. You know, his security detail had found a place, you know, where he would go and sort of run down two flights of stairs. Because when you get the siren, it means the risk is real. People here take it seriously. They do run for cover. There isn't the sense of, well, it happens so often and it's not a real risk, so we're just going to continue with our daily lives. That does not happen here. And that is a very different feeling than we experience in Ukraine, and it's because of the proximity of the missiles and also because of the specificity of the Iron Dome's ability to say what space is actually at risk from being hit by that incoming rocket.",

To that point, you know, the proximity here, the density particularly as it appears Israel is about to launch one of the more significant urban warfare campaigns that we've seen in a long period of time. Intelligence has to be critical in this moment right. How good is the IDF's intelligence?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, they're gaining, Phil. That's the only thing you can say. They lost attention, they lost focus, that's pretty obvious, on Gaza over the last couple of years They've seen it as a political movement. They haven't paid as much attention to it. So, whenever you take your eye off the ball even slightly, and I'm saying it may have been just slightly You lose some intelligence factor when you have things like hostages and the potential to strike targets or even a ground invasion or a ground incursion, you have to have intelligence to drive your operation to tell you where to go, what to target, what to see.

There's only one way in and one way out. And then once you get in there, you're curving around, you're going different routes, it breaks off, and you can't resupply them.So, you have to be carrying your ammunition and all your equipment on your back when you go into here. And that makes it even tougher because these things are tight. Imagine yourself going through this with a pack on with a lot of stuff. But then there's just the requirement for light, for night vision devices, for the ability to know where the enemy is. And, again, when you're targeting or when you're gaining intelligence above ground, you can have different intelligence drones or overhead platforms saying, here's where the enemy is. You can't do that underground. It's very difficult to do. So, it all just lends more complexity to the battlefield.",

It has to support Israel's right to self-defense, but it wants to make sure, if it's at all possible, to keep it within certain parameters.Also, you know, the United States is implicated. It is involved because 29 at least of its citizens have been killed and there are apparently potentially Israeli-American hostages. So, the U.S. is absolutely involved. But some people are cautioning. You know, the U.S. was asked, would they put boots on the ground, right, in that 60 Minutes? And Biden said, I don't think it's necessary. The U.S. is sending strike forces to the sea around Gaza and around Israel. What for? Is that to cover? Is that for covering fire? What is it for? And just go back all the way to 1983 when the U.S. sent warships outside Lebanon and in support of Israel was involved in that war. And it had a terrible, terrible backlash against the United States, massive killings at the U.S. military barracks in Beirut and on and on and on. It was the beginning of really serious anti-American backlash in that part of the world. So, that has to be considered as well.",

Of course, John Kirby had left it on the table that when it comes to U.S. hostages, we're not going to take anything off the table as to whether you would need any kind of U.S. military power involved in that in Gaza.Now, not taking it off the table isn't the same thing as saying you're going to do it. But, nonetheless, there is still that uncertainty, right? You have Americans being held hostage. And that is a whole new thing here.",

It's only on the ground that you can get to those hostages. You already had a discussion about the parameters and the dangers of that. And the question now is -- truly, the question is, if it's true that some of those hostages have already been killed in airstrikes, and we haven't had confirmation, but that's what Hamas has said, is Israel's first priority to save the hostages or is -- and I'm talking about in a ground incursion, or is it to decimate Hamas around Gaza City and in the north of Gaza? And that is a question that we don't know the answer to yet.",
