It's RFK Jr.'s turn to pound the congressional marvel as Donald Trump's pick for health secretary tries to convince key Republican senators to support his nomination, despite conflicting views on one of the most important issues to the GOP abortion.Plus, making it official. We'll take you to state capitals across the country as presidential electors cast their votes this hour to formalize Donald Trump's victory. And another community is in mourning, after a 15-year-old girl opened fire in her Wisconsin school. I'll talk to a survivor of the school massacre in Parkland, Florida who now wants to be vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start on Capitol Hill, where RFK Jr. is meeting with GOP senators for a second day. And answering questions about his views on vaccine safety, views debunked by scientific studies, but he's also talking about abortion rights, an issue on which the man from a democratic Kennedy dynasty has taken polar opposite views from Republicans whose votes he needs. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. What's happened so far, Manu?",

And those allies have been emerging from those meetings, say that they are on board with Kennedy. Kennedy has tried to alleviate concerns about his position on abortion.In fact, telling these Republican senators that he would be in line with Donald Trump's position on abortion. Now he's also field of questions about the issue of vaccines. One of his advisers, his attorneys have tried to push for to revoke the authorization the polio vaccine. He has told Republican senators that he does not support revoking the authorization of the polio vaccine. And there's a question about the issue about vaccines linked to autism. That is something, of course, that has been debunked, but it's something that Kennedy has suggested publicly before, that he believes that exists. In my conversations with senators, he has not been explicitly making that link, but he has been saying that there's a rise of autism. He wants to understand why. He's also said that he would question vaccine safety and also question the science. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): What he wants with vaccines is, which is, what I believe in, is transparency.

And if he doesn't keep it to three, that will be enough to get the job as health and human services secretary.The most significant concern we have heard so far is from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, himself a childhood polio survivor, raising concerns about those efforts to revoke the polio authorization. Perhaps one reason why Kennedy came out and said, one thing he has been saying in the hallways, he does support the polio vaccine, perhaps to alleviate that concern from McConnell. Dana?",

They've known from the moment of him naming him, that this was going to be one of the issues again, due to the map that Manu pointed out about Republicans, that they were going to have to work through here. And the line they've come up with, which you just heard Senator Markwayne Mullin repeat there, which Kennedy is saying in all of his meetings, is, this isn't about my personal views on this issue of abortion. This is about Donald Trump's agenda. I serve at his pleasure. I am not going to get in the way of his pursuing his policy preferences as it comes to abortion issue.",

Even federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers does not give Kennedy pause. This was a quote from the article. Everybody should have access to good medical care.

And these are years and years of comments that he has made and interviews on television. I mean, they know that these clips exist.So instead, the real motive here, and what they're trying to get him to do, is to convince the Republican senators that he has no interest in touching the issue of abortion from what Donald Trump wants it to be. So, if Donald Trump has said, the issue should reside with the states that Kennedy will respect that. Because again, there is no back tracking here for Kennedy. He can't undo the years of what he has said from a pro-choice standpoint. But instead, what they'd like him to do is focus on the fact that he can say, I am here with Donald Trump, and I am doing what he wants me to do. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: And listen. I mean, I think one of the things you see from RFK is he has this tremendous support in MEGA world, but he also has this mix of ideological support as well from people who are liberals, moms who are concerned about preservatives in their kids' food, some people who like raw milk, milk for instance. And so, if you look at the nominees who are going to face a lot of questions, RFK is certainly on that list, but he's also on the list of sort of Donald Trump's favorites, right? And the people he feels like he wants to go to the mat for, he was a big star. If you think about the campaign, his decision to back Donald Trump was crucial. He was out there stumping for Donald Trump, this whole make America healthy again. So, we'll see what happens. But I think in the end, as much as somebody like RFK, even somebody like Tulsi Gabbard, former Democrats, they likely are probably going to get support from these Republicans who say this is Donald Trump's choice.",

So, his lesson here is not to give in to -- you know, I mean Mike Pence, his former vice president.You know, after the 22 midterms, when Donald Trump sort of blamed Dobbs as a reason for losing in the messaging over -- you know, Mike Pence would come out and rail against that with the nomination of RFK Jr. Mike Pence. And again, I'm using Mike Pence as a figure that is in that wing of the party, lots of pro-life folks would come out.

He did not have the same welcoming that he had this time around.When I talked to some of his advisers, and we talked about the fact that he won Time Person of the Year. He even feels like this time around was different, like he actually won it. The same way that he feels about the election, which is that he won the popular vote as well as the electoral college. And he feels like he actually won this time, and that's why people are coming to him. But what's been so interesting talking to the people around him in this moment is just what it is that he's saying behind the scenes. Because that you just saw in that press conference is a lot of what he says to people around him, this kind of marvel and awe that all of these people want to meet with him and talk to him, and he's taking it in, and he's taking advantage of it.",

The second time is sweeter for Donald Trump, and you see lots of things going his way. His approval rating is high. The transition ratings, which you talked about last week, are higher than they were last week. So, we'll see what happens when he gets to Congress, when he goes through these confirmation hearings that I think are going to be fairly bruising for some of -- some of these picks and tries to muscle his agenda through a very narrow House and then a Senate that he has much wider margins on.

Let's start with Arizona. Donald Trump won big. There we go. Donald Trump won big over 5 percent, five and a half percent.

That doesn't take a thing away from Donald Trump's decisive victory, sweeping all seven states. And as Kristen alluded to earlier, also winning the national popular vote, just adding to the decisive nature of his victory. You mentioned the electoral college totals. One thing to watch for. I'm just curious today, as you see the tally going up on the side, will those totals look like that when all these votes are recordable. There be some faithless elector that votes for somebody else and screws up our math as we have to record the history of this -- well, we shall see. I love seeing this process. I think it's great. I love that it's different than four years ago. We see in polling also Republicans now are much more likely to say, they think the election results were legitimate. Donald Trump fondly and often says, it's because his victory was too big to rig this time. I hope that this will be an enduring thing going forward, and that the Republican Party doesn't -- should it lose an election going forward, revert back to denying election results.
