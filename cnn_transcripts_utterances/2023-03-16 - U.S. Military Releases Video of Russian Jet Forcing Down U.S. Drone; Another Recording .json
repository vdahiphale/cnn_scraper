As you see, a Russian fighter jet here approaching a U.S. drone, that's where the camera is. U.S. officials say that is when it dumped fuel on to the drone. Those were several steps that they were taken. U.S. officials have speculated about maybe trying to disable some of the sensors that were on that drone. Of course, what this also confirms and what a senior administration official has just told our colleague, M.J. Lee, is that this does confirm there was physical contact between that Russian fighter jet and the U.S. drone. Of course, it clipped the propeller. That is why U.S. officials later had to force that drone down. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is live at the Pentagon as this video has just been released.

It is intentional if you're dumping fuel on it. But correct me if I'm wrong, probably not the physical contact because that puts the pilots in that Russian jet in extreme danger. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  You're right, Don. That's exactly it. The Russian pilots were clearly told, based on Natasha's reporting and what we're seeing with our own eyes right now, do harass this drone. They were told to probably kind of bring it down. He got a little bit too close, the Russian pilot did, and that was what when you started seeing the propeller in the after picture. It actually shows a bent blade.

It was over international waters, over international airspace and it was actually working on a reconnaissance mission, which is allowed by international law.

This is not the kind of information we usually get particularly before there has been any sort of indictment. We know this grand jury has recommended multiple indictments.

And the fact that they're in consistent communication with the regulators and administration for the last week, you know, I think I have pretty good understanding of how they responded. I think they responded well. But we have to get to the bottom of why this happened, sort of the who, what, when, where why and how of this.
