Alejandro Mayorkas as hope for a border security bill, at least in a bipartisan fashion, in Congress is fading fast. Senate Republicans debating whether to shelve an emerging deal amid staunch opposition from former President Donald Trump. Now, even if a deal manages to make its way out of the Senate, Speaker Mike Johnson and Republicans have declared it all but dead on arrival in the House. And Johnson bristled at the suggestion that Trump and his political aspirations have anything to do with that GOP opposition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Congressman, I appreciate your time this morning.I know there's an old adage on the Hill -- those who actually know whip counts don't actually talk about them and those who do talk about them don't actually know. But when it comes to impeachment, do you think your conference will be lined up to move forward on that on the House floor? REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN):  Well, the process was pretty heavy last night. Personally, I believe it's appropriate. It's been a year-long process, very thoughtful and detailed. And you've got a -- you've got the head of Homeland Security who is charged legally with securing our southern border. And Phil, he's not only failed to do that, he's willfully disobeyed existing law which requires that you detain certain individuals. And instead, he's created this mass catch-and-release program, which has resulted in things like -- In my home state, about a year ago, they had an individual on the terrorist watchlist come across the border. They had him and they released him into the country. He was here for a year before he was picked up. He's a member of Al-Shabab -- the terrorist group Al- Shabab.",
