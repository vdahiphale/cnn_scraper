      "sentences": "The horror of war takes a dramatic turn that suddenly changes the American president's trip to a dangerous and unpredictable war zone. That's tonight on Newsnight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. We begin with another tipping point in an already volatile crisis in the Middle East. Hundreds are reported dead after a hospital was bombed in Gaza. The number of casualties is not yet clear and neither is responsibility. Hamas and Palestinian officials accuse Israel of carrying out an airstrike. The Israelis, though, say that they have evidence to prove that it was a misfired rocket from a terror group. I'm going to take a moment to show you the video from the scene. It is extremely graphic, but it's important to see the reality on the ground. As fingers point, what's clear is that innocent civilians and children, you saw them there, are caught in this crossfire of a conflict that we have to remind you began with a devastating attack on Israelis. Now, again, the images that I'm about to show you of this scene at that hospital today are extremely graphic. A toddler here, bloodied, being carried in a man's arms, a group of adults urgently caring for someone on the ground behind him, another little boy, also bloodied in bandages, being rushed through the crowd, seeking help. A teenager, wounded, blood splattered along the walls behind him. It's, of course, unclear if that blood belongs to him. And young girls traumatized in the middle of a chaotic triage scene, one with Minnie Mouse on her T- shirt. President Biden tonight says that he is outraged by these scenes. He is right now on his way to Israel for a high-stakes trip in the middle of this war. But due to this hospital strike, his plans are now falling apart. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has canceled his meeting with Biden and Jordan has as well. The next few minutes and hours will be critical in what may be another turning point for this region. My CNN colleagues are standing by all around the world in Israel, in Jordan, one of the places where protests are erupting tonight and at the White House. I want to start first, though, with CNN's Anderson Cooper who is on the ground in Tel Aviv. Anderson, we're seeing this horrific video tonight of that deadly hospital blast. Hundreds of people are believed to be dead, countless others injured. What do we know about what happened there and what are Israeli officials saying tonight?",

Our Oren Liebermann was reporting earlier to U.S. intelligence. More evidence is supposed to be presented to President Biden, I believe, when he gets here on the ground.

But that hospital, as we saw in those images, was chalk-full. What do we know? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, first of all, it's in the center of the most populous area of Gaza, right in the middle of Gaza City, the northernmost city. It's also, unfortunately, a place where we know Hamas has had headquarters underground in those tunnels we've been talking about for so long. The initial strike has been horrific, the injuries, the deaths that are involved with it. But what we don't know yet, Abby, is what happened. And, immediately, the information went out on the Arab street. We're seeing the results, the strategic results in several countries that has already dismantled, potentially, President Biden's trip to try and bring a little bit of calm to the region, but it's already exploded.

The trip is changing dramatically at this hour as leaders drop out as tensions rise.I want to bring in CNN's Senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee over at the White House for us tonight. M.J., we're already seeing the implications from this blast, including part of President Biden's trip to Jordan just being canceled. What impact are you hearing this is going to have on the diplomatic objectives that he has going into this trip? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, first of all, Abby, the president was traveling to a war zone. He and his advisers were very aware, of course, of what a volatile situation they were heading into, that events on the ground could shift very quickly. But we heard the president saying in a statement earlier this evening that he is directing his national security team to continue gathering information about that hospital blast. And we also heard National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby telling reporters on Air Force One en route to Israel that they are at least taking into account Israel's staunch denials that they were involved, that they were responsible for that deadly blast. But you are absolutely right that this event has had the effect of really altering the president's trip to the region even before he had arrived there. The cancelation of this summit of President Biden and Arab leaders, that is a huge setback for this administration because what it effectively means is that the president is no longer going to be meeting in person, face-to-face with some of these key Arab leaders. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, he is not going to be seeing him in person. He's certainly not going to be seeing the president of Egypt. And we know from our reporting over the last several days just how much emphasis the president himself had placed in trying to meet with these leaders and talk to these leaders face- to-face to talk about these incredibly sensitive and complicated issues. And I think, Abby, what this hospital blast has also done is very much sort of clarified what some of the president's top priorities are heading into this trip. For one, there's obviously the issue of trying to minimize the civilian casualties. Very interesting that Kirby said to reporters on Air Force One that the president planned to ask some tough questions to his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And we know that he has been urging the prime minister, both in private but also in his public statements, that it is incredibly important that the Israelis adhere year to the rules of war and also just the urgency of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. Now, we have a situation where there are hundreds and hundreds of people desperately needing medical help when this was already a community that wasn't able to access basic necessities like food, like water, like electricity. So, just getting this vivid and just awful visual, as the president is headed to the region, of how much is at stake and the fact that civilians are getting caught in the crossfire as the president really hopes to make some progress on these top priorities, Abby.",

But, Rula, I do want to start with you. This is a really tricky situation, but one that we should all be prepared for, right? It's going to happen again, where we don't know what happened and we may not know for some time.

The demonstrations until now have been modest in size, that's where we left off you and I on Friday, I said watch these demonstrations. And now they don't want to put down these demonstrations of their own people. And so now this is all loose. It has been loosened, unleashed by what happened today, whoever the responsibility is, but already there was a building humanitarian catastrophe visible to anyone of any political belief could watch on television and see this land, this tight landmass with 2 million people and nowhere to go.

Depending on what you believe, if it was a rocket that went awry, if the rocket motor failed, and there are indicators that the Israelis have evidence of that. The rocket would travel a little bit further and then not have any kind of guidance system, so it just drops out of the sky. And that happens a lot with some of the Iranian rockets that Hamas has been firing. If it was an Israeli bomb, it was probably a precision weapon, so it would have struck the target it hit at and not at a parking lot beside it.

At first, I want to just get your reaction to what we just played from Congresswoman Stefanik. His past wrestling coach credentials being cited in a nominating speech on the House floor.",

      "sentences": "Well, thanks for having me, Abby. The funny thing is that when people always call Jim Jordan a fighter, and I always wonder who he's fighting for, because he had a real opportunity to fight for us and the people that he coached and the people that he recruited at the Ohio State.And all he's done is just turned his back on us. So, I don't know what the fighter thing is. I know he used to be a fighter. I know he used to be a good wrestler, but he's not a good fighter for anyone else that I know of.",

Why do you believe that he is not the right person to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives?Well, all I know is he's just a different person. I was a tryout walk- on at the Ohio State, and he was the guy who kind of did well this tournament. He said, I'm going to talk to the head coach for you. I'm going to give you an opportunity. And they gave me an opportunity to get onto the team. I was a walk-on. And he's changed since. He was -- I understood his Christian values at the time. I understood his conservative values, and I was on a different end of the spectrum with him, but we still could agree to disagree. We could talk about things. We could debate things. And he's lost that. Like he -- and I don't know where that's come from. But it's pretty sad because all he has become is divisive. And it shows with our lawsuit and our group because he's done nothing but help divide our group as well from teammates who, you know, haven't come forward or people who, you know, still believe that he's a fighter or they don't want to turn on him. And it's just quite unfortunate what he's become.",

It's tough here because there's people who believe in him and there's people who believe in the BSA spewing and how he presents himself.And you know, I guess if you want to fool people and if that's what they do up on the Hill, he's, you know, I guess that's what he's good at. Like I said, it's just disappointing because he still has an opportunity to do right by us. He has an opportunity to help us out, to help us remedy this thing with Ohio State, and he chooses not to do it with hundreds of athletes that he was associated with that as a coach you're just supposed to help protect and mentor into manhood.
