Plus, newly-revealed emails and audio recordings showing how team Trump made a chaotic and fringy push to overturn the 2020 election just hours before January 6th. It is a CNN exclusive. And five years in Russian captivity. CNN has new exclusive audio of American Paul Whelan making a desperate plea from behind bars -- a plea directly to President Biden. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. Breaking news tonight, Donald Trump kicked off another state's 2024 ballot. Maine's Democratic secretary of state just moments ago issue a decision which bars Trump from that state's ballot. In her decision, she cites the 14th Amendment insurrection ban. The decision can be appealed in state court, an appeal that is almost guaranteed given Trump's legal team had already demanded that Maine secretary of state recuse yourself from the matter, pointing specifically to tweets she wrote, saying Trump had engaged in insurrection and should have been impeached. Trump's attorneys say she showed biased by prejudging the matter. This Maine ruling, of course, follows a similar decision in Colorado. It's at odds, though, with other decisions in Michigan, Minnesota, Arizona, and New Hampshire. The Colorado Republican Party saying it has asked the Supreme Court to overturn that Colorado ruling. Many legal experts expect that Supreme Court will settle this issue for the entire country. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT with more on this breaking news for us tonight. So, Paula, I know we're all doing through this right now. What more are you learning? What do you see here in this decision? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Erica, Maine now becomes the second state after Colorado to ban Trump from the ballot based on Section Three of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. And let's break down exactly what that says. Under Section Three, it holds that officeholders who engage in an insurrection are barred from future -- ever holding office in the future. But while it lays out some specific offices, it does not specifically mention the president or the presidency. So, we have seen this question of Trump's eligibility based on the 14th Amendment litigated across multiple states with different outcomes. Again, this has been litigated across half a dozen states. But Maine and Colorado are the only ones that have concluded he should be removed. Other states for various regions have opted not to remove him. Some of those decisions are procedural. Initially, even Colorado said, look, it doesn't specifically say the president, so this should not be applied to him even though that state in a trial found he engaged in insurrection. But that state's Supreme Court overturned that lower court ruling and that has been appealed, at least by the Republican Party of Colorado to the Supreme Court. And, Erica, when you have a state split like this over a key constitutional question, that is really the right time for that Supreme Court to weigh in. Though they haven't been asked, again, by the Republican Party of Colorado, former President Trump has not yet filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in Colorado. It's too soon to do that in Maine, but we expect Hillary appeal in the state as well. Now, we're waiting to see if that Supreme Court wants to weigh in on this issue. But it would be something that would be beneficial for all parties involved here to get clarity from the Supreme Court because we've seen in states like Minnesota and Michigan, even though they've said, look, we're not going to ban him from the primary ballot, they left the door open. This whole issue could be relegated for the general election. So, this issue right for Supreme Court review. We are waiting to see if they weigh in, and this Maine decision also on hold until that Supreme Court reveals if they're going to step in and offer some clarity or not.",

I do want to bring in, though, Ethan Strimling, who's one of the main residents who challenged Trump's eligibility for the state ballots. He's also a former Democratic state senator. [19:05:02] Ethan is with me on the phone tonight. I appreciate you being with us. So, first of all, just your reaction to this decision from the secretary of state? ETHAN STRIMLING (D), FORMER PORTLAND, MAINE MAYOR (via telephone): It's a big day for democracy, a good day for our Constitution. You know, the law in the United States should apply to everybody, no matter what position you hold or held, and our secretary of state today, after clear, objective deliberation made the right call.

And now, there is the judicial body in Maine that oversees our election, our secretary of state, that three different racial bodies. Two of them have now determined that the 14th Amendment clearly applies to the former president.So I feel like, you know, our courts will recognize those and if anybody who watched this saw that it was an insurrection and saw his involvement in it. And if you read the 14th Amendment, it's absurd to imagine that the 14th Amendment would apply to every elected official in the country but the highest officer. So, I feel like I haven't read all the details of this decision yet, it just came down. But from what I hear from our attorneys, people feel very good about that decision, well-reasoned, and well thought through.",

Number one, again, as you mentioned, two courts have deemed that he incited an insurrection and now one of our constitutional officers in Maine, the highest officer that oversees our election, has deemed the same thing. So, three bodies have now deemed he was an insurrectionist. So it'sfalse to sort of claim he's never been charged with that and found, in essence, guilty of that. Yes, there has not been a criminal charge around it. But -- doing some research around the 14th amendment, there was no crime for insurrection that was on the books back in 1868 when it was passed. I understood what insurrection was, you didn't have to have it on the books. And they didn't charge any of the Confederates with it. And yet, Jefferson Davis obviously and other Confederates were not allowed to hold office. So I think those arguments are pretty weak in the end. Our Constitution is clear. You cannot violate our Constitution, and then violate your oath and then run for office. That piece should be held I think no matter what.",

But at this point it's unclear how prominently it will factor in any eventual trial. We know that case is currently on hold while the former president appeals on some of the larger constitutional issues. Now, Ken Chesebro is an unindicted coconspirator in the federal case. And our colleagues have learned he and his lawyer actually reached out to the special counsel back in October before he entered a guilty plea in the Georgia case. But they haven't heard back. Smith basically left him on read. I mean, he has not responded and it's unclear, Erica, if that means they don't want to use him as a witness, if they think there are credibility issues, or if they're just kind of putting the coconspirators to the side and focusing solely on Trump. But I want to remind you, he's also -- Chesebro is also a key cooperator in other states. He's entered a guilty plea in Georgia. He's also spoken with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.",

Karen, we're going to get to all of the new -- we've got a lot of new tonight. Let's really quickly though if we could talk about Maine for a moment. What do you make of this decision, Karen, by the secretary of state saying that Donald Trump cannot be on the ballot there? KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  So, in order to run for president, you have to be qualified under the Constitution of the United States. And there's many different requirements to be qualified to run for office. You have to be at least 35 years old, you have to have lived in that United States for at least 14 years. You have to be a natural born citizen. If you recall, Trump tried to claim that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And another example is you can also not run for more than two terms. And if, we're talking about any of those qualifications, right, if it ever came out that Donald Trump wasn't born in the United States, or if he had served two terms in office, we wouldn't be having these discussions about whether or not he should be on a ballot. So really this boils down to because the 14th Amendment specifically addresses this issue about if you have engaged in an insurrection, and violated the Constitution, if you can be -- if you can -- if you are qualified to run. I think this just really boils down to whether or not, two things, whether or not it applies to the president, and I think that's one of the issues that Supreme Court is going to have to settle. And what type of process has to happen in order to find you, like a due process, right? You have to be convicted, you have to be found to be -- what is it? Because there is no doubt, if he did engage in an insurrection, that that disqualifies you from running for office. So it's just interesting that this has been treated so differently from these other really objective factors.",

He's in trouble wherever this is legitimately raised and addressed.So, yes, the Supreme Court is going to have to weigh in on it. I want to say those strict constructionists and originalist get around that language. How are they going to do it? I don't know. It looks so applicable, Erica.

That is how he will try to push this off and blame others.But I think this scramble to get these fake elector ballots, the fact they were going to go to such great lengths to charter a plane if they had to, to get this to Mike Pence, it just really goes to show the desperation and what was going on at that time around this. But I think it's interesting that Jack Smith has not taken Ken Chesebro up on his request to cooperate with him and that he doesn't seem to be interested to hear what he has to say. If you remember, Ken Chesebro's apology letter in Georgia, we won't even call at that, is basically not an apology letter. He basically regrets doing it, we just kind of what he's saying here, too, right? He regrets it because he's being thrown under the bus. So, until he comes and says, Donald Trump knew he lost the election. We were doing this anyway to try to steal the election from the country.

I know Nikki Haley very well.We're both from Bamberg County, a small county that is probably 15,000 people total. We set beside each other. Our desks were beside each other in the state house. We served together. I remember in 2010 when she gave a very similar answer. So, to say this with some type of fondling, just in this moment, that not the case. I would actually say Nikki Haley is immensely talented. I've said that time and time again. I think she is one of the most talented politicos in the entire country. The problem Nikki Haley has is that she oftentimes doesn't stand for much. And when that light shines bright, you can see that. Let me just also go back and say one more thing, just -- I have to say this because my good friend Jonah say it. Nikki Haley did not take down the Confederate flag. That also was something part of her bravado, part of her resume. Nine people died in a church, including one of my good friends, Clemente Pinkney. Nikki Haley takes credit for that, but in order to take credit for that, then in the other breath say she does not necessarily understand this was a mistake, because we know that in 2010 when she was running for governor, she said the same thing.

And tonight, of course, the Trump campaign is seizing on that and attacking her personally, accusing her of, quote, trying to interfere in the 2024 election. That is the argument that they have made for pretty much all of former President Trump's legal troubles. But, Erica, at the core of this case, one of the questions that has been appealed to the Supreme Court is whether state officials have the authority to remove people from ballots. The first question is, of course, if the 14th Amendment, Section Three of that amendment applies to presidents. Another question is, well, if it does, do state officials have the power to enforce that or is it up to Congress? And then another question that has been posed by the Republican Party of Colorado to the Supreme Court, is whether you are depriving a political party of their First Amendment right if you remove someone?

And they've been meeting with members of the Iranian guards.And that has been a sort of tendency. We've seen started in February of this year, and it has continued until September. And then we see that members of this unit, of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence, also were absent from Russia exactly at the time of the attacks on Israel. So, we are looking and where exactly they went but it seemed -- what we see at the moment is a very strange preference of Russian intelligence officers to spend time in Iran, long stretches of time, shortage of time, consistent with training for example.
