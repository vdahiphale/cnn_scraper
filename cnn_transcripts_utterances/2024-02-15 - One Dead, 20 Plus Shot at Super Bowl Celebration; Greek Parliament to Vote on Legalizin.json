In just a few hours' time, Greece's parliament will take up a landmark vote to legalize same-sex civil marriages. The bill is expected to pass, and if it does, it will make Greece the first majority-orthodox Christian country to give LGBTQ couples the same rights that heterosexual couples already enjoy.

      "sentences": "We're waiting for the bill to pass, but it's going to be a difficult one because it's been an issue that has been pivoting the country for a long time now.On the one hand, you have the activists who have been waiting a long time to see this right, as they call it, be voted in for them to have equality in marriage, something that the Greek Prime Minister has now also supported and put forward. But he has a lot of opposition within his own party, even. And from what we understand, the battle in parliament is going to be very tough. You will be able to get it voted in, but you will have to do so with the help of the opposition, of the opposition leftist parties. You have to understand that Greece is a southern country, a Mediterranean country, a more traditional country than most in Europe in many ways. And this is what we've been seeing in polls so far in people's response to the issue. So while the majority have said yes to same-sex marriage, basically a step up from civil partnerships that Greece had approved 10 years ago, there's a lot of debate on what to do about parenthood, what to do about abortion. These are all issues that have been part of this legislation. And if we understand that if this bill does go through, it will allow same-sex couples to adopt. It will give them full parenthood rights. This is something that the Greek Orthodox Church in a country that's predominantly Christian, it's over 80% Christian has been proposing very strongly. There have been demonstrations in relation to this. Both the clergy, members of the public have come very much all around where I am now, just here in outside parliament. Five days ago, we had a big demonstration. Today, on the other hand, we expect the activists to be here to support the bill and to hope that it gets through. Now, if this bill goes through, it will be the first Orthodox majority country that will see such a bill. This is very significant for human rights in Greece, for the region, and it's something activists here have been waiting for -- for a long time.",
