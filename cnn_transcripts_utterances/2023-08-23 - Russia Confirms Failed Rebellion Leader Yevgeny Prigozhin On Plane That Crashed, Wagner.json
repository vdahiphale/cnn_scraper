      "sentences": "Tonight on 360And the mercenary leader who dared challenge Vladimir Putin, Yevgeny Prigozhin apparently dead in a highly suspicious plane crash. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with all we've learned in the last few hours about that crash of a private jet in Russia. Russian authorities are saying, Yevgeny Prigozhin and a number of his top lieutenants were on board. The social media channel linked to Prigozhin's Wagner Group is saying that he is dead. The plane's final moments were caught on camera. This is some of the footage showing it spiraling toward the ground. From the looks of it, with possibly only one wing falling at nearly 8,000 feet a minute toward the end. The circumstance is highly suspicious. President Biden saying he wasn't surprised and that not much happens in Russia that Vladimir Putin isn't behind. CNN's Matthew Chance has done extensive reporting on Prigozhin and his attempted rebellion some two months ago. He also lived and has reported from Moscow for years. He joins us now. So, what's the latest that we know about this crash?",

There is an investigation underway by the Russian authorities, and you see the aftermath, the flames that engulfed that entire area.It is about 60 miles or so outside of the Russian capital of Moscow, so it is not far. The plane had just taken off from Moscow, and was traveling at an altitude of, I think, 26,000 feet when they lost radio and radar contact with it, then you can see that video there of the plane spiraling to Earth before it crashed into that into that fiery, you know, kind of fireball at the bottom of it. Look, I mean, there's all sorts of narratives that are coming out on social media. As I say, there is an investigation underway. But, you know, the main suspicion certainly from kind of observers outside of Russia is that this is connected with the state in some way. Remember, Yevgeny Prigozhin is the man who headed that attempted coup against Moscow in June. He's the person who challenged Vladimir Putin's rule to the greatest extent in the past 23 years and Vladimir Putin called that coup attempt a stab in the back and was absolutely furious. And so you know, was this coincidental? Well, I mean, that's something that we may never find the reality about, but certainly, there is a lot of suspicion, as you mentioned, President Biden amongst them, that the Kremlin may have in some way been involved.",

He was once the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. He was, you know, of course, the commander of Russia's Air Force. It was announced today that he was no longer in that role. We still haven't seen him in public. And so it seems that this is a sort of clearing of house of all these people that may have been connected that with that uprising. It wasn't just Yevgeny Prigozhin, of course, on board this plane. It was the top leadership essentially of Wagner, it was his chief of security. It was Dmitry Utkin, who was one of the founding members of the Wagner Group as well. There were seven out of the 10 people on board, three crew members and seven others, all of them -- all of them were killed, obviously, in this fireball.",

But the sheriff's office tells CNN that he was handled just like any other defendant.

If you're inside the Southern District of New York building, there is a wall that has portraits of every US attorney going back to the 1800s, and there, '83 to '89 is Rudy, and it is actually framed similarly to this mug shot here.But the circumstances couldn't be more different. He is younger, of course, but he's got the flag behind him and he is sort of smiling proudly, because the truth of the matter is, he was a remarkable and really historically significant prosecutor. And now, here he is. He is an indicted defendant in one case; he is a co-conspirator in a federal case. He has had his law license temporarily revoked for lying to the court in two jurisdictions. He is being sued for defamation by various parties. It's a tragic Shakespearean fall, but let's be clear, it's his own doing. Nobody picked it on him for reasons of amusement or politics. He has done this all to himself. COOPER: I want to ask you both about, and start with Michael, about this move by Ken Chesebro, which has not gotten a lot of attention, but he has -- his attorneys have filed papers essentially demanding a speedy trial. Talk about the significance of this. MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER ATTORNEY FOR GEORGIA'S MIDDLE DISTRICT: Yes, Georgia has a statute that it's called the Speedy Trial Act, and it is a little different than we think about in the federal court, but what it essentially says is that a defendant can come in during the time they're indicted and ask the court to immediately try their case. And it gives the district attorney just a few months, and in this case, it would be really through October to put the case on trial. So if they don't do that, if they don't try the case within the time that the law says, then the charges are dismissed. So it is a clever move, I think by the defense attorneys here. I think you're going to see likely some motions to sever other defendants because they're going to claim we're not ready this quick. You know, we don't want to do it and it puts the DA frankly, in a unique position. Because she is essentially going to have to decide what does she do with Chesebro, and is she going to try to give the other side a trial run and let them take a look at what she wants to put forward with her case? Or is she going to try to -- does she think that some of these will be moved to federal court? We just don't know. But it was a good move. It's a -- you know, it is sort of taking the fight to the prosecutor, if you're a defense attorney. They've indicted you, they've taken your picture, they've put you in jail for a few hours, and you know, let's go ahead and tee it up and that is essentially what his lawyer is doing.",

Traitors, he believes to be the worst kind of specimen of human. And if you look back, whether it's Alexei Navalny being poisoned, whether it's Sergei Skripal, a former double agent being poisoned. Again and again, we have seen Putin showing no mercy in his attempts to extinguish this kind of a threat.I think what was really sort of fascinating to people, Anderson, was how it was possible that Yevgeny Prigozhin was wandering around very visibly seemingly very freely visiting Belarus, visiting Africa, apparently, greeting African leaders in St. Petersburg for a whole two months after this extraordinary mutiny took place, and everyone was sort of waiting in disbelief. Surely, at some point, this has to come to an end, and surely at some point, Putin must exact his revenge. Now, we're hearing from some sources and people who watch the Kremlin very closely, that, you know, really, this just gave them a two-month period where they really had the time then to go about dismantling Wagner, getting all the pieces set in place so that they could go ahead and exact their revenge once and for all.",

He thought that he'd come to an accommodation with the Kremlin to settle, you know, some of the grievances that he had when he staged this march on Moscow in June, and he probably thought that he was too valuable to the Kremlin to be disposed of. I mean, he's got very significant operations through Wagner in countries, in Africa and elsewhere as well, operations that really do extend the Kremlin's influence into that continent into the Middle East as well. And he may have just made the calculation that he was home and dry, and that Putin was not strong enough to act.

So, this is an aircraft that was on fire and it looks like some structural pieces, aerodynamic surfaces, were missing. There are some reports I've been reading that maybe some piece of the rear section, perhaps the vertical stabilizer or tail was missing. I think what you have to assume in this case is that an aircraft like this, as you pointed out, they don't -- just don't catastrophically drop out of the sky without something very unusual happening. So, I would think that investigators in this case, to the extent that it will be investigated in Russia, will be looking at an explosion either inside the aircraft or outside it. Inside a bomb.

There's all sorts of different ways to try to get it, how this happened and why this happened. But I think the target was two people here, not just Yevgeny Prigozhin and not just others who might be aspiring to him and to his goals, but also there's some deniability with the Russian people who have to (ph) remember Prigozhin was popular among some of the Russians at least, those we saw in (inaudible).And so, there has to be some sort of explanation, pilot error or some sort of terrorist bomb, did the Ukrainians do it?

And that's why it's important -- and you were speaking about this in the last segment, Anderson -- to look at not just one but two events today, the loss of that aircraft, as you're watching it now fall to the ground, but also the removal from his position as Head of the Russian Aerospace Forces of General Sergey Surovikin. To have both those events happen on the same day and you'll remember, Surovikin was rumored in Moscow to have been, if not involved, then at least quietly approving of Prigozhin's attempt at a coup two months ago. Those two moves today point to something that two western officials tell me could have been a message in their view, meant to scare anyone who might have challenged Putin in the past or would think about doing so in the future.
