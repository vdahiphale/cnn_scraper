This system as a whole, making its way off towards the East, even as we speak.Now, one thing to note with this particular storm is, as its coming through, it also dropped a tremendous amount of rain. Look at this, widespread totals here across portions of Northern Iowa, Southern Minnesota, and over towards Southeastern Dakotas. You're talking widespread four to six inches, but there was a lot -- several places that picked up more than 10 inches of rain in just the last few days. You look at a lot of those rivers, creeks, and streams just in that same area. We've got 26 river gauges at major flood stage, another 28 at moderate, and almost 50 of them at minor flood stage. Now, that system as a whole is going to continue to make its way off towards the East, bringing with it the chance for very heavy rain and also some severe storms. You can see, by this afternoon, we start to see more of storms develop belong that cold front before the system finally starts to take the bulk of that moisture out to sea by Monday. In the short term, however, still looking at the potential for more severe weather for today, that includes the potential for some hail, damaging wind gusts, and yes, even a few tornadoes are possible, especially across portions of New England here where you've got that enhanced risk. That's where you're really going to see the best chance for some of those really strong storms to develop. Now, one perk of those storms coming through, it's going to drop some of the temperatures back. So, take a look. We go from 98 today in Philadelphia, down to 84 by tomorrow. New York, D.C., Pittsburgh all looking at those temperatures dropping back to pretty much normal once that front finally moved through. But it is short-lived because those temperatures will jump right back up. So, you still have a lot of these areas looking at the heat advisories and excessive heat watches and warnings for the day. And yes, that does include Washington, D.C., for another day after yesterday, breaking that triple-digit mark for the first time since 2016. But the East Coast isn't the only ones. Notice a lot more of these heat advisories now starting to pop up into the Central U.S. because that's where we're going to see our next way of heat.

He called that an incredible amount of time. Noting that you go to high school for example, you go to college, that's four years. Five and a half years far surpasses those major life events.Now, he is calling on the U.S. government to take decisive action to bring him home. He wants them to pull out all of the stops in order to bring home both himself and detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. This is what he described as some of those decisive actions that they could take.",

NASA made the announcement Friday night in a blog post further adding that there's no new date scheduled and also saying it won't happen until July.You might recall, the Starliner launched back on June 5th for its mission to the International Space Station. The entire trip was only expected to last about a week but helium leaks and issues with the thrusters have delayed the space craft's return. Let's discuss now with former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. Mike, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Tell us more about, you know, this latest delay. NASA is saying that it will give them a chance to \"review propulsion system data.\" What do you make of that and the fact that they haven't planned for a new date for undocking? MIKE MASSIMINO, FORMER ASTRONAUT, NASA: Well, Amara, it kind of makes sense to me. And I don't think it's necessarily bad. They did have some issues with the spacecraft. They had a helium leak. They had helium leaks which they have I think solved now, so they're not leaking any longer so that's good. They also had a couple thrusters not work for them. But they've checked them out and now they're down only one thruster. So, 27 out of 28 work and that's pretty good too. So, the spacecraft has been cleared for an emergency re-entry. If they needed to get out of there in a hurry, they could. What's also contributing to this is just scheduling logistics. There's a couple of spacewalks planned. They don't want to have too many big events kind of backing up against each other. So, with a few spacewalks coming up and with the opportunity to study these issues a little bit longer, they're going to give them some extra time on orbit which is not a bad thing. You know, nine days was the initial plan but that really was a minimum. You can -- I think we should look at it is that that spacecraft could stay on board or the plan was between nine and 45. That's the max. And getting some extra time is good. It gives the two astronauts Suni and Butch some extra time on orbit. They can help out the crew that's already there. And the team on the ground can take a longer look at the spacecraft. The service module where they had some issues doesn't return to Earth. That's used for re-entry but doesn't come back to Earth. The only thing that comes back is the crew module. So, they'll be able to study the crew module when it gets back but they want to get as much data on that service module as possible.",

And there's no indication that that hasn't happened in over the 20 years that we've had people on board the space station.So, what -- the reason that I bring that up is because if they really had a come home, they could. The spacecraft has been cleared to come home. It's just now they have some extra time to check it out. And part of that is because they could -- they' like the extra time but also with the logistics of the spacewalks and other things going on, it makes sense for them to stay on orbit longer.",
