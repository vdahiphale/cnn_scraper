As we look at these pictures last night, we were looking at the ground and seeing these hot spots and thinking they were likely trees on fire. But now in the light of day and kind of correlating the locations, some of these hot spots were actually homes that were burning to the ground. Reminding you really of what Southern California can look like sometimes with pictures at night.There is the smoke that came off of Lahaina. And across the entire area just covered in smoke with winds blowing at 60-mile-per-hour and in some spots 82-mile-per-hour was the highest gust that we were able to find. So, yes, a devastating series of events and yes, there's some drought in Hawaii, about 30 percent there of Hawaii in some type of drought. Mainly the lowest levels of drought, but that just means the grasses are dry and ready to burn and that's exactly what they did. So how did it happen? Well we talked about this hurricane to the south -- a category 4, Dora. But there was also a high-pressure to the north. The difference between the low and the high caused all of the winds to funnel in through the Hawaiian Islands. And that area there near Lahaina obviously picked up some of the biggest funnels even though the storm was 800 miles away and a big storm at the time. Of course, it still is and still moving away. And this is what will let the winds die off. We're not at 80 anymore. We're not at 60 anymore. A couple of gusts to around 40. But as the days go on those wins will eventually die off even more. And so, even for later on today and into tonight, likely the biggest gusts we'll see is maybe 20 to 30. That's already and still a problem when you talk about flames that are still burning. And we know that that's actually happening right now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That post obviously very concerning to the U.S. Secret Service as well as the FBI. A law enforcement source tells me that as FBI tactical agents tried to arrest the suspect, they were giving him commands when the suspect pointed a gun at the agents. One FBI agent opening fire fatally shooting that suspect. Now this entire investigation began back in March when a social media company contacted the FBI regarding concerning material that they were seeing on their platform allegedly tied to this suspect. One particular threat was against the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. I'll read you part of that post. The suspect allegedly writing: Heading to New York to fulfill my dream of eradicating another George Soros two-bit political hack D.A. I'll be waiting in the courthouse parking garage with my suppressed nine-millimeter to smoke a radical fool prosecutor that should never have been elected. The suspect then went on to allegedly write in graphic detail how he would kill Manhattan's district attorney. Now back in March the FBI confronted the suspect, he was under surveillance. But agents eventually approached him, brought up this online material. The suspect allegedly -- according to federal criminal completes -- telling the FBI that this was all a dream. He told them to come back when you have a warrant. That they did. Showing up at his residence Wednesday morning. Again, that suspect fatally shot after a law enforcement source says he pointed a gun at those agents. The FBI says it is investigating the circumstances surrounding that shooting.
