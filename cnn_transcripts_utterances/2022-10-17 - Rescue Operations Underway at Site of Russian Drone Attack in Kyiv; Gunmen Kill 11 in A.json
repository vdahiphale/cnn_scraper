We begin this morning in Ukraine's capital where rescue operations are under way right now after Russian forces attacked just a short time ago using kamikaze drones.That's according to Ukrainian officials. The city of Kyiv hit at least four times. I want to get straight to CNN's Clarissa Ward. She is on the streets of downtown Kyiv. Clarissa, what are you seeing? What do we know?",

      "sentences": "So, Christine, we're here at the sites of one of those four explosions that woke Kyiv up this morning. And I think you can see behind me, this is an ongoing rescue  effort. This is quite clearly a residential building. We have already seen one body being removed from here.We also saw another elderly woman being rescued from the rubble, actually from one of the balcony on the neighboring building. And we just spoke with the head of the ambulance services who says they don't know for sure, but they do believe it's likely that there are other people still trapped inside that building. Earlier on, there had been reports of voices being heard from underneath the rubble. But you can just get a sense here, Christine, I think, if we sort of look around of just how chaotic this scene is. There are dozens and dozens of paramedics, firemen, rescue workers. There are many journalists as well who have gathered here, and we actually also just spoke to the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko who said that this was quite clearly an attack on a civilian target. Here you see this residential building, but the likely-intended target was Kyiv's civilian infrastructure, which Russia has been hitting harder and harder in the past week, clearly, trying to cripple energy plants, power plants, heating plants especially as we go into the Winter. But the effect of all this, you can imagine is quite dramatic in terms of the psyche of people living here in the capital. Up until last Monday, it had been relatively quiet here since the beginning of the war. Now, you have hordes of kamikaze drones coming in, dropping explosives on to residential areas right in the heart of the capital. The Ukrainian Air Force saying they intercepted 15 kamikaze drones trying to get into the capital this morning. And obviously, four of them did manage to strike and cause explosions like the one you see behind me, Christine.",

I think the Ukrainian authorities would say, this is kind of a mark of desperation that the Russians feel they have no recourse left on the battlefield, but to try to strike at civilian targets, at civilian infrastructure. And clearly, they want to maximize whatever damage they can do as this country heads into the Winter.Obviously, it gets very cold here in the Winter, and that's why you're seeing attempts to hit things like heating plants, like energy plants. But the -- you know, the consequence, of course,  of that is that it does have a profound impact on the psyche. I asked the mayor how this is affecting the people of Kiev. He says, you know, they want to intimidate us. They want to frighten us, but what they're actually doing is making people even angrier and making people want to fight even more, Christine.",

And one of the things we need to know about the Belgorod region, it is right on the area bordering Ukraine, and it is really a very militarized town there in Russia.It's where the Russians have a lot of their military stationed that they've been using for the war in Ukraine, but it's also a place where a lot of that training takes place for those more than 200,000 Russians who have already been mobilized to then go and fight in Ukraine. And this happened over the weekend when they were obviously training shooting, and then two of the people who were there, apparently, opened fire on a crowd of those being mobilized but of course, also on the trainers as well. And as you mentioned, the Russians are saying that 11 people at least were killed, 15 people were wounded. And generally, in this Belgorod region, that's one of the few areas in Russia where the war is really affecting also the population there in Belgorod, and that city of Belgorod. There were also some strikes that the Russians say were done by the Ukrainian military infrastructure in Belgorod, also some military installations as well. And now this very devastating attack. It's unclear who exactly was behind this, whether or not there were some larger plot, whether something else was behind it, but it certainly is the case that this is something that is absolutely devastating for that mobilization effort that Vladimir Putin has been undertaking. And of course, we also saw Vladimir Putin right before that took place, saying that the mobilization is going to end soon. He said within the next two weeks. It's clearly something that's been weighing the Russians down. And now, this incident certainly will make it even tougher as well, Christine.",

They are regular events, but of course, the context as Jake Sullivan made very clear there is far from normal.We've been hearing increasingly blunt nuclear threats from Russia, they are on the back-foot on the battlefield. U.S. officials have been saying that they are depleting their supplies of conventional weapons, raising concerns that their nuclear capabilities will form an outsized share of their overall capabilities. So, you know, obviously, when we see those exercises taking place in Russia, they will be closely watched by the U.S. and other NATO allies. And meanwhile, NATO is starting today with its own nuclear exercises over western Europe. This will involve 14 countries, 60 aircrafts including a U.S. B52 bombers. This will not include live weapons. NATO has made that very clear. But of course, these exercises are part of that delicate balance of the nuclear deterrence that both sides endeavor to keep up. As I said, these will be very closely-watched probably by Russia as well and the U.S. and NATO will be closely watching when Russia starts its own exercises.

A lot of sheriff's departments all across Georgia actually do like him and support him, and these are the types of things that you give to local celebrities. It doesn't actually mean that it has any power, but I do think that it is Walker's own unusual way of trying to show that he does have adoring fans from his days as a Heisman Trophy winner and a very popular college football player here at Georgia, that he does actually have some type of influence.
