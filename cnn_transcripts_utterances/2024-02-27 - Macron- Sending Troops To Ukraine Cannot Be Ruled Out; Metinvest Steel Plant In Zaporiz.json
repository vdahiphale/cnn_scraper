If you have a look at the big board here, you will see that it is slipping a little bit. The NASDAQ though, faring a little bit better. Those are the markets and these are the main events: NATO and multiple EU leaders say there are no plans -- read -- no plans to send European troops to Ukraine after French President Emmanuel Macron actually floated the possibility. President Joe Biden's support for Israel is under scrutiny from some primary voters in a key swing state. And Macy's plans to close 150 stores. Live from New York, it is Tuesday, February 27th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a very good evening. Tonight, Russia is pushing back after French President Emmanuel Macron said he wouldn't rule out deploying Western troops in Ukraine. Now, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a broader war would be \"inevitable\" if such a thing ever happened. Mr. Macron made the comment at a European Summit in support of Ukraine. Listen now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): There is no consensus today to send ground troops in an official endorsed or a sanctioned matter, but in dynamic terms, nothing should be ruled out. We would do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, shipments of Ukrainian corn were actually spilled across the railroad tracks in Poland this past weekend. You see it there, farmers there have also been blockading Ukrainian border crossings. Joining me now from Warsaw is Michal Sznajder. He is a senior anchor at CNN's sister network in Poland, TVN 24, and I'm really happy to have you join us to give us some insight about what's going on in Poland right now. We are seeing the emotion involved in this farmers protest. Do you expect these protests to grow in the coming days? And what kind of economic impact is all this having? MICHAL SZNAJDER, SENIOR ANCHOR, TVN 24: Good evening, Paula. Thank you very much for having me. I most certainly do expect these. These protests to continue perhaps even increase. Let's have a look at the numbers in front of me, I have a brand new opinion poll, which confirms what the previous ones stated clearly. But this time, these numbers according to the authors are almost unprecedented in terms of support for the demands of a social group. So almost 80 percent of those surveyed support the protests in Poland, 46 percent strongly support the protests, 79 percent say that the influx of Ukrainian food needs to stop and they don't accept it, the argument that it could hurt Ukraine, which is fighting Russia, and according to that survey for OKO.press and TOK FM, they support the farmers more than they support the EU's Green Deal. And you ask about the potential results for the Polish farmers, the impact for Poland, well, the farmers, the protesters, they say that should the Green Deal become reality, they could go bankrupt. That could hurt their livelihoods and the livelihoods of their communities, so that is what they are afraid of, that is what they are trying to avoid. And also in another survey, almost 70 percent of those surveyed blame the EU's decision to open the European market to Ukrainian agricultural imports for the difficult situation of those Polish farmers. Now, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the EU has to solve the problem created by that decision: \"No one has the right to think that the Czech Republic and Poland do not support Ukraine, but we will work together in Brussels for corrections that will protect our market against the negative effects of this decision,\" Tusk said. And the speaker of the Lower House of the Polish Parliament, Szymon Holownia met with the farmers today with the representatives of the protesters. He said that: \"All of the problems they highlighted will be solved, that they are valid, but that undoing some of those decisions at the EU level will take weeks.\" He also said that the EU should create some sort of mechanism, which would allow the food surplus to be bought from the farmers and allow for those products to be moved somewhere else where they are needed. He also said that perhaps European bureaucracy created a situation where some unnecessary burdens have been placed on Polish farmers. He added that the EU subsidy system should be improved.",

And in fact, there already is a decrease. We also see it in the numbers and that is connected to some sort of wider frustration. According to the most recent polling, barely -- more than half of polls support accepting Ukrainian refugees, it was more than 70 to 80 percent initially. There is an increase in the number of polls willing to financially -- there is a decrease of the number of polls willing to financially support Ukrainians. There is lower acceptance for Ukrainians who are living in Poland. The polls also approve of the fact that Ukrainians and Poland are working. Also in sectors which couldn't find workers. There is a lower number of Poles who believe that Ukrainians are receiving bigger and better social support than Poles and that was some -- that was a problem two years ago. Now that has decreased and we must add that almost one million Ukrainians have received a Social Security number in Poland, and 90 percent of those who are in Poland are children, women and the elderly.",

Now Johnson, in private conversation we are told has said that he acknowledges how important it is and how urgent it is that they try to figure it out and he has said he wants to do something on Ukraine, but the challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson here is that he's dealing with a right flank, who is very powerful in his conference, who does not want to see any more dollars flowing to Ukraine. And you heard there, Johnson in the meeting today continually brought up the southern border and said, before we give out any more money to foreign countries, we need to address our own issues here domestically, starting with the southern border. But as a reminder here, it was Johnson and former President Donald Trump who rejected a bipartisan deal in the Senate that would secure the southern border. And so that is where we are in terms of the impasse here on Capitol Hill. Now, as you heard Chuck Schumer and President Biden and Leader Jeffries, all of the Democrats in the room really tried to implore Johnson to stop thinking about the immediate politics and the immediate repercussions and to think about the long term and they said things like history is going to remember what you did. And it really is important to point out here that Johnson is only a few months on the job. He really is still a rookie speaker. He has not had a lot of international experience. Hardly any, really. He was just a rank and file member before he pretty much accidentally stumbled into this job. And now here he is with the fate of Ukraine and the war itself all in his hands. So at this point, the ball is in his court. He has not said how he's going to act. I'm told that the leadership team is thinking about potential different ways to address Ukraine aid, whether that's turning it into more of a structured loan or trying to offset it or tying it to other hardline border immigration provisions.

Beauty has also done really well, particularly coming out of the pandemic. And so Macy's is going to be opening some of those Bluemercury stores, strong kind of beauty company, but pulling back on the traditional department store model that has kind of a relic of the past and increasingly less relevant to shoppers today.

So surge pricing, Wendys does faces a risk here. But the company is betting that people will want to come in when prices are a little bit low. Maybe not on peak hours, and that will allow it to space out its operation. Sometimes you think about during peak times the fast- food lines are so long, the drive-through lines are so long, and so Wendy's is really trying to discourage that.
