So, there's still -- there are still some things up in the air. Rupert Murdoch, of course, Dominion wants to have him testify. And the judge has indicated in that case, at least, that he might compel him to testify. He's not really being moved by some of Fox's arguments to prevent a potential testimony from him in the trial yesterday in a court hearing -- a virtual court hearing. He had rejected some of those arguments saying that, you know, the 92- year-old is -- been traveling, he was at the Super Bowl recently, for instance, he has indicated he is -- looks forward to traveling between his various residences across the world. And so, it's likely or potentially likely that the judge could compel Murdoch to testify in this case, but you're expected to see if this does go to trial, some of the biggest names in right-wing media being taken to stand.",

We also know Hale fired at the six victims indiscriminately. But an exact motive for the shooting remains unclear at this time.Joining me now is Nashville Police Chief John Drake.
