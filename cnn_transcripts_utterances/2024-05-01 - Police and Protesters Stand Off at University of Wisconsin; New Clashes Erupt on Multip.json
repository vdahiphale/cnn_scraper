All right, let's bring in Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. John, your reaction to what we're looking at right now, we should show our viewers or point out to our viewers. You're looking at live pictures of what looks like protesters sort of locking arms outside the campus library. They're at the campus of the University of Wisconsin Madison.

We saw the police action last night in New York City, the retaking of a seized building at Columbia University, a couple of hundred arrests there and at City College.And when you look at what's happening in Madison, it's a contrast to what occurred in Los Angeles, where students clashed with outsiders who came onto the campus. This seems to be colleges across the country saying, as we get closer to graduation, and we have people controlling different areas of our campuses, we're taking those back. And some of these pictures that we're seeing today, you know, obviously they don't look pretty. And this is, you know, part of the process where police have to plan what are we going to do, how are we going to do it and how do we minimize either the use of force or the number of injuries.",

And at this point in most places, and, you know, this would have been the rule in L.A. and New York, it's probably similar in Wisconsin, is you give the legal warning which is you're being ordered to disperse you are going to be arrested if you do not disperse and then you give them time to kind of suss out, do I want to actually get arrested today or is that my level of commitment to this, and then those people who remain after the order is given, you move in and you separate them.And you know we've seen tactics. Locking arms is not a problem for the police. They'll separate them and arrest them for whatever the charges are going to be, likely criminal trespass or something like that. But there are sophisticated measures that have been used before, things like sleeping dragons where they chain themselves together requires more equipment and more time, but it certainly increases the amount of time it takes to clear an area.",

Is that has that been a factor in all of this on your campus?NEWMAN (voice over):  I'm not entirely clear that some people have said that there are potentially outside agitators or outside protesters. What I know is that there are students involved, there are faculty involved, who have been at the encampment day and night and that they were warned to leave the encampment, that there would be consequences if they stayed in the encampment and that no protester should physically assault an officer or resist arrest under a lawful order.",

This is not the way you want the year to end.NEWMAN (voice over):  You know, I think that's challenging. I think many students have felt that this is not the way they wanted the year to end. I think more broadly, it shows the breakdown in civil dialogue, the group who puts out tents and makes -- they have their demands. They have an unreasonable set of six demands that goes from everything from the university divesting from Israel study abroad programs to police having to leave campus overall. Those are an unreasonable set of demands and are not in the spirit of civil dialogue. So, it's no surprise that when confronted with the police that they behave in ways that are also physically uncivil.",

We're also seeing tons of barricades that have been put up that were not here, but that is because of what happened last night.Police using really a shock and awe tactic here at Hamilton Hall, which you're seeing just to the right of me. In that hall is where some of these pro-Palestinian protesters broke in and occupied the space. It is a long tradition to use Hamilton Hall as a place where protesters go in and occupy it from the 1960s through to now. But they went in and put banners outside that said, Free Palestine, said Intifada. And at some point this seems to have been the breaking point with the university who then sent a letter to NYPD and told them to come in and get rid of -- remove the protesters. They not only went in and shock and awe with dozens of officers all at once going into that building and taking out dozens of protesters, but they got rid of the encampment that has been here for almost two weeks now. We also heard from the New York City mayor. The mayor, over and over and over again, although students refuted, but the mayor over and over again said, look, there was a -- yes, the majority of students that were in that hall and that were taking part in these protests, they were students at Columbia, but that there was a small group of people, potentially a smaller group that were from the outside, that were, as he called them, professional agitators. And he spoke to them saying that they were the ones to influence these students and that the concern from the university became high enough for them to call police in, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY):  There is a movement to radicalize young people and I'm not going to wait until it's done and all of a sudden acknowledge the existence of it. This is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children. And I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the city of New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to go now to my colleague, Gabe Cohen, who is over and closer to the university right now. There has been no class on campus. This has been a virtual class.

What's more, there were several of my colleagues and fellow student journalists who were outside Hamilton Hall, even before the police came in. Unfortunately, most of these student journalists were pushed out of campus by the officials before the police action really happened. So, they couldn't get to bear witness to the police action that happened in a sensitive environment, like a university campus, as a result of which the footage that we have from last night is very sparse, and that footage already raises some troubling questions about the NYPD's conduct on the campus. If we had more journalists there, student journalists there, we would have known much better what actually unfolded in front of Hamilton Hall.",

Of course, both sides have interests here, so a lot of concerns there. I've also spoken with students here who have not been involved I spoke to a freshman who was leaving campus a little bit earlier trying to get food for the first time of the -- in the past 12 hours because of the lockdown on campus, and he was saying last night there was really concern on both sides from the students who he was surrounded by. Some did not want to see police on the campus. They were worried about the safety of the students who were involved in that protest. Others wanted to see the protest cleared away fearing for the Jewish students on campus and the fears those students have been feeling.

We saw a lot of pushing and shoving there a few moments ago. We're closely monitoring that situation will bring you the latest developments as they come in. In the meantime, just last hour, up on Capitol Hill, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said she will force a vote to oust the House speaker, Mike Johnson, as soon as next week.

And there really are no other major decisions coming down the pike that could put him in more hot water with his right flank. There is an effort that they would have to keep the government open, but that is not until the fall. So, perhaps Mike Johnson could survive this threat because of the Democratic support and Republicans. Many Republicans don't want to go through that messy episode that happened last fall when McCarthy was ousted and there were about three weeks of no speaker. The Republicans are battling each other. They're hoping to move past this and focus on the election.",
