The China Energy Investment Corporation, the world's largest coal-fired power generation company, said it produced more electricity on Monday than on any other day in the past. Hundreds of millions in China are sweltering through what could, once again, be the country's hottest-ever summer. And it's not just people who need protecting as our world gets warmer.

And these bodies were apparently all killed last month and mostly from the Masalit tribe, which is one of the main known Arab communities in this region.Now, this is history repeating itself here, Rahel. Because 20 years ago this year, Darfur went through a genocide where 300,000 people were killed. And the same Janjaweed militia, which has evolved into the Rapid Support Forces which is being led by one of the generals involved in this recent conflict in Sudan -- they were responsible for those -- for that genocide at the time. And again, the U.N. is saying that they have credible intelligence that the Rapid Support Forces were behind this latest killing of 87 people in El-Geneina. So it's just absolutely horrific with what is happening there. The U.N. has called for an investigation. And today, in Egypt, a summit is holding -- urgent summit with neighbors of Sudan to discuss what can be done. It's the latest international mediation attempt to try to bring an end to this conflict that's raged for 12 weeks now. Each time there's a mediation and a ceasefire is agreed it's immediately violated leading to a frustrating blame game. So it's just a very, very desperate situation for Sudanese people who are caught in this hellish trap of violence that seemingly is not ending, Rahel.",

Let's take a look at U.S. futures, also up, perhaps for the same reason. Dow futures are up, let's call it one-tenth of a percent. Nasdaq up more than half a percent. The Nasdaq has been having a great year -- one of the best in 40 years, in fact. The S&amp;P also up, let's call it one-third of a percent. Stocks also jumped on Wednesday after new data gave investors hope that the Federal Reserve may soon stop aggressively raising interest rates. The Consumer Price Index showing that inflation slowed to three percent on an annual basis, making June the 12th-straight month that inflation has slowed. Let's take a look at some of the categories. Gas, from a year ago, is down 27 percent almost. Used cars about five percent. Meat, fractionally, but airfare off almost 19 percent. One thing that is not off, however, are school supplies -- and for the first time in nine years, back-to-school spending is set for fall. That's according to a new report by Deloitte. Consumers are expected to spend 10 percent less as prices of school supplies have increased almost 24 percent in just the past two years.
