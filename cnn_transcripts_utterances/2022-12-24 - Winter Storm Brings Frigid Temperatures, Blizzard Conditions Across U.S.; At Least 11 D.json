And of course, all of it coming just in the final stretch leading up to Christmas, the crucial moments where people would be trying to get to loved ones.But it's just because of these winter conditions being so intense in some places; it's part of why Buffalo's airport said that they were going to shut down over the course of Friday night, canceling all flights, essentially and operations. And that's because they were seeing wind gusts approaching hurricane force level winds close to the 70 miles per hour in that range, at the very least.

And by laying that all out for the public, to see, it increases, I think the likelihood that the Department of Justice, looking at the same set of facts will reach the conclusion that that I've reached, which is that this is one of the most significant criminal activities of my lifetime, for sure, and possibly in the history of the nation.

And that increases the possibility that Mr. Meadows himself might be charged, which in turn increases the possibility that he would agree to cooperate more fully with the Department of Justice.We always say that it's not the crime, it's the cover up. And in this instance, much of the cover up is collateral, I think, to the actual crime, the riot, the insurrection, we attempt to obstruct Congress, but it will provide levers of opportunity for the Department of Justice, to secure the truthful testimony of some of the witnesses close to Trump who have thus far been unwilling to testify.",

The House passed it Friday along with a one-week funding measure that averted the government shutdown yesterday.Biden signed that short term bill which provides enough time for the year-long measure to be formally processed and sent to the President. The spending bill includes $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine, and about 40 billion for emergency disaster relief. It also includes a measure to ban TikTok from federal devices and an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election. A jury in Los Angeles has convicted rapper and singer, Tory Lanez, on three counts related to the July 2020 shooting a fellow rapper, Meghan Thee Stallion. Megan said Lanez shot her in both her feet after she got out of a car following an argument. Lanez could be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison and possibly deported back to his native, Canada.

Remember the pipes of the back of your washing machine, underneath the sink. Open those cabinet doors get some warmth for them. Find the main water shut off because when things start thawing, if you have a leak, you want to make sure it doesn't come all through your house with no way to stop it.[07:30:02] Keep the heat in. Don't open the doors unnecessarily, block, drafty windows and doors, stuff a towel in there, something. Don't just let the heat get away that you've paid for and you're trying to keep your house warm with. Fireplaces and stoves are pretty much ineffective. Fireplaces don't put that much heat into the room. Stoves are actually a dangerous way to do this because possible carbon monoxide risks. Same thing for generators. If you have power go out, get those away from the house out of the garage. You need some separation so you don't have carbon monoxide issues and space heaters. Look out for any kind of fire danger too close your curtains, things like that. And have your food, water, flashlights, and warm clothing ready. Know exactly where it is. Don't go fishing around in the dark when the power goes off, be ready to do it now. If you have to go outside, full tank, full phone, plus emergency supplies ready in your car now. Have that so that you can get to that easily and be safe when you go out. Make sure your windows and lights are completely clear to snow and ice. Drive slowly, brake gently, yes to your headlights on, no to cruise control on. This is not good on snow and ice. Don't pass ploughs or emergency vehicles. They may be slow but in front of them is going to be more dangerous from where you are. Give other people plenty of room. They can't drive any better than you can in these conditions and stay in your vehicle if you get stranded in most cases. You're safer in there than trying to step outside where those crushing temperatures will get after you fast, which brings us to the subject of you going outside. First of all, stay sheltered. Try not to, but if you have to, wear sufficient clothing, plus shoes and boots with good traction. There's an old saying, there is no such thing as cold weather just people who don't know how to dress for cold weather. So, make sure you are dressed for it. Use handrails if you're near them so you don't fall. Do not overexert yourself. People have heart attacks every year out there trying to shovel snow or chip away eyes. Take it easy, realize that you're exerting a lot just by moving through that environment. And most of all, limit exposure. Don't stay out there long. If you have to be out there, make it short, do what you have to do, and get back into safety.",

Now, it's not known it's not been said that there's any kind of big national shortage of Tamiflu, which is an antiviral use to treat flu. But some pharmacists have said that they've had trouble getting access to the generic version. So, let's take a look at what flu is looking like in the United States. All of these states in red and orange and purple. That means flu is at very high or high levels. There are only five states where flu is not at a very high or a high level. So far this season, there have been at least 150,000 hospitalizations with the flu, and at least 9,300 deaths. Not only has the flu season been severe, but it's been very early. The numbers were very, very high in November and continue to be high in December. And there may be some places, hospitals, or pharmacies that weren't quite ready to be seeing this kind of demand on medications this early in the season. Back to you.",

You know, the manufacturer and distributors weren't anticipating this high of a demand. And that's where you're seeing some of the spot national shortages of the suspension of also time of year. And amoxicillin was also, I think, worrisome that if you go to some of these major pharmacy chains, like CVS and Walgreens, there is, you know, disruption to over the counter pain relieving and fever reducing medication for children. But it's important, this is not a shortage of these medications, it's just a demand issue. And so, there is limitations happening right now. So, this is real. It's playing a crowd -- playing, you know, across the United States, but if these are in certain locations, that's not all states.

What's important is that during high risk activities, like when you're traveling, when you're around a lot of people, when you're indoor crowded situations, take that mask out your pocket, and put it on. Certainly, get tested before any major gatherings. You want to make sure you're not, you know, bringing home a virus to your grandma or your -- or your, you know, your child. You know, the best protection or the best holiday gift you can give anybody is a gift of protection. So, making sure you're not bringing that virus to them during his holiday gatherings.
