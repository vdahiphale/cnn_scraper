Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" drama unfolds on two fronts today as the cases against Donald Trump and his allies enter a new phase.We're tracking a tropical storm headed towards Florida and expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it makes landfall this week. Plus, an emotional vigil in Jacksonville, Florida after a hate- motivated mass shooting that took the lives of three people. Thanks for joining us. Well, in just a few hours from now, the first courtroom hearing on the charges against Donald Trump and 18 others will get underway. A federal judge will hear arguments from Mark Meadows, a co-defendant, and Trump's former White House Chief of Staff. He is pushing to get his case moved to federal court or even thrown out. As part of that, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to lay out the evidence and legal arguments in her sprawling anti-racketeering case against Trump, Meadows and 17 other co- defendants. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who Trump pressured to find enough votes to win the state, has been subpoenaed to testify. Separately, we'll also likely learn the trial date for the federal election interference case against Trump. Special counsel Jack Smith is asking the judge in that case for a January trial date, but Trump is pushing for a court date in April 2026, long after next year's presidential election. Bernarda Villalona is a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. She joins me now from Brooklyn, New York. Good to have you with us. BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: Thank you for having me.",

As you mentioned, there are many more injured. The 20 other survivors of the crash were brought back to Darwin, to the Australian mainland to be checked over. At least five of those people were hospitalized. Now, Australian authorities have issued their condolences. So has U.S. President Joe Biden, who issued his condolences in a tweet there on behalf of himself and the First Lady Jill there. So, what authorities have been very careful to say is that these incidents, this was a routine training run, but they're just as deadly, they can be just as dangerous as frontline combat of course, and we've seen that in this case now. What we don't know is why the crash occurred. Once the recovery aspects of the mission have been completed, there'll be an investigation by the U.S. side and the Australian side to try to get a sense of things. What we do know is that the Ospreys had a track record of deadly incidents. There were just last year crashes in California and in Norway involving U.S. personnel killing nine people, Rosemary.",

That was then responded to by Hermoso saying, quote, in a statement later, that on Saturday she said, \"I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse driven, sexist, out of place act, without any consent on my part\", so she was very clear on that. Since then there's been a wave of resignations, none from Luis Rubiales. But much of them from the coaching staff and, of course, the Spanish women's team have said that they will not play until Rubiales is either removed or he resigns. Now there is no sign that he will step down any time soon, even though over the weekend the high council for sport in Spain has, at the moment, suspended him, and FIFA, football's highest governing body, has also suspended Rubiales for his behavior for 90 days, saying he cannot be involved in any international or national level football.

And we've seen support, not just here in Spain. We've seen, for example, in the match between AC Milan as well as Atletico Madrid that they were support on the field there for Jenni Hermoso, as well as footballers outside of Spain, for example top women soccer players in U.S. and in their game showing banners and badges saying we're with you Jenni.

So I think poker is just a great game where, okay, you have certain odds or you put the other player at a certain range and you have to make a decision whether or not the play you make is profitable or not.And you can equate that to playing golf. You know, is it a better decision to hit the driver off this tee or a three wood? If the decision is driver, you hit driver. You take the emotion out of the shot. And obviously if you feel uncomfortable with the shot that has to play in it, but if you believe that this is the plan, you have to stick to the plan and execute and I think that's just a good way to think for most areas in your life.",

But it is pretty crazy when I go out there on the golf course unannounced and then suddenly a couple of people see me and then when I make the turn there's a large group of people there just watching me play. And I think that's just a little bit weird.I haven't -- because I'm just so used to -- I'm just a normal guy. I want to play some golf with my buddies. It just never crosses my mind that other people would want to stop what they're doing just to watch me play golf. You know, it just kind of doesn't compute to me, but it is really cool to see just the support that a lot of people from back home have for me and watch golf. Because Norwegians are very patriotic and whenever we do something well, they tend to watch and cheer. So that's awesome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
