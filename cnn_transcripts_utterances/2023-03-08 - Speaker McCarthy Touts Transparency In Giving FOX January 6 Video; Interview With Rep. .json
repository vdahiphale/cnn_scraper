The Speaker's remarks come on a day that saw several Republican senators criticize his decision and hard on the heels of last night's document dump in Dominion Voting Systems case against FOX, documents revealing of Carlson's contempt for the former President, for his viewers, and for the facts. We'll have more on that shortly. First, though, some of what the Speaker just said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): One thing I always want to make sure is this Capitol is protected and secured. I want to make sure the officers here have everything they need to provide that. My whole role for January 6 is just bring transparency. People can make their own decision then. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We aired portions of that broadcast on CNN.Capitol Police saw every piece of footage that we aired in order to make sure it didn't raise security concerns. As for CNN knowing when subpoenas were going to be released before anyone else, we have some really good reporters who did stuff, who found that out and you know, staked out areas and saw people coming and going from Courthouses. And as for his comment about Statuary Hall, we can only guess it was a reference two interviews that Jake Tapper and I did with lawmakers there on the one year anniversary of January 6, which we did from Statuary Hall because we were invited to.

But you're seeing some very close allies to Kevin McCarthy take a bit of a different approach. In fact, they are planning to press ahead with their own investigation into January 6th going forward, but not about Donald Trump's role, or about what was uncovered by the January 6 Select Committee in the Democratic-led Congress, but to actually look at what the Democratic Select Committee did in and of itself. Barry Loudermilk, who is the Chairman of a Subcommittee here in the House told me that he plans to look into the January 6 Committee investigators themselves and look into any holes in their investigation. It's not entirely clear what that means, though, Anderson, but that is going to be a focus here.

In particular, I think the Police Chief in that two-page letter to the members of the department taking issue with how the events were being misrepresented by Tucker Carlson said there was no effort to get their input, and even when that was available to them. So you know, I think McCarthy's getting a lot of flak as he should be for compromising the security of the Capitol, compromising our escape routes, compromising where security officers are posted, giving the material to someone in Tucker Carlson, who we see in the Dominion litigation, basically, privately was acknowledging the truth about the election and publicly was lying about it. And when others were truthful, took issue with wanting to get them fired, because it would hurt the profits of FOX. So this is who Kevin McCarthy has decided to trust this security footage with and he has done exactly what was expected and that is misrepresent it in an effort to, as Adam was saying, appease the base, but also apparently meet commitments he made in order to get the speakership to the most extreme elements of his conference.",

And yet, the power of repetition is such that, you know, people like Tucker Carlson, who know they're lying to the public can convince tens of millions of people of those lies. I tell you, it's been really illuminating to me about other periods of history where you had other liars use a powerful megaphone and convince millions that they can't believe what they've seen, and you wonder how is that possible? And now we see how that's possible when you have people who have no love of country, no patriotic fiber, when it's just all about the money, then this is what happens.
