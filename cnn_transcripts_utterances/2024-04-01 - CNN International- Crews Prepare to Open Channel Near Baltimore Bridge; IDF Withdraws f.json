That is going to be the most complicated part of this operation. Moving all of that debris and taking it off the ship so that they can begin this cleanup process and then there's everything that's laying below the surface. The part that we can't see. There is more metal, more concrete, more debris in the water and that's going to be critical because they have to be able to make that safe for the divers whose mission it is to get back into the water and continue searching to attempt to recover the bodies of those who were lost. But as we're sitting here, you know, now finally being able to really see it and get up close to it, you really just get a sense of the enormity of the job at hand. But all the officials here have told us that they are confident that they're going to be able to get it done. They're working together, have all of the technology necessary and they're going step by step, taking a meticulous approach to make sure that they get it right and that eventually they can reopen the port. They can start rebuilding and that this important symbol for the city of Baltimore and the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland can get cleaned up and the people here can start getting back to normal.

And the main thing the Israeli cabinet needs to decide is whether it agrees to this demand by Hamas. Because it seems that at the moment if Israel does not agree and Hamas sticks to its position which is the case right now there's not going to be a deal. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We've seen those dramatic images of buildings covered in bullet holes. We've been hearing over the last two weeks from eyewitnesses on the ground about the almost constant shelling of the hospital, airstrikes in and around the area. And of course we have heard from health ministry officials in Gaza who have said that some 400 people have been killed over the last two weeks, that more than a thousand homes around the hospital complex. Again, Gaza's largest hospital at least it once was Gaza's largest functioning hospital, more than a thousand homes have been destroyed. Now the Israeli military has described this as a precise and targeted operation. They say they are targeting Hamas militants who are operating within the hospital. We heard yesterday from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said that the IDF had killed more than 200 Hamas militants operating around the hospital. Though of course, CNN cannot independently verify those figures. But the IDF has also said that while it has located weapons and intelligence documents, it has also worked to ensure that no harm has been caused to civilians or medical staff in the hospital. But that really stands in contrast to the accounts that we've been hearing from Palestinians trapped in the hospital, particularly from medical officials and doctors in the hospital. Over the last few weeks we've been hearing repeatedly from doctors telling us that they've been unable to move in and around the hospital buildings because they feared that they would be targeted by snipers, that they had seen patients and family members attempting to leave the hospital being targeted by snipers. We've been hearing similar accounts from those who live nearby the hospital and of course we have also been hearing from some civilians who have managed to flee the hospital, who have been ordered to move southwards by the Israeli military. Many of them described facing interrogations as they were evacuating. Some including teenagers saying that they were stripped, forced to undress while they were being interrogated by the Israeli military in open squares around the hospital. And of course, we've also been hearing about those situation being faced by those trapped inside. No water, no food and of course limited medical supplies. So this is an extremely dire situation but we have had a limited picture of what has been happening inside and now that siege is over we'll be waiting to hear more about what has been happening over the last two weeks.",

About 100,000 people are still evacuated from their homes along the northern border because of the escalation in attacks from Hezbollah across the border. So Macron, earlier in the year, has spoken about this when Israel struck at a Hamas leader and killed him inside Beirut.Macron was very clear that Israel must not escalate that problem. But what can the French do while they do have some diplomatic influence inside Lebanon? And the U.S. has a negotiator, Amos Hochstein, that's been working to try to de-escalate that tension. But the sense is, you know, people have been talking about the middle of April as a potential deadline whereby Israel says, this Hezbollah problem, we have to go after it.
