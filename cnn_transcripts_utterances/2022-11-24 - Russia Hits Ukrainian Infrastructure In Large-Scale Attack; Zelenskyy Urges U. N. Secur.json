Authorities are searching for a motive in the mass shooting at a Walmart in Virginia. The suspect was an employee who opened fire inside a break room, killing six people, including a 16- year-old boy.And the U.S. Justice Department is seeking testimony from former President -- Vice President Mike Pence. Sources say Pence may be open to providing testimony. More on that ahead in Early Start. Most of the Ukrainian capital is still without power after Russia launched a large-scale assault on the country's critical infrastructure. Ukraine says Russian forces launched 70 missiles on Wednesday, 51 of them were intercepted. But those that did strike knocked out power and water service across Ukraine and killed at least seven people. Several regions say their power has now been largely restored. Russian strikes also slammed into a hospital maternity ward, killing a newborn baby. The International Rescue Committee has condemned that attack in the Zaporizhzhia region, saying women and children continue to pay a high price. Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy urged an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to support the Ukrainian peace formula, saying there should be no room for terror in the world. CNN Correspondents are tracking all these developments. Fred Pleitgen is standing by for us in Moscow. Salma is live for us here in London. Fred, what is the motivation for this latest round of attacks?",

We hear from him every single day, whether he's directly addressing his people or whether he's speaking to a parliament in Europe, or whether he's speaking to the U.N. Security Council. And yesterday was a day for him to voice his anger, voice his opposition.Let's just take stock of what happened. You had over 70 missiles, around 70 missiles fired by Russia towards Ukraine. Many of those, as you mentioned, were struck down. But those that did hit their targets, that ended up meaning every Ukrainian in the country who is an electricity consumer was cut off from power at some point yesterday in the capital Kyiv. That meant many people didn't have running water. And we're not just talking about people's homes. Think hospitals, think schools, think transportation, think what keeps a country running, which is water and power. That's why President Zelenskyy was at that U.N. Security Council accusing Russia yet again of crimes against his people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Energy terror is comparable to the use of weapons of mass destruction. When we have the temperature below zero and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Authorities say two bombs went off less than 30 minutes apart on Wednesday, killing a teenager and wounding 18 other people. Hours after the attacks, hundreds attended a funeral for the 15-year-old who was killed. Israel's Prime Minister says the bombings were more sophisticated than usual, and there's concern there could be prelude to more similar attacks to come. Rescuers in Indonesia pulled a six-year-old boy alive from the wreckage of Monday's earthquake. His parents and grandmother are among the 271 people, though, who were killed. The boy survived unhurt, protected by a mattress. Meanwhile, a woman who started having contractions during the earthquake has given birth to a son. She was evacuated to a medical tent. Despite the quake and subsequent landslide, the baby's father says he's feeling overjoyed and blessed. Now, a week and a half after four college students were found brutally stabbed to death in Idaho, police still have no suspects. The university's security force has been increased, and those in the community are being urged to stay vigilant. Police say they're determined to give the victims justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remarkable online video that we've been closely monitoring showing these clashes taking place at this massive iPhone factory located in Zhengzhou, the central Chinese city. You have Foxconn workers that are absolutely fed up and furious with their pay, with COVID-19 restrictions, and also with the sanitary conditions inside this factory.Foxconn earlier today announced that it's willing to offer $1,400 to recent hires if they quit and leave the facility immediately. Now, $1,400 is roughly equivalent to two months salary for these workers. And even though the term, Foxconn is heavily censored online. In China right now, these dramatic online videos have been circulating widely. And in them, we see the tense standoff between the Foxconn workers out on the streets against the hazmat suit clad security forces. You see the workers tear down barriers and hurl them. And in live streams, which have since been taking down, you can hear the workers describe and complain about the conditions that they're up against inside the closed loop system, inside the factory, the facility there in Zhengzhou. Earlier today, we got a fresh statement from Foxconn. Let's share it with you. The company says this, quote, \"Taking care of the health and safety of employees is the primary operating principle that the group has always adhered to. We fully understand the concerns of some newly recruited employees in the Zhengzhou Park about possible changes in the subsidy policy. Our team has been looking into the matter.\" Now, CNN has also learned that Apple has staff on the ground in Zhengzhou at the Foxconn factory. And Apple has also issued a statement as well. Let's bring it up for you. Apple's saying this, quote, \"We are reviewing the situation and working closely with Foxconn to ensure their employees' concerns are addressed.\" And Max, we will continue to monitor the situation there in Zhengzhou and to see whether that payout from Foxconn will succeed in quelling these angry protests there.
