      "sentences": "All right, a live look at the U.S. Supreme Court this morning. They are right in the middle of all of our political debates this election year.Good morning. Thanks for being up with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. A controversial new immigration law in Texas is on hold again. An appeals court blocking what's known as SB4 late last night just hours after the Supreme Court voted to allow it to stay in effect. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear new arguments later on this morning. The Biden administration has been making the case that the measure is unconstitutional and that it will invite racial profiling. The law gives local and state law enforcement the power to arrest and detain anyone suspected of entering the country illegally. Let's talk about it with Mychael Schnell. She's congressional reporter for The Hill. And Tyler Pager, White House reporter for The Washington Post. Good morning to both of you. Thank you for being here. Tyler, you cover the White House. Let me start with you in terms of what the Biden administration is doing here. This -- it's a little bit confusing. The Supreme Court decides one thing and now it goes back to the appeals court. The appeals courts decide another thing. The bottom line is that it is back and forth over whether this law can remain in effect while the legal challenges play out. This, again, allows police officers to essentially assess -- normally, they could arrest someone for another crime and then consider their document -- their documentation status. This allows them to simply detain people on suspicion of this. The Biden administration has been pushing back against this. How do the politics of this cut for them, and what is the decision- making behind the scenes? TYLER PAGER. WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Yeah. I think the politics of the situation are a) incredibly complicated because this entire issue is incredibly complicated for the Democratic Party. And we've seen the president become much tougher on the border in recent months. Obviously, he was very supportive of the bipartisan effort to try to pass tougher restrictions on immigration. That failed in Congress after former President Donald Trump made clear that he did not want his party supporting it. And so, as you look at the positionality of the White House on this issue, they are trying to be clear that they are not supportive of this sort of legislation that is much tougher and they argue would contribute to racial profiling and undue harm to citizens and non- citizens alike. And so, we've seen the White House push very hard against this. But as you're right, it's quite complicated for the general public to watch because every few hours we're seeing different rulings have different effects on whether or not this law can go into effect. And I think that's part of the chaos that Americans are seeing when it comes to this issue because there's so much moving at the same time and it's hard to sort of keep all those things straight.",

      "sentences": "I think at the end of the day, one of the takeaways you can get from this legal entanglement is that immigration and the border is going to remain in the headlines and remain in the news as a dominating story in the lead-up to the presidential election. Obviously, poll after poll -- we've seen that show -- them show that immigration and the border is the salient issue among voters.It's going to be the issue this election cycle and give lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans, an ability to (audio gap) because if voters care about it they're going to have to make inroads on it to try to get their voters to agree. Obviously, there was that bipartisan border deal that came previously that Republicans then pushed away because former President Trump said he wasn't supportive of that. We're now likely, in the coming weeks, going to see some conversation about Ukraine aid. And obviously, Republicans have consistently said if we pass aid for Ukraine we need to address the situation at the southern border. So at the end of the day, having this news story in the headlines and other immigration and border security beats give lawmakers an ability to try to figure out how to message on this issue, particularly Democrats because it's been a weak spot for the president. Of course, it's salient in the polls. So if Democrats want to have strong outcomes come November, they're going to have to figure out how to message on it. Keeping this in the news gives them an ability to do so.",

Her former comms director Stephanie Grisham wrote a tell-all book about her. Her close friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who came to the White House with her, also has been writing against her. She doesn't have, like, anyone to protect her. And so she's really been pushing to bring back Kellyanne Conway into the fold because Kellyanne has always been a very fierce defender of her and helped her try to turn her Be Best program into policy. And also, there's the added benefit that Kellyanne and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump -- they don't really get along so well, and Melania has very little love for Jared and Ivanka. In fact, Katie Rogers, who just wrote a book about the first ladies -- from The New York Times -- she -- in her book, she says that Melania called Ivanka the princess and that's how she was referred to in the East Wing. And she just doesn't want them around right now. So if there was ever a way to keep them out of the campaign, as Jared starts texting and offering advice, bring in Kellyanne. Of course, Kellyanne has her Fox News gig she's pulling. Hard to say if Melania can make this one happen.

Wagner overcoming all sorts of adversity. They've lost four of their last five games in their conference and now they've found themselves shorthanded. Only seven active players against Howard. Melvin Council Jr. had 21. Wager was up 17 at one point, but Howard went on a 14-2 run. And with 10 seconds to go -- all they needed Kasie was a three to tie it -- no good. How about another chance, though? And, no. Well, come on, one more. You can do it. No -- they missed it. So that's good for Wagner. They hang on for their first NCAA Tournament win in school history, embracing this moment before moving on to face number one North Carolina next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
