It gave very little warning, very few weather models that meteorologistslooked to actually picked up on the rapid intensification that it actually went through. In a 24-hour period, it was impressive. It took advantage of a very narrow swath of ocean water temperatures at about 88 degrees Fahrenheit. And that`s significant because four rapid intensification to carry on, it actually needs to be 80 degrees or higher. And it found just that water and strengthened rapidly 165 miles per hour. This is the first Category 5 landfall to impact, the Eastern Pacific. The strongest storm to strike the Pacific coastline of Mexico and the fastest 12-hour rapid intensification for this area. It is that 12-hour window where it rewrote the history books rapidly intensifying by 90 miles per hour. But the overall picture in a 24-hour period, 115 mile per strengthening, that is incredible mind boggling to be quite honest. Acapulco, not only a tourist destination, but it has a residency of about 1 million people. So with a direct hit like this over a major metropolitan area, we`re starting to see the first visuals of the damage that was left behind not only by the wind, but also the storm surge.
