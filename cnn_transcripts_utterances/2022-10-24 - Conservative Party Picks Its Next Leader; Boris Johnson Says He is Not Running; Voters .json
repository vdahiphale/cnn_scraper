He announced on Sunday he won't be entering the tory leadership race, though he claimed he had enough support to move forward. That narrows the field to former finance minister Rishi Sunak and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt.The Conservative Party today will announce which candidates had reached the necessary 100 nominations and whether a vote will follow to determine the next leader of the party and the country. Whoever becomes out on top will be Britain's third prime minister in just a matter of weeks after Liz Truss stepped down on Thursday. CNN's Scott McLean is following all developments for us and he is joining us now live from outside 10 Downing Street. And Scott, Johnson says he had the 100 votes but chose not to stand, as he couldn't guarantee the unity. His withdrawal is likely going to be key for, in particular, Penny Mordaunt to reach that 100-vote mark. Even though it is considered that Sunak is definitely the front-runner here.",

And as chancellor we know he steered the British economy through Brexit. But he will now face the most enormic (Ph) -- enormous economic challenges. Just talk us through the entree he would have as prime minister. MCLEAN:  Yes. So, this was one of the big things during the leadership race over the summer that Rishi Sunak sort of painted himself as a realist, someone who understood the financial realities that this country was going to and realized that tax cuts were simply not going to fly in this kind of an economic environment. He reluctantly said at some point that there would be tax -- tax cuts, but only when the financial -- the financial realities actually allowed for it. And he correctly predicted, as you said, Christina, that Liz Truss' policies of tax cuts, even those for the richest in society and corporations, would have disastrous implications in terms of inflation. And that seems to have played out. So, he is coming into this job undoubtedly with a lot of credibility when it comes to managing the finances of this country and getting the economy back on track. But he has some pretty eye-watering decisions ahead of him. That's how the current chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described the challenges in trying to get -- balance the books in this country. And Rishi Sunak also has the share of baggage coming into the job as well. He also has some scandals that have plagued him from when he was chancellor. Case in point, his wife, her tax status, she's not a British citizen. And she had nondomicile tax status, which saved her millions in taxes. She's an extremely wealthy individual. He also held a U.S. green card residency permit up until late last year. And of course, he himself was also fined for taking part in parties that took place while this country was under lockdown during the pandemic, Christina.",

The power supply to a coal mine that was hit, which means that that mine can't produce coal. And so many of the power plants in the country rely on coal.

Again, Johnson said that he was attracted to running because he'd won a big election victory back in 2019 and said that he believed he was uniquely placed to avert a general election in the short-term and win big for the party in 2024.

If he has given his endorsement to Rishi Sunak, I think that confirms really, for most of us, that Rishi Sunak has won.There may be some delay on that statement, but there may not need to be if, as we assume, Sunak keep thumping in post. I think the combination of both of them will calm markets. The Conservative Party certainly better hope so. But of course, calming the markets is one thing, and impressing voters is quite another. And given that the Conservative Party, they may get a balance with Sunak replacing Truss, will still be a long way behind the opposition Labour Party. I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that they are out of the woods yet.",

New monkeypox cases have been falling in the U.S. recently, but there are still concerns about severe illness or death, especially in immunocompromised people. U.S. case numbers for the respiratory virus known as RSV are higher than they've been in two years. This according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. And health officials warn respiratory viruses are making children's hospitals busier now than they were during the height of the COVID pandemic. About 75 percent of pediatric hospital beds in the U.S. are currently occupied, according to federal data. RSV is a common cold-like virus, but it can cause serious illness, especially in younger children. Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb says parents should remain vigilant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
