The latest carnage unfolded at a bank in downtown Louisville, Kentucky on Monday. An employee opened fire during a staff meeting before the bank open to the public killing at least five people. A law enforcement source says the 25-year-old gunman had been told he would be fired and live streamed the attack.Afterwards, the U.S. President issued a statement on gun control asking how many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress will act to protect our communities. And in Tennessee, a lawmaker kicked out of the Statehouse for taking part in a gun reform protest on the chamber floor after a fatal school shooting in his community two weeks ago was just reinstated. The Nashville Metro Council voted to put Justin Jones back in office. The expulsion of Jones and another black Democrat Justin Pearson, from the Republican-dominated house has triggered major protests at the state capitol. There will be a vote on whether to reappoint Pearson on Wednesday. And CNN's Ryan Young has more now on the Tennessee vote. RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: A lot of focus on the state of Tennessee and especially the city of Nashville. Nashville had a plan vote on Monday with their city council to see whether or not they could put Justin Jones back in his representative seat. Last week, of course, the Republican majority at the Statehouse in Tennessee, kicked out two of its members, Justin J. Pearson and Justin Jones. Justin Jones case, he had the opportunity to go for the City Council. They reappointed him and that vote was dramatic. You could see it in his face. In fact, take a look at this video, as you see, Justin's exuberance of the crowd who was excited. They went from that moment and they marched to the state capitol. On the Capitol steps, he was back to getting a read back in. He had a swearing in service right there on the steps. The crowd went crazy as he went back and defiantly address that state capitol assembly once again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. JUSTIN JONES (D) TENNESSEE: Today we send a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge. We are calling on House Speaker Cameron Sexton to resign as Speaker of the House. He is an enemy of democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

His case now moves under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for hostage affairs. Two other wrongfully detained Americans in Russia. Brittney Griner, the U.S. basketball star and Trevor Reed were released in prisoner swaps last year there. As I say, we're also designated as wrongfully detained but another Paul Whelan also like Mr. Gershkovich accused of espionage is still serving a sentence in Russia. There is however, a more immediate problem for Evan Gershkovich and that is that the U.S. as it has yet to be granted consular access to him which means that they're essentially having to take Russia's word for the fact that he is being treated fairly and humanely in Moscow's notoriously Lefortovo prison.

He's a proud Irish American, he references those Irish roots all the time quotes, Irish poets, and a lot of his speeches. And in fact, before this trip, the White House sent quite an extensive genealogy table dating back to 1803. Going back to President Biden's great, great, great grandparents, who eventually journey to the United States. But of course, this trip is about more than sentiment as well. It's timed around the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that a court that brought peace between the nationalists and the Unionists here in Northern Ireland. President Biden, of course, very eager to highlight the legacy of that agreement, which came about with some significant American investment, not just American investment, but democratic investment in the form of President Bill Clinton, and the Senator George Mitchell. And certainly, President Biden wants to underscore the importance of these kinds of agreements in world affairs. Particularly, at a moment when American involvement overseas is being questioned in the United States by some Republicans. This is sort of the different kind of diplomatic agreement that President Biden really does want to emphasize, and you'll hear him talk about that when he arrives in Belfast later today.Now, the Good Friday Agreement is being tested somewhat certainly, the specter of violence has never entirely disappeared here in Northern Ireland. And you did see some of that yesterday at the March in Derry, some of the violence that you saw there, you also see a very significant security presence ahead of the President's arrival here in Belfast later today. Heavy police presence on the streets around the President's hotel. And so certainly that is something that the White House in the Northern Irish government is watching very closely. You also see sort of the power sharing agreement that was part of the Good Friday Agreement that's been paralyzed for several months now over this dispute between the Brexit trade rules and so that is something that the President may want to talk about when he arrives here later today. He will only be here in Northern Ireland, though, for 24 hours before heading south to the Republic of Ireland later on Wednesday. Rosemary.",
