So, I think to your point, Alisyn, he's trying to appeal to our core values and saying if your vote doesn't matter, then nothing else will matter. And this was a very clear warning and acknowledgement by the president that he fears that this mid-term election will be 2020 2.0 except perhaps more dangerous because election deniers have had two years of practice to work on this. There are a number of similarities. We have a number of states in very close races. You have very high stakes; the balance of congress hangs in the balance. You have -- likely it's going to be days before we know what some of these races, what the outcomes will be because it takes time to count these mail-in ballots.

CNN political analyst Alex Burns, political commentator Karen Finney and Republican strategist Doug Heye.You know, maybe I'm a glass half full sort of person today even though we're six days out.

I think Democrats are concerned that what we're seeing is GOP talking points about a red wave, we're seeing a lot of different polls. I think the American public is probably over polled at this point, but when you look at the turnout data there is enthusiasm on the Democratic side.And so, one of our concerns, one of the Democrat's concerns is let's let voters have their say. Let's not tell them what's going to happen and depress turnout. That's number one. Number two, you know, \"The New York Times\" reported that over a couple dozen of the lawyers who worked for Donald Trump's efforts in 2020 to overthrow the election and all sorts of different schemes in the states are, right now working in a number of states for a number of campaigns on the Republican side. So, it was kind of a prestaging that sort of says we've seen this before. We know what this is, don't let it stop you from voting. That's part of the democracy message.

And everybody who works in politics knows this. And the difference is that some people who work in politics know that confusion is there and play upon it to sow distrust in the system. And there are other people who try to explain to people, you know, why this might seem strange but actually, you know, there's a process that you need to let it work. I will say, Laura, I think part of where the president is coming from here and part of where, you know, the White House administration, democratic leaders generally are coming from here is that they recognize as if there is strong likelihood of Republicans who are going to pick up one or both chambers of Congress next week.

I thought it was a good speech, politically. I thought it was a good speech how it was delivered. I agree with a lot of what Biden says on these election deniers that are taking over county boards and obviously states. But politics is about people, and people are concerned about what's happening to them every day of their lives, and that's when they go to the grocery store, when they go to the gas station, and everything they see and hear about crime. And by the way, if you go to the grocery store you may have to hit a button for somebody to come get things for you because of shoplifting.

However, it is a great issue to demagogue on.

He should recuse because of Ginny Thomas' involvement, but he's not the bad guy in these e-mails. Let me tell you why.First of all, they're not singling him out just because they think he'd be favorable. Every Supreme Court justice is assigned a certain geographic circuit that they are in charge of incoming emergency motions. The 11th Circuit which includes Georgia, that is Clarence Thomas' territory. We saw it the other day with the Lindsey Graham subpoena. So, let's get that, number one. Number two, lawyers all day long talk about judges and justices. Ooh, that one is really good. We're going to lose if we get her, We're going to win if we get him. I hope we get these two, not that one. That's what they're doing here. The bad guys here are the lawyers, ar John Eastman and this Chesebro guy because what they're doing is taking a theory that they know is completely bogus and saying if we get lucky, if Clarence Thomas puts a hold on this, just a procedural hold, then we'll argue that that's something and that should hold up the January 6th count.",

So, it is possible -- possible that he thought he understood Justice Thomas' thinking even if there was no collusion or playing footsie. The only other thing I want to add, Alisyn, is this. I want to tie together what we were talking about before the break with this. President Biden spoke about democracy today.

Let's talk about it with my panel here. I've got Alex Burns, Karen Finney, and Doug Heye. You know, when you look at that and think about that the Capitol Police had monitoring but nobody was watching because she was in Washington, DC. He, of course, lives in California. But this is not the first time we've seen even in this election cycle, toxicity. I mean you wrote a really interesting op-ed for \"The Washington Post,\" Doug and when you were the RNC's Communications Director you were part of the \"Fire Pelosi\" slogan. Tell me about how your thoughts have evolved since then, you say. DOUG HEYE, FMR. RNC COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR: Well, it really started on Friday. Earlier in the week last week, I e-mailed a couple of colleagues and said, \"Hey, whatever happened to the Fire Pelosi banner?\" that frankly I stole one on the last day of my tenure at the RNC. I brought with me. And I want to see what are we going to do with this if this is presumably Nancy Pelosi's last election. And then Friday happened, and it made me think about what rhetoric I'd used in the past, and certainly everything that we see that spins everyone up. And you know, when you start to write about that, you start to get criticisms of both siderism or the other side's worst than mine. So, I want to be introspective, and say, okay, where have I crossed the line? And I don't draw a straight line to the Fire Pelosi campaign in 2010 to what happened last week to Paul Pelosi anymore than I do, say, Chuck Schumer saying Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the whirlwind and pay the price and somebody showing up at his house with a gun. But clearly, you know, if warming waters cause more and frequent -- more frequent and more violent hurricanes, that's what's happening in our political rhetoric right now. So, when Steve Scalise was shot and the two security detail members who worked with him -- I worked in Eric Canner's office when I was there -- David and Crystal, I know them well. Nobody made jokes. We took it seriously. And Mitch McConnell said the right thing. Kevin McCarthy reached out to Speaker Pelosi's office. That's the right thing to do. Republican members shouldn't be joking about this. People in kind of Republican circles didn't because when Gabby Giffords was shot, I went to my office that Saturday morning at the RNC. I was on a conference call with colleagues and John Boehner's office, Eric Canner's office and we wanted to say the right thing and make sure that nobody on our side said the wrong thing.",

They don't have to kind of security the members do. So, they have to watch for themselves so that if it gets to a certain level and they need to go to the police or make someone aware that they know how to do that and to know how to prepare your family for that, right? Because seeing your loved ones viciously attacked like that can really wear down particularly children.
