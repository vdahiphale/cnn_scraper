Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is on his way to Washington for his first foreign trip since Russia's invasion began. A U.S. House committee votes to make six years of Donald Trump's taxes public. We'll discuss what this means for the former president. And 70 million people are under winter alerts in the United States as a phenomenon known as a bomb cyclone develops. For 10 months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has delivered messages of determination and defiance from inside his country amid Russia's unrelenting assault. But at this hour, he is traveling outside Ukraine for the first time since the war began and is headed to Washington. I was visited in the hours ahead will include a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House, as well as an address to a joint meeting of congress. The White House says Mr. Biden invited his Ukrainian counterpart to underscore the United States enduring commitment to Ukraine. In a tweet Mr. Zelenskyy confirmed he is headed to the U.S. to \"Strengthen resilience and defense capabilities.\" The visit will coincide with an announcement by President Joe Biden of another aid package for Ukraine totally almost $2 billion which will include the highly advanced Patriot missile defense systems. CNN's Oren Lieberman has details from the Pentagon.",

      "sentences": "In the next Ukraine security assistance package that we're expecting when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, visits the White House. We're expecting the U.S. to announce two crucial systems that fill two different roles. The first is the Patriot air defense system. One of the most advanced U.S. systems for aerial defense and crucially, and long-range system. That will sit almost like a dome on top of the systems the U.S. has already provided. The medium range NASAMS system and then some of the shorter-range systems such as stingers and MANPADS that the -- that Ukraine is already used for aerial defense. And that's on top of what other countries have also provided. Patriots have their challenges though. They are large, complex systems. So, the training, the maintenance, the sustainment, all of that will take time to learn.And that's part of the process here. The other crucial system that we're learning about, the precision bombing kits, known as JDAM, joint direct attack munitions. That allows Ukraine to turn \"dumb bombs\" into precision guided bombs. We have seen them use with great effect, precision guided munitions, for example, the HIMARS systems, the Excalibur guided artillery systems. All of these have been critical for Ukraine successes on the battlefield. So far, this will largely fill a similar role. These JDAMs. They can be used on a variety of different bombs from 500-pound bombs, up to 2000-pound bombs. They're relatively inexpensive according to (INAUDIBLE) about $22,000 per kit, which is a fraction of the price of the GMLRS munitions that are used with HIMARS and some of the other high-end munitions that have been provided to Ukraine. And yet, they fill that role of precision bombing that can be done at range. So, you don't have to get in very close. The standard JDAMS have a range of about 15 miles and some of the extended range have a range of 40 miles or more. It's unclear exactly what the U.S. will provide at this point. Of course, these have to be air launched, they are launched from fighter jets. So, Ukraine will have to figure out a way to mount these on Soviet era fighter jets that they have so that they can use them and then find a way to be able to control them from a soviet era cockpit. But crucially, Ukraine has shown that ability already. They did it with the U.S.-provided anti-radar missiles and they'll have to do it again here to make this work.

You'll remember at the very beginning of this conflict when the U.S. offered to evacuate President Zelenskyy he said, I don't need a ride. I need ammunition and that really has been the hallmark of the way he has governed this war.He has stayed in the country continuing to meet with troops just that visit yesterday to Bakhmut as sign of that. [02:05:09] I think the timing of this is crucial, 300 days exactly since the start of the conflict coming when the new U.S. Congress is set to take effect on January 3rd. We know that there have been signs from the Republican majority in the House that they may not be as quick to approve new Ukraine aid. So doing this now will be an opportunity for him to garner that bipartisan support to carry out this sort of P.R. exercise. It also comes at a time when Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure and civilian facilities and things like that. And when Ukraine is also very worried that this might proceed a new ground offensive from Russia starting as early as in the new year. Now, President Zelenskyy didn't officially confirm this trip until just about an hour ago. But he did, as I say, visit the front line in Bakhmut yesterday where he was presented with a flag by Ukrainian soldiers to give to the U.S. Congress. Have a listen to what he had to say. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): It is a complicated situation. The enemy increases the number of its troops. Our boys are braver, and we need more sophisticated weapons. We will pass on gratitude from our boys to the U.S. Congress and U.S. president for their support. But it is not enough.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT: Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to have an appearance at the courthouse behind me on Wednesday, which should be if all goes according to plan, his final court appearance in the Bahamas, at least for the foreseeable future. There has been an ongoing fight over his extradition to United States. And on Monday, he looked confused as I sat next to him in the courtroom and other spectators in the courtroom were confused as his attorneys, Bahamian attorney appeared to be on a very different page in this U.S. attorneys who had said that extradition was a likely outcome to his case. But by Monday afternoon, Sam Bankman-Fried's Bahamian attorney said, yes, they had spoken to their client and that he had agreed to be extradited. It was unclear what happened on Tuesday why there continues to be delay. We saw attorneys going in and out of the courthouse behind me, but no clear answers about when extradition will happen until the announcement came that there will be hearing at 11:00 am on Wednesday, and then an attrition could happen as early as Wednesday afternoon. This is the end of Bankman-Fried's stay in the Bahamas, as someone who was considered at the very top of the cryptocurrency game. He'll be leaving the Bahamas, we expect on a U.S. Federal private plane, something he's used to traveling on, but certainly in a very different manner. And when he arrives in New York, it is expected that he'll -- he will be booked there. He is facing eight charges that have convicted could lead over a century in prison. [02:40:07] And then there will be a discussion over whether or not a he can make a bail. A judge will decide in the United States if he is a flight risk. But at this point, Sam Bankman-Fried is agreeing to go home. And we expect that an extradition hearing will be held on Wednesday, is what officials here have said. And we'll finally decide whether or not Sam Bankman-Fried will head back to United States to face the charges waiting from there. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Nassau, the Bahamas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is World Sport and we've got a celebration of a lifetime happening in Buenos Aires where generations of Argentina football fans have welcomed home their first World Cup in 36 years.Tuesday has been declared a national holiday. Lionel Messi and the rest of the team had planned to celebrate with the people, the center of the city, but it just couldn't go on as planned. We've witnessed some jaw-dropping scenes throughout Tuesday, millions, it seems, taking to the streets, culminating in absolute jubilation and pandemonium around the famous Obelisco of the Argentine capital. Just euphoria everywhere you look. People climbing on anything they can see, there's balloons flying in the air, the flags, the shirts, it's in phenomenal, phenomenal stuff. And we believe that is someone somehow got to the top of the obelisk. Many of these people would have heard their parents talk about the late great Diego Maradona winning it in 1986. Well, now they can say they saw Lionel Messi do it and add a third World Cup to this proud footballing nation. Let's go now to Buenos Aires to Stefano Pozzebon and Santi Bauza, who've been there for us all week on the ground, bringing us the sights and the sounds of some of the most passionate fans on the planet. Stefano, let's start with you. You've been out in that sun all day. The team was supposed to arrive at the celebration at noon local, it didn't go as planned. Describe the roller coaster of events and emotion that you've witnessed today. STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Yes, he did. I mean, it's a day that really felt like a week having lived it through. We had, of course, fans, thousands of fans chanting and jumping from the very early hours from before I woke up today at 6:00 A.M. local time. And then we had military flight -- military plane flying over the avenue. And then as soon as it was clear that the Albiceleste, the national football team on their open bus would not have been able to stream through that ocean of people behind my back and arrive here and the Obelisco. The security protocol decided to provide a helicopter and the Lionel Messi together with the head coach, Lionel Scaloni, and star, Rodrigo de Paul, flew over with a chopper, a helicopter, over the 9th of July Avenue and that was just the culmination of these a party that has been participated by over four million people. Just imagine four million people into the streets of Buenos Aires at least even more probably to greet Messi and his teammates. And the party, let me tell you, Coy, is still going strong because I can see from here, from our vantage point, just a few floors below us, it's the floor of the 9th Avenue, and well, there are still hundreds of fans chanting, jumping and singing it and Leonel Messi and their incredible achievement, Coy.",
