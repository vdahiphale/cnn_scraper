But the trick is, you don't want it to start to replace otheractivities. You don't want them to not go out and play. You don't want them to, you know, not read a book. That's the problem is when it starts replacing actual human interaction. Some of the down sides of screen time, pediatricians will tell you, are things like sleep problems or children can start to get lower grades. They don't have enough outdoor activities. They develop mood problems. There are ramifications to too much screen time. I know it's a delicate thing to say how much is too much, but I think you can sort of watch your child and sense when they've had too much time in front of a screen when enough is enough.",
