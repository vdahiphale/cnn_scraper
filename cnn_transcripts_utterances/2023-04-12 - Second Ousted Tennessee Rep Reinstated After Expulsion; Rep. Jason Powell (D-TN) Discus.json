Hang there for us, if you would. We do also want to welcome now a Democratic member of the Tennessee State House Representative Jason Powell. Sir, good to have you with us. I guess, first question, understandably is what's your reaction to what we are seeing now play out in Memphis? REP. JASON POWELL (D-TN): Hi. I'm very excited. This is a movement that has - is underway. I'm so excited to have my colleague Justin J. Pearson back. I already have my colleague here from Nashville. Justin Jones back with us. I personally have been affected by gun violence. This hit very close to home. I am a father. I have a son who was in third grade. He's nine years old. I was at my son's school, reading to his class the morning that this shooting happened at Covenant School. The little boy that was murdered is a member and was on the team, The Reds (ph), in the Creek (ph) Hall Little League where my son plays. That's how close this hits to home. And I am so energized and excited, hopeful that we are going to finally tackle this issue of gun violence in the State of Tennessee. But the excitement today is about Rep. Pearson, Rep. Jones coming back, fighting against this undemocratic process that we saw on the State of Tennessee where they were expelled for office. It was a shame, but the people have spoken, the county commission in Shelby County did the right thing today. The people of Nashville and our city council did the right thing. We have reappointed our colleagues back and we are going to continue on this movement continue to fight for true gun reform and stop gun violence in the United States of America and make the starting point here in Nashville and in Tennessee.",

But we should reflect on the past experiences of Americans who have been wrongfully detained in Russia.   For Trevor Reed, it took almost two years to negotiate a deal for a prisoner swap to get him home. For Brittney Griner, it took about 10 months. That was a shorter timeline in comparison to some other Americans where it's taken years to negotiate some sort of deal to bring them home. So if past is precedent, they're not in a situation where this is going to happen overnight. It's going to be quite a process. Of course, one that we will track closely. We should note that President Biden did call Evan Gershkovich's family earlier this week and here's what they said about that phone call in a statement saying, \"We appreciate President Biden's call to us today, assuring us that the U.S. government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible. There is a hole in our hearts and in our family that won't be filled until we are reunited.\" Now, the other thing as you mentioned in the introduction there is that Evan Gershkovich still hasn't had consular access. He hasn't been able to visit with U.S. diplomats. That's something that the Secretary of State said U.S. officials are pressing for on a daily basis with Russia. We heard from the Russian Foreign Ministry for Foreign Affairs Spokesperson saying that they're working that out in due course and not being very definitive about when that's going to happen, guys?",
