      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a devastating claim by Hamas is overshadowing what could beanother day of joyful family reunions in Israel as more hostages could be released from Gaza anytime. Without providing evidence, Hamas says the youngest Israeli hostage, a ten-month old baby boy was killed at an early Israeli airstrike along with his four-year-old brother and their mother. Israel says it is assessing that claim. And while we are expecting another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners soon, it could be the last unless a truce has already been extended by two days is extended once again. But we are already seeing some movement on the ground today. A Red Cross convoy entered the Rafah Crossing from the Gaza side, and according to the IDF, two women are now back inside Israeli territory. This after Hamas said it handed over two female Russian hostages to the Red Cross in Gaza. All this happening amid a scramble to keep the truce going. Qatar is spearheading negotiations involving U.S., Israel and Egypt. It says -- it tells CNN, it is hopeful an extension will be announced by the end of the day. Keeping an eye on all these developments for us is our Jeremy Diamond who is following -- who joins us tonight from Ofakim in southern Israel. And Jeremy, let's start first on the status of today's plain -- planned hostages release. We've heard two hostages had been released so far. Why only two, and what about the rest?",

      "sentences": "Well, it appears that those two hostages that have already been released are outside of the framework ofthis negotiation. We have watched now as earlier this week, there was another Russian-Israeli citizen Roni Kriboy, who was released outside of this framework. These are Israeli citizens, but they also have dual citizenship with Russia, and it appears that there is a side arrangement being made with the assistance of the Russian government to secure their release. We are still waiting of course for the ten additional Israeli hostages to be released today who are part of that framework agreement. We have watched as yesterday, ten Israelis were released. Today, ten more expected to be released as part of this two-day extension of the original deal to see women and children released as part of this pause in the fighting. But now, the question is turning very much to whether or not there will be an additional extension. We are just three hours away from midnight, and still questions looming about whether or not that truce can be extended. We know that they are active negotiations with the CIA director in Doha, Qatar, alongside the Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari intelligence counterparts, and they're working to see whether or not they can extend this deal. The initial focus will still be on trying to get all of the women and children held captive in Gaza out first, but there is also a broader negotiation beginning to brew as well, and that one is focusing on men and Israeli soldiers as well. Those will come at a much higher price for the Israeli government in terms of the types of -- and the number perhaps of Palestinian prisoners that they will have to release from prisons. So a lot of efforts being made today, I was told earlier today by U.S. official that things were looking good in terms of securing perhaps a one or two-day additional extension focused on those women and children, but whether something broader can be achieved is another question altogether.",

The Palestinian Health Ministry says two children were shot dead by Israeli forces in Jenin today, including an eight-year-old boy. Israel launched a major incursion in Jenin yesterday, saying it was conducting counterterrorism activities. Doctors Without Borders says two Palestinians were killed on Tuesday after Israeli military vehicles blocked ambulances from reaching them. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Israeli forces with bulldozers and Jeeps entered the camp under the cover of darkness. This has become a routine. And this is the usual aftermath, wreckage and rubble, asphalt roads plowed down to the dirt. Once the damage is repaired, there is another raid, and it's the same thing all over again. (on camera):  For almost two years, a low intensity war has been raging in the occupied West Bank. Residents here in Jenin's refugee camp say that there have been more than 30 Israeli military incursions since August of this year. (voice-over):  The camp is home to militants who Israel has accused of involvement in attacks on Israelis, but here, those whom Israel calls terrorists are seen as fighters against a decades-long military occupation. Well, Al-Diam Kuskas(ph) is not a fighter, he works for the local government. (on camera):  I guess it's the kids room -- (voice-over):  But last week, Israeli soldiers took over his home during yet another raid. As he shows me around, the remains of what was a family's life crunched under our shoes. Brutal is how Al-Diam(ph) sums up the soldiers' behavior. Scars of battles passed pockmark the camp's walls, debris on almost every corner. Houm Sami(ph) shows me spent cartridges on the floor of her house, saying Israeli troops used this room to fire down into the street. \"They took my husband, bound his hands and pushed him outside in the cold\", she says. \"They kept him there from 6:00 in the evening until 5:00 in the morning.\" Eventually, the soldiers let him go, but took away her recently- married son. After ransacking his bedroom searching for weapons. Eighteen- year-old Mahmoud Abu-Hege(ph) was shot last Thursday evening, shot through his bedroom window. His mother, Hidam(ph), holding a bloodstained towel, recounts how Israeli soldiers wouldn't allow medics to take him to hospital. \"I was sure we were going to the hospital\", she says. \"We went downstairs. A second officer was there and made the medics put the stretcher down. Mahmoud(ph) bled to death in front of his home.\" Tuesday night, Israeli forces raided the camp again, sparking gun battles with militants, and in the process, Israeli troops killed at least four people, including this eight-year-old boy, and then they left.

But what we've seen is increasingly, the Israeli government has been focusing on the West Bank while we have, you know, high extremist ministers in the Israeli government are pushing the idea of expanding settlements, empowering the settlers, more handing out weapons to them. So certainly, what we're seeing is that there is more unrest among the Palestinians who aren't happy with this, but more than that, I think the Israelis see the situation in the West Bank and are trying to sort of keep the natives under control, so-to-speak, but increasing as they watch what's going on in Gaza.

So, that group ostensibly could be covered under the existing agreement, and so if they could extend the truce another couple of days, perhaps, you can get most of them out. But once it gets to the men, Hamas is facing internal pressure. It's got Palestinian-Islamic Jihad among other terrorist groups inside the territory who want a higher price. They're saying we are not going to turn over the Israeli soldiers that were holding all the men of military age, unless we see far more Palestinians released from Israeli jails. And at this point, it's upwards of 8 to 9,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

He was there yesterday meeting with Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian counterparts. The belief, Isa, is that this current pause for women and children can be extended by two more days. We will know in the coming hours, because what happens every evening is that Hamas releases a list, hands over a list of the 10 people that they expect to release the following day.

And so we could get to a scenario, in which all of the women and children who Hamas can find or has in their custody, have been released.

And in fact, moments ago, we just saw those two Russian Israeli women, who have been released by Hamas. Not as part of the framework of the deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the Qatari government, but rather a part of a side agreement that appears between Hamas and the Russian government. These two women, Yelena Trupanov and Irena Tati, released by Hamas today. And we just saw them come through. I saw one of those women actually waving at the crowd as the van that she was in slowed down to make it around this roundabout. And she was certainly smiling and very happy to be welcomed home in such a way. And these are the kinds of scenes of joy that are happening across Israel, as loved ones are being reunited with their family members. But beyond the family, it is clear from the scene behind me and talking to Israelis around the country that people feel so involved. They feel connected to these hostages, to the fate of these hostages. And that is why you are witnessing scenes like the one behind me right now.",

We are still waiting to see exactly when they will get out.

There've been active conversations between Israeli, American, Qatari,Egyptian officials, all involved in trying to secure an extension of this truce. I spoke earlier today with a senior Israeli official, who made very clear to me that they are looking to extend this pause. But what they want to see is all women and children released before they move on to a broader conversation about the men and the soldiers who are still believed to be held captive by Hamas. They want Hamas to fulfill the initial part of this agreement and extend that agreement effectively until it is achieved. And then there can move -- the conversation can move to another agreement. A broader agreement that would, of course, come at a much higher price for the Israeli government in terms of who and how many Palestinian prisoners they would need to be released and perhaps some other conditions that could also be thrown in.",

What are you hearing from your source, what are you hearing from the United States?

POPE FRANCIS, PONTIFF, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator):  I am still not well with this flu. And my voice is not nice. NADEAU (voice-over):  Since his election in March 2013, the pontiff has taken 44 trips to 62 countries. But he has also had some serious medical problems and has been hospitalized three times in the last two years.
