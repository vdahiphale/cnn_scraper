      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Today an abortion case with implications everywhere. A Texas, Trump appointed judge will decide if pills to terminate pregnancies should be pulled off the shelf from coast to coast.Plus, more economic turbulence today. As American markets tumble on fears a big global bank might go over the edge. And wrong, disturb, the Neville Chamberlain approach. Senate Republicans in Washington say the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is way off target to suggest the United States to forget about Ukraine. Up first for us this hour though, a Texas courtroom clash over abortion that may echo in women's lives no matter where in this country you live. The case, the alliance of Hippocratic medicine versus the FDA. The plaintiffs are an amalgamation of five out of state anti-abortion groups. Their argument that the FDA put politics ahead of science two decades ago, ignoring they say evidence and safety rules when it approved, mifepristone, excuse me, to go on the market. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used to terminate pregnancies. The venue here is as important perhaps even more important than the specific legal arguments. Today's hearing happening in Amarillo, Texas, where the federal bench is occupied by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. He is a Trump appointee, cited by many court watchers as perhaps the most reliable anti Biden's judge on the federal bench. We start in Texas, with CNN's Rosa Flores. Rosa, walk us through the arguments here.",

      "sentences": "Well, CNN producer Ashley Killough, literally just walked out of court and she briefed me, John, she says that the plaintiffs are the only ones who have argued so far. And they've argued on the merits and standing. The judges asked them a lot of questions. But the judge doesn't appear to be questioning with much skepticism. But we do know that the sharpest question that this judge has asked so far of the plaintiffs, as he's asking the plaintiffs to point to another case, where a judge has been asked to do what this judge has been asked to do. In this case, this judge has been asked to block the FDA approval of this abortion drug. And the plaintiffs have not been able to point to a case. That is why this case is so unprecedented.And so important, because the plaintiffs can't point to another instance, in which a judge has ordered the FDA to remove another drug from the shelf. Now, what the plaintiffs have been able to do is point to other instances in which the FDA has suspended approvals on its own. And again, this is the FDA doing it on its own. That's what the plaintiffs are using to argue here. But the big stakes, of course, that we're talking about here are unprecedented because in this case, the plaintiffs which are a coalition of anti-abortion groups are asking a judge to do the scientist's job. What the FDA does, they study this. They have protocols and procedures to approve drugs for use for the American people. And the plaintiffs in this case, in this injunction hearing, they're asking the judge to circumvent all that. The judge is not a subject matter expert in this case. But they're asking him to overrun the scientist, John, that's what's so unprecedented. And I should add that the FDA has not been able to argue just yet, but the hearing is ongoing in the building that you see behind me. John?",

He was a former attorney for a Christian Law Firm, actually worked with some anti-abortion groups.He has issued a number of rulings, contrary to the Biden administration's positions, including Texas versus Biden, which is an immigration remain in Mexico policy. In a case against the Department of Health and Human Services evolve birth control. You see the anti LGBTQ discrimination case there. Again, past does not guarantee future.

As anyone who you'll see and there's really an element here of judge shopping. Whenever you're a plaintiff, you want to land in front of a favorable judge.Usually, if you go to certain districts, they will randomly assign the case to any judge. You might get a conservative judge, you might get a liberal judge, you might get a centrist judge. The weird thing here is in this particular vicinage, in Texas, this Judge Kacsmaryk is the only judge. And so, we've seen a lot of people challenging Biden administration policies, by trying to find some way some hook to go into this district because they know they're going to this judge who, as you say, has a history of ruling against Biden administration policies.",

If we're looking at this strategically, they know they're going to get this Judge Kacsmaryk, who may well issue a nationwide injunction.The next step for the defendants for the FDA and the government is to go up to the court of appeals. This is the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. This is largely seen as the most conservative court of appeals in the country. And then the next step, of course, is the U.S. Supreme Court. They can't force them to take the case, but it's up to the Supreme Court. And of course, there's a six to three conservative majority in this court as well. This is the same court that overturned Roe versus Wade. So yes, the deck is really stacked in favor of the plaintiffs here judicially.",

With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Lauren Fox, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, and Tia Mitchell of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.And it's just striking that we're looking now at a federal courthouse in West Texas, Amarillo, Texas. Washington is essentially a bystander in the abortion debate now because of what the Supreme Court did in the Dobbs' decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The impact here could be giant. Look at the statistics, this is from the CDC, more than half of women got an abortion using pills in 2020, of all abortions nationally was 51 percent, of abortions before 10 weeks, it was 64 percent. So, this one judge in West Texas, again, there would be appeals and everything, but has the ability to have another earthquake, just like the Dobbs' decision. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yes. And you know, right now, Washington is out of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be. You know, Congress could intervene and create some laws that clarify access to abortion, clarify whatever limitations or medications or clarify the FDA's role in that. But we know that there's gridlock in Congress on this issue. We know that Republicans in the House are likely to block any progress on this issue. And now we're leaving it up to the courts. And again, as it has been laid out right now, this particular lawsuit is on a trajectory that keeps it within courts that have a conservative bent, and it means that there is really risk to access to abortion on a national level.",

And you have to remember that the effort by anti-abortion activists for a very long time in this country was restricting abortions in states by making it more difficult to get appointments to go to clinics to make those clinics more sparsely populated in those states. And so, I think that one of the issues you're going to run into is the backlog issue.And it is something that, you know, Congress could step in, and Congress could have a voice in this issue, and they likely won't for many reasons, one of them the Republicans in the House of Representatives. But also, the fact that you have Republican senators as well. And you have a filibuster in the Senate who believe in this issue of restricting abortion access.",

But this is from the Guttmacher Institute, which is a pro- choice organization, but which was a very good job tracking the impact across the country.Says, the states that would be hit hardest here. If there's a ban on abortion pills, you see in Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington. Iowa on that list, Jeff Zeleny, the vice president United States, you're part of the reporting going to make her first trip to Iowa during the administration of political trip to talk about this specific issue, reproductive rights. Democrats believe it helps them at the ballot box. At the moment, though, because of the divided government here in Washington because of the close margins in both the House and the Senate, there's no legislative solution in sight.

Down the road, this is something that is also as you said, a seismic a potential shock. I'm told Vice President Harris, who's going to Iowa on Thursday to put some Democratic ideas in the air. There's been a lot of Republicans there, of course, Donald Trump, but Ron DeSantis, others, so she's going to try and balance some things, but this has been front and center for her abortion rights access. And we should point out, there are majorities of Americans in both parties overall, who support the idea of this medication for abortion. So, it's not, you know, certainly divided on partisan lines. But this is, you know, it's a judge shopping as Elie said without question, and this is one of the fallouts for a while elections matter, and these Trump judges are still very much important.

Now, this is on top of concerns that we've seen about Credit Suisse that European bank is down 24 percent as we speak, it's down at record lows. Now turmoil at Credit Suisse is nothing new. They've been in trouble for years. What is new, though, is that their biggest backer, a Saudi bank has signaled that they are not going to add any new funding here. And also, just in the last few minutes, we got word from the Treasury Department, the Treasury Department's spokesperson saying that Treasury is monitoring the situation at Credit Suisse and has been in touch with global counterparts.

Today you have the Credit Suisse development, and more volatility and turmoil in the markets. Is this a case where there are five or six banks that are a little wobbly?

You know, people are asking why the government acted on Sunday to basically bail out the uninsured depositors of these two banks. And I think we're seeing right now, why they did act that way.The concern on Sunday was that if you make people who have large, uninsured deposits, that includes companies that are making payroll, if they're worried about those deposits, this was the bank, Silicon Valley Bank, a week ago, you know, there were some problems known, but people thought it was generally a strong franchise. And if the bank fails two days later, and still nobody has emerged as a acquirer of the bank, that causes a loss of confidence. And so, the worry was on Sunday, if you don't do something to backstop these uninsured deposits, what is to stop other people with large deposits at similarly situated banks from taking their money on Monday morning, and saying, you know what, I'm going to put it at Chase or a Citi or Wells Fargo, because I won't get in trouble if, you know, if the bank I have the money in right now goes down.

Don't put any more pressure strain on the banking industry.

And so, they have to figure out which one to focus on more.If the banking problems somehow get resolved, which you know, what's happening this morning with Credit Suisse markets now see that as much less likely that this gets resolved. It makes it harder for the Fed to raise interest rates next week. And already we're seeing investors betting on an interest rate cuts later this year, John. So, it's a difficult position for them to be in. But they're going to have to do something on financial stability and the stability of the banking system.

Yesterday, John Kirby, the strategic coordinator for the National Security Council said, the U.S. had taken steps to protect its equities but wouldn't go into further detail.We now know from two U.S. officials familiar with the incident, that step that was taken was erasing or wiping the software from the drone. The sensitive software that runs the drone and is in charge of collecting the intelligence, collecting the signals that the drone uses and then passes on to the U.S. upon its landing. Remotely the operators of the drone were able to wipe the drone and erase that software such that it wouldn't fall into Russian hands or frankly, other hands after the U.S. brought it down in the Black Sea. A senior Russian official said on Russian state TV that the Russians would try to recover the drone. It's not the aircraft itself, the hardware, if you will, that's the sensitive part. It is the software and that's the step the U.S. went to protect by erasing it and wiping it remotely from the drone before it crashed into the Black Sea. The U.S. doesn't have naval assets or ships in the Black Sea that would be able to expeditiously carry out a recovery effort. So, this John, is now we know the steps the U.S. took to make sure sensitive information intelligence didn't fall into the wrong hands.",
