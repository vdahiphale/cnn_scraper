He writes, \"There's no way I can get a fair trial with the judge assigned to this ridiculous Freedom of Speech/fair elections case. Everyone knows this, and so does she. We will immediately be asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds. And likewise for a venue change out of D.C. Now, the venue change, I think is no huge surprise, and perhaps not a surprise that he wants out from this judge. This is Judge Tanya Chutkan, who has been hearing a lot of January 6 cases.

And in some of the previous rulings, she's been pretty tough. She said here in November 2021, \"Presidents are not kings. This plaintiff is not President.\" And this is after Trump left office. There's also another ruling in 2021 where she said, \"It has been made clear that trying to stop the peaceful transition of power, assaulting law enforcement, is going to be met with certain punishment.\" So these are tough statements, but they're also reasonable statements that any judge would make.

There's basically no grounds to seek recusal at this point.Also, the number of defendants she's seen who are January 6 defendants, this is D.C., all of these cases are going through here. There's not a judge in that courthouse who hasn't heard a dozen or more of these cases, and impose sentences on people who have been sent to jail. So I don't think that fact is notable either. With respect to his quite reasonable desire to want to have this heard any place other than D.C., I think he'll face a tall order there as well. It's -- we saw this in the George Floyd case, very hard to go into federal court and make the argument that you can't get a fair trial in one city because of the publicity around that issue, when the publicity is actually nationwide. There's no place in this country that he could go to have a criminal trial that hasn't heard anything about January 6 or his role in it.

That is what he wants to be focusing on.And it's clear through these posts that he is angry. We also can tell that this is a playbook that Donald Trump has used since 2016. When you look at some of the posts, and I don't think we need to get into all of them, they're not all just about this case, they're also -- you talk Nancy Pelosi and her family with outrageous claims. That is exactly what we saw in 2016. It becomes more and more escalated. The more and more he feels like he's getting coverage on it. And so that is what he is trying to do right now. I also will tell you that I know from people who are close to him from his advisers that he's riled up, that he was essentially chomping on the bit before heading down to court on Thursday. He didn't want to be there, but he also was out there putting messages on social media, getting people spun up. And that's part of his playbook too, always trying to control his own media narrative. PHILLIP: It's incredibly risky, it seems to me, that special counsel put a flag down basically saying, you do something, we're going to take it to the courts and see what the judge says.
