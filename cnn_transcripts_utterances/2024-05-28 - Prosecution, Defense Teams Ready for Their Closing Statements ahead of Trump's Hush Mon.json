Trump meanwhile has been railing on Truth Social on Monday he posted this and I'm quoting him. \"Why is the corrupt government allowed to make the final argument in the case against me? Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair, witch hunt!\" Well, it's actually normal for the prosecution to get the final word when they must bear the burden of proof.

LEGAL AFFAIRS REPORTER, \"POLITICO\": Well, I think that Trump's side has probably more to do here because they're going to need to stitch together sort of things that they have left hanging in various arguments. They have put out a number of different issues that they want the jury to consider as the prosecution case was presented. Remember, the defense didn't really call very many witnesses compared to the prosecution, maybe 10 percent as many, only two witnesses. One was sort of almost trivial to put in some phone records. And so they have been cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses, but not necessarily trying to string together a full theory of what happened, whereas I think the prosecution's theory is pretty evident. So even though the prosecution has the burden of proof, I think the defense is going to have to try to make a more, if not consistent, more explained argument than they have thus far.

Israel is facing growing international outrage over Sunday's airstrike in Rafah, which Gaza officials say killed at least 45 people and injured more than 200 at a camp for displaced Palestinians. According to a U.S. official, Israel claims an explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby, starting a fire which tore through the camp, though that explanation has not been confirmed.

Yes, in a remote and isolated part of Enga province in the north of the country. But it was seen as a transit point. This highway, major highway seen as the lifeline of the region, ran straight through this village. And it had shops. It had a school, a church, a gas station. It had a lodge. So there were a lot of people who lived in this village. Hence, the death toll rose from 100 on Friday up to 600, 700 on the weekend. And then in the last 24 hours, more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive. Now, because the site is so unstable, Rosemary, it is very hard to get this heavy equipment that has been shipped in onto the site. It's just impossible for them to operate. So rescuers, villagers are using shovels, sticks, their bare hands to try and find the bodies. This is very much a recovery operation. Six bodies have been recovered so far.

It's a Japanese term for people who cut themselves off from society, sometimes for months or even years. It affects an estimated 1.5 million people in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. But it's showing up in other countries as well. The rise of the internet, COVID isolation and financial or academic pressures are often cited as causes.Joining me now is Hamish McLeod, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Glasgow. Appreciate you being with us. HAMISH J. MCLEOD, PROF. OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW: Pleasure to be here.",

It's often the family members that will be the ones who identify the problem and they'll sometimes have been waiting for months and in some cases years before things get bad enough for them to seek help from services.And then the diagnosis usually involves trying to rule out that there's not another explanation. So sometimes there are problems such as anxiety disorders or other kinds of mental health conditions. But basically, if the person's had persistent withdrawal for more than six months without contact outside of the home and no other role functioning such as engagement, employment or work or training, then that usually would lead to the conclusion that the person's showing the hikikomori pattern.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it's probably important to think of it not necessarily as something that affects only a particular age group, but the onset certainly affects younger people more. And that makes sense partly because this is when a lot of the initial steps into adult life and attempt to achieve cherished goals like completion of university or getting employment and leaving home, all of these things tend to come on at late adolescence, early adulthood.But in Japan, where hikikomori was first identified in the 1990s after the economic contraction there, some of those people have ended up staying in their withdrawn state sometimes well into their 50s and 60s. And now as their elderly parents are passing away, these people are being re-identified in society. So it affects people across the age range, but the onset is younger. And to your question about how to help, one of the first things I think is that it's the families around the person that may need the first port of contact and help with how to communicate with and reconnect with their family member. The helping of people with hikikomori in the longer term tends to involve gradual re-exposure and reintroduction into social roles, things like work and employment, sometimes group therapies that encourage social interaction and then gradual re-exposure to roles and responsibilities can help people recover. And it is important that some people do recover very much back to normal functioning with the right support.",
