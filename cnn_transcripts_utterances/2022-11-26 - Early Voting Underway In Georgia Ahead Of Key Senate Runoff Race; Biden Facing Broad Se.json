Should also beware of scams.

And people should also remember that this isn't just related to RSV because the hospitals both adult and pediatric are overrun with patients that may have flu, RSV and our COVID. It's actually hard for us to take care of any patients. So even if you feel like your kids in the clear, or you're not particularly worried about getting flu or RSV, any kind of illness, a heart attack, a car accident, will be something that would land you in the emergency department and you may not be able to be as well taken care of as you could because we're overwhelmed with the number of sick patients that we're seeing due to this rise in the tripledemic, all three of these viruses really hitting the population hard at the same time.

And that won't really target our hospitals, we won't see that rise until mid- December. And then we'll come up on the heels of travel related to Christmas. So all of us in health care are really bracing for what could be an onslaught of really sick patients. And so I really implore everyone to take this seriously.

And that is true, both of the COVID vaccine and the flu vaccine. The patients that I see that have flu and COVID that have been vaccinated have much more mild symptoms, often are patients I can discharge home and are avoiding having serious complications and/or infecting other people who may be at risk in their family.

West became engulfed in controversy as you guys know in October, after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast. Those antisemitic remarks by West cause companies that he was affiliated with including Adidas to sever their relationships with him. But more recently, he's been spending time with Nick Fuentes, who the Anti-Defamation League has identified as a white supremacist.Fuentes has also been banned from most major social media platforms for his white nationalist rhetoric. In the video that was posted to Twitter on Thursday, he claimed that Trump is really impressed with Fuentes. But a source familiar with the dinner told our Kristen Holmes that Fuentes was a guest of Kanye's and was not invited by the former president. And I just want to read to you the former president statement on this on Truth Social. He said, \"This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.\" So the former President clearly trying to distance himself here from Fuentes. But he did not ask him to leave the club, which would have of course been his right. And we've seen a Trump use this pattern of behavior before when he has been associated with controversial figures.",

Maeve Reston, thank you for that report.Meanwhile, another political firebrand, the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, she has lost her bid to win a seat in the House of Representatives. Palin's defeat is the latest political setback for someone who was once considered a rising star of the Republican Party. Joining us to discuss this is Julian Zelizer, he is a CNN Political Analyst and historian, as well as professor at Princeton University. Julian, thanks so much for joining us. You just wrote a very interesting opinion piece on CNN.com. And you make the case that Sarah Palin has lost the battle but won the war. You say, quote, \"Palin's political legacy will endure. The former Alaska governor was a pivotal figure in mainstreaming a new style of Republican politics that ignored traditional guardrails. Her brand of conservative populism weaponized social and cultural outrage and mobilize working class Americans. Palin, in short, mastered Trumpism long before Donald Trump ever set foot in the White House.\" So Julian, how is it that the person who arguably unleashed this phenomenon may now be out of politics?",

The island nation is letting visitors swim with them for the first time to learn and help boost tourism. Patrick Oppmann takes us underwater.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Usually they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean. But sharks are the reason why we have come here to the waters off eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba, perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world, but the ones we see seem mostly curious. Swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guide Lazaro says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them. The shark is the perfect machine, and the perfect predator, he says. It's inspiring, emotional and satisfying to interact with them. Marine biologists say robust shark populations are necessary to maintain healthy coral reefs. In 2015, Cuba placed restrictions on shark fishing, one of an increasing number of countries in the Caribbean to realize that sharks are not only important to the environment, but a way to track visitors. (on-camera): People in the Caribbean used to commonly catch and kill sharks, either for food or because they were considered a nuisance. But warmer countries in this region are now taking steps to protect sharks. It's not just about conservation, shark tourism, visitors specifically, coming to a country to dive with sharks, can generate millions of dollars in revenue. (voice-over): Just before her first dive with sharks, Canadian tourist Carrie tells us she's been terrified of them ever since seeing jaws.",
