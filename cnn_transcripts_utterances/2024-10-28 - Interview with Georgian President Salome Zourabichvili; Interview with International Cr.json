I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In Tbilisi, Georgia, voters have come out to protest the results of this weekend's elections. Opposition leaders claim the vote was tainted by Russian interference. Outside observers report troubling conditions, citing pervasive intimidation of voters inside and outside polling stations. Videos like this are circulating, claiming blatant ballot stuffing at one election precinct. And this contested election is not happening in a vacuum. In Moldova, in Lithuania, in the Czech Republic and now, in Georgia, there are persistent allegations of Russian interference. As Moscow uses various methods of hybrid warfare to deter countries formerly in its orbit from moving closer to the west. Now, the Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili is leading the opposition response. She says, recognizing these elections, quote, \"would be tantamount to legitimizing Russia's takeover of Georgia.\" And she is joining us now from Tbilisi.

That's all they are saying today. They're listening to the political parties and to their game plans that they are proposing. And that will continue probably the next days. I don't know exactly when. Now, the outcome of all these is twofold. One is that they are calls for international investigation to add to the evidence that has been gathered here to show the image, the global image, the massive image of the manipulation and intimidation that happened. And then, the pressure probably will come from European and American governments that have also called for an international investigation that pressures on the government to review -- re-examine the results of this election.

Moscow has been constantly complimenting, including very recently the result of the elections, complimenting the Georgian Dream and making sure that they are conformed to the propaganda of Russia on many issues that are very common between this government and Moscow. And the interest of Moscow in this is to make sure that Georgia does not follow up on the path towards Europe. We have gotten the candidate status last December. We were very close to starting our path to opening of negotiations of adhesion and that is what displeases Moscow. And every move that the Georgian government has made this year is clearly designed to go against all of the recommendations of the European Commission to make sure that we don't get the approval of the European leaders and the European Commission to closer to the E.U.",

With one Revolutionary Guard commander vowing action, while President Masoud Pezeshkian says we do not seek war. He warns, though, that tensions will escalate if Israel continues its aggression, he says. Iran reports five people were killed in the attack on Friday night, but Israeli targets avoided nuclear sites, energy production facilities, and leadership positions. So, will Israel and Iran revert to their shadowboxing deterrent postures, or will this direct confrontation escalate?

And I've been arguing from the beginning of this year, the more Israel succeeds in weakening Iran's regional deterrence, the moreit fails by pushing Iran towards the ultimate deterrent, which are nuclear weapons. But the reason I say it's not as straightforward for the Iranians is that their nuclear program is deeply penetrated by Israeli and western intelligence. And so, if they decide to dash towards nuclear weapons, it will probably be detected and it would, in and of itself, become an invitation for an attack by Israel or the United States. Also, they can reach highly enriched nuclear material. That doesn't mean they have a deliverable nuclear weapon. The weaponization process takes about six to 18 months. And in that period, they're vulnerable. But even if we take it to the ultimate end game, if they have nuclear weapons, this year alone, Iran has attacked both Pakistan and Israel, two nuclear weapon states.

You have a disconnect where the junior partner in the Alliance has the grander vision for the region, and the senior party is left trying to respond to events. This is not a good place for the United States to be. Core to the assumption of the Israelis is that in a wider war, the United States will be doing the fighting.

Now, there is a hope that after the elections, whether Democrats win or lose, and President Biden would have less to lose and would think about his legacy more, and therefore, would be willing to exercise more pressure on Israel and pull the plug on this cycle of escalation, which by definition is not going to have any winners.",

Choreographer Bill T. Jones first staged \"Still/Here\" at the height of the AIDS epidemic. And while his piece confronts everyone's mortality, one prominent dance critic at the time had labeled the work victim art, a claim to martyrdom by a gay black man. Well, that man, Bill T. Jones, begs to differ. And three decades later, he's asking new audiences to weigh the artistic merits of the piece for themselves.

It's titled \"Mass Deportation: Devastating Costs to America, Its Budget and Economy.\" Now, just -- you went through this kind of theoretical exercise almost, and really just looked very specifically at what sort of costs it would be if we were to be able to do something like this. So, why write this now? AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN IMMIGRATION COUNCIL:  Well, right now we are at a time where mass deportation has become a popular topic for politicians and policymakers to propose. And given that issue, it's important for the public to understand, what does mass deportation actually mean? It's not just some theoretical, amorphous idea, we're talking about an U.S. law enforcement operation designed to round up over 13 million people over a period of time and to deport them outside of the United States. And that is a huge operation which would have dramatic consequences for the United States, its economy, and its people.",

How'd you come to that number? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  Yes, well, that number was calculated in the most conservative way possible, because it is the estimate just of the theoretical costs of a single one-time mass deportation operation, presuming no costs change currently. And we calculated that by looking at four individual costs. The costs of arresting people, the costs of detaining them, the cost of processing them for removal, and then the cost of actually carrying out those deportations. And we calculated an average cost, using today's prices, per each part of that and multiplied it by the affected population. But that doesn't take into account all the additional costs that would be needed to carry out this kind of staggeringly large operation, which is why we also developed an estimate for what it would take to deport 1 million people a year.",

Do we physically have the manpower, so to speak, to do it? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  Well, right now, ICE does not have that manpower. The agency has several internal divisions that carry out arrests of people in the communities, and the two big ones are what's known as the Criminal Apprehension Program and the Fugitive Apprehension Program. And so, Fugitive Operations is the department inside ICE that goes out into the community and arrests people who are targets. And primarily those in the Criminal Apprehension Program are mostly going to state and local jails and picking up people who are already in custody. So, as you can imagine, that's much easier. If somebody is already in jail, the federal officer just has to show up and have custody transferred. But if people are out in the community, you need to send officers out to do an arrest. And that is much more expensive. In the Trump administration, we calculated and looked at the Trump administration and really the error, which we have the best data for. So, that was 2016 through 2020. And during that period, the average ICE arrests during that period, fugitive arrests were less than 30,000. So, right now, the Fugitive Program is really only going after tens of thousands of people a year, but not that many overall, considering there are over 13 million potentially removable people in the country. And so, looking at that, the U.S. does not have that manpower right now and would either have to hire hundreds of thousands of people to do this in a short- term, or 31,000 people to do it for a million a year. And otherwise, if they couldn't hire those people, they'd have to pull them from other law enforcement agencies, which means you would have the people investigating child pornography suddenly taken off to go after some grandma who's been here for decades.",

What are the economic costs if we weretheoretically to take 13 million people out of the existing U.S. economy and the roles that they perform today? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  Estimates are that undocumented immigrants are anywhere from 4 to 5 percent of the U.S. workforce. And so, if you carry out mass deportations, you are shrinking the U.S. labor force significantly. And that is going to affect the overall economy, because it's not the case that immigration is a zero-sum game, that if one immigrant comes here, that's one American who doesn't get a job. That's because immigrants also help create jobs, not only through their consumer demand, but also because they often start businesses or help ensure that American businesses can stay active and keep hiring others. So, when you look at a mass deportation operation of this population, we estimate that mass deportations would lead to a drop in U.S. gross domestic product of anywhere from 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent. And I know that sounds theoretical, you can throw these numbers around, but for context, that is larger than the Great Recession. In the height of the Great Recession, there were 15 million Americans out of work.",

What's wrong with that thinking? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  Yes, I mean, part of that is wrong because there is a labor shortage and there just simply aren't enough Americans to take these jobs. You know, if you cut all of these people out of the population, there will be certain jobs that just will go unfilled. And as those jobs go unfilled, the firms that are trying to hire there, the companies, the businesses, many of them small businesses, they won't raise their prices or adjust their prices and stay in business, they'll just go out of business. And if they have Americans who are working there as well, and which you'll find was very common, those Americans will lose their job too. One recent study found that for every 500,000 undocumented immigrants deported, 44,000 Americans lose their jobs. But beyond that, you're also looking at the fact that undocumented immigrants work in a lot of the fields that help America thrive. You know, one in seven people who work in the entire construction industry, everything from day laborers, all the way up to the CEOs is undocumented. And in specific trades, that's even higher. One in three roofers, drywall installers, stucco masons, and ceiling tilers, they are also undocumented. And you think it's hard enough to get a contractor now or to pay for repairs, imagine if a third of the people doing those jobs suddenly weren't here. The prices would go up and fewer people would be able to access those services. You wouldn't suddenly see a huge increase in Americans taking those jobs. There might be some substitution, but it would not be 100 percent or if it was 100 percent, that could take decades and there would be significant economic downsides in the interim.",

It wasn't necessarily a record number of crossings and that it's because about 20 years ago, the statistics on apprehensions were much lower -- were a little bit lower because most people crossing the border made it through without being caught. Today, the southern border is blanketed in surveillance cameras. We've got tens of thousands more agents than back then, and the majority of people coming across the border are taken into custody. So, apprehensions hit a record even while crossings arguably didn't. But setting that aside, numbers are down. Numbers have been down significantly this year due to two things, due to the Biden administration reaching a deal with Mexico in late December of last year, and Mexico has now embarked on its harshest and record setting enforcement operation and the harshest and most record setting enforcement operation in Mexican history and also, the Biden administration in June began turning away asylum seekers who crossed the border between ports of entry by changing the process and raising the standard for people seeking protection. So, right now, September was the lowest border apprehensions of Biden's time in office and, indeed, was about at the level of summer 2020 before Trump left office.",

Now, that bill, if it had gone through, what likely changes would we be seeing by today? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  I think the situation, at least when it comes to the southern border, would look somewhat similar. And that's because the Biden administration's June policies adopted some parts of that bill. However, the bill itself had -- was not -- was imperfect. It had created this border emergency authority that was mandatory, except at the times when it was voluntary, and it was at times voluntary, except when it was mandatory. And it was, in some ways, a little too committee driven to actually be great, effective, sensible policy. But that said, it also came with resources, and that is the thing the system needs more than ever. It would have led to the hiring of thousands of new asylum officers, hundreds of new immigration judges and more agents, more officers, more resources, which, as I've long argued, is the big issue right now. We have an under resourced asylum system that has been straining under its weight for years now, but Congress keeps trickling dollars and cents to it while pouring money into the enforcement side of things. And for the first time, this bill would have given the adjudication system a huge burst of funding.",
