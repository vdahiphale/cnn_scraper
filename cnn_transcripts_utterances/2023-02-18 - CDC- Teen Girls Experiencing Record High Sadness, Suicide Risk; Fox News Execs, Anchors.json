Dr. Ethier, this report from the CDC, for which you played such a critical role is really alarming. What data jumped off the page to you?

They're not describing those things to their -- to their parents, to their schools, to counselors, to people who can help them. And that's really a concern.

Flash forward to now and they have dozens of options and conservative media.And so, what happens is, every host is worried about getting out flank, every host is worried about hearing that, you know, what happened to you, you sold out. You know, I can't trust you anymore. Why? Because even if they don't throw out the craziest theories themselves, they know their audience is getting this stuff from somewhere, it could just be video someone posted on Facebook, you know, we also have social media today, or it could be from Breitbart or Newsmax or, you know, any show that you can think up. So, the end result here is that they're all worried about getting out flank, they're all worried about you not being far enough to the right or not being far enough to hating Democrats. And we -- you know, this explain why conservative media came around on Donald Trump. In 2016, there were plenty of hosts who either ripped him as unfit or were never Trumpers, and gradually they all came around, you know.

People are setting the speed limit to not the speed of the car to nine miles over the speed limit. I do it myself. So, I know that thinking. And -- but the difference between people in an ADAS equipped car and myself is, I'm still paying attention, even though I've set the cruise control to nine miles over the speed limit. People in ADAS equipped vehicles are relaxing. They are being told they can go hands free. Even if it's just for 30 seconds and they will do other things in the car and they will put their feet somewhere else in the car. And then all of a sudden something goes wrong and you're speeding.
