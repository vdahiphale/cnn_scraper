Katelyn, what happens to these investigations if Trump throws his hat in the ring? What is the plan? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Ana, it's just going to raise the stakes quite a lot on the political side and on the legal side. So we know right now that there's going to be a lot of very complicated decisions that the attorney general, Merrick Garland, is going to have to make after the election within, you know, a window of time before likely the next presidential election. Those are things like whether there's a case to bring against a former president of the United States, potentially. Whether there's a case to bring of top advisers that were around him in the White House or after the White House. How should they be thinking about, at the Justice Department, in the grand jury steps that Donald Trump took when he was president and then what he was doing with federal records, the Mar-a-Lago investigation theoretically after the presidency? So there's a lot of questions there. And so right now, the Justice Department is in a period of preparation. They're figuring out exactly how to respond to this when they're going to need to. And that includes, one, discussing the possible need for a special counsel if they see fit once Trump becomes a candidate. The second thing they're doing is Merrick Garland is essentially bringing in a brain trust, people to focus on those two Trump-related investigations, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and January 6th investigation. They've brought in people with national security expertise, they've brought in advisers with criminal law expertise, people who have worked with cooperators. And so this has been a quiet period leading up to the election on Tuesday where the Justice Department isn't taking overt steps in these investigations. But what they are doing is they're table setting. They're putting in place the -- all of the advice that they're going to need to make the big decisions as soon as the election period is over -- Ana?",

      "sentences": "I'm skeptical, Ana, because it will cause a delay. It takes time for someone to be led to staff up, get office space, get up to speed. And I don't think the benefits are there.And the benefits of a special counsel are it takes the politicization down a notch. This is someone who is at least semi-independent. So we saw when Robert Mueller came in, he was praised, oh, he's great, he won't be biased. As soon as he started digging up damaging information on Trump, it was a witch-hunt and he was completely biased. I don't think a special counsel appointed now would even get that honeymoon period. I think, right off the bat, they would say it's a witch hunt. So I think that benefit goes out the window along with the benefit of potentially lasting through an administration. So John Durham, when he was appointed by Bill Barr, lasted into the Biden administration and they did not fire him. And that turns out to be the right move because he came up with basically nothing at all. I don't think that we can trust that a second Trump administration or another Trump-like GOP figure would allow the special counsel to continue his or her work. So I think the benefit really isn't there. And I don't see it's worth the delay.",

They already have been treating Trump with kid gloves, if we're being honest, and been more cautious, giving him more process than any other citizen would get when you look at how they handled the Mar-a-Lago search and its aftermath.So I think they will continue to do that and they ought to do that. But I don't think they ought to change course. There's no special rule that applies to political candidates. There's only the rule around the time of the election. And we all know one of the reasons that he wants to run again is to try to insulate himself from these kinds of inquiries in the first place. So I think they should keep doing what they're doing.

So, you know, they need to dig into, Congress does as an oversight matter. What's going on with Secret Service? Are there people there who need to be removed, not loyal to the government? There are a lot of issues around that. I think that, separate and apart from what the January 6th committee is doing putting together this case, it's really important that we learn more about that so that we can be sure the Secret Service is doing what it needs to do.",

And you'll notice something. They're all tech companies. These are companies that, over the pandemic, really experienced explosive growth. And now they're starting to pull back as we shift to a potentially different cycle economically. But also the real estate companies. And I spoke to Geiberger, one of the top economists, about this jobs report, and I asked him for advice for people who are trying to make sense of the jobs report and trying to make sense of if they're thinking about switching jobs. He said, look, it's still a strong labor market right now. But it's not as strong as it was six months ago. And It's probably stronger today than it will be in six months. So you want to think about that. If you're thinking about switching jobs, you want to plan accordingly. He also said, if you're in the type of industry, like tech, like real estate, and you were already thinking about switching, you might want to consider doing that because they will probably continue to experience some challenges.",
