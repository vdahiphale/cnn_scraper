Hurricane Idalia, now tropical storm Idalia cutting a devastating path of destruction across parts of the southeast. It's moving slowly north now along the Carolina coast, weaker, but still bringing heavy rain, flash floods, and tornado threats to the Carolinas. Georgia -- Georgia and the Carolinas are seeing serious flooding, especially in those coastal areas. Water levels in Charleston rising to near record levels.
