As we count down to the midterm elections, the president of the UnitedStates faces twin challenges. Gloomy new data points shows inflation is still running unchecked, despite attempts by the Fed to cool it down. The cost at the kitchen table is way up, fueled in part by the cost of war and clashes with unpredictable global powers. The economic and foreign policy chaos part of what's driving dramatic uncertainty ahead of next month's elections. Today, a special focus on the midterms. We will have interviews with the candidates in two critical battleground races, one with tremendous consequences for the country, Arizona, where Democrat Katie Hobbs is running against Republican Kari Lake for governor, and then to Colorado, where Republican Joe O'Dea is testing whether a Republican who distances himself from former President Trump could win a purple state. O'Dea and incumbent Democratic Senator Michael Bennet will be here. But, first, today, we start with the Biden administration and the issue voters say over and over is their top concern, the economy. Here with me now is White House economic adviser Cecilia Rouse. Thank you so much for joining me. I want to start with what President Biden said on Friday, that his administration has made some progress on reining in inflation. But annual inflation in September was 8.2 percent. It barely changed from the month before. How is that progress?",

I completely understand how that's a big challenge for many families, for all families here in the United States. So what we can see in economic data is, the Fed is focused on bringing down inflation. And the big concern is, can they bring down inflation while maintaining a robust economy, labor market? And we are starting to see signs that the actions they are taking is having an effect. For example, we love having a very strong labor market, but it's been very, very strong. Employers are having a very hard time finding workers. But we saw in some data last month that workers -- that employers are posting fewer job vacancies, which means that there's a little bit of easing in the labor market, without having any layoffs. We can also see that the housing market is beginning to cool. And we know that housing prices is part of the challenge for families. It's part of our inflation challenge. We know that excess savings are starting to be spent. So, we're starting to see signs that our red-hot economy is starting to cool. And so we know that, because of that strength, we're in -- we're better positioned than most other countries for the Fed achieve its goals. (CROSSTALK)",

But part of the challenge for food is actually through energy. And so Putin's war against Ukraine, where he has weaponized natural gas, he's weaponized energy, shows up in food prices as well, because energy is a big component of fertilizer. We have been working to ease ports, which actually helps to ensure that farmers are able to export their products. And where they're not sitting on a lot of inventory, our Agriculture Department is doing what it can to try to increase supply and increase yields through programs such as helping farmers with double-cropping. So there's no question that families are feeling the squeeze. It's why the president is focused on trying to bring down costs. The Inflation Reduction Act, while it doesn't directly speak to food, does go to medical care. It goes to energy costs. And so we are focused on trying to help families get through this.",

So, we are focused on trying to address medical care. And by extending the Affordable Care Act extensions, through -- for another few years, it provides accessible health care for so many people.

This is a challenge. What I will say is that this economy is stronger than almost every other economy, that the Federal Reserve is focused on bringing down inflation.

Can you give a reason why the U.S. would want to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now? JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Well, first, Dana, thanks for having me on. You're right. The president did say that he is going to reevaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, because they did side with Russia, against the interests of the American people. This is a relationship that got built over decades on a bipartisan basis. And so the president isn't going to act precipitously. He's going to act methodically, strategically.

It has been two months since Democrats passed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which you called a victory for the American people. Core inflation is still at its highest level in four decades. And polls shows, as you know that -- and polls show, I should say, that the economy is a top issue for Colorado voters. So, why isn't the Inflation Reduction Act reducing inflation? SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO):  Well, because the elements of the Inflation Reduction Act aren't going to kick in for a while, Dana. I  mean, the cap on drug prices for seniors and the requirement finally -- finally, we overcame pharma to have requirement that Medicare negotiate drug prices on behalf of the American people -- capping insulin at $35 a month, I mean, these are things that are going to take a while to put in place. And you're right. I mean, today, gasoline is 300 -- $3.70 a gallon. Here in Colorado, a gallon of milk costs $4.20. That's really tough on people. And I think one of the things I have been trying to explain to folks is that this is a global problem. Canada has the same inflation that we have. The European -- every country in Europe has the same inflation we have. The U.K. does as well. India has as well, because as we're facing broken global supply chains that we have to -- have to address. [09:50:03] And we're facing increases in energy prices because, two years ago, oil was at $20 a barrel, went to $93 because of the economic recovery, and then Putin invaded Ukraine.

I'm concerned that the Federal Reserve kept their interest rates at zero for too long and that their quantitative easing was too aggressive. But that's looking in the rearview mirror. What we need to do now is fix the issue. And I think we can fix the issue by bringing our supply chains back to the United States, by making sure that we are benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act, in the sense that we are leading the world in the transition from fossil fuels over the next 25 years to a net zero energy economy. The United States is perfectly positioned to do that now.
