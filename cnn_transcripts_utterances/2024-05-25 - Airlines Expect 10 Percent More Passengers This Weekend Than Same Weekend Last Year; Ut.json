And we begin with dangerous weather that could impact your travel this holiday weekend.More than 70 million people are under a severe weather threat as intense tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and near hurricane force winds hit the central plains and parts of the Midwest. Let's bring in now, CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa. So, Elisa, what areas are we talking about?",

      "sentences": "We're really keeping an eye on parts of Oklahoma and Kansas. That's where we have the greatest threat for severe weather outbreak today.You could see it in the red area that's that moderate risk level four and a five, where we could find intense tornadoes, baseball-sized hail, and a string of damaging winds that can be pretty hefty as well. Notice the risk kind of stretches even into the deep south, including places like Atlanta, Savannah, and then, there is another cluster up in the Northeast. But really what we're watching here is a possibility of some strong, violent, long-lived, and intense tornadoes that are possible from Wichita down to Oklahoma City. We are looking at EF2 tornadoes or greater. So, again, just incredibly dangerous the magnitude of tornadoes that we can find today. And this is coming in a season that has been so incredibly busy. Since the beginning of the year, we've had more than 900 tornado reports, when on average today, we would have closer to 700. Here is a look at the radar right now. Not too much going on in this area. We need the daytime heat and humidity to really cook the atmosphere and get the storms to explode. We've been watching a line of storms though just south of Atlanta, where there are a few severe thunderstorm warnings right now. As we go through the day, storms really start to fire up in that area, kind of late this evening. Might not get busy until 5:00 or 6:00 tonight. And then, notice all of these discrete cells. Those could be the violent long track tornadoes, the timestamp, 10:00 p.m. Nocturnal tornadoes, kill more people because we are sleeping. It's hard to get those emergency alerts while you're sleeping. So, make sure you turn up the volume on your phone tonight. Those violent storms do congeal into a line. That's where you get a threat of damaging winds across Missouri, as we go into the morning. And then it continues through the Ohio Valley with that threat of damaging winds going into tomorrow. So, the severe weather threat continues on Sunday. That level three out of five. That orange enhanced risk from St. Louis to Louisville and Nashville, where we can continue to find the string of damaging winds, a couple of tornadoes and large hail. On top of this, we are also tracking some excessive heat in the south. Texas has some warnings for excessive heat down from Central Texas into our Brownsville, where we could find that heat index up to 117 degrees. So, sweltering heat even for this time of year, where averages along the Gulf Coast are in the upper 80s, but we're looking at highs in the low and middle 90s from Florida into Texas. And that could, again, pose a risk for heat sickness, you want to check on kids, elderly, and pets. Now, a lot of this is coming in the midst of the warmest May on record for a lot of these areas. Miami has been sweltering since May 1st. We do know that that's the trend. Spring season there has a nearly three- degree fever. It is just warmer since 1970. We add nearly 30 more warm spring days since 1970 in Miami. So, we're just kind of losing that spring season. The extreme heat starts sooner. Fred.",

Now, before that can happen, of course, you go through the whole trial, the guilt phase of the trial.

Now, prosecutors are going to use some of that evidence and say this set was a total disastrous mess.

He was born in '91. I was born in '89. So were very much on the same experiences when it comes to growing up in the '90s, the Internet of the early 2000s. I think, for Millennials, especially, we're in our 30s, we're raising kids, we're trying to live our faith. We can look to Carlo and see, OK, holiness is attainable. Holiness is attainable even on the Internet. Holiness is something that is not just for people who levitate or people who speak in tongues or people who can bilocate, which is sometimes the stories of the saints. And those are incredible. But holiness is something that we can find in the ordinary. And we find it because of our sacramental life. Carlo went to daily Mass. Carlo was kind to people he met on the street who suffered from homelessness. Carlo was a good guy. And as a good guy, it was because of his faith. And so we can look up to that example and it's moving, it's challenging. I can tell you, I told my daughter -- she's six years old -- the other day that Blessed Carlo is on the path.

The White House, so far, has been silent on the ruling, except to say that its position on Rafah has been clear and consistent. CNN's Elliott Gotkine is in Tel Aviv for us. Elliott, good to see you.

And according to CNN reporting, this was because the Egyptians effectively got agreement, got sign-off from Israel, and then changed what Israel had agreed to and presented it to Hamas.So Hamas came out as we will remember, saying that they'd accepted this deal. There were celebrations on the streets of Gaza, only for those hopes for a ceasefire and the release of some of those hostages to be dashed because it seems that both sides were agreeing to different agreements. So where we are right now is they are trying to resurrect these talks. There are reports, I should say, in the Israeli media, which I can't confirm, saying that talks will resume this week. But certainly, we know that Bill Burns, CIA director, meeting with his counterparts from Israel and also the Qataris and Egyptians as well. They were having talks in Paris. They say that progress was made, but no new talks were scheduled. I think even if these talks do get back on track, it will take some time before an agreement can be reached. And as we've seen so many times in the past few months, whenever there is hope that an agreement is about to be reached, those come to nothing, unfortunately.",
