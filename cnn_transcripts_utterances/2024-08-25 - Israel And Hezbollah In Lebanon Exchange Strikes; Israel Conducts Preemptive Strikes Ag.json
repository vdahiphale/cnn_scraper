Together with the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff, we instructed the IDF to act proactively to remove the threat. The IDF has since been acting vigorously to thwart the threats, and destroyed thousands of rockets aimed at the north of the country. It also thwarted many other threats and operates with great strength both in defense and attack. I ask you, citizens of Israel, to comply to the directives of the home front command.

And over the past couple of days Israel seem to be indicating that it was detecting an increasing level of threat coming from Hezbollah. The security cabinet met in the early hours of the morning as the IDF said more or about 100 aircrafts were hitting 40 locations, taking out what they say were thousands of missile launch barrels, not the -- not the missiles themselves, but launch barrels. And that was the preemptive strike.And as you say, Hezbollah was able to launch what they claim were 320 missiles and drones back towards Israel. It's not clear, you know, what was preemptive and what was Hezbollah actually at the ready. Not normal for Hezbollah to have so many weapons at the ready to go at any one time. So, it seems that the intelligence Israel was basing its preemptive strike on, had a degree of accuracy because Hezbollah had more weapons than normal ready to go and they did fire. The IDF say that the targets were mostly in the north but somewhere in central Israel. The IDF has not given any specifics about any of the military sites that -- the 11 military sites that Hezbollah claims to have targeted. And the IDF is also saying that the damage was very little, very little damage. We know of one civilian only who was wounded by falling shrapnel. And that was in the north, in Acre to the north. The country went on to a higher state of alert. Planes were stopped from flying out of Ben Gurion Airport here in Tel Aviv. They've restarted. Now they're delayed, many of them. But there were -- there were stricter conditions put on social gatherings, leisure, and cultural activities banning -- was banned on the beach here in Tel Aviv until a half an hour or half an hour ago. And now closer to Tel Aviv, and extending closer to the northern border, some of those restrictions have been lifted. But tighter controls are in place in northern Israel close to that border, warning people to stay close to their shelters as Israel analyses Hezbollah's next move and the impact Hezbollah has had on them.",

If they did, in fact, take out radar installations that the Israelis have that would increase Israel's vulnerability. It doesn't seem as if they have been able to do that based on what we know at the moment, except for maybe one location where that could have occurred. But we'll have to see if that's the case.But generally speaking, the Israeli air defense system is a layered air and missile defense system, and it allows for basically different altitudes to be managed. And in this case, they have a system that allows all of those incoming missiles and rockets to be shot down if they are within certain altitude range. So, generally speaking, low altitude to medium-range, they can handle those fairly well with the existing Iron Dome system. And then they, of course, have other systems like David's Sling and the Arrow system to take care of more ballistic missile style threats.",

And so, they staged what they saw were groups of missile batteries, drone launch sites, and they hit them with a couple of hundred jets.What's notable to me is that Hezbollah could have chosen civilian targets but instead chose military targets. I think that's why we're not seeing many reports of damage this morning because if it's on a secured military base the Israeli Defense Forces will choose what to share. If there are any fatalities, we might hear about that, but we're not going to see the damage. It could have been a lot worse. So, what we could be seeing right now is a face-saving measure by Hezbollah. Remember, Israel claimed responsibility for killing its Hamas military -- Hezbollah military commander, Fuad Shukr. And Hezbollah has been holding fire literally in the three weeks or so since. So, best possible worlds, they've carried out this attack. They've done what they think they have to do in terms of their popular support, and hopefully it can end here.",

That hasn't happened.Now, either that's because Iran decided not to do it at this time, or it's holding that type of strike in reserve.

So, an Egyptian official tells CNN that both sides are still far apart on some issues. What's the degree of optimism there that a deal could be reached? NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Victor, Amara, the fact that we are seeing a mass delegation arriving in Cairo to take part in these negotiations is a sign of progress here. We know, of course, during those talks in Qatar previously, last week, Hamas did not participate directly. It remains to be seen whether they take part directly in these talks today here in Cairo, whether they continue to communicate through mediators. They are here to listen to the Egyptian mediators with regards to this latest proposal put forward by the Israeli delegation. And as you mentioned, there is expected to be an Israeli delegation present at these talks today as well. Now, of course as you mentioned, there are still, according to one Egyptian official, wide differences in the positions of both Israel and Hamas. There are still key sticking points which need to be hammered out and discussed. And one of the key issues continues to be the terms surrounding the presence of Israeli troops, or rather the long-term presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip, and in particular, presence along the Philadelphi corridor, that buffer zone separating Egypt from southern Gaza. Now, Hamas has previously said that it does not wish to see any long- term presence by Israeli troops. In fact, Egyptian officials have also said they don't want to see Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor in any sort of post war structure. And we know that Israeli officials have put forward a proposal which was flat out rejected by Egyptian officials seen as a non-starter. However, they have put forward a revised proposal which sees a reduced number of military posts and truth (ph) stationed along the corridor during the first phase of the proposed ceasefire, which would see a six week pause in fighting. Now, Egyptian officials have transmitted that proposal to Hamas officials for their consideration, a sign. Perhaps an Egyptian officials see this proposal as being somewhat more serious, perhaps even more acceptable to Hamas officials. But again, that remains to be seen. And this is just one of several key sticking points. There are other issues, including the free movement of Palestinians as well as terms around the release of Palestinian prisoners. And what we've been hearing from Hamas repeatedly, is of course their concern that this current ceasefire deal on the table does not include any guarantees for a permanent, lasting ceasefire. That is something they want to see, guaranteed. And of course, given the news this morning of latest, crossfire and attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, there are concerns as well that that could, place a spanner in the work when it comes to these ongoing ceasefire negotiations.

That's a really important point. The fact that that Hezbollah chose this moment to try and proceed with this attack really goes to show how little confidence the group has in the ceasefire negotiations actually bearing fruit or coming to fruition. If the -- if there was indeed a breakthrough that was imminent in the talks, it is highly unlikely that Hezbollah would have done anything to jeopardize those talks. Obviously, we know that the Iranians who, at the end of the day, are the main patron of all of these groups that we're seeing right now as parties to this conflict, whether it be the Houthis or Hamas or Hezbollah. We know that Iran itself doesn't want this all-out region war that everyone has been afraid of. And so, they have been waiting to see what these negotiations bring to bear. But the fact is that according to Israeli negotiators themselves, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been dragging his feed, has been adding new conditions to the -- to the negotiations and has really, they feel not given them a mandate to go ahead and sign a deal. And so, we see, you know, 10 months into this conflict now that the deal seems farther away than ever.

EL-GAMAL: So, it's a part of it. The preemptive strike, according to the Israelis who are saying that they -- they -- they expected around 6,000 rockets to be lobbed at Israel from Hezbollah. And so, they tried to preempt that by striking when they did. And so, what ended up happening is that out of those 6,000, that the Israelis were expecting, according to their own statements, around 300 of them made it.
