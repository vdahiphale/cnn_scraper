You see a map of it here. Experts say the victims likely were killed instantly. Search teams are now scouring the ocean floor here hoping for any clues that could point to what may have caused the disaster. CNN's Jason Carroll is live in Boston where the U.S. Coast Guard has been deploying ships for the search.

Now we know what happened. This is something that's affected not just folks who have been watching and taking partial interest in it, but when you think about the maritime community, the deep-sea community, it's a small group. They all basically know each other, know what they're doing. It's hit that community very, very hard. When you look at what's happening up at Newfoundland, at the port at St. John's, flowers being left there for the five victims. It bears repeating their names. You have Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate. Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani citizen, and his son, Sulaiman, just 19 years old. Hamish Harding, the British billionaire, who I spoke to his friend just before going on the expedition saying how excited he was to be going there. He had already gone on the Blue Origins space flight back in 2022. Of course, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, the noted explorer who had been down to the Titanic numerous times before this fatal mission. He spoke to a lot of folks about this particular mission. One of his friends, Fred Hagan, had been on a mission down to the \"Titanic\" with him before. And he spoke about his friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRED HAGAN, FRIEND OF PAUL-HENRY NARGEOLET: P.H. was this wonderful, warm human being, incredibly talented. Iconic, legendary, the greatest deep diver that the world has ever known. At the same time, with the humility and grace to sit down and speak to anyone as an equal. And as someone said a couple days ago, a man equally at ease on the deck of a ship of a hurricane or sitting and conversing at a Parisian cafe. Just a wonderful individual. It's broken my heart that a man of his dynamism will no longer shine his light in this world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Is it just wishful thinking to say he is not going to be the next nominee, even as you are agreeing to this pledge? HUTCHINSON: Well, I believe that. But let me say very clearly, Donald Trump is not the right one to lead our country or our party. That's my message in the primary and that will be my message on the debate. And the Republican voters are evaluating all of the candidates really in light of the clarity of that message as well as their vision for America. We'll get those debate credentials.

Sure, you look at the 2022 election, we probably had a closer election than we should have because, one, Donald Trump was recruiting bad candidates in there and invoked himself and looked to the past.

They really said that, you know, there were a lot of things that went into their decision to do this controlled release and burn. One was that they looked at temperature readings. They thought that they were going up. They said that the valves for the pressure on the tankers may have malfunctioned. They also were worried about the extreme heat around these tanker cars and the explosive reaction that could occur if they didn't try to take care of this in this way. The fire department chief in East Palestine ultimately took responsibility for the calls here, but he had 13 minutes to make a final decision about what to do. We did hear some evidence, though, that maybe the signs were misinterpreted and the explosive reaction was not about to happen inside of the tankers, maybe it was not necessary. These experts, though, and the people who were doing the responding said, you know, even with this information, they may not have changed the way they took care of things, because they were not sure what the damage was and what was happening on the inside. This may have been the only way for them to react. But, Brianna, of course, there are lingering health effects from this. Residents in East Palestine telling the CDC in a survey, more than 700 of them, that 76 percent experienced headache after this, 54 percent coughing, 52 percent fatigue, 50 percent rashes and skin irritations.
