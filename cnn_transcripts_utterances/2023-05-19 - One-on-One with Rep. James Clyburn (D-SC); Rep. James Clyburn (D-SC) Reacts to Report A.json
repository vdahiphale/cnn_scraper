It was a very tumultuous time for me, but he would never let me get a tattoo. So I thought if I involved him, you know, maybe he'd like let me get a tattoo and he was very emotional when I got it done. That picture was just three, two months before he passed.",

She's so charming, so fetching and kooky, you know, and he's just fascinated with her. And so I just get lost in her, you know, when I work with her. She's amazing.
