Hamas says it won't back down after its demands in the ceasefire proposal it agreed to for Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it is far from meeting Israel's demands. Prosecutors say they need two more weeks to present their case in the Donald Trump hush money trial as the judge threatens the former president with jail time after he violates the gag order for a 10th time. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron meet in Paris with trade and Ukraine at the top of the agenda. And the Starliner to the stars. Boeing's new spacecraft is set for its first ever voyage with astronauts on board. All that and more coming up. But first, Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal that was proposed, in fact, by Egypt and Qatar. Israel says the proposal, though, falls short of what it wanted, but that it would send a delegation to the negotiating table. Palestinians and the relatives of some Israeli hostages have been welcoming the news of a potential deal. We should note, though, that the exact details of the agreement haven't been released yet. However, recent proposals have included releasing at least 20 Israeli hostages over several weeks, and that's in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. Hours after the announcement, multiple explosions were reported to the east of Rafah, that's in Southern Gaza. The Israeli military had ordered Palestinians to evacuate that area earlier Monday, raising fears that a ground invasion was imminent. Jeremy Diamond joins me now from Jerusalem with the latest. Jeremy, it really has been a busy few hours on the ground in Israel and Gaza. Given all that's gone on, can you take the measure of this possible ceasefire deal? It's hard to understand right now if we are any closer to a deal.",

And over the course of the last several hours since Hamas released that very boldstatement claiming that it had agreed to a proposal for a ceasefire agreement, I've been working to understand a little bit better exactly what Hamas has agreed to and how it may or may not move the needle in these negotiations. And what I've learned according to a senior Israeli official and a senior American official is that Hamas agreed to a different proposal than the one that Israel had helped craft with Egypt, which was submitted to Hamas a little over a week ago. This latest proposal calls for an end to the war in Gaza, which has really been a red line for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is the major way in which this proposal diverges from the Egyptian framework that had been submitted to Hamas a little over a week ago. So, major questions about exactly how these negotiators can now move forward with this. But the Israeli prime minister's office says that this latest proposal by Hamas does not meet its demands at all, but they are agreeing to send a working level delegation to meet with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators to try and see if a deal can indeed be struck as all of this is happening. As all of this is happening, the Israeli war cabinet tonight agreeing to continue this operation in Rafah with -- which began today with the evacuation orders, thousands of leaflets being dropped in Eastern Rafah ordering the evacuation of about 100,000 Palestinians who are living there. And this evening we're seeing more military action in Rafah tonight. The Israeli military says they're carrying out what they're describing as targeted strikes in Eastern Rafah, that very same area, where people, less than 24 hours ago, were told to begin to evacuate. And so, certainly the Israeli military, the Israeli government trying to keep up the pressure on Hamas even as they continue to speak at the negotiating table in the coming.",

But the politics that the Israeli prime minister are facing are very different. He has a right-wing governing coalition that is keeping him in power, two far-right ministers in particular. Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have threatened to walk from the government, collapsing it, if the war ends in Gaza without a Rafah ground offensive.

So, a couple of things here, I am told by U.S. officials that when it comes to the hostage dealnegotiations that U.S. officials are sort of rejecting the characterization from Hamas earlier in the day that they had accepted a proposal and said they are saying that what Hamas did was they came back with a proposal that was given to them back in April with some amendments. That was the language used by one U.S. official that I just spoke with. And they essentially said, look, that means that we now go back to the negotiating table, and the parties have to come together to try to hopefully get to a deal. Of course, as we were talking about President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when those two leaders spoke earlier in the day, the Hamas saying publicly that they had accepted this deal, again, a characterization that U.S. officials now reject. That had not actually happened yet. So, the two leaders didn't discuss the specifics of that framework that Hamas is now putting on the table. And of course, as U.S. officials, for weeks now, have been working feverishly to try to help the parties get to a final deal, we know that that effort continues with CIA Director Bill Burns in particular remaining in the region. And it's just tough to overstate, you know, how much is, sort of, on the line for this administration and this White House and for this president. Of course, U.S. officials have made clear that they want more than anything else to see a quick end to this conflict. They also want to make sure that all of the hostages do eventually get out, including several of them believed to be American citizens, and they also want to avoid a major ground incursion into Rafah, which the Israelis have been warning about with increasing force. Now, a question that I did put to White House Spokesman John Kirby earlier in the day is the question of a Rafah operation that is limited in scope and scope. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just, first off, thank you very much for coming in to help us analyze what is going on. We know that there are airstrikes likely still at this hour. The IDF said there had been about 50. This is not a ground incursion. But what's your reaction as soon as you hear from MJ Lee what the White House said about what even a limited scope incursion would elicit from that? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, truthfully, Paula, it is a very complex situation. And truthfully, as a military guy, I'm not sure what's the difference between a limited versus a major ground incursion. What we're talking about is different areas within Rafah where you have to attack, where the Israelis feel like they have to continue to destroy the elements of Hamas. They contend that there are four or more battalions of Hamas left, and in viewing this war from the very beginning, it appears that this is a major headquarters for Hamas. So, to end the war, to not go after these final battalions, which probably includes some of the main players in Hamas would be a disservice to the Israeli people. So, from a military perspective, they -- the Israelis have to continue to attempt to go after that Hamas headquarters and the fighters that are in this area. President Biden has made it very clear that he wants to exclude the potential for a great deal of civilian casualties that more humanitarian aid has to go in. But in this particular area, Hamas is buying for time, just as they have been buying for time from the very beginning, and they have used the kinds of methods they use where they've suddenly announced that they're willing to live by a ceasefire that no one knows the details of is just more buying for time and trying to put Israel as the scapegoat and the world pariah. There was reports of dancing by Palestinians citizens inside of Gaza today as soon as Hamas announced that. When Israel then continued the operation, it certainly will be contrary to what most of the citizens of Gaza believed was about to happen because of the lies and obfuscation of Hamas fighters and their leadership.",

We have said, you cannot take out Hamas, you cannot completely take out Hamas. That, at this point in time, seems to be standing in the way of actually getting these hostages freed.

That's what I think is happening. You took a look -- and \"The Wall Street Journal\" carried some excerpts of the proposal that Hamas signed on to. It basically calls for an exchange of prisoners for hostages and a cessation of military activity followed by a three-to-five-year period of construction. Where the Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza and with assurances from the U.N., Qatar, and Egypt, Gaza would be reconstructed under the auspices, clearly, of Hamas as a key part of the governing structure. So, the Israelis are not going to accept that. And at the same time, Hamas is not going to trade hostages for anything short of a withdrawal of Israeli forces or a comprehensive ceasefire. And Netanyahu's government has no interest right now in signing a deal that would force the Israelis to return nearly a thousand Palestinians, some of whom have been convicted or accused of killing Israelis. So, I think both sides are keeping their options, however bleak they may be, open. And that includes any number of options with respect to Rafah.",

And basically,what they said was, look, Hamas took a look at what was on the table. They added their amendments and said, hey, you Here you go. We agree to it. Which is not a negotiation obviously. What do you think was Hamas' -- you know, Hamas' motive in doing all this? And by the way, doing this in a coordinated fashion so that regional players also came out and said, we call on Israel to agree to the ceasefire deal?",

I mean,look, they had the International Community poised at the edge of their chairs for a full, what, three hours this afternoon? And the only thing we knew, the only thing was that Jazeera reported that that Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, had basically agreed to a Qatari-Egyptian proposal. And based on that, everyone was convinced that we were very close now to a formal ceasefire agreement that both sides could accept. So, I think part of it is the fact that literally there's the absence of urgency. Negotiations happen when there's urgency. Pain on one hand accompanied by the prospects of gain. And both Netanyahu and Yahya Sinwar, frankly, are much more focused, I think, on keeping their positions, in the case of Sinwar, actually surviving this. And Netanyahu wants to survive this as well. Far more focused on that than they are on cutting a deal that would alleviate the suffering of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza and free hostages. Some of whom we know are being mistreated and abused.",

And as Nic said, I don't think it's going to occur while Israeli mediators are pretending to negotiate on a deal they can't possibly accept. So, I think it's poignant. It's a tragedy because we're in a strategic cul- de-sac, and the civilian populations on both sides, clearly the hostages and their families, and millions of Gazans who've been uprooted from their homes, their families destroyed, are caught in the middle, and with no way out.",

None of these issues, none of these concerns are a big surprise to Xi Jinping.He's had to confront them before, including when American officials have come to Beijing. But now, he is on the road and he's having to discuss many of these issues once again, and we are getting a bit more response than we have had in the past from China, from Xi Jinping, now that he's on the ground in Europe. Let's first talk about this very contentious topic, free and fair trade. European officials have expressed long time concern that Beijing, China, is basically helping to fund, subsidize its electrical vehicle industry, the EV car industry, giving it an unfair advantage, flooding the market. Well, according to Chinese officials, Xi Jinping said that there is no such thing as China's overcapacity problem, making those remarks in front of French President Emmanuel Macron as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during this trilateral meeting that we saw take place in Paris. This is an issue, though, that is going to have to be resolved, because China is a big investor in a big plan of France to become a battery manufacturing center for all of Europe. So, there is this back-and-forth business relationship, and this concern is something that is going to have to be resolved. So those are the talking points for now. And then, Paula, you brought up this point about concerns that China is helping to support the Russian war machine, particularly when it comes to Ukraine. According to President Macron, during a conversation with Xi Jinping, he said he was reassured that China will not send weapons or parts that could be used for military purposes in Russia. That's been the crux of the concern, the criticism, According to Macron, the length of and the quality of this exchange is what gives him some reassurance, gives him some calm, gives him some pause. But this is not an issue that's going to go away anytime soon either. According to Russian media, President Putin, Vladimir Putin, will be here in Beijing sometime in the very near future. And the fact that these two world leaders have such a cozy relationship is going to create a lot of unsettled feelings in Europe and other parts of the world. Paula.",

We want to go now from stocks to space. You are watching live pictures at the launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, where Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is getting ready to take off for the first time with astronauts on board. Boeing has spent years trying to get to this moment. The scheduled launch is now less than four hours away. Kristin Fisher is there for us at Cape Canaveral. So good to see you there for all the excitement. Just let us in on why this is significant given the fact that NASA has been at this with Boeing, in partnership with Boeing, for quite a while.",

      "sentences": "Yes, 10 years to be exact, Paula. That's when NASA approached two potential commercial crewpartners, SpaceX and Boeing, and said, hey, we want to do this thing called the commercial crew program. Utterly groundbreaking at the time. It was a chance for NASA to really outsource some of the hardest work that NASA has to do, just getting these NASA astronauts up and back from the International Space Station. At the time, everybody thought that Boeing, one of the great NASA legacy contractors, would, of course, be the first to fly and ferry astronauts to and from Earth and the ISS. But as we all know now, it was SpaceX that did it first and has now been flying crews two space and back 14 times. So, now, tonight, just hours away from Boeing, being able to try to do what SpaceX has done for so long, Boeing Starliner, on this launch pad right behind me at the Space Force -- Cape Canaveral Space Force Station used to be Air Force Station, now Space Force Station. And what we're going to see, hopefully at 10:34 p.m. Eastern time is NASA astronauts, two veteran NASA astronauts, Sonny Williams and Butch Wilmore, launch on top of an Atlas 5, a ULA Atlas 5 rocket. And they will be inside the Boeing Starliner capsule that sits on top. This is the first time that there have ever been people inside the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. And this is only the sixth time ever in history that there has been a first test flight of NASA astronauts in a new spacecraft. So, Paula, think of it, you had, you had Mercury, Gemini. Apollo, the space shuttle, then SpaceX is Dragon and now, Starliner. So, the fact that you have a first crewed test flight, very rare. It is -- it carries a bit more risk with it. And so, that's why, in part, it has taken so much time to get here tonight. Boeing has encountered some tremendous technical difficulties as well. Lots of questions in the preflight press conferences about some of the issues that Boeing has had on the aircraft side of things. NASA and Boeing very emphatic to say that the airline division of the company and the space and defense division, two separate entities. And so, tonight, all eyes are going to be on this launch pad behind me. And, Paula, I have to say, you know, for a company and a spacecraft that has had so many delays, the lead up to this launch has been looking really good. I mean, first of all, the weather, it is rare to get a 95 percent favorability forecast from the meteorologists here. That's what we have, Paula. So, they're starting fueling. The NASA astronauts are suiting up. Fingers crossed that this first crewed test fight of Starliner finally launches tonight.",
