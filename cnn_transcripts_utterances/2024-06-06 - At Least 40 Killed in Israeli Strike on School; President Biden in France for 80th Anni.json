President Biden joining other world leaders at this hour to mark this milestone anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of continental Europe during World War II. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the wartime president of Ukraine, had this heartwarming moment and a hug with one of the Americans who fought at Normandy. President Biden also met with a handful of the last surviving U.S. veterans who stormed those beaches or parachuted behind enemy lines as very young men. Today, they are all around 100 years old, making this anniversary especially poignant and moving, as the world pays tribute to the Greatest Generation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I remember when we were both there. How much do the current global tensions underscore the poignancy of today's ceremony? CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Honestly, Wolf, I think that's what it's all about, as well as celebrating the heroes that have fallen and who are laid to rest, and also those who have survived and who've come back again. I spoke to the 101-year-old Jake Larson. We will have a little clip in a moment. But, really, everything today was framed, whether it was in interviews, whether it was in the speeches by Presidents Biden and Macron and the secretary of defense and the others, in -- in the current crisis. Because who would have thought that, 80 years since D-Day itself and the liberation of occupied territories, that we would be facing a raging ground war in Europe? It's just unbelievable what's going on. It's just unbelievable that in 2024 this is happening after all the sacrifice and after all the years of this international world order that was created by the United States and its allies. In any event, I want to play for you a tiny sound bite from Jake Larson which sort of sums up the courage, the commitment, the heroism of those who did actually fight. He landed on Omaha Beach 80 years ago today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I think that is what is really the difference this time, to know that democracy doesn't come cheap, to know that history is not linear, to know that we cannot take literally anything for granted. Even I have spent my whole career taking it for granted that it would go in a straight line, that, the more we fought, the more that we sacrificed, the more we paid attention, this democracy and freedom would just grow and grow and grow. But, no, it really is at risk right now, and I think everybody understands that, unless Ukraine is won, then the entire project that these people fought and died for will be at risk.

LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Wolf, our policy using long- range strike weaponry to go into Russia hasn't changed. But what we have done is provided Ukraine the ability to counterfire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they are firing at the Ukrainians.

They have come out with their jeeps, their amphibious vehicles, like the one we're standing on now, one of the Ducks that proved so crucial in resupplying the Allied front lines as the men moved in, but, on that day, very different conditions. In fact, this was a D-Day that should have happened on the 5th of June. It happened instead on the 6th because of the inclement weather. As they came on shore, it's almost unimaginable what the men would have faced, and, in fact, the extraordinary losses of the Americans on Omaha Beach, some 2,000 men lost in those first few hours on that beach just due east of where we are now -- this is Arromanches, Gold Beach -- speak to the horrors of what they would have been facing. And I think what we have seen at the heart of these commemorations that we have seen today, for this, what is most poignantly, Wolf, one of the last commemorative events around D-Day, where any living veterans are likely to be able to make the trip, given their age, what we have seen is a great deal of remembrance about the extraordinary logistical operation that was Operation Overlord. Remember that beyond those first few troops who took those first staggering steps up towards the liberation of France and Europe, there were all of these vehicles that you see here gathered on this beach, not least this Duck that I'm standing on, that allowed until the artificial port that you can just see the remains of off the coast of Normandy there, just at sea, 570 hectares of artificial port that were built in those first few weeks, again, an extraordinary feat of coordination between the 12 armies that took part. Until that could be built, it was vehicles like this that allowed the allies to come in and out, bringing the equipment from the ships that were offshore all the way up onto the beach and straight to the front lines. And, really, that is part of what allowed Operation Overlord to succeed as it did, against the odds and despite the losses and with that coordination between Allies at its heart. When you look back now at what was achieved that day, it seems almost an act of folly that it was undertaken at all. And what you -- when you speak to historians about what unfolded here, what they tell you is that, had it failed, it would have taken probably years for the Allies to be able to attempt anything like it again. And that's what we have seen at the heart of the commemorative events that involved, of course, the world leaders that we have seen gathered further down on Omaha Beach. But, again, on beaches like this, look at the turnout, people who've come to remember and tell their children of what was achieved here against the odds and in the name of freedom. From the point of view of the American veterans, the several dozen of them that have been able to make their way back to this continent 80 years on, a lifetime on, Wolf, from these transformative events that they lived 80 years ago, remember that these were boys that were coming to a part of the world that they'd never seen in the name of freedom of the people they'd never met.

Whether that command center was being used by Hamas willfully embedding humans, civilians in and around their operations center, impossible to say. The longer the ground campaign continues, the longer the war campaign continues, the greater the odds and the chances of what we have seen time and time again, and that is mass casualty events.

And then Yair Lapid, the head of the second largest party, offers the prime minister a safety net, and you get a sort of government of disunity. A third option is to dissolve the Knesset. Benny Gantz is prepared to offer legislation to do that, and you go to new elections. So I think the odds, Wolf, of this deal being implemented, I think, are growing increasingly more narrow and small. I mean, Hamas has not accepted it yet. If they had a clean acceptance, then I think the government of Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu would have key decisions to make. But more than likely, Wolf, Hamas is going to come in with a yes, but. And the Israelis, who have accepted this, according to the administration, and I think this was an Israeli proposal -- it came as no surprise to them -- also have a way of spinning it so as to create doubts in the mind of whether, whatever the Israelis commit to, they're going to observe. So you have a situation in which neither side, frankly, has the kind of urgency required to move into phase one. The party that has the greatest sense of urgency, Wolf, is the Biden administration.

I'm not sure the Iranians want a major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. It could easily, easily draw Israel and the U.S. in. I'm still hoping, perhaps betting, that the Israelis and Hezbollah will keep this below the threshold of an escalatory ladder that could end up in a confrontation that would wreak havoc, not just in Southern Lebanon and in Beirut, but also in response to Hezbollah's high- trajectory weapons. And they have something, Wolf, that Iran does not have, which is proximity to Israel. These high-trajectory weapons could be -- could do tremendous damage to the civilian population of Israel.
