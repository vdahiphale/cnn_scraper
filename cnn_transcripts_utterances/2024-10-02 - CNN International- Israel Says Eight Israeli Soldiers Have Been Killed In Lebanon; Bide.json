Senior U.S. officials continue to be in constant contact with their Israeli counterparts, as they try to determine what the next steps and the Israelis' response to Iran will be. Now, President Biden is expected today to convene a call with the leaders of other G7 countries to specifically talk about the situation in the Middle East. That's according to a source familiar with the call. It comes at a time as the U.S. and other allies are waiting to see exactly how Israel might respond. You have heard President Biden say that they support Israel and also want to keep these lines of communications open to try to determine these next steps.But, one question going forward is, what U.S. assistance in any type of response might look like? And you have heard publicly across the administration, from here at the White House, and at the State Department, that the U.S. does believe there will be severe consequences for Iran following this attack. Take a listen to what the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had to say on that matter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: This is a significant escalation by Iran. We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is a hope that there will be some consultation between the U.S. and Israel before they make any final decisions going forward. President Biden has said that he does plan to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at some point. It's unclear exactly when that might come. But, one big question is, how much influence the U.S. will be able to have over this decision?You'll remember, back in April, when Iran had launched that barrage of missiles and drones against Israel that were ultimately thwarted by the U.S. and other allies, that at that time, President Biden had essentially told Netanyahu to take a win. You only saw a very limited response from Israel in that moment. Officials acknowledged that this situation is much different. So, the administration is likely going to try to encourage the Israelis to take some type of measured response when they do, in fact, plan their response to Iran's attack. Yesterday, the State Department would not say whether they believed Iran might target nuclear -- Israel might target nuclear facilities in Iran. They simply said they wouldn't comment on that matter. They weren't ruling anything in or ruling anything out. But, it does present a very tricky dynamic for not just Israel, but also the U.S., as they're trying to prevent this from really escalating into an all- out war in the Middle East.",

EISINIslamic regime of Iran having the rhetoric of saying that they're attacking, but for the first time in a very long time, they are in defense. And from my perspective, that's a good thing, not for Israel, but for the world. The Islamic regime of Iran not just overtly attacking Israel in the way that they did yesterday, but they are the ones that support, that give the ideology, that are the ones that give the training, and especially the ones that give all of the weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the different Shiite proxies, both in Syria and Iraq, and to the Houthis in Yemen. And from that perspective, the action that Iran took yesterday, it's not just bluster. I was in the safe room yesterday. That was a hectic time here inside Israel, but what they're doing right now is they're trying to show that they're still in the game. I am happy. I have to say this. When Iran feels that they need to be in defense, they cannot be the safe haven and the ideology for these terror entities and themselves calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel.",

Take their country back. It was interesting messaging to hear from him. Do you think that we're going to continue to see Israel kind of pushing, or Israeli government trying to push something like that to really try to knock down this Iranian regime?",

After the events, he directly threatened the Iranian regime. But, I'm saying that he too, the Prime Minister in Israel right now, addressed the Iranian people. I'm very wary, both as a commentator, as a colonel, as an Israeli, about foreigners intervening in any kind of other country. I really do think that the Iranian/Persian people deserve a different regime than the Islamic regime of Iran, and that I say as somebody who looks in at the regime and what it does to people, to women, to everything.Having said that, I don't know that we're the ones that have to make that change. And I don't know that the Islamic regime in that sense. I mean, they hear these voices. They're a harsh dictatorship, and it's very tricky. The only time that Israel directly intervened and tried to do that kind of regime change that we call it was what Ben Wedeman from before would remember very personally, 1982 when Israel entered into Lebanon, and at that time, part of that campaign was also with an element of regime change. That didn't end very well. And I really do hope that we wouldn't take steps like that. I'd love to see the Iranian people take those steps, but that's up to them.",

And it goes to show that when you're focused, when you look at an arena, when you understand the players, you can both infiltrate and impact in a very effective way.I'm very proud of the things that were done, but I don't want to be like in that hubris. I'm very wary of us taking it too far. Hezbollah still has a lot of capabilities. They built themselves for the long term. They were fighting in Syria for many years. They are hardened terror militants. So, yes, we've done a lot. We've shown a lot of capabilities. And at the end of the day, it doesn't mean that we've erased Hezbollah, certainly not their ideology, and you still have behind them that Islamic regime of Iran, the supporter, the backer of the ideology.",

SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I mean, Jessica, it was one of the best debates I've seen in a long time.

Vance because of the politics, not necessarily him as a person, and they even said, God, it would be great if those two were the top of the ticket.

If you look at those who -- he increased his overall net favorability by four points. I think this actually moved the needle for Governor Walz, because both of them were introducing themselves in a new way to the American people. And so, in that case, everything matters.And the fact of the matter is, when you -- I agree on the personality standpoint. I think they did a great job of reminding folks that personality and policy can go hand in hand.

But, overall, I think how robust J.D. Vance was and his nuance of understanding what it would take to address issues such as the economy and affordability. He talked about trade and how trade has overall been a net negative for working class people. We can go all the way back to the 90s with NAFTA, many economists now agree with that.

What did you make of that particular moment? SINGLETONI think most people. I know a whole lot of Republicans who will say we lost the damn election in 2020. It is what it is, Jessica. If I were advising the Senator, knowing how the former President feels about that, although, as of late, he has acknowledged that he was beaten by President Biden, and he has even acknowledged that if he were to lose, he wouldn't run again. We'll see if that happens or not. But, if I were advising him and preparing him for the debate, I would have answered that question, or prepared him to answer the question by saying a part of the reason we are running is because we do not want a continuation of the Biden-Harris policies, and then I would have pivoted and moved on. I think that's probably the best way you can answer that question without angering Donald Trump, if that's something you're trying to avoid, if you're advanced.

But, as we see today, that fight is hardly over. Israeli soldiers, as you mentioned, have been killed in the fighting in south Lebanon.So, there is a long way to go.

This is a coal mining town that's important to both Ukraine and Russia, and it sits at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefield fronts, making it a key spot when it comes to supplying the warring forces.Joining us now with more is CNN's Clare Sebastian.

This is going to be a pretty big blow for Ukraine, Jessica, not only, as you say, because it's a strategic location that perhaps not as strategic as some other towns in the east. It is sort of where the eastern and southern fronts meet. The Russians have been concerned that it's sort of putting pressure on the roads that lead to Mariupol in the south, but the loss of it will also sort of open up that part of the defense of the Donetsk region, which we know one of Russia's key objectives is trying to take the whole of that region, which it has, it claims to have annexed, but doesn't fully occupy. So, there is that.It's a town that's heavily fortified. Russia -- Ukraine, rather, has been defending it to the hilt for the past two years, holding off several major Russian attempts to take it. So, having gone through all of that, now to lose it is going to hurt pretty badly, even though this is a relatively small town, pre-war population of some 14,000 people. But, I think more importantly at this stage in the war is what it reveals about the reality on the battlefield. We heard President Zelenskyy in Washington last week saying Ukraine is closer to peace than we think, trying to sell his victory plan. And meanwhile, Russia continues to take territory. It may also raise questions, of course, about the Kursk incursion, Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory, given that part of the motive for that was to try and ease the pressure on the other fronts, which certainly in the case of the Eastern Front, seems to have not worked. So, there is that altogether. I think this comes at a very critical time for Ukraine in the war, looking ahead to the presidential election in the U.S., the prospect of what that means for new aid, now losing this territory amid efforts to restart some kind of peace process. It is a major blow. Jessica.",

I think you're going to see possibly some of the nuclear sites that Iran has that are under construction. So, there is not inactive weapons program in there. They might hit something like that. That way, they can't be accused of hitting a nuclear facility that might spread nuclear material.Surely, they will go after some of the sites where all of those ballistic missiles were launched in yesterday's attack, and they might go after energy infrastructure as well, because as costly as firing 180 some odd ballistic missiles from Iran at Israel would have been to Iran. Israel spent a lot of money in its various air defense systems, knocking most of those ballistic missiles out of the sky. So, they really want to send a message that this can't just be tit-for-tat. This can't just keep happening back and forth. They want Iran to think many, many times before launching another such strike. And I think they also want to damage some of the capability so that Iran needs to take a while to rebuild and reconstruct its launch facilities.",

A child was injured in one of the strikes, but no one was killed. And Biden had said, take the win. This time, you heard Sullivan talk about serious ramifications, a serious response.So, I think we're going to see Israel brief in some way the U.S. beforehand and the U.S. at least provide some sort of cover to whatever Israel decides to do. And that also helps play into the election here in the U.S., because one of the wraps that the Republicans have had against candidate Kamala Harris, the Vice President, is that she has been tough in some of her comments on Netanyahu.
