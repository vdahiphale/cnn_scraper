Local residents were evacuated once the country's Civil Protection Agency declared a state of emergency in the area. Plumes of smoke and an orange sky could be seen from Iceland's world famous blue lagoon. This is the fourth eruption there since December, and one expert says it's the most powerful so far. Some stunning images there.All right, thanks very much for joining us this morning. I'm Jim Acosta. Hope you have a great week, everybody. Our next hour of Newsroom starts right now.",

Attorneys of former President Donald Trump say they're unable, unable to get a bond to pay the $464 million fraud judgment. Calling it, and I'm quoting now, a practical impossibility.

      "sentences": "So Trump's lawyers have informed the Appeals Court today that they are unable to get anybody, an insurance company and underwriter, to help them post this bond, the $454 million for Trump alone, the rest to cover his sons. And what they say is that they've approached 30 insurance underwriters, some of these big gigantic companies that you know, and they say that none of them are willing to do it.As you said, they are calling it a practical impossibility. One of the reasons that they say is an issue here is that some of these insurance companies have internal limits that they won't issue a bond for more than $100 million. And some of the biggest names that you can think of in the insurance world also will not underwrite a bond and take property, which is what Trump has to put up. They want cash. They want securities, stocks, bonds, something that is, what's a liquid, easy to sell asset. They don't want property. And so that is the problem that Trump has run into in trying to come up with this massive amount of money, half a billion dollars. You know, these bond companies, too, they also want their own, I guess you could call it, you know, insurance on it. They want extra money than just what the bond is so that they can, you know, cover this as it plays out. This bond is to stop the New York Attorney General's Office from seizing the property while the appeal of the judgment and the case goes forward. So they've been asking the -- the Trump's team has been asking the appeals court to allow them to not have to post this bond until the appeal is over. They're saying that Trump has properties that are worth more than the judgment in this case. It's just something that the insurance companies won't take. So they're saying that the attorney general's team will be able to collect on this judgment if it stands. And they could do so by seizing some of the properties, which the Attorney General's Office said they're ready to do. But they're still asking the appeals court here for more time. And that's why we're seeing this new information come out today saying they're unable to post the bond of this magnitude. They can't get anyone to underwrite it because it is just a large amount and particularly a large amount for one individual. Wolf?",

It's up to this New York State Appeals Court to decide whether to allow Trump to move forward with the appeal and stop the Attorney General's Office from seizing properties to give them this time to have the court case play out. If the court says that Trump does not get the state, Trump's side is asking them to allow them to put their ruling on hold so they can appeal to the highest Appeals Court in New York State. Those will be decisions for the New York Appeals Court to decide. And, of course, the New York Attorney General's Office has opposed this. They want the Appeals Court to allow them to enforce the injudgment now, if Trump cannot post that bond. Wolf?",

A significant development indeed.There's other important news we're also following right now, including in northern Gaza, where a very dangerous situation is unfolding. Israeli forces have surrounded the Al-Shifa Medical Complex there. It's the largest in the enclave. And they're telling people in the surrounding area to get out as they search for what they describe as Hamas terrorists. Gaza's Ministry of Health says some 30,000 people are using the hospital for shelter right now. All this is happening as we learn Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden will speak today by phone for the first time in more than a month. I want to get straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's joining us from Jerusalem right now. So, Jeremy, what's the latest? How is this situation unfolding, very dramatic, very dangerous?",

He's a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Colonel, thanks so much for joining us. First of all, what can you tell us about the current IDF operations inside the Al-Shifa hospital? What's going on right now? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Indeed, since the early hours of the morning, Wolf, we've been conducting a precise operation against Hamas terrorists that have been operating within the grounds of the hospital. And indeed, as Jeremy Diamond pointed out, we've killed at least one senior leader of Hamas, that some of those forces actually opened fire against our forces as they approached the hospital, as they conducted their operations. What it actually goes to show, and this is what we actually know at this stage, Wolf, is that it shows that Hamas has returned to the hospital of Shifa to conduct its operations and try and safeguard its operations, to continue its operations of terrorism against Israel. We are determined to dismantle Hamas as a terrorist organization, make sure that they can't use the sanctity of the medical facilities, because hospitals are for healing, not for hosting terrorists in order to conduct their terrorist activities. We are indeed conducting activities as we speak with Special Forces on the ground in order to engage and kill the terrorists or arrest them. Despite what the Hamas Ministry of Health has told the journalists, there are not 30,000 people taking refuge in the hospital compound. There are a few thousand, and we are not fighting against them. We are targeting our efforts against Hamas terrorists that have opened fire against our forces and continue to pose a threat to the region. There's a very easy way out of this. They can surrender unconditionally, lay down their arms, and there will be no more need for combat in this area. It just goes to show, Wolf, that Hamas have no regard for the humanitarian mission. They have no regard for the medical mission. And they have no regard for the people that need the medical help in the hospital itself.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, over the last five months, we've seen in every hospital that we've approached that there has been infrastructure that Hamas has used, whether it's tunnels, whether it's the CCT television that they've used -- that we've revealed time and time again that they took hostages to these locations, whether it's the tunnel system that gave them access to mobilize from place to place, whether it's the communication capabilities, and all of this while they were feeding off of power supplies, water supplies from the hospitals above ground.So I would say there's been ample proof, ample evidence, and there is enough to say once and for all, Hamas, leave the hospitals alone. That is the only decent thing that decent people should say to this terrorist organization. They have no regard, Wolf, for what you and I understand, that there are basic decency that are required in the conduct of warfare. They will manipulate and try and take advantage of every single law of war to try and exert the maximum amount of death on civilians. Israelis and I would say Palestinians as well, we are operating in order to restore safety and security to the people of Israel. We're operating in a way that is unprecedented in the urban warfare. And I strongly suggest that we look at this with very wide eyes and not a narrow tunnel vision, that Hamas, as the way it is operating, how it is operating, how it has institutionalized its terrorist intentions and capabilities within the civilian arena. They need to be condemned. They need to be outcast. They need to be gone from the control of the Gaza Strip. That is what we are out to do.",

We're doing it by land, by increasing the access and the capacity of our land crossing. There is no bottleneck on the Israeli side. On the contrary, the bottlenecks are on the Palestinian side. And the distribution issue is actually the challenges that is faced inside the Gaza Strip.We have also, for the second time, just last night, increased access to the northern Gaza Strip from a second access point across the border, not in Kerem Shalom, but further north in order to circumvent some of those looters that the trucks were facing in the southern areas, indeed, to try and increase the amount of supplies. We can also recall that the access of food supplies and medical supplies, whether it's from airdrops or also from a sea route, a maritime humanitarian corridor that we just conducted over the last weekend. And we expect more to come in over the next few days. So I would say, yes, absolutely. We understand the humanitarian needs. We understand that there is a combat zone, there is a war zone. And as this operation just this morning underlines, Hamas are still operational in the north. They are still abusing this civilian arena. They are still weaponizing the humanitarian mission. And that needs to be a concern for everyone. So I would say we will maintain our operational connections with the welfare program and the other international humanitarian organizations precisely to alleviate the difficulties that are a result of a war, a war that we didn't ask for.",

We are getting the reports already that children are dying of starvation. And you can imagine as a parent watching your child waste away in front of your eyes, losing strength, losing color each and every day.And so that is why we are seeing the scenes of desperation when aid is able to get through. And we've had convoys from UNICEF, from WFP that have been able to get in, but it's been sporadic, and it needs to be consistent. Communities need to know that aid is going to get in today, tomorrow, and the next day, and in the weeks and months ahead. And again, we keep saying this, but the only way that we're going to be able to do this is an end to the fighting. It is impossible to deliver the critical humanitarian supplies that are needed whilst bombs are falling and bullets from all parties of the conflict, to all sides.

Just last week, he was talking about the fact that Russia is ready to use a nuclear weapon if they feel that Russia is threatened. And so this is saber rattling that is very much taken seriously by the West. And it really has conditioned the way that the U.S. and other NATO countries have approached the conflict in Ukraine in terms of the weaponry that is given to Ukraine.The U.S. has been very careful at sort of steadily growing the size of the weaponry that's given to Ukraine, but putting parameters on that as well, telling Ukraine you're not allowed to use U.S. weapons in Russia for fear of provoking the Russians and escalating this conflict. Now the Ukrainians dismissed that. But this is very much a concern of NATO's and what he was saying. There is a response to the French President Emmanuel Macron who said that he doesn't rule out the western troops could eventually be used in Ukraine. Now that is not something that the U.S. agrees with or other countries like Germany. The U.S. is very firm to say we are not putting U.S. boots on the ground. Now there are some foreign troops there, but they're not at the front line. They're not doing the actual fighting. And the argument from the administration is this is why we need to increase the aid to Ukraine so that we don't have to send our forces in there, so that the Ukrainians are doing the fighting. We're giving them the support. And I think what this really highlights, Wolf, what the administration is going to hope that this highlights is the need for more aid to be sent to Ukraine so they can continue their fight against Russia.",
