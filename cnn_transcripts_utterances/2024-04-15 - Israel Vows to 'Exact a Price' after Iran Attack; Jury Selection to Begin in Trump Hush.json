We appreciate it.In just a few hours from now, history will unfold in a New York City courtroom, when Donald Trump becomes the first former president to stand trial on criminal charges. Jury selection starts this morning. The search for 12 impartial New Yorkers and alternates expected to take a week or more. Prosecutors alleging Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, payments that were allegedly made to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. The former president trying to make the case that he's going on trial for the American people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT/2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The entire world will witness the commencement of the very first Biden trial. They're all Biden trials. You know that, right? And I'm proud to do it for you. Have a good time watching. When I walk into that courtroom, I know I will have the love of 200 million Americans behind me. And I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

No Bronx, no Brooklyn, no Queens, no Staten Island. Manhattan only, a borough, a county where Donald Trump got 12 percent of the vote in 2020. So he's worried about that.But you're right, prosecutors -- I've been in this situation -- are terrified about one lone juror sneaking through who could hang a jury. You need all 12 in order to convict. The questionnaire is really interesting, because what the questionnaire is trying to do is get at, first of all, which way do you lean. It doesn't come out and just ask it. I kind of wish it did just say like, did you vote for \"A\" or \"B,\" or are you Republican or Democrat? But there's all these other proxies for that. Have you ever participated in political activity for or against Trump? Have you ever contributed, that kind of thing. But he asks a couple important questions. It says, whatever way you lean, can you still be impartial in this case? Now some people are going to say, I can't be impartial. I just lean too strongly. That's it. And they're going to be out. But then there's going to be a lot of people who say, I do have feelings, but I can put those aside and still be impartial. And that's where the instinct kicks in. That's where the judge is going to have to ask, do I believe this person? And more importantly, the parties who have a limited number -- ten each, ten strikes each -- they're going to have to make the decision, do we use one of those ten precious strikes to remove this particular person?

And we've seen this, actually, in the E. Jean Carroll libel case and in the civil case, the fraud case up in New York, when the judge basically told Trump's lawyers, can you control your client?

But you know, as a political matter, I think anytime you are on trial, and you are testifying on your own behalf in a trial, that is not a helpful thing. That is not persuasive to general election voters. You know, it may be persuasive to his MAGA base that has shown time and again that they are absolutely die-hard for him, regardless of what he does. But the MAGA base alone isn't enough to get him to 270 electoral votes. And so, you know, anytime the backdrop for him is a courtroom and, you know, his potentially criminal proceedings on just -- on trial here, I think that that's not a good thing for him. So if he -- you know, it may be the right legal strategy. I don't know. I defer to the legal eagles on that.

Among independents, that number is 58 percent. I mean, I just have to wonder, I mean, just any conviction, that's never good.

In reality, when these things actually happen, it's -- it's always a very different thing. So I think that's what the Trump campaign, I think what you're probably seeing out of some of these polls. But that being said, right, time is finite. And so when you're sitting in a courtroom in Manhattan, you're not in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia. So how Trump is able to leverage campaigning from in and around a courtroom is going to be key. And I think to Katie's point, a little bit, when he goes and he talks about testifying on the stand, his audience is not the juror. I think that's one important thing to remember about this whole process, if you're Trump, your audience is not the jurors. It's the American people, and it's the voters.

He does have a right to assist in his own defense. He does have a right to prepare for each trial individually. You can't chain smoke these trials and have one end on a Friday and the next one start on the following Monday. He does have a right to prepare for them. And so I think we need to be careful here.
