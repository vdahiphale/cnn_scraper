It's your job to try to decide. I want you to go back there and judges do with different degrees of firmness, but orders them to attempt to reach a verdict.And very often when you have a deadlocked jury that instruction from the judge will help them overcome their differences, often reach a compromise verdict. If that should happen here, for example, there's nine checks Trump signed. That might be a natural way out of the 34 false documents to compromise. The challenge with hung juries, John, they're rare. 5 percent or 6 percent of all cases end up in a hung jury where you have one juror or more commonly two jurors who see the case differently than the others.

Two Italian newspapers say Pope Francis made the remarks while meeting bishops in a closed-door meeting last week. The Pope has instructed bishops not to accept gay men for the priesthood, and this is the context in which he was making his reported remarks. But in a new statement, the Vatican insists the church welcomes everyone.The Pope's remarks have caused a real stir because of the use of an anti- gay slang word, something that he used whilst discussing with Italian bishops whether to admit gay men to the priesthood. But the Vatican in a statement stressed the Pope never intended to express himself in homophobic terms and said Francis apologizes for any offense. It also says that the Pope has repeatedly stated that the church must welcome everyone, including, quote, \"everyone as they are.\" Now, of course, this has been the Pope's consistent message during his pontificate when it comes to LGBTQ Plus Catholics. Pope Francis is the Pope who said who am I to judge at the beginning of his pontificate when asked about gay priests. He's also opened the possibility for same-sex couples to receive blessings. So the Pope's remarks as they report in the media caused surprise. It's also been suggested that Pope was not fully aware of how offensive the term he used was, and the statement that the Vatican has issued is clearly saying that Francis did not intend for it to be homophobic. Francis is a pope who apologizes for his mistakes and he clearly felt it was necessary to rectify the situation given this story and these reports were threatening to damage or undermine the work that he's done to welcome gay Catholics.
