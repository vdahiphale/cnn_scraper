Plus, she says Mangione's fingerprints match those investigators found on a water bottle and an energy bar near the scene. Mangione's attorney says he still hasn't seen the evidence but there's no question his client will plead not guilty to murder charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS DICKEY, ATTORNEY FOR LUIGI MANGIONE: The burden of proof is always on the government. OK. So, you know, again, people forget that he and any other person charged with a crime is presumed innocent. That means we start off square one with a presumption of innocent of him being innocent. And the rest then follows and then we challenge the evidence and contest it and battle it out in court where it belongs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kaczynski, a Harvard grad mathematician, while Mangione minored in mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he also majored in computer science and engineering and had a masters. Kaczynski was estranged from his family, living as a recluse in Montana. Mangione mother reported her 26-year-old son missing about two weeks before the shooting, telling police at the time she had not spoken to him since July. And while Kaczynski targeted universities and airlines, Mangione allegedly had his sights set on the health care industry and UnitedHealthcare's CEO. Police found a three page handwritten claim of responsibility on Mangione. He also wrote in a spiral notebook, much like Kaczynski did, writing: What could be better than to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference. It should be noted that Kaczynski's brother David has spoken out in the wake of the shooting, saying violence is not the answer. In a statement to CNN saying Kaczynski's actions were blind, misguided, cruel and utterly inconsistent with his goal of preserving our basic humanity, we must remember that our world is never improved by violence, only by love.
