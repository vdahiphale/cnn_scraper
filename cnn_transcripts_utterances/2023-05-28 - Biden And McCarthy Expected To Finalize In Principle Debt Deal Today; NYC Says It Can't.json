I said let's work together to be able to raise the debt ceiling, but curb the amount of spending, to let America be able to work again, cut red tape, get some work requirements to help people get back into work. I think this agreement frames all that from limit, save, grow. It doesn't get everything everybody wanted, but that's in divided government. That's where we end up. I think it's a very positive bill. We did a conference call with our conference and over 95 percent were overwhelmingly excited about what they see. They haven't had -- they're getting the text today in the process. Look, in every single negotiation when it comes to debt and others, we get both sides of the party voting to pass the bills and I expect the same thing to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it has been a critical 48 hours here in Washington as both sides race against the clock to reach an agreement.On Friday, President Biden on his way to Camp David said they were very close to a deal and expressed some optimism. And then yesterday, the White House negotiators as well as Hill negotiators were talking on the phone and virtually as they tried to strike this deal, and it eventually happened with a call between President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy where they reached that deal in principle, we're told according to sources. Now, they are expected to speak again. President Biden told us, reporters that they were going to talk at 3:00 PM to what he said is dot the I's and cross the T's. He also, when asked about whether there was any sticking points said \"none.\" But of course, that has been the question looming over the White House, it is can they also get consensus among House Democrats, especially on some of these issues, like expanding work requirements, some of which we've slowly learned about but we're still waiting for the text. But the bottom line in the message that the White House has been sending is that there were concessions on both sides as they tried to reach this deal and avert a debt default. After yesterday's announcement of a deal in principle, President Biden said the following in a statement. He said: \"It is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone. And the agreement protects my and congressional Democrats' key priorities and legislative accomplishments.\"  \"The agreement,\" it goes on to say, \"Represents a compromise, which means not everyone gets what they want. That's the responsibility of governing.\" So the White House on the phone today with Democratic leaders and Democratic members of Congress to read them in on the deal and to get their support and that will ultimately be the question as expected to close the deal is how much support it will get as it moves on to the next phase of this and perhaps one of the more difficult ones in terms of getting this on the House floor in a vote.",

McCarthy says that the votes will be there ultimately, among Republicans.Let's actually take a look at what is in this deal, most consequentially, it raises the debt ceiling for two years. It caps federal spending this year and next. There are no cuts to military or veterans, that, of course, politically unpopular on both sides. There are tougher work requirements, which I alluded to before, that's very unpopular with Democrats for food stamps and that is in limited cases. It reduces the new IRS funding, that of course, Democrats aimed to go after wealthy folks to recapture those funds, well, all of those funds now not on the table, and it also claws back unused COVID relief funds. So we're going to get a better sense of what precisely is in this deal. Right now, it is all a framework.

They may have gotten other things, I'm not happy with some of the things I'm hearing about, but they are not cutting the deficit and they are not cutting spending because if you think about the fact that they've agreed to increase Pentagon spending, number one, they've agreed to increase VA spending, number two. And while there are some fiscal -- you know, calculations that are being made around what non-Defense discretionary spending is, and by the way, for people that are listening to that, that's a lot of mumbo jumbo. That's basic spending on things like health care, education, child care, all the things you care about is what Republicans want to cut.

But Ken Paxton did take to Twitter in response to his impeachment, saying in part: \"I am beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what we just witnessed is illegal, unethical and profoundly unjust. I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate where I have full confidence the process will be fair, and just.\" So what happens in the Texas House? What we know is that the lieutenant governor serves as judge, the 31 senators serve as jurors and that a two-thirds vote of those senators who are present is required to convict.

The Ukrainian military is saying that of 59 Shahed drones, they were able to take down 58 of those, so a huge success rate there for the Ukrainian military. And the largest part of those drones apparently were directed at this area, Kyiv, and the surrounding areas, now certainly where people who were harmed in this, two people were killed mostly by debris from destroyed drones falling to the ground. There were also a bunch of buildings that were damaged in this area, one fairly large warehouse was damaged and partially caught fire as well. It is a pretty dramatic video that came out from the Chernihiv region, that's in the north of Ukraine, of border guards there apparently firing into the sky, and then as they put it, taking down one of those Shahed drones, obviously firing a lot of bullets to take the Shahed down. And certainly that's something that hasn't gone unnoticed by Ukraine's president as well. He came out today in one of his addresses, and he praised those fighting against this threat of those drones, calling them heroes. At the same time, the Ukrainians obviously pretty angry at Iran, for allowing Russia to have those drones. An adviser to the presidential administration here in Ukraine warned Iran that there could be retaliation from Ukraine after the Iranians gave the Russians those drones -- Fredricka.",

Spanish authorities towed the ship back to port. Orcas had been sinking three or have sunk three boats earlier this year and there have been other attacks as well. Spanish authorities are warning sailors to immediately leave the area if they see any strange behavior. I want to bring in now killer whale researcher, Dr. Deborah Giles for more perspective on this and people don't call you doctor, but instead Giles. So Giles, good to see you. DR. DEBORAH GILES, KILLER WHALE RESEARCHER: Hi, thank you for having me.  WHITFIELD: Wonderful. So there are a lot of theories out there. That in one case, a female orca was traumatized by a boat collision and began, you know, taking it out on other ships. And then fellow orcas kind of learned how to follow suit on that. Another theory is that, you know, this simply is a game that juvenile orcas are playing for fun. So what do you think is going on?",

They are smart and can pick out behaviors quickly.I'm in that camp of play as opposed to say, an aggressive thing, because I believe, given what we know about killer whales, in general, if they were really trying to take a boat down, they would be hitting it harder, they would be hitting it, I think in a more concerted effort. There seems to be a lot of interest in the rudder in the underside of the boat that the whales are focusing on. And the other thing that really makes me feel that it's more of a play thing with the boat is that when the boats have become completely disabled by sinking, something like that, then people are transferred to a smaller boats, the whales leave. They don't continue their interaction with the second vessel.",

I can't imagine what it would be like to be on a boat and have that interaction kind of, and it seems like for some folks, it's over the course of several hours, it would be quite scary.But again, I think that given what we know about killer whales in other parts of the world, this part of the world in particular, we've just not seen that kind of aggression, even when the whales have been targeted, in some cases by being shot at over decades, and you know, in some cases, during the capture era, whales were captured. There is one famous incident where scientists, in order to document that we could actually tell these whales, year after year, as individuals, they took a pocket knife, one of them took a pocket knife and carved out two triangles in the trailing edge of the dorsal fin. Also, the southern resident fish eating killer whales back during the capture era, every single one of them was rounded up multiple times. And these whales saw their family members being taken right out of the wild and put into -- you know, taken away. And yet all of those incidents never has led to any of the whales in this region, \"attacking boats.\" And so -- and it just kind of speaks to the playful nature, they have a curiosity streak and they do learn from each other and they do adopt behaviors that spread through the population, seemingly popping up out of nowhere, and often disappearing out of nowhere, just as quickly.",

I think that there are some measures that can be taken to hopefully limit these encounters, possibly having vessels which isn't necessarily the thing that sailors want to do out there, going in more of groups of boats traveling if they're trying to get from Point A to Point B, that might be an option, possibly having motorized vessel escorts. Again, not really the romantic quiet sail trip that some people might be after.But I do believe that it is important to remember that we're in their world. We're in the marine realm. They were here long before vessels were plying the waters, as a species they were. And so giving them the respect that they deserve and giving them the space whenever possible, if an encounter starts to occur it seems like one of the things that people can do is stop that hasn't been effective for all cases as I understand, but it does seem to be the forward motion and water moving over the keel that the whales are particularly interested in and they may just be drafting in that area where the water is being sucked along as the vessel is moving forward. And so that's one thing people can do. You know, one group I did see banged on the hull of the boat to maybe drive them away things like that might help in the situation. I do feel badly for the people. Obviously, it must be terrifying, but also the loss of property is part of it, too.",

It is about five points, 52, 53 to 47, 48 percent. And so it is a decisive victory, and what's interesting about it is it was a unified opposition candidate, a single unified opposition candidate that eventually made it to the runoff, and he still couldn't beat Erdogan for his third term. And so wherever you look in the world now, Turkey is what President Erdogan calls the Turkish century is how he is now going to view it. From the United States' point of view, the number one issue is going to be NATO and is Turkey going to drop its opposition to Sweden joining NATO over Ukraine. President Erdogan has been forceful against President Biden in this regard and now the two leaders will have to find some sort of way forward, some sort of negotiation if you can. But here you have President Erdogan with a third term, powerful in terms of geopolitics, an economy that is in trouble, but certainly giving no quarter.",
