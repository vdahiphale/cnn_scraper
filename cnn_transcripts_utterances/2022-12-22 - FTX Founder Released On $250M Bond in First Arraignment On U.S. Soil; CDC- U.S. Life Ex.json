      "sentences": "Yes, Victor. So the big number here is $250 million. That's what prosecutors say is an unprecedented amount in a financial fraud case. A fraud that they said was on the scale of epic proportions.So in addition to the $250 million bond, which Bankman-Fried and his parents and two others have to sign, the judge also said that he was going to be subjected to home detention. He was -- he is now going to be required to stay in his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, and also subject to electronic monitoring. He was fitted for an ankle bracelet before he walked out of the courthouse today, you know, the first time he's been on U.S. soil since his arrest last week. This is the first time that we have seen him in a courtroom in America. He was escorted in by a U.S. Marshal wearing a navy blazer and a white shirt. But you could hear the clinking of the shackles around his ankles as he was led to a seat at the defense table. He only spoke once during the hearing when the judge asked him if he understood what the consequences would be if he bail, jumped or if there was any issues with him abiding by the terms of this deal. And he said, yes, I do. His parents were seated there with him, the third row behind him in the court room. They didn't say anything while they were in there. It was a relatively short hearing. The judge said that Bankman-Fried would return to court next month for an arraignment on these eight criminal counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. And as you saw when he was leaving there, it was quite a scrum of journalists, given it's the first time we've seen him, the former so-called crypto king in the U.S. to face these charges, Victor.",

      "sentences": "I mean, that was a significant development overnight that the prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's office here in the Southern district of New York, announced his number -- his co-founder, Gary Wang of FTX and also Caroline Ellison. She was the former CEO of Alameda Research. That was the hedge fund that is also intertwined in this alleged fraud.Now, interestingly, today prosecutors also revealed a little bit more about the evidence that they had. They said in addition to those cooperating witnesses, they also have the testimony of dozens of former employees of FTX and Alameda, as well as encrypted messages, saying that the number -- the amount of evidence that they have in this case is strong. That's something that the magistrate judge also acknowledged in this matter. So having a cooperation is really key for prosecutors, especially in a complicated financial fraud case. It's someone who can help walk both the prosecutors and potentially a jury through the evidence and explain what was happening. It also is potentially why they have those encrypted messages and are going to be able to explain what happened. You know, as we've learned from the bankruptcy so far of FTX, they had little -- it was seemingly a disorganized place. They didn't have financial statements in some of these areas, in some of these business units. So having the help of insiders is really very significant to the prosecutors and it adds to the pressure that Bankman-Fried is facing. Victor?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's really important, Victor. And you're right. I mean, the day that Zelenskyy was here, Putin meeting with his defense minister, was talking about really major reinvestment in the military, reorganizing it, increasing the numbers, new hypersonic missiles. And, in fact, even President Putin himself said, you know, we need more drones, and we have to put them everywhere.So, there was a big emphasis on that. And then also, I think, in that kind of muscular messaging that you're talking about, he was saying -- President Putin was saying, you know, this is a conflict with NATO. And we can answer NATO. We can fight anywhere. We can put as much money as is necessary into this. And then he even added, you know, war is tough. People die. It's really too bad, but better now than later. And then the other whiney side was, I think, you know, if you were President Putin, I think you'd have to be kind of -- I don't know, hurt by the fact that there is President Zelenskyy on the world stage meeting with the President of the United States. And the imagery coming from the Kremlin was President Putin in the Kremlin behind, you know, in a suit, behind a podium, a very kind of old image of a leader, whereas Zelenskyy is there, you know, in his fatigues, in that olive drab, looking very much like a wartime leader. Very different pictures.",

Every installment of military support from the west, from the U.S. comes with this threat from Russia. Sometimes it's nuclear, sometimes not. I wonder how they see the addition of this Patriot missile system. Of course, the Ukrainians think that this is step forward. How escalatory do the Russians believe it is?",

He said that it's not as good as our S-300s. So I think, you know, that's his response, kind of dismissing it.What militarily they think, I'm sure, is that it is a potent system. Granted, there's only one battery at this point, but I think symbolically and that's, you know, we're talking military, but also symbolism, it is a sign of the escalation of the aid coming from the United States militarily for Ukraine. So I would presume that Moscow would be worried about that, and hence that's why you have the Kremlin saying, well, this is just going to create more problems and more suffering. I think all the message, Victor, coming from Moscow is this is going to go on for a very, very long time. And I would say that Putin has really upped the ante in this, definitely by what he said and what he did.",

You know, prior to the pandemic, for the most part, these life expectancy rates were going up, up, up with medical advances and more better diagnostics and prevention. But, unfortunately, now we've seen it go down for the second year in a row.So let's take a look at what the CDC found in this report. They found that life expectancy in 2021 was 76.4. That's a seven-month decrease from the year before. And this is really a gut punch. The biggest drop, the biggest drop in life expectancy was for people between the ages of 35 and 44. So very young people. The two drivers, as you mentioned, were COVID and drug overdoses. So nearly one in eight U.S. deaths in 2021 was due to COVID -- were due to COVID-19, and nearly 107,000 deaths were from drug overdoses. Now, Victor, I hope that when we're sitting here a year from now and they do the 2022 report, that we will hopefully be able to say that life expectancy went back up again. But we will have to see.
