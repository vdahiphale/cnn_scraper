Just moments ago, Hezbollah announcing it launched long-range missiles from Lebanon toward Jerusalem after the confirmed death of its top leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut yesterday. Tonight, there are questions about what remains of Hezbollah's leadership and what a potential response might look like. For Israel's part moments ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has arrived at a, quote, \"historic turning point,\" saying Nasrallah's killing was necessary for achieving its goals. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): There's no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.

We kind of got a sense of the likelihood or a possibility of a ground incursion when the defense minister announced that it had a meeting with the army chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi. Some of the senior intelligence officials as well. There they said they sort of had an operational assessment of the situation along the northern border, plus the possible increase of what the IDF or what the troops could be doing along the border.There's a lot of signaling over the past few days, you know, a video of troops, newly arrived, the newly called up reservists arriving, getting their equipment, all of that. The messaging is continuing creating that impression that there's a possibility maybe for a ground incursion or for some sort of additional deployment of the troops along the border. Now, Wolf Blitzer just in the past couple of hours asked Peter Lerner, IDF spokesman, about that possibility of a ground incursion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: There's a huge amount of different tools that we have in our toolbox. Ground operations is one of them. We are preparing for that if it is required, if we received the instructions. And of course, the primary goal with regard to the front with Hezbollah is to restore safety and security so that 60,000 Israelis that have been evacuated from the front precisely because of the aggression and actions of Hezbollah can go home safely and securely.

What's happened late this evening was an incoming missile into the West Bank towards Jerusalem. Sirens went off in Jerusalem. But this missile was intercepted and landed in part in Mitze Hagit, which is a settlement in the West Bank. West Bank, a vast majority Arab population settlement -- Israeli population. So the question then becomes, was Hezbollah targeting this tiny settlement inside the West Bank with all the risk of hitting the Arab population that surround that area? It's not clear precisely what the target was, but the medical rescue services who were on the scene said they went to three different locations where there were some impact of shrapnel or missile. Not clear there were fires there, but they said they didn't report any casualties.",

I think you've got to remove Hezbollah's capability if Israel and the region as a whole are going to be safe. And the first step to do that is to destroy this extraordinarily large missile arsenal.I mean, the CIA factbook says that it could be up to 150,000 and there are any number of public estimates out there, some even larger than that, of which may be 10,000 have been used since the Hamas attack on October 7th. This is extraordinary capability that Hezbollah has and as I say, as long as it's there, as long as there is somebody who can push the buttons, Israel remains unsafe. And that doesn't even get to the question of Iran, which is the paymaster, the armor equipper, trainer, financer for the Houthis, Hamas, Hezbollah, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria.

Their credibility is systematically being destroyed by these Israeli successes. And to get that credibility back with their terrorist proxies, they need to take a strong stand against Israel, really impose a heavy cost for what the Israelis have done.But they are I think petrified in Tehran that this time the Israelis will not succumb to the White House pressure. They will not take the win, whatever that means. This time if Iran itself gets involved Israel will strike hard in Iran as they would be entirely justified in doing.

Those rockets were intercepted, drones were intercepted. There was a measure of retaliation. There was what we would have called tit-for-tat. But after 10 months of that and with much of the war in Gaza already prosecuted, Israel essentially had had enough. And you saw that very clearly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements. Not only that, I'll point out for years here since the end of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah really, Israel has known another war or believed another war with Hezbollah was coming unlike, for example, in Gaza where Israel didn't see that coming and that was very plainly obvious over the course of October 7th and the ensuing weeks. Israel believed the war with Hezbollah was coming, and therefore carried out the work on intel, carried out the preparations and the planning that you see have so quickly played out over the course of the past two weeks. Israel saw that it had the opportunity to go after Hezbollah's leadership. The U.S. believed it was close to a ceasefire agreement. In fact, U.S. officials were quite optimistic about that just a few days ago. Israel, Netanyahu had very much other plans. It's worth pointing out that when Netanyahu talks about his stated goals, the goal is not the elimination of Hezbollah. It is not the destruction of Hezbollah. That would be an incredibly difficult task and a bridge too far right now for what Israel is claiming. The goal is to return some 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel. And that is where Israel, that's where we're waiting to see how Israel decides to carry that out from this point on having destroyed Hezbollah's leadership. It's also worth pointing out that in terms of what we're seeing from Hezbollah, Israel believed Hezbollah could launched thousands of rockets a day for a sustained period of time in a war and that's not really what we have seen from Hezbollah so far. It's hundreds of rockets a day. So very different than what the expectation had been for a larger war between Israel and Hezbollah.",

Part of that is probably attributed to the fact that Israel was or rather the U.S. was very much focused on trying to get a ceasefire in place. The U.S. has been focused basically since October 7th in trying to make sure there wasn't an expansion of the war.And it believed that for Israel to go after a target like Hassan Nasrallah would have essentially fan the flames of war and risk the regional war that the U.S. have been trying to avoid. So that may be the reason Israel didn't telegraph much in advance, really an advance at all what its plans were and that it was going after Nasrallah. In fact, it was just moments before with the aircraft already in the air that Defense Minister Yoav Galant told U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that the strike was going to happen. So no real time for consultations or pushing back, and it seems that was very much Israel's intent in this case. And it's not the first time we have seen this level of tension. It was just 11 or 12 days ago that Israel told the U.S. something was going to happen in Lebanon, providing absolutely no details. And then we saw the pager explosions. There was no heads up about the walkie-talkie explosions a day later. So Israel is very much playing its cards very closely even as we have seen this escalate quite significantly over the course of the past two weeks.",

And as a result, encounters on the border are down enormously. I mean, we're talking to 200,000, 250,000 toward the end of last year, about 50,000 a month now in this year. And as you saw in Harris's speech, she is committing to continue in this direction. It's a little bit like inflation, though. Even though the conditions now are better, the overhang of what happened earlier in Biden's presidency is still a headwind against her.

But the CNN poll had them only tied because she was not winning the usual share of black voters, only around 79% of black voters. By the way, this is the exact same pattern we saw in the \"New York Times\" polls released today about Michigan and Wisconsin, the \"Fox\" poll released about Pennsylvania. All of these polls show Democrats slightly below -- slightly below where -- Harris slightly below where Democrats usually are among nonwhite voters at/or above Biden's share among white voters. So the question is, is that support Trump is drawing among nonwhite voters real in polls, or is this capturing something significant that's changing? And even if it is, can he hold it all the way to the finish line? And conversely, can Harris continue to run at least as well as Biden did in 2020 among whites?

And if you look the site -- if you look across the battleground states, I had access to some data that's rarely discussed in public from a -- targeting firm called \"Catalyst.\" It shows that the voters who are highly likely to support Trump, but uncertain whether they're going to vote at all are predominantly, preponderantly, whites without a college degree, while Harris' pool of voters who fit that same description in the Rust Belt states are -- in the Sun Belt states are predominantly people of color, young voters, Latino and black. And in the Rust Belt states, it's a combination of those voters and non-college white women. In many ways, you know, the irony of modern politics is that even at a point where we are so irrevocably and passionately divided between the parties, it is the people who are uncertain whether they care enough to participate at all who probably will tip the balance in the end in these few states that will decide our next president.",

And what people tell me is that part of the problem is not only what you can see, but also what you cannot see, the communications problem, mobile phone services are down, and also people trying to get the basic necessities. I was talking to a gentleman earlier who told me that he tried to go to the store. He went to a supermarket. He found 400 people, by his own estimate, waiting in line outside for the chance to buy some things. This is how he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On Friday, the mayor pleaded not guilty to five federal corruption charges during a court appearance. Those charges include bribery, wire fraud, as well as accepting gifts, free luxury travel, and campaign donations from foreign powers. Adams, who was first elected to office in 2021, has said he has no plans to resign.CNN's Gloria Pazmino is following this story. There are so many layers to this, Gloria, and there has been strong push back from Adams' attorney. Tell us more about that?",

And the reason I say that is because we're starting to see just the contours of what Eric Adams' defense is going to look like. Because we heard from his lawyer on Friday after the mayor was arraigned and released.We are starting to hear much of what the mayor has already said over the past two days, that these gifts that he received were just gifts, that the airline upgrades that he received were just airline upgrades, and that some of what is alleged in the complaint, in the indictment, happened long before he became mayor, and that, therefore, he was not using his authority or his power to pressure anybody into doing what the government alleges. I want you to take a listen to Alex Spiro. He is representing the mayor in this federal -- in this federal case, and he spoke to reporters shortly after that arraignment. Take a listen.
