That exchange sort of brief. The moderator didn't push back after he again denied the allegations. I think more noteworthy is Walker's evolving stance on this policyissue of abortion. Initially he said that he didn't support any exceptions. Then he said he supported Senator Lindsey Graham's national abortion ban. And now he is saying he supports Georgia's abortion bill, which includes limited exceptions. Take a listen to how that exchange played out last night.

And I tell people this, Georgia is a state that respects life, and I will be a senator that protects life. And I said that was a lie, and I am not backing down. SEN.

Tia, we're grateful that you're sharing part of your Saturday with us. A lot of negative headlines for Herschel Walker over the last few weeks. He needed a big win last night. How would you rate his performance? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION\": Again, I think Eva really laid it out clearly that the bar was set really low, really by Herschel Walker himself, and so, relatively, he did well. His answers were coherent for the most part. He wasn't rambling. It wasn't hard to follow him. Now, of course, there are going to be a lot of people who didn't agree with everything he said, and some of the things he said were factually inaccurate. But at least you could follow it. And for Herschel Walker, compared to some of his other extemporaneous speaking engagements, that is a big improvement for him. And as a result, I think most people are saying he won, but I think it's all relative. Again, Reverend Warnock, now Senator Warnock, is a very accomplished public speaker.

If anything else, the support for Herschel Walker has shown that his supporters are willing to give him a pass for a lot of things. So moving from election denialism to accepting the outcome in an effort to win a general election, I think for the most part people who want to support him will accept that answer.

Now, of course, his absence there is reflective of his poll numbers. The president is unpopular. And so therefore, the president is not visiting these states where there are Democrats who are in very, very tight races. Instead, we know that the president told his advisors that where he sees being most beneficial with his contributions is going to these Democratic strongholds and trying to make the case, draw the contrast between Democrats and those political rivals, people he frequently refers to as MAGA Republicans, while also trying to lay down what the stakes are.

Back in the beginning part of his presidency, 73 percent. From July to August of 2021, 69 percent. From September, 2021, to March of 2022, 52 percent.

Look at that. There we go -- 26 points. And look at 2022. Just 21-point lead.Now, one group that I think is very interesting to look at here is the gender gap. The choice for Congress among Hispanic, look at Hispanic women. You see Democrats still a very large lead at 29 points. But look among Hispanic men. Just a nine-point lead for Democrats. So we see that Hispanic men are really driving this change among Hispanics to be a little less Democratic.

And as you mentioned, we see in this clip we are about to watch that Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence are talking about contingency plans for certifying the election. This is as rioters have been storming the Capitol for hours. But the former vice president and the House Speaker are focused on certifying the election, and that remains the goal. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: We're at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and Senate to meet as a backup plan should anything -- should anything happen that would warrant that. Logistically, we want to bring all the members here, House and Senate, anyway. We're just making a judgment. We'd rather go to the Capitol and do it there. But it doesn't seem to be safe. (END VIDEO CLIP) COHEN: So you'll notice that Nancy Pelosi was so concerned about the safety -- or the safety situation at the capitol at that time that they were willing to try to figure out a way to convene lawmakers and bring the vice president to Fort McNair to certify the election. Ultimately, that wasn't necessary. But other videos really show the remarkable amount of fear for both Vice President Pence's safety and their own in that moment. We have Chuck Schumer at one point yelling at the secretary of the army to send troops in to help protect the U.S. Capitol. So we really see both this balancing act between the concern and the level of fear and the level of safety concerns that were present that day, but also this focus in this push forward to certify the election, which they ultimately did.

Researchers at Indiana University have found that fewer hits to the head happen when young players practice what's known as air training. They say that implementing contactless practice drills could be one of the most impactful ways to curb the number of head injuries in football. Joining us now to discuss is Dr. Elizabeth Matzkin, a surgeon at MassGeneral Brigham Sports Medicine who works with high school and Division I college football teams. Doctor, we're grateful to have you this morning. I'm curious to get your impressions of this study coming out of Indiana University and how air training differs from what we have generally. DR. ELIZABETH MATZKIN, SURGEON, MASS GENERAL BRIGHAM SPORTS MEDICINE: Good morning, and thank you. So I think when we think about this study, I think it's important to understand that concussion doesn't always equate to loss of consciousness, and that concussion can be any jolt to the head that causes the brain to move quickly within our skull. And so what this study looks at is head impact. So not just kids that are falling so hard that they are losing consciousness, but the number of impacts they are seeing by the intensity level of the drills they are doing in practice. And so as you had already mentioned, they looked at a level of contact which went from basically contactless drills, where the athletes aren't having any contact with each other or the ground, and then all the way up to live play in which there was full contact with other players and the ground. And it's pretty intuitive, but the level of contact decreases when you are not actually hitting other players, and the number of head impact exposures also decreases. The importance of this is that --",
