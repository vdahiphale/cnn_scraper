We don't have to forget that while Italian cities remain popular less traditional destinations are experiencing a really significant growth in visits, let's say up to 20-30 percent.So what I can recommend to tourists coming to Italy is try to avoid big cities and touristic cities next season and try to concentrate on smaller cities and villages that are beautiful.",

In a recent \"Washington Post\" op-ed, a top official from the museum addressed how the institution collected tens of thousands of body parts during the first half of the 20th century.Lonnie Bunch wrote that they were largely taken from black and indigenous people, mostly without their consent. Well, this comes after a \"Washington Post\" investigation revealed that the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum is in possession of more than 30,000 human body parts from people in the Philippines, Peru, Germany and the United States. After being closed off to the outside world for three years due to concerns about COVID, North Korea is once again allowing its planes to fly outside the country. The first known international commercial flight from North Korea since January of 2020 landed in Beijing on Tuesday. North Korea also plans to resume flights to Russia on Friday. Excitement is growing in India as the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is just hours away from making a historic attempt to land on the moon. If the mission is successful, it will make India the fourth country to land on the moon after the U.S., China and the former Soviet Union. People across India have been praying for a successful landing and schools will allow students to watch a live telecast of the event. India's space research organization is already sharing stunning photos from the mission including a close-up of the moon's dusty gray terrain. India's moon mission comes days after a Russian spacecraft crashed into the moon. Joining us now from Houston Texas is retired NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao. Thank you so much for joining us. So good to have you with us. The Russian mission to the moon ended unfortunately in disappointment. What makes it so difficult to land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole?",

But nonetheless it is very difficult to land on the moon. There havebeen a number of attempts and only a handful as you've pointed out have been successful. To date, no commercial entity has successfully landed anything on the moon. Most recently, just a couple of months ago, a Japanese private commercial venture failed.

They have their own plans for the next few years to fly their own astronauts into space. They've developed advanced rockets with cryogenic engines. So they are doing quite well.

You know, it's I think the space race might be a little bit of -- a little bit of an extension because, you know, all of the different countries are vying to put probes down there. And NASA of course, has very publicly said that they are going to go explore the moon. So is China, by the way. But, it does not have the urgency of the space race, the race to the moon of the 1960s.
