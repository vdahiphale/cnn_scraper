G7 leaders making that decision in Italy at their annual summit. The loan will amount to $50 billion, money that Kyiv desperately needs. US President Biden and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy just signed a 10-year security deal thereto. They praised the new loan in their joint remarks afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, turning now to Tesla, we should know in a matter of minutes whether its shareholders have approved an astronomical pay package for CEO, Elon Musk. Musk has already said he has the votes to receive around $50 billion worth of Tesla stock options. Now, a Delaware judge had struck down his compensation plan back in January. She said the process of awarding it was deeply flawed. Tesla shares rallied, however, on Musk's announcement closing four percent higher. The results of the vote are due to be announced this hour of the company's annual general meeting. Anna Stewart has more details.

We've already heard from a number investors who have said they are not going to vote in favor of the package. In fact, it is difficult to ever get unanimity in a large corporation. That's why companies are very careful when they create a compensation package that in fact has the rational incentives to it, that are necessary. Now, if there is an incentive to it and it really works, yes, a majority can approve it, but because it had business purpose, the problem here is the judge found that it didn't. And awarding yourself massive amounts of equity by a board that the judge found was not independent of Mr. Musk, the board the judge found effectively he was negotiating with himself. The board is there to protect all the investments, not one or two, everyone's. And she found that they failed and I think that's really the issue here. I don't think he is going to walk away from a 20 percent investment in the company, though it is now down to I guess, about 13 percent. My gosh, that's an enormous amount wealth.

Listen, there are certainly people I think who think he is terrific and he has been very creative and very entrepreneurial. And done some amazing things. But no company is based around one human being. We have a vice president of the United States in the event that the president becomes incapacitated. Every business does think about what happens next and to build an entire company around one person when a company should be going on indefinitely, at least its shareholders expected that when they bought into the stock, is I think on an important part and gather for it, I would not have agreed with that particular approach. You can't build something around one human being. There has to be accountability and that's what's missing in this package, and that's I think ultimately a real problem for that company.

The English Pro Football Association and the French Players Union accusing FIFA of violating players' rights and potentially E.U. competition law by creating a calendar that it says is, quote, \"overloaded and unworkable.\" Now according to world players union FIFPRO Europe, FIFA has failed to meaningfully engage or negotiate and have unilaterally continue to program a competition expansion despite the opposition of player unions. Now, CNN has been proactive in reaching out to the world governing body for football, FIFA, trying to get comment on the legal action.

Why don't you stop complaining and get on with it? But all of a sudden now, 18 months down the line, you see that it has become now an industry problem. It's no longer about a few unions or few players complaining. It's just even the fans, even the most skeptical fans saying I want to see my player playing because if I don't, I lose games, if I lose games, I'm sad. So for the first time I think we're no longer talking about the problem of players.
