And just a short time from now, the NTSB will hold a press conference as we learn another airline has found problems with its planes. Now, just days after a blowout on the side of an Alaska Airlines flight left a massive hole in the plane, United Airlines is revealing that loose bolts have been found on these Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plugs. And Alaska tonight says that it found, quote, loose hardware on some of its planes. Now, these are pictures of the plug about the size of a fridge. We'll show you an illustration of what happened in just a moment. And the warning signs were there, it seems. The Alaska Airlines plane was restricted from flying long routes over the ocean after its warning light came on three times in recent weeks. Now, just listen to this Portland science teacher who was the one who found that panel in his own backyard. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One is, did Spirit Aerospace (ph) follow the steps in the installation of that plug? Who signed off on the completion of that task? What redundancy was involved in any oversight by Boeing in regard to looking at that, and who had the ultimate responsibility that that was correctly installed? That, I think, in light of the announcement by United today, is obviously now a fleet-wide issue.The issue of the CVR also, I think, is extremely important. The U.S. has lagged in terms of cockpit voice recorders, and we need to have the 24 hours recorder like we have in Europe. That's something the chairman of the NTSB has pushed for. And we should have a warning signal in our safety system that we've had a majority of serious runway incursions that could not be adequately investigated because they didn't have a 24-hour CVR. I think the third item is the oversight of Boeing. It went under a fine tooth comb inspection by the aviation subcommittees, and has the culture of that company changed?",

I know Kamala Harris was out last year to a lot of black colleges. I know President Biden has been in other black institutions in the past. But Nina makes a good point. And I think if I were in the campaign, you know, I've been in several campaigns in the past, if I were advising President Biden, I'd advise him to do several things. First, he has to engage those people who haven't been traditionally engaged but who are part of his base, black voters, young black voters in particular, young people in general, Arab-Americans, people who have some concern about some of his policies. He needs to be directly talking to them. Everybody in that church will vote for Joe Biden, except for the four or five people who protested. But everybody in that church is going to vote for him. So, he's not really winning any converts there. He needs to be talking to the people who aren't necessarily going to be voting for him. But, you know, then secondly, there has to be some more policy adjustments, too. People are concerned about some issues, about student loans, they're concerned about Gaza, they're concerned about some of the policies about student loans that he hasn't necessarily been able to deliver, like the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, for example, or the John Lewis Voting Act, that Nina mentioned. But he has to talk about the things he has accomplished, a historic funding for HBCUs, for example, the historic low rates of unemployment for black people, or even the idea that he's able to pass the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act after 100 years of Democrats and Republicans attempting to sabotage that. So, I think there's some room for progress, but he has to be engaged in this seriously and can't wait to the last minute to push this out.",

It's a defense that's never been tested before, and he's not only using it for the January 6th case against him, but also for the Georgia one too. And his lawyers argue that Trump was working in his official capacity as commander-in-chief when he tried to undermine the 2020 election results. The attorneys wrote in part, the Supreme Court has held that states cannot use their criminal law to interfere with actions that are inseparably connected to the functioning of the national government.

The appeal -- they are there to answer a question. What are you asking the court to do?Not how a jury will find, but what's the legal question here? It is not an overall fact-finding hearing where they're going to have witnesses and testimony, or the courthouse steps moments of -- even the AGs filing against Trump in New York. Instead, it is, what is the legal basis? And this is interesting about this. The court could very well conclude whether there is immunity or not, without even touching the underlying facts of the case. The legal question is, does a president have absolute immunity that they cannot be prosecuted for anything they did while they were in office? That's not -- did he commit insurrection? That's not -- was he engaged in insurrection? That is, do you have absolute immunity? And for that, Trump will be very, very disappointed if he finds himself trying to wonder, will they actually say I can commit insurrection or not?",

And so I kind of played this mind game with myself that like, oh, maybe that was just an anomaly.But just before I went to Israel, the war had broken out on October 7th. I knew that I had a lump and I had done a mammogram. And I went anyway because I wasn't sure what it was and they said, okay, well, you're going to need to come back for a biopsy. And I said, okay. Was that the right choice? I don't know. But it is sort of typical of me to go and do the job that I feel like the best place I'm supposed to be for the company, for the story. And I have to tell you that being there at a time when I was almost 100 percent sure that I was going to come back and find out I had cancer, it really shifted my thought process, seeing what people were going through there, seeing what happened to people in Israel after a Hamas attack, and then seeing what happened to people in Gaza. And living through that and watching them try to survive something that frankly is far worse than anything I'd been diagnosed with at the point, and anything that I would be diagnosed with later. It taught me that living is the ultimate and that nothing else matters, and it really set my head straight. When I got back, and four days later, after I got my biopsy, I found that I had stage three breast cancer.",

I had to read it three or four times, that one in eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime. Those are the statistics.So, I can name eight women right now, and it completely blows my mind that one of us is going to get it. I'm the one in my group. But then I went further, and I'm like -- 41 percent. That is how much more likely you are to die if you happen to be a black woman. What the hell are we doing? That just should not be true.
