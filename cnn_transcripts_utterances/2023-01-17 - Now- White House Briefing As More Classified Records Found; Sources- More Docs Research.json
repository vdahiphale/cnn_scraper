LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Victor and Alisyn, we just wrapped up a lengthy phone call, a press call with reporters that the White House Counsel's office spokesperson held, trying to offer a robust defense of how the White House has handled all of this so far, including sort of the timing of the disclosure of information, and sort of the decision to wait to disclose certain information and the fact that some of this information has really come out in piecemeal fashion over the last week or so. But the spokesperson, Ian Sams, really started off the call by saying how -- again, that he was limited in what he could say, given that there is now an ongoing investigation by the special counsel. Though he did emphasize again, that the president takes classified information matters very seriously and that the White House and the president's lawyers have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with this ongoing investigation. One thing that he said in defense of how the White House has consulted all of this was -- he said, as searches were underway looking for additional documents to be properly handed back to the government, we want it to be respectful to try to provide as complete information as we could, trying to balance with the need to provide that information to you all consistent with the investigation. I have to tell you. This was a press call that lasted well over half an hour. And, unfortunately, we don't have a better picture right now compared to before that press call as to some of the details that have really been plaguing the White House about how all of this has been handled. Just to name a few of the questions that came up on this call that we didn't get an answer to, why the White House waited months to disclose the discovery of the classified documents in the first place. No answer to that question. Will there be or are there additional searches that are going on right now? That's not something that the White House Council spokesperson would engage on. Why were Biden lawyers who do not have security clearances, why were they involved in the subsequent searches after those classified documents were discovered? So, guys, I think, again, we are seeing the White House sort of struggle with the tension of dealing with an ongoing investigation and basically, feeling like they're very limited, but also dealing with the criticism about the lack of transparency as well.",

I mean, the FBI didn't go into executing that search warrant with President Trump until 16 months, they've been waiting for him to turn over the documents. It's only been two months for Biden so far, so why would you want the FBI to go in? REP. MIKE WALTZ, (R-FL): Well, I -- that's -- your math is interesting there, Alisyn because, by my math, it's been five years that these documents have been sitting there. And so, if you know, the White House's rendition of kind of events here is correct that we've done the right thing, we've told the National Archives, we've told the Department of Justice, why didn't they tell and do the right thing five years ago, four years ago, three years ago?

I mean I do not think, Victor, based on what we have seen so far that there are any meaningful number of voters who realistically would be open to President Biden who would choose now to flip to opposing him because of what they have seen on this.I do think that despite all the differences that Bradley and others have pointed out between the two cases, in a practical sense, this probably does make it more difficult for the Justice Department to indict Trump for his handling of classified documents if they're not going to indict President Biden. Obviously, that would be something after office. But I'm not sure in the end, even that is entirely good news for Trump. Because I've been skeptical that after, you know, 200 years in which -- 200-plus years in which we've never indicted a former president, that the Justice Department would really do it twice. They would do it on classified documents and they potentially would do it on the much more important issue of January 6 and the attempt to subvert the election. So, if this clears the decks on the classified documents issue, I think it might make it even more likely that the Justice Department moves forward on the question I think almost all Americans would agree is more important, what Donald Trump did after the 2020 election.",

Police also say that one member of the group, a cooperating witness, said that he intended to shoot above the windows in these homes to prevent from hitting anyone. But -- and I'll read part of this affidavit, the confidential witness stated that Solomon wanted the shootings to be more aggressive. The witness stated that Solomon wanted them to aim lower and shoot around 8:00 p.m. because occupants would be more likely not be laying down. Now, the motive remains under investigation. But in looking at his social media presence, this suspect has a documented history of election denying. Now, one of the elected officials allegedly targeted was on CNN this morning and spoke about an encounter she had with Pena right after the election. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
