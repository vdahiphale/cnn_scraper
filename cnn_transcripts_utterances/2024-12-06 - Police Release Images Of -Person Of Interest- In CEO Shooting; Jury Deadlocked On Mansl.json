The man shoots and kills a powerful CEO in broad daylight in arguably the most surveilled city in the nation. How has he managed to evade police for more than 48 hours? CNN has news in Manhattan.Plus, when President-elect Trump first tapped RFK Jr. to be his health secretary, medical professionals were outraged. But now some nutritionists and farming industry advocates say, and by the way, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are coming together and around his idea and say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And later, gay couples are rushing to get married, concerned that their rights and benefits could be threatened under Donald Trump. We're going to speak to a couple who is, quote, terrified about their future and what they're doing about it. A fake I.D. and a flirtatious moment at a New York City hostel, just two developments officials are seizing on this morning as the manhunt continues for the suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Take a look here. I'm sure you've seen it by now. This -- these images showing the person of interest as he checked into a New York City hostel days before the shooting happened. Law enforcement sources tell CNN, he paid in cash and used a New Jersey driver's license. But that license traced back to nothing because it was a fake. Omar Jimenez joins us now. So, Omar, sources are telling us that this man traveled several days before the shooting. Tell us more.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So travel by bus in a route that -- that started in Atlanta but it's unclear when this person actually got on the bus, since there are many stops between there and here. But as you mentioned, well, the big clue that comes from that is that this suspect allegedly got here 10 days before the actual shooting. And then went to the upper west side of Manhattan to check into a hostel where he stayed for a few days, briefly checked out, then checked back in using that fake New Jersey I.D.And that's where this person was believed to have been staying in the lead up to the actual shooting. But then, of course, police released the images that you were just showing a few seconds ago of a person of interest they say is wanted for questioning. They didn't quite go so far to say this is the suspect just yet. But a person of interest is this is an unmasked photo that law enforcement has been doing. Sources telling CNN that this actually this moment actually happened to him, to remove the mask as they were flirting. And then, of course, he's smiling back at her. So it's an authentic moment back and forth, but could end up being one of the biggest clues, if not the biggest one that we've seen so far. So that goes to the question of who this person may be. But, of course, the second question is, where could this person be? When you trade -- when you retrace the steps a little bit and go back to where the shooting happened, it happened in Midtown Manhattan. And then from there, law enforcement traced or tracked the route of where this person went north from that Midtown Manhattan spot toward Central Park. And then from Central Park, we are -- you see this video that eventually comes out on 85th Street, so about 30 blocks north of where the shooting actually happened. And this is where police believe this is in the outskirts of the park. So in theory, there is a path where you could go to the power of the park. They have not found the gray backpack that the shooter was seen wearing at the shooting scene. They do not know what may have been inside. And here you see the route from sort of Midtown Manhattan heading up toward the park. And then at the scene itself, police are also looking at a water bottle that they say has a fingerprint on it, though it appears law enforcement sources tell CNN that it was smudged. So the details might be a little bit harder to be conclusive. But then on top of that, they're also looking at a cell phone that was left at the scene as well to see if there are any clues. So bottom line, these are all the bits and pieces that investigators are trying to comb through to get towards some sort of substantive answer here. Again, on the first question of who this person is, but then, of course, the more pertinent one as well is where this person is.",

So they start with this idea that I'm going to commit this violent act, and then I have to plan and I have to prepare for it before I commit it. And the planning and the preparation, which is where we can see all their actions visible across people around them, people who don't realize what they're seeing, this planning and preparing, that's what we saw when he came in early.He knew, obviously, that this person was going to be there, that was his target. And so he didn't necessarily know his details, his route to get to the guy, his route to get away from the guy. And that is all that planning and preparation. He wanted to be sure. When somebody commits targeted violence, they want to be sure that they're in control of the whole situation. And he was in charge of the whole situation in his mind. And so that's why he had to have plenty of time ahead of time to know where I can go, where I can come away. But we'll see.

On the one hand, you have the prosecution who's indicating that there was at the very least recklessness here. And what is recklessness? The standard is that you consciously disregard the risk of your behavior.What risk? If you have your hand or your arm around someone's neck, would it not be probable or possible that they would die? That's the one narrative. On the other hand, you have the defense saying it was certainly necessary that Jordan Neely represented a danger. The danger was immediate and that there needed to be activity taken. I think the other issue that's hanging them off is there's a causation issue. What does that mean in English? There was differing testimony from the medical examiner who the prosecution had that said, look, it was because of that chokehold that there was the death. Not so fast, said the defense. It wasn't because of the chokehold. There was not enough pressure that was applied, said the defense. It was a combination of factors, schizophrenia, sickle cell anemia and anemia and certain mental maladies that led to a lack of oxidation. So both on causation, that's a problem and both on the issue of whether it was necessary was a problem. So it's not surprising.",

At the same time, criminally negligent homicide, a felony, very significant, but that's an e-felony. And so you don't -- you don't really have the exposure. You have exposure up to four years.
