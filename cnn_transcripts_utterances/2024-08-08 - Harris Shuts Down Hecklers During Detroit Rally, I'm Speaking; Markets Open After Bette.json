You say, I'm not going to take lectures about Master Sergeant Walz's military service from a man who faked bone spurs to get out of service himself, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, who said our war dead are suckers and losers, Donald Trump who stood over the grave of a fallen hero at Arlington Cemetery and said to his dad, I don't get it, what was in it for them? Donald Trump, who doesn't want wounded warriors at his events because, and I, quote, no one wants to see that. Donald Trump, who said John McCain and other POWs were not heroes. Donald Trump, who praised Adolf Hitler, said Hitler did a lot of good things. Donald Trump, who sucks up to Vladimir Putin and told the whole world he believes Putin over courageous American intelligence, Donald Trump, who attacked a gold star family of Captain Humayun Khan of Virginia, who gave his life for our country.

Vance, he opened himself up then to J.D. Vance wanting to say something back at him and pointing out.And, again, I don't necessarily agree with going veteran versus veteran on your service, but I don't think that Tim Walz had thought through it in a way because, you know, today's press conference coming from Donald Trump, a bit rich, as Paul may have pointed out there, but if it comes from J.D. Vance, it's a little bit different, right, because he is a fellow veteran. He actually served as a Marine Corps, like he served overseas in Afghanistan. So, it's very different. And I think we all realize that some of the questionable or misleading comments that Governor Walz has made opens him up to voters than thinking should we be questioning a little bit of his character, what does that say about him? So, I'm not saying that it's a tactic that will benefit because looking backwards has not proven to be effective for Republicans, but also hasn't proven to be effective for Democrats. But, again, this is politics, and this is a part of politics that most Americans find beyond frustrating, because both sides don't know where to stop.",

This shows you, one, how sensitive we are to economic data, but also just the general level of volatility.Let's talk about why it's got investors excited. Let me just show you the numbers. This was first time claimants for unemployment benefits. The number was better than expected. We were expecting around 240,000 people. It's actually 17,000 less than we got last week. Not only that, something that stood out to me, Texas, 6,500 less people claiming first time unemployment benefits in Texas. Why do we care? That jobs number on Friday, the data collection period was during Hurricane Beryl. So, it kind of suggests that maybe weather played a role in that weak number. So, again, optimism being taken from that, it's one data point. We shouldn't act like this but it shows the sensitivity. The final thing we're going to watch today on my list, tech stocks. Are we tech tantruming or are we tech-tastic? Well, we're sort of tech-tastic for now. We have to wait and see. I've pulled out the really sensitive A.I. ones that you all should be watching now. Down the bottom left, super microcomputers, it's a hardware player. It announced weaker than expected earnings yesterday. It plunged 20 percent. We're overreacting to earnings at this moment, too.

Luke Wood and one of the first students to sign up at the black honors college, Olivia Lewis. Thank you both for joining us this morning. Dr. Wood, I want to go first to you. Why do you think it is so critical right now at this point in American history to have a black honors college, the first of its kind? J. LUKE WOOD, PRESIDENT, SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY:  Well, I think it's important to have it because it creates an opportunity for students to be in an environment where they're fully invested in. You know, in California, we have a lot of students who do leave the state to go have an amazing experience at a historically black college or university but we also know that there are students who are place- bound, who can't necessarily leave the state, but want to be able to have an experience that's focused on them, the curriculum, the faculty, the cultural experience is one that's rooted in their history, their life, and their culture.",

And so I would say to any student who's interested in having that kind of experience that this would be one that would be perfect for them. I'll also say that this is part of a larger effort that's taking place across the Cal State system where you're seeing institutions lean into a focus on serving black students and black student success under the leadership of our chancellor, Mildred Garcia. And what we're doing here is a unique component of that, and that we have, you know, our own dean of students, our own director, our own faculty members, our own staff members, our own therapists, our own academic advisers and outreach team. So, we've created an entire ecosystem around these students.

You're seeing the banning of books, the elimination or banning of critical race theory, of African-American studies, of DEI offices, of anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion. And at the same time, in these same states, they'll put the students who are black on the front of their brochures for the colleges and universities.And so what we want to do is be the north star of the west. So, if you're in a state like Florida or Alabama or Texas or other states that are moving away from diversity inclusion, we say, come on over the Sacramento State where you won't just be a name on a sheet, right?
