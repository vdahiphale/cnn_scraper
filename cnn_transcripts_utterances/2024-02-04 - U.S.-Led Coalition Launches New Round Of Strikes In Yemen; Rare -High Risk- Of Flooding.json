      "sentences": "This was a pretty significant round of attacks by the U.S. and the U.K. supported by a broader coalition here. And it targeted 36 targets and 13 locations inside Yemen against the Houthis. It's part of this larger campaign by the U.S. to try to deter the Houthis capabilities as they continue to target commercial shipping and U.S. naval assets in the Red Sea.Now, according to U.S. Central Command, this involved strikes on Houthi infrastructure, Houthi targets, Houthi weaponry and equipment, including radar and equipment, underground storage facilities, things that the U.S. and the U.K. believed the Houthis have been utilizing to attack commercial shipping with missiles and drones over the last several months. And the question now is whether it's actually going to work. But Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement, last night that, quote, this collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end there illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels. We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways. Now the U.S. and its allies have been framing these strikes inside Yemen as self-defense because the Houthis have been targeting us naval warships including just last week, we should note when a missile -- a Houthi missile came within just one mile of a U.S. warship, roughly eight times closer than those missiles have ever come before. And it forced the warship to use really one of its last lines of defenses in order to defend itself against this incoming missile. And so, the U.S. clearly very concerned about this, but they don't have a great idea at this point of just how many weapons and how much capability the Houthis actually have. And so it's hard to say just how much the strikes have actually degraded their capability. So well have to see whether this actually deters the Houthis long term. The U.S. saying that they're going to continue taking these strikes as long as the Houthis continue their attacks.",

Specifically, they say, navigation heading toward Israel until Israel stops its war in Gaza and they've already had a huge impact on international shipping. Four of the five largest commercial shipping companies have now diverted their shipping they no longer go through the Red Sea or the Suez Canal. They go all the way around Africa and that also includes British Petroleum.So, the Yemeni say they will carry on like this. And the Yemenis we know from history have been able to overcome enemies far stronger during between 2015 and 2022, a Saudi-led coalition was trying to defeat the Houthis. But in the end, they essentially gave up and the Houthis emerged stronger than ever before. Now, the Iranians are also condemning these strikes, saying that the United States and the U.K., which are the major partners in this coalition and the Red Sea are fueling what they said, our chaos disorder in security, and instability -- Victor.",

That is aimed at stopping the root, the inspiration for a lot of this violence.But to pull back to the 30,000 foot view of this, Iran is fighting for influence and supremacy in the region and it is very effectively using its proxies like the Houthis to portray themselves as David versus the Goliath of the U.S. and the Western powers by using this choke point of the Red Sea to get the point across. And even though the U.S. has tried to do things like it's sanctioned for settlers, Israeli settlers this past week to try to show that it's being fair. That is also cracking down on Israeli militant violence, the way the message is being perceived across the Middle East is that the U.S. and the West are largely bullies enabling Israel to strike Gaza. And one of the ways that, that has impacted recently, as in the past few days a U.S. plant, a Procter and Gamble plant in Turkey was taken hostage by a single man over the Gaza strikes. And that kind of incident, the U.S. intelligence community fears is going to expand. That the plant according to the BBC and the AP, everyone's been freed.

And the fact that it's going to be around for multiple days is not a good sign.Right now, the heaviest rain is coming down across portions of northern and central California, but we're starting to see that rain surge into southern California as well. And that will be the case as we go through the day to day. These are all of the areas that have the potential for excessive rainfall today. And you can see the worst of it is really right there along the coastline stretching from San Francisco down through L.A. But L.A. specifically and even places over towards Santa Barbara are under a level four out of four, what's called high risk. These are exceptionally rare to be issued. In fact, they're issued on fewer than 4 percent of the days annually on average, but they account for more than 80 percent of the flood damage in nearly 40 percent of flooding depths. L.A. specifically is under a high-risk today, but also tomorrow as well. So it's that prolonged period of dealing with that extremely heavy amount of rainfall that's going to be one of the biggest concerns not only for flooding, but other impacts as well. So you have the dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding. You also have mudslides, landslides, debris flows, especially across some of those burn scar areas, but also down trees and power lines. And that's coming from the high wind threat that we have for today, numerous wind advisories, high wind warnings, where you're talking those wind gusts up around 60 to 80 miles per hour. But even this, for the very first time ever, the San Francisco National Weather Service office issuing a hurricane force wind warning, gas, those could be upwards of 90 miles per hour. So again, going to have some big problems there in addition to the damage imaging winds also the potential for some waterspouts and tornadoes here along the coast that stretches from San Jose down through San Luis Obispo. That's going to be for the day today. Widespread rainfall across California, two to four inches. But when you start getting along the coast and farther south, especially around L.A. and through San Diego. Now you're talking three to seven inches some of these locations, especially higher in elevation, could be looking at ten inches of rain. The snowfall, this is going to be measured in feet. You're talking the Sierra is looking at feet or three to five feet of snow over the next few days. That's going to lead to very dangerous travel conditions.",

There's no process that Congress has enacted. So the question becomes then, who decides. Who is the decider to say well, you're an insurrectionist, you're not an insurrectionist, you're giving aid and comfort to the enemy, you're not giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Those are things that are not spelled out clearly. And the problem I think going forward for the people who are trying to have Trump thrown off the ballot is that in this case, there really was no process, no adversarial process to make that determination.

He is 600-something himself.But if we look at that, she's admitted that she paid him money and then she took the money to travel. Her argument is well, but I also paid for trips for us, too. He pays. That's a little bit like a bank robber saying I didn't rob the bank because I once upon a time made a deposit there. That just doesn't float. If you take the money, you take the money.

I think that we saw her have to wrestle with that and argue about that in front of Judge McBurney when it came to the fund-raiser thing.

Because from what I read, the people who live there are not happy with it.

However, the federal government continues to work down here on the border. Remember, Shelby Park is a park. It's a small piece of land. And we have an entire border that we need to protect and work on, which they continue to do. However, this is the only time that something is getting done. It may not look pretty. It may not look nice. But I agree that at a minimum, it's bringing the attention of the rest of the United States to come and say that we need some assistance down here.",
