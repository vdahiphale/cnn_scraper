Jaber told the panel that there was, quote, \"no science out there or no scenario out there that says that the phasing out fossil fuels will achieve 1.5 degrees.\" He was referring to a temperature threshold aimed at curbing global warming. Today, at COP28, Jaber said that his comments are being misrepresented. Listen.

And prosecutors asked for his detention pending trial, sol to keep him in jail until trial.His attorney is asking for bond to be set. And they will have another hearing later this week. But one of the interesting things that the prosecutors said in the hearing is that they anticipate bringing additional charges against Rocha. And look, the facts, as laid out by prosecutors, they say they are backed up by recordings that he made with an undercover agent. The FBI coming onto him, essentially getting tipped off in 2022 that Rocha had been acting as an agent of the Cuban government since at least 1981. In one of the recordings, there is even a reference to perhaps going back to 1973 when he lived in Chile. But during this time, obviously, according to prosecutors, he was working in various capacities in the U.S. government including working at the Cuban embassy at the U.S. intersection, which was the then, de facto, embassy of the United States in 1986. At the time, you remember, Boris, I'm sure, from the -- when the shoot down on the unarmed planes belonging to Brother to the Rescue happened off the coast of Cuba in international waters. Four people were killed. He was essentially one of the top diplomats of the United States in Havana. According to prosecutors, here's what he said in a number of meetings with his undercover agent. I will read just a part of what they are saying. He said here, \"I want to tell you, I want you to tell my compatriots that I appreciate and I am thankful for this alert.\" Again, this is him talking to an undercover agent that he thought was working for the DGI, Cuban intelligence service. He also said, \"My number-one concern and my number-one priority was any action on the part of Washington that would endanger the life of the leadership or the revolution itself.\" You heard the attorney general refer to another of his statements where he said, \"For me, what has been done has strengthened the revolution.\" According to prosecutors, he was doing this, again, over 40 years, while he was serving in Havana, in Bolivia where he was the U.S. ambassador. But also when he was working in various other diplomatic posts in Argentina and the Dominican Republic and even taking trips to Cuba to meet with the DGI, again, to meet his handlers, according to prosecutors.",

He is now a national security strategist for Carbon Black. And, Eric, we should mention, you helped take down a U.S. spy before. As you are listening to this and hearing details about the case of 73- year-old Manuel Rocha, tell us how much damage someone like this could have done over the decades. ERIC O'NEILL, FORMER FBI COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIVE: Certainly. And it is great to be here with you, Brianna and Boris. Spies can do immense damage. There is no more damage that can be done than the spy who is on the inside. And here we have Rocho, who not only worked for the State Department until about 2002 -- from 2006 to 2012, he was an advisor to the U.S. Southern Command, SOCOM, which is responsible for Cuba and their territories. So he had access to that information that can do incredible amounts of damage. And he also, because he's been a spy for so long, has the knowledge and the wherewithal to get it into the hands of Cuban intelligence where they could target that information and do immense damage potentially to the United States.",

There is also the Cuban Five that were caught in Florida in the late 90s.It seems like the Cuban intelligence service had some success infiltrating U.S. intelligence. Why is that? O'NEILL: They do an amazing job. And I have been going back to those cases. I know a lot about the cases. And now, this new Rocha case has really made me take a look. And it's amazing. Cuba is very capable of recruiting people, U.S. citizens who have access to information, through what we call ideology. So you believe in Cuba, you believe in the revolution, you believe in the struggle, and you're going to help us. It is less about, like, for example, other spies, who are doing it for money or because they are being blackmailed. So these idealogues believe in Cuba and so they are helping this small country that thinks very differently than the United States as far as their government in order to help them achieve their goals.",

And ultimately uses some tradecraft before the meeting.But he seems pretty convinced when this person tells him that they are his new handler and he just goes on to be very open with them. O'NEILL: Yes, the FBI is very adept at holding what we call a false flag operation. So it's an undercover asset - like when I went undercover to catch Robert Hanson (ph), who was a spy for the Russians for over two decades. The undercover assets are trained, we're trained to go and gain the person's trust. Here, clearly, just reading between the lines of the complaint, the FBI knew a good deal of information, enough information to hook him to take the meeting with the U.C., the undercover asset. So for this false flag operation, where they pretend that the undercover FBI agent is part of Cuban intelligence, is meeting with him. This is another thing I have seen about spies, especially long-career spies. They get into it. They feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves. And it seems from the conversation that Rocha felt very comfortable being back active and back in that very exciting spy life that perhaps he had gone dormant from. He does mention -- one of the weirdest things he mentions is he created a legend for himself as someone was right-wing so he would not be found. It seems like he wanted to get back into the game. And the undercover asset is trained to play on that and gain the target's trust.",
