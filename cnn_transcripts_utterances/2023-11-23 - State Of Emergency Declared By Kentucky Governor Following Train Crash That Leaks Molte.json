      "sentences": "An update now to a story we've been watching closely. Residents in a central Kentucky town are being urged to evacuate after more than a dozen freight train cars derailed, spilling molten sulfur and sparking a fire.Officials say, that fire is now 50 percent contained, but the toxic smoke that's in the air is actually the biggest threat, because when molten sulfur burns, it releases sulfur dioxide, and that gas has a very strong scent. It could cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat as well. CSX, the train's operator, says that specialized equipment is now being used to monitor air quality in that area. Kentucky's governor, Andy Beshear, has issued a state of emergency. We're also following major breaking news out of New York. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is being accused of sexual assault. According to a new court filing, this happened 30 years ago in 1930 -- in 1993, I should say, and the plaintiff is seeking $5 million in damages. CNN's Jean Casarez has been tracking this story, including how the mayor is responding. So, Jean, what's the latest?",

And this was put into law, signed into law by the New York governor in 19 -- in 2022, one year ago, gave that one year window for adult survivors of a sexual assault, alleging that to come forward.And this is one of many, there's been a flurry, I'm sure in general, but against high-profile defendants in the last few days. And the allegation against Mayor Adams is that she was a city employee back in 1993, so long ago, but that he sexually assaulted her. There was battery, employment discrimination, there was retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress. She is also suing the New York Police Department and the City of New York. Now, listen to the mayor this morning, just hours ago, when he was giving his Thanksgiving remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY):  My career speaks for itself and just really -- it's just something absolutely that has never happened. And I don't even recall ever meeting the person who made the -- this allegation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, really. Today, was intense on the border between Lebanon and Israel. Last night, an Israeli airstrike hit a house in which there were five Hezbollah fighters, including the son of the leader of Hezbollah's parliamentary block. And what we saw today was perhaps some of the most intense exchanges so far since the 8th of October. Now, you were referring to that incident where Hezbollah fired 48 Katyusha rocket at this Israeli base, and that was just one of the many volleys that were fired today.Now, Hezbollah is claiming that they killed four Israeli soldiers in the course of the day. However, we have yet to hear any comment on that from the Israelis. Now, also significantly, today the Foreign Minister of Iran was visiting Beirut. He met with Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of Hezbollah. And they talked about bringing the Israeli war in Gaza to an end. Now, also today, the Iranian foreign minister had an interview on Mayadeen, which is a local Lebanese satellite channel. And he said that if the truce does not hold in Gaza, the scope of the war will expand. Now, Hezbollah is not part of obviously this agreement between Israel and Hamas for a four-day pause, but a Hezbollah source spoke to \"Al Jazeera Arabic\" and told them that they do plan to abide by the truce and hold their fire unless, of course, Israel fires at Hezbollah, Wolf.",

They're just one group threatening to turn this war into a broader regional conflict. Another, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. And today we learned that a U.S. warship patrolling the Red Sea shot down multiple attack drones launched from the area that they control in Yemen. CNN's Alex Marquardt has been tracking this.

One of the latest ones was -- arguably the most dramatic against the U.S. Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq. It was on Monday, and a group called Kata'ib Hezbollah, not to be confused with Lebanese Hezbollah, this is an Iraqi group, they fired short range, close range ballistic missiles. That's really significant. This was -- there was the first time that since these -- the spike in attacks since October 17th.You're right, there have been almost 70 of these, mainly in Iraq and Syria against U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. responded to this one by targeting two facilities related to Kata'ib Hezbollah, that was the first time the U.S. has responded in Iraq. However, there have been three different sets of airstrikes in Syria against facilities that are connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, as well as these Iran-backed proxy groups. Essentially, U.S. telling Iran and its proxy groups to knock it off. But Boris, these attacks continue.",

The former president lashing out on \"Truth Social\" earlier today, calling the judge a psycho and accusing him and his top clerk of political bias and corruption. This comes just a week after an appeals court put a pause on the judge's gag order, restricting the former president's comments, and after we learned the judge and his staff has received hundreds of harassing messages that court security has deemed serious and credible threats.Joining now to discuss all of this is CNN Legal Analyst Norm Eisen. Norm, thank you so much for being here on Thanksgiving. We do appreciate it. So, obviously last week that appellate judge undoing the gag order, given the fact that these threats have been deemed credible, do you anticipate it might be put back on the former president? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS CZAR:  It should be turned back on, Boris, because while we have strong First Amendment protections under the constitution, the courts have held, including the Supreme Court, that those protections must yield to the administration of justice during active cases. We have an open trial here with targeted restrictions. And when you see this latest filing by New York explaining how when the gag order was lifted, these threats against the judge and the judge's law clerk shot up, that really makes the case for the gag order to be perhaps narrowed but reinstated.",

Particularly, this is really the core of it, the out of court attacks on the judge's law clerk. That is a place where while there has been a temporary lifting of the gag order, while the appellate court considers what to do, that's really in the core of what these kinds of orders are intended to prevent.And when you look at the filings that the court has made and the threats, really horrific antisemitic threats, assassination, death threats, I will kill you, I'm coming for you. When you look at that and the sheer volume that this law clerk is getting on her social media, her e-mail, on her cell phone, that information has gotten out. I think the courts are going to allow those narrow protections. SANCHEZ:  Trump's team, obviously, set to respond on Monday. What we've heard from them previously is that he -- he's a candidate for president. This is political speech. Have you ever seen the system tested this way with a defendant that says, I'm protected not only by the First Amendment, but by the fact that I'm running for office? And that I'm allowed to make my pitch to voters.",
