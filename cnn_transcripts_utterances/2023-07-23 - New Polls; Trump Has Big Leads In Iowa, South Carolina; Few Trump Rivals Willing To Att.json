These are some of the first quality polls that we've seen coming out of Iowa and South Carolina all year. And in Iowa, Donald Trump has a 30-point lead over Ron DeSantis, with Tim Scott there nipping at his heels. Now, Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, they round out the top five. Trump holds a big lead also in South Carolina with the state's former governor, Nikki Haley, in a statistical tie for second place with DeSantis. Senator Tim Scott also from South Carolina is the only other candidate in the double digits there. Lots to discuss here with us in the studio with CNN's Harry Enten, Errol Louis of Spectrum News. Semafor's, Shelby Talcott, and Shane Goldmacher of The New York Times. So, Shelby, this -- these polls seem to confirm what we maybe knew all along, which is that Donald Trump is still very far in the lead. And all of the other challengers are still struggling to even get close.",

And so their argument to me, over the past few months, has been all of those votes, if Nikki Haley and Tim Scott were not in the race would be going to Ron DeSantis. And would you know, Trump would still be in the lead, but he'd be closing the gap.And so whether or not all of the votes would go to them is very interesting, but I think it's fair to say that a Trump would. And so that -- I think that poll is really notable because that's representing what they've been concerned about for a little bit of time now. Shane, you've got a great piece in the Times today about what's happening inside of the DeSantis campaign, which is, frankly, a lot of soul searching. You right here in the subhead, the campaign's missteps and swelling costs of donors and allies nervous. One person close to the former governor says he's experienced a challenging learning curve.

Just take a look at these numbers from Quinnipiac since July -- or since February, he has lost about 22 points from college educated white voters.

But it also speaks to the fact that Ron DeSantis has become less well loved. There's these -- there's this very favorable number, if you look across an aggregate of polls, it was near 50 percent. That was how many Republicans had a very favorable view of Ron DeSantis at the beginning of the year? Now that number has dropped into the mid-30s.

He's going to have an interview on Thursday, sit down camera interview with an outlet. I'm told that even if the indictment drops that day, there's no changes to his schedule.

So, Kara, what are you expecting this week? Because I think people might be rightfully a little bit of -- a little bit confused, because there was a target letter that was a week ago now.

But if you even look back at the Mar- a-Lago documents case where Trump received a target letter from the same special counsel, there was about a three-week period between that target letter and when he was ultimately indicted.You know, during that period, Trump's attorneys had asked for a meeting, we didn't know at the time that he had that target letter, but they went in to try to persuade the special counsels team not to bring these charges. So we don't know right now, you know, he's brought in this new counsel, who was just on Fox, he played that clip. You know, he -- they may have a strategy session here where they say they want to go in and talk and try to persuade them not to bring these charges. And we don't know if that's happening or not, or what the receptiveness is on the special counsel team. You know, so it's possible, that will be something that happens that could in essence, you know, kind of slow down this process. You know, of course, the Special Counsel doesn't have to bring the charges, although usually when someone gets the target letter, that's ultimately what happens. And, you know, as we also if you look at the documents case, you know, in that instance, they brought this indictment, but they're still -- these have it sent a target letter to a low ranking official and employee at the Trump organization at Mar- a-Lago. And that, you know, indicates that even though they just charged Trump, and Walt Nauta, his assistant that they're still pursuing that investigation. So, you know, it's all in secret, it's a little hard to exactly know how that's going to play out. But there could be a couple of things at play here.",

Please support our Capitol police and law enforcement, they're truly on the side of the country, stay peaceful. I'm asking for everyone at the capitol to remain peaceful, no violence. Remember, we are the party of law and order, et cetera, et cetera. They'll point to those tweets. And they'll say, well, he's not responsible for the violence.

And when you have alternate sort of statements about staying peaceful and things like that, from a prosecutorial standpoint, that's very difficult to get to a beyond a reasonable doubt.So when you look at the target letter, you're really looking at charges relating to the efforts to elect -- the fake -- fake slates of electors and obstructing proceedings. And then the question will be, what evidence do they actually have of Trump's involvement in those schemes directly? So it gets away from a lot of the violence and things of that sort?
