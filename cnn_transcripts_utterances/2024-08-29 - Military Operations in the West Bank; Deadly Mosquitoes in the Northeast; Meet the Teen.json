The footprints are similar in age, shape, and geological context. Back then, 120 million years ago to be specific, the seven continents hadn`t split apart yet. Remember Pangea? So scientists say the findings suggest that dinosaurs once traveled along their own version of a highway. Pop quiz hot shot. Which landmark is also known as Chomolungma? Mount Everest, Ayers Rock, Kilauea, or Timbuktu? Towering over the Himalayan mountains, you`ll find what`s known locally as Chomolungma, or Mount Everest. We want to introduce you to a teenager who`s making mountain climbing history. We traveled to Nepal, home to several of the world`s tallest peaks, and home to Nima Rinji Sherpa, who only has one more mountain to climb in order to conquer all 14 of the world`s mountains that are over 8,000 meters tall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Step-by-step this teenager is on his way to making history. 18-year-old Nima Rinji Sherpa is setting his sights on the highest peaks in the world. After reaching 13, he`s aiming to become the youngest person to climb all the 14 mountains above 8,000 meters. Even though he comes from a community of mountaineers, this is still a big deal.",

You know, like --because before this, you cannot -- you can`t imagine a teenager doing the 14 peaks, you know. KINKADE (voice-over):  Sherpas are an ethnic group native to the valleys around Mount Everest. And they`re often guides for mountaineers in the Himalayas. They carry large loads like equipment and food, fixing ladders and ropes along the way. Always a dangerous feat. And climbing such incredible heights also brings great risks. Avalanches, exposure and high-altitude sickness can easily take over and can be the difference between a successful summit and never reaching the peak. But Nima Rinji Sherpa says his mental state is what keeps him focused and calm.",

They`re all in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges spanning China, Pakistan, Nepal and India.
