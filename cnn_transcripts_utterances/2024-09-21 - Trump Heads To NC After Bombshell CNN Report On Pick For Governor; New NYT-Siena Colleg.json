We're told that at the summit, they're going to announce a joint initiatives to really combat cancer, such as investing more into research and also increasing the amount of cervical cancer screenings and certain areas of the country and in the world. And what is really the significance Danny as the summit is going to take place this weekend is it's going to be held in Wilmington. Now that is the hometown of Biden, and this is somewhere where he resides when he steps away from the White House. And so we are told that that was a very personal decision for the President, because he really wants to illustrate and just convey this message that foreign policy is personal, and he really wants to show these world leaders just a bit about where he comes from and how this community, in this environment as has shaped him as a public servant. And so when he's having these one-on-one meetings, this is very pivotal for the President, because he really just wants to submit what he wants to do in the months ahead, in his final months in office, and also just wants to set the tone of what his expectations are for the summit and of this environment on these world leaders when the next presidency and the next administration comes in.

Here, you can see this cold front right through here. Now, yes, that's going to bring the chance for some showers, even some severe thunderstorms, especially on the southern side. But the biggest change we're going to get from that cold front is the drop in temperature. So all of this area Midwest, down through the Ohio Valley and back down close to the Gulf Coast, all above average for today.But that cold air behind really starts to swoop in, beginning tomorrow for some and then a few days later, as that system begins to spread off to the east. So take a look at today, places like Chicago topping out at 91, 92 in Cincinnati, same thing in Nashville. Lots of 90s down through here in portions of Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee as well. Look at Oklahoma City. The high temperature today could top out at 98 degrees. The record for today is 97. So you can end up getting a another record breaking day, yet again today, but it's going to be the last one, because now you can see those temperatures start to drop back. Take Oklahoma City, for example, that high today in the mid-90s, drops to the 70s tomorrow, then low 70s after that. And a lot of other cities, Kansas City, Dallas, Midland, also going to see a similar drop starting tomorrow. For other cities, it takes an extra day before we start to see that drop closer to Monday. But look at Chicago, 91 today, down to 72 tomorrow, 69 for the high on Monday. St. Louis, going from 89 today, still in the 80s Sunday, but then you see that bigger drop on Monday, and that's going to be the general trend for all of these over the next couple of days. And then other cities in the southeast, like Memphis and Little Rock, they too will get their drop. It just takes it a few more days before they really start to see that change happen.",

Last night, he got back to Dodger Stadium. Huge ovation from the L.A. crowd there before his first bat. Then in the fifth inning, but what does Ohtani do? He hits yet another home run, this two run shot number 52 on the season.And then the seventh inning, after a single, Ohtani would steal second with ease. So he's now created the 52/52 club. How high will he go? We'll have to wait and see, eight days left in the season. Dodgers won that one six to four. All right, we had a top 25 showdown last night in college football. This one was in the Big 10 22nd ranked Nebraska taking on 24th ranked Illinois, the fighting line are down seven in the fourth, but they get the touchdown here. Luke Altmyer to Brandon Henderson, the big old lineman, gets in for the score. Love seeing that. We would go to overtime tied at 24, Illinois scores first. Altmyer to Pat Bryant, so the Huskers needed to answer, but they went the wrong way. This is fourth and 26 and Dylan Raiola get sacked. Illinois wins 31 to 24. This was Nebraska's 400 straight sellout. But they now lost the last 25 games against a ranked opponent. That is a long streak. All right, the Pac-12, meanwhile, still has two members, and one of them is undefeated. But it wasn't easy for Washington State last night against San Jose State, the Spartans, they scored here in a 20-yard touchdown pass from Emmett Brown to TreyShun Hurry. They went up three with just 26 seconds left. But Washington State quickly gets in field goal range, thanks to this 32-yard completion. And Dean Janikowski, what a kick here, 52 yarder to send the game into overtime. Now, both teams threw an interception in the first OT. So in the second, San Jose State, they actually needed this two point conversion to tie, but the Cougars getting the big stop. Washington State now four and zero, they won that game 54 to 52. [08:55:11] We got three top 25 matchups today, each of them with the team and a new conference, 11th ranked USC, going to make its Big 10 debut in the big house at Michigan, Utah playing its first Big 12 game on the road against Oklahoma State. And you got the Sooners starting their SEC era. They're going to take on 6th ranked Tennessee. All right, finally, F1 in Singapore this weekend. Look at this. This guy decided he wanted a front row seat to practice. A lizard just chilling out there on the track. Look, they tried to get him off. He took off. He's like, you're not getting me. They had to pause practice for a bit to get him off the track. And, you know, good thing -- good thing they did guys, because, you know, the last thing anyone wanted to see is, you know, Lewis Hamilton coming around the corner, and that guy in the middle of the track wouldn't have been pretty.",
