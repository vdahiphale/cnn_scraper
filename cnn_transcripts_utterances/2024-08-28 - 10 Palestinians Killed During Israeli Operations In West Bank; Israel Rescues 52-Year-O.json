So Paula, what are you learning about these Israeli military raids overnight in the West Bank, and what they were targeting exactly?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, these raids started in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and they do appear to be quite significant compared to what we have seen the Israeli military carry out over recent months. We understand, as you say, that at least 10 Palestinians have beenkilled in two particular areas in Jenin and also in Tubas. This is according to the Ministry of Health there and the Red Crescent Society. The Red Crescent Society say at this point they are also being restricted from being able to move to different areas with their ambulances by the Israeli military. So, it would appear as though this may still be ongoing. We can see from the images that we're showing right now that there are military bulldozers within some of these areas as well. We understand that they were pulling down some infrastructure within Jenin also clearing roads. And we've been told by the Ministry of Health and the Red Crescent Society that there have been both raids by the Israeli military and also air strikes. Now, from the Israeli side, we have had some information from the Israeli Foreign Minister, he issued a statement saying that it was to thwart Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure. Now we know Israel has long said that they are targeting Hamas elements within the West Bank, also other Palestinian militant groups. But he did say something interesting within the statement which I'm going to read, he said, \"We must address this threat just like we're handling terror infrastructure in Gaza, including temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and any step necessary. This is a war like any other, and we must win it.\" Now, that statement there does suggest that this is more than we have seen before in the West Bank, and that it could become bigger as well, suggesting that, I mean, obviously, what we're seeing in Gaza is devastating, with more than 40,000 Palestinians having been killed there, many of them women and children. So, what we're hearing from the foreign minister is that we should handle threat in the West Bank the way we are handling it in Gaza. So, we're still waiting for more information. We are gathering more information on this military operation, but it does appear at this point, Rosemary, as though it is more significant than what we have seen certainly in recent months.",

He's still accused of obstructing Congress's certification of the 2020 electoral college results on January 6th, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, and of illegally interfering with the election results at the state level. But the retooled indictment changes how prosecutors describe the allegations to refute arguments by Trump's lawyers that his actions were part of his official duties and therefore deserve immunity.

Their villages are being attacked, literally burned to the ground. We know that there are tens of thousands, perhaps many tens of thousands, who have been displaced without food or water, medical attention, without any access to humanitarian aid.And what is so eerily reminiscent about what happened in 2017 seven years ago is that the world is simply ignoring this horror. And it was, you know, as I listened to member states governments making proclamations and talking about how terrible it was what happened seven years ago, and condemning the violence and expressing sympathy for the victims. The fact is, this is going on again and once again, the international community is simply not providing the attention and focus on this crisis at a moment in which thousands and thousands of lives can be saved.

It took place Tuesday afternoon, just into the second day in a row of Ukrainians enduring this massive air assault from Russia the day before. President Zelenskyy said that that air assault was the largest, the biggest that the country had seen since the beginning of that conflict. So very much within that context, you had a President Zelenskyy who was trying to demonstrate strength, trying to demonstrate preparedness, trying to project victory despite, of course, these incoming attacks.He highlighted Kursk, as you mentioned, said that Ukrainian forces continue to advance. He poked fun at President Putin for failing, in his words, to defend Russian territory. He accused President Putin of going after a city that nobody knew, a reference to Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine where Russian forces are advancing. So he's painting this very mixed battlefield picture, but he's saying we still have the upper hand. He also wanted to show off Ukraine's capabilities, essentially saying we are taking things into our own hands. We are developing ballistic missiles. He said the first test of domestic ballistic missile occurred. You mentioned that long-range drone. He's also saying Ukraine is developing these weapons, important to note that Ukraine is very far from using any of these on the battlefield. Of course, what they want is for NATO to continue to provide weaponry. But again, just a bit of rhetoric there from President Zelenskyy. And finally, he highlighted what he called a peace plan that he would propose to President Biden. Now, I would describe this more as an outline than a plan. It's very, very scant on details, but he sort of had these four points and said, the first part of this peace plan is invading Kursk and we've already done that. So, President Zelenskyy really trying to show that he's taking action, that he's preparing for this potential meeting with President Biden next week and really demanding, yet again, more from his NATO partners, not just in terms of weapons, but in terms of permissions to use these weapons further and deeper into Russia.
