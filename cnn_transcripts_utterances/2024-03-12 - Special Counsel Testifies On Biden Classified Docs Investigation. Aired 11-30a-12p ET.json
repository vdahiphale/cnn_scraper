It was the difference in the facts in the case and how he dealt with it.The fact is, Mr. Biden sat through five hours, and he did an admirable job. And he did an outstanding job in the State of the Union laying out the case for the future of America, for the middle class, for the freedom -- for democracy around the world, for standing up to the Russians not bending down to them. That's what's important. Not if you can be like on the $64,000 question, sue me he was legit, and answering every single question correctly. That's not what you need to be president. To be president, you need to have values, you need to have an understanding of what values America has and needs to maintain to keep the world safe and peaceful. That's dealing with Ukraine. That's dealing with difficult people like Netanyahu in Israel to try to get something done that's correct. That's what Joe Biden does. And understanding social security and Medicare -- Medicaid are important institutions that help seniors and not senile people. I mean, I've really objected to that -- common people see. He's not -- nobody suggests he see now. And that's disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability. Lots of seniors have memory disability, but they're not seeing now that.

The ghostwriter says well, something blah, blah, blah. And Biden says this. Some of this may be classified. So, be careful. Some of this may be classified. So be careful. Now, my immediate response was, OK. So, he knows he's got classified ducks. He's looking at this. He can't read. He's telling -- he's giving this to somebody he knows to has no security clearance and he says, hey, read this. But be careful. It might be classified. The next thing -- and the guy says, OK. The next thing he says well, I don't know if it's classified or not. I'm suggesting to you, and this is the diff -- where you and I have a difference of opinion. When you say something like, hey, I just -- look, this may be classified. Be careful. That warning -- that warning to be careful -- be careful because it may be classified, that indicates guilty knowledge. That indicates he might know something more than he otherwise would have. And it indicates -- then they go on and they read it. As you point out here, he reads classified information. And it's still classified today. That's on page 106. So, when you look at this, it's hard for me to say, well, he was ignorant. He was incompetent. It was accidental. No. He had guilty knowledge. He knew and told the guy that he's going to expose that classified material to, hey, be careful. Be careful. It may be classified. That indicates something a little bit more than mere knowledge. Indicates that he has some intent there. Because the next thing he should have said is, hey, I don't know if it's classified but we're going to skip over this until that's resolved. He didn't do that. What he said is read it anyway. I yield back.",

It's a story of America. It's a story that the guy who appointed you would end if he was in charge. Again, it's a story that most of the folks on the other cross -- other side of the aisle seek to block every day in this room. But it's a story that's persuasive.
