Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Of the sounds, U.S. President Joe Biden walked through the capital of Ukraine. His surprise visit comes nearly one year after Russia began its relentless attack. Mr. Biden was accompanied by a Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who says, it reminds the world every day what courage is. He hearkened back to the early days of the war when many braced for Kyiv to fall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a very strong signal to Ukrainian people.It's a very strong signal to all of the United States allies, particularly in Europe, particularly in the Pacific region, South Korea, Japan as well are also giving their support to Ukraine, that the United States is committed, and it's committed to Ukraine, and it's committed to the long haul of the fight and that it -- this support will be enduring. So, there cannot be a greater symbol of that commitment than the United States president. The United States President going to Kyiv literally while sirens are going off. And I think it provides and provided President Zelenskyy with the -- with the -- with the possibility to amplify his already well-heard messages, but strong messages, and particularly the one that the war potentially could be one this year, that victory could happen in 2023. That's very ambitious. But it's an important message for Biden, it's an important political message back home for all the leaders that are supporting Ukraine because it indicates that the war is not without end, that there is ambition and possibility to end it soon. Zelenskyy also, thank Congress, that's an important message for President Biden to take back as well, because it -- there are concerns among partners that Congress could be divided and that they won't in the future give Ukraine the support it's had. And the other message from Zelenskyy was that essentially, Russia should pay. Again, that's an important message that leaders that support Ukraine can take to their publics. And so, the cost of this is not all going to fall on you. So, thanking the people that he most needs for support, that the war is not without end and that Russia should pay some. These are very important messages that President Biden's visit has allowed President Zelenskyy to amplify to all his supporters.",

They make the point that Republican leaders in Congress are very supportive of Ukraine and remain very supportive. Even as many vocal of Republicans who are in the Congress are talking more about a fatigue. There was recently a resolution in the American Congress, the fatigue in Ukraine resolution that was supported by about a dozen Republicans. But it remains to be seen whether that sentiment sort of grows in the Republican Party in the weeks and months ahead. And certainly, one of the reasons President Biden wanted to come to Ukraine today was to make the point to the American people that this war is not over. That their support, that American support will still very much be needed as a President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians continue to wage this fight against the Russians. And now, one thing that will be interesting dynamic that is going to play out in the United States over the next several months is the beginning of the Republican presidential primary, because you do see a split in the Republican Party. There are some Republicans who have encouraged President Biden to go faster with the aid to Ukraine to send things like fighter jets, to send more power, powerful weapons. And then there is the more isolationist camp of the Republican Party, perhaps heralded by the former President Donald Trump, who have encouraged the United States to focus on the United States and maybe not spend so much money on a war that's thousands of miles away. And so, that's a dynamic that the Republicans, as a party will have to sort out. But certainly, what President Biden wants to do is make the point very prominently, very vocally by showing up in Kyiv today to say that American support is still very much needed as this work continues, Becky.",

Butthen the events of today have kind of turned in to some kind of a marking of this moment in the sense that it was such a huge thing for the President of the United States to come on this unannounced visit. The fact that he was walking around just behind me, going into St. Michael's Church walking around St. Michael square, laying a wreath at the wall of fallen defenders. And all of this happening, by the way, today is the day of the heavenly 100 heroes, which is when Ukrainians remember all those activists who were killed in Maidan Revolution. That, of course, was many years ago. But still, it's a day that is steeped in symbolism. And I think that up until this point, it has been a tough winter. It has been grim fighting in the east. There have been a huge number of casualties in Bakhmut and other places. There have been the difficulties that come with this ruthless Russian campaign targeting civilian infrastructure, a lack of heat, running water, electricity. And so, I feel like a lot of Ukrainians are grateful to have this moment, this boost to the morale by having this visit, because it's a visit that they have been asking for for quite some time. It's a visit that frankly, no one was sure was going to happen because of the numerous complexities. The fact that it takes nine or 10 hours on the train to even get to the border. And that it would be so difficult, given the distances and the length of time to keep it a secret. So, it means all the more. I think people do appreciate that effort. I will say that Kyiv was brought to a standstill in certain parts of the city because all traffic was completely cut off. And we heard reports from some of our staff that the metros were overwhelmed because cars were not moving. And so, people were taking the train to try to get to, to work and to go about their daily business. But you really didn't hear anyone complaining. And in fact, we were outside talking to people all afternoon who came once they'd heard that President Biden had visited, they were coming they were taking photographs, they were posing. And there was definitely an air of excitement that this meant to ordinary Ukrainians. We can do this and we have the support to do this. With one major caveat, as you've just been discussing, which is the continued effort on the part of Ukraine's leadership to source heavier weaponry, to source long range artillery to get fighter jets as they have been requesting which they fear are essentially going to be crucial if they are to have a real outright victory on the battlefield, which up until this point, Becky, despite the success of all these counter offensives remains elusive, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. Well, the U.S. has not released this evidence yet. Secretary Blinken did hint that thatevidence could come soon, of this kind of consideration by the Chinese to provide legal support to the Russians. But this is something that the U.S. has been tracking for quite some time now. Just after the war began, last February, the U.S. saw signs that the Chinese were considering yet again providing lethal weaponry to the Russians in support of their operation in Ukraine. But the U.S. came up very strongly against that at the time in warn China, both publicly and privately of the consequences of them doing that. And the U.S. believed that that caused the Chinese to kind of back off a little bit not wanting to be seen as a kind of pariah on the world stage. Well, now something has kind of shifted, and we don't know exactly what that is, but the U.S. has, it has evidence that there are discussions underway and Chinese leadership to go further than non-lethal equipment that the U.S. has seen some Chinese companies providing to Russia and actually provide lethal equipment, like weaponry. We did report last month that the U.S. has been reaching out privately to Beijing over the last several weeks and months to gauge whether they are aware that Chinese companies have been sending non-lethal equipment, like flak jackets and helmets, for example, satellite imagery to Russians for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. And the U.S. said that they didn't see any signs as of yet that the Chinese government was aware or implicit -- or complicit in that. But now we are seeing a shift, interestingly, where the U.S. is saying publicly yet again, that there are going to be grave consequences, including sanctions if the Chinese move forward and provide and take that dramatic step and start actually providing weapons to Ukraine to use on the battlefield in Ukraine, Becky.",

So, don't expect Beijing to sway from this position, as we have seen with the balloon incident, as we've seen with others.

It takes three readings before a bill becomes a law here. But for many of these protesters, they feel as though it's a now or never a moment. The people around me are chanting things like democracy. They're chanting things like Israel is not a dictatorship. There are signs that say SOS, save our state. The protests actually began in the early morning with a children's protests across the country as well as protests in Tel Aviv, some of which even blocked the highway. Other protesters even end up in front of the houses of members of parliament, an act that was denounced by both opposition and coalition leaders. Meanwhile, there are counter protesters here. They're a smaller group, but they support these judicial reforms. They say that they are much needed a way to rebalance the power between the branches of government saying this is what the people voted for in those November elections that brought Benjamin Netanyahu back into power. But meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are facing some outside pressure as well. The American ambassador in Israel recently calling on the Israeli government to pump the brakes to slow down the legislative process in order to give a chance for negotiations between the sides to play out. So far, we aren't getting any indication from Benjamin Netanyahu or the Israeli government that they plan to do so. Benjamin Netanyahu, giving a speech yesterday saying that Israeli democracy will be safeguarded and civil liberties will be safeguarded by the Israeli President Isaac Herzog saying that he has been in intense talks in recent days with all the different parties.

We heard -- President Zelenskyy heard a little bit of -- a little bit there. He has said that extremely tangible losses have been inflicted on the Russians. And that is true. They have not been able to advance they have suffered immense losses both according to Ukrainian and Western officials, as well as along several other fronts, including Marinka, Kreminna and Bakhmut. So, these four towns essentially make up the four axes of where Russia is trying to push forward in this new offensive. But to answer your question, Vuhledar is interesting because Becky, we often talk about the southern front and the eastern front. That is where Russia has made the most progress. Vuhledar is essentially where those two fronts meet. So, Russia is trying to press forward to essentially try to take up more territory in the southeastern part of the country, more territory in Donbas which, of course has been the major focus of the Russians over the past few months. Now, a bit farther north in Bakhmut, that is where the fiercest fighting has been over the past few months. Immense losses on both sides. It is seen primarily as a symbolic fight rather than strategic. The Russians know that if they were able to take the city and they have managed to make incremental gains, that it would be a symbolic victory, particularly around this first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They likely would not be able to get too much farther because the Russian - - the Ukrainians are dug in just west of Bakhmut. So, this area, those four areas are where Russia is pushing forward in its offensive.
