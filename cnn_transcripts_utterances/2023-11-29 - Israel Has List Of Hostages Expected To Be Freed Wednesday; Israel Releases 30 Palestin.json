The pause has already been extended for two days in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.Sources say Hamas has now given Israel another list of names of hostages, who are expected to be released in the coming hours. Hostage negotiations in Doha are ongoing, with all sides agreeing to work towards extending the current truce. A senior official with Hamas told CNN they're pushing for a longer lasting ceasefire, which Israel has already described as a non- starter. On Tuesday, the fifth day of the current pause, Hamas released 12 hostages. 10 of them Israelis. All of them women, one a 17-year-old girl. The handover took place at the Rafah crossing on Gaza southern border with Egypt. Large crowds lining the streets cheering as the women were paraded by Hamas before taken away by the Red Cross. And a separate deal with the Government of Thailand, two Thai nationals were also released by Hamas Tuesday. So far, 86 of an estimated 250 hostages have been set free. And for those who are either at home or on their way there, the return to normality will take time and will not be easy, especially for the children who have been held in captivity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. EFRAT BRON-HARLEV, CHIEF EXEC., SCHNEIDER CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER IN ISRAEL: They came from different places in Gaza and in different times and of course, different ages. But in general, I can say that they all came very skinny, very pale, last maybe 10 to 15% of their weight sometimes and not only them but their mothers as well, the ones that came with them. Other than that they have some minor wounds. But they will overcome all that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Could Israel start its military operations up in Gaza again, or will Hamas continue to release hostages?The hope by the Biden administration is that the pause does continue and more hostages continued to come out. The quiet goes on for a bit longer, they hope and more aid goes into Gaza to deal with the really catastrophic humanitarian situation. Tuesday saw the CIA director Bill Burns in the Qatari capital Doha to work on just that he has become President Biden's point man on all hostage issues meeting in Doha with Qatari officials and his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. Burns's goal was also to try to broaden the negotiations to more than just women and children, and to try to get men and Israeli soldiers out which everyone agrees will be much more difficult. The Biden ministration is also urging Israel that if they start their operations up again, militarily in Gaza, which they say they will to be much more careful, to be more cautious, more surgical and precise, to try to minimize the often deadly impact on Gazan civilians, most of whom are now displaced.

There's only four facilities functioning in the north now, one of them, Al-Ahli Hospital has only around 30 functioning beds. The other hospital Al-Sahaba is a maternity hospital.

Because it seems the answer to that question would seem to determine the scope of the rest of this Israeli military operation in Gaza, and the chance of any kind of ceasefire. That is, before you add in the factor of Israeli domestic politics. So where do things stand right now? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST: Well, I think that obviously Hamas is not an existential threat to Israel. By the way, my personal opinion is that Israel does not face any existential threat at the moment. But I think what we saw on October 7th, that Hamas is a huge threat for Israelis and for Israel, without it being an existential threat because it managed to conduct the most serious attack on the state of Israel maybe since 1948. And the most serious invasion into Israeli territory, and the most serious attack on Israeli civilians since 1948. And I think that when you ask the question, why does this war continue, it is not because Hamas is an existential threat to Israel, it is because no Israeli will be able to go back living in this area on the borders of Gaza if he knows that on the other side of the border this threat still remains. And that is what Israeli really public opinion is telling the government. And this is why I don't think any politician right now in Israel will be able to stop this war without dismantling Hamas.",

Many of the most successful companies are those tapping into the continent's unbanked or unreserved population -- underserved population, I should say.Launched in 2017, Numida became the first Ugandan company to be backed by the American start-up Accelerator now working to help small businesses access unsecured loans using cutting edge technology. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MINA SHAHID, CO-FOUNDER/CEO, NUMIDA: Small businesses matter in Africa because they are the primary drivers of economic growth and development across the continent. Hi, my name is Mina Shahid. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Numida. We said from day one that we wanted to figure out how do we give $500 unsecured, working capital loan to someone who's never borrowed before from a financial institution but they have a shop that's making money, that's supporting their family, that's employing people in their community. How do you that in an effective way? And I really do believe that we have figured that out.",

Micro and small business owners can download the Numida app. They'll go through a loan application process through the app and they can apply for working capital within a few minutes.And then if they're approved, they'll receive capital within a day. Super simple, we don't require collateral, we don't have guarantors. We don't need documentation. We have alternative ways of determining each business owners credit-worthiness and are able to provide them credit quotes within minutes and then, you know, actual funding within a day that they can then put into their business to drive growth. Uganda being a very young tech ecosystem, some of the core talents that we need in order to build this company, it's been hard for us to find. And we spent actually three years building our credit models and our operational tools before we really went in to scale up mode. We've dispersed roughly $40 million in unsecured working capital loans to 47,000 businesses in Uganda to date. We have proven that there is alternative ways to underwrite semi- formal micro and small businesses. And every time we give a loan to somebody and they come back to us and they tell us, you know, I used this loan and I bought this inventory and I was able to make this additional revenue, and my business at this point a year ago and now it's here. You know, that is the most validating thing for me. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
