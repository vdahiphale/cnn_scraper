Just ahead, Ukraine's President warns hundreds of thank you is not hundreds of tanks, because both the U.S. and Germany refused to send them modern tanks, which Kyiv says are crucial for frontline combat.Then one of the world's biggest human migrations millions in China travel ahead of the Lunar New Year, some fear it could become a COVID super spreading event. And Cryptocurrency may be revolutionizing the world of finance that one community in the United States can't get past the noise. A crucial meeting hosted by the U.S. Defense Secretary is taking part at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany right now. And Ukraine says the gathering could decide the fate of the war. Dozens of defense leaders from around the world are discussing whether to provide Kyiv with heavy weapons. Germany is under mounting pressure to send its Leopard 2 tanks to the Ukrainian Battlefield, or at least allow them to be transferred from other countries that have them. President Zelenskyy made an impassioned plea via video link, urging Western allies to send their weapons without delay. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But at this stage, they haven't outlined whether or not they will be offering those tanks as support. Of course, there are questions around whether or not they're still waiting for perhaps the United States to offer a firm, offer of tanks. They say they might go ahead with that, if there was a similar offer from the United States. That hasn't happened, but of course, this meeting today is all very much focused on the supply of tanks. We've heard from Ukraine's Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, he's present at that meeting, but he outlined the three key things that Ukraine wants to achieve at this meeting on Tuesday said they want more air defense systems, they want a securing ammo supplies, as well as repair and servicing support for machinery.

Of course, Peru is in the middle of a deep political crisis has been there for years. And it's not just a crisis of Boluarte is making.But right now the ball is clearly in her court because yesterday again, we understand that thousands of people, the government does not release figures of how many people took to the streets. But we understand that at least thousands, if not, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Lima. At least three people died in these protests nationwide, mostly in the rural areas of Peru because the burns are the violence that is occurring outside the capital in the provinces in the Andean Ranger where most of the poverty is concentrated in the country. But now as I said the ball is in Boluarte's court and he's a President who has been in power for a little over a month. She took over as a caretaker after the ousting of her predecessor Pedro Castillo, who tried to dismantle Congress. Both the presidency and Congress are widely regarded as corrupted institution as and there is political crises they are how can Peru turn to page one now its Boluarte responsibility to offer a fair deal, I guess. To protest or kind of bring the country together because now the question is, for example, for today, what happens with the thousands of people who traveled to Lima yesterday to protest to have their voices heard by Boluarte, and by the rest of the leadership? They're still in Lima, they want answer and they want political change. So it's now up to the authorities to kind of like broker a deal and finds a way to bring this country together after I'd say six years of two political crises because we've been here before and this is just the ugliest page of a crisis and a story that keeps rolling, Max.",

And I posed that exact question to the District Attorney yesterday after she announced this significant charge here involuntary manslaughter against Actor Alec Baldwin.And what she told me is that there was no single piece of evidence that she used that sealed it for her that. She knew that she had to prosecute but she said in her words, she looked at the totality of the circumstances surrounding how that movie set operated. She said that there was a pattern of unsafe practices. And of course, we know what happened Actor Alec Baldwin was rehearsing the scene of a movie using what was a prop gun. Somehow a live round of ammunition got in that gun, the gun discharged killing Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. And so the District Attorney saying that if you look at the history of this movie set there have been previous accidental discharges, there had been employees on the set complaining of safety issues. And so when she came to the decision, look, this is gross negligence. And you know, I asked her, Alec Baldwin certainly didn't intend to do this. By all accounts this was an accident and she told me specifically that something can be both accidental and still be a crime and her goal and the goal of prosecutors here is to try to bring justice to Halyna Hutchins and her surviving family members. Now there is a question still the debate about how that gun actually went off? Alec Baldwin is firm and saying that he did not pull the trigger on that weapon. But interestingly, we're learning that investigators here actually sent that firearm from New Mexico to the Washington D.C. area. It was analyzed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI at their laboratory; they conducted analysis on that gun that Baldwin used. And they determined that there was no way that that gun could have fired blood for someone pulling the trigger. And so again, that's another key piece of information that prosecutors use saying that that just added to the negligence, you know, pulling a gun and pointing at someone and pulling the trigger. Obviously, for his part, Alec Baldwin has claimed that he is innocent. He says that he will fight these charges as far as what happens next. Prosecutors say that they want to arrest him, he's not going to be placed under arrest that he will be issued a summons where he will have to come back to New Mexico or appear by video conference, and then the prosecution will start next.",
