And a major first for space exploration. A tech billionaire and an engineer, now the first non professional astronauts to conduct a spacewalk. What this means for space travel now. And the Swift effect. Taylor Swift endorses then calls on fans to get out the vote at the VMAs. Can you measure the impact of such a star? I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN News Central. (MUSIC) SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: Campaign says get ready to see and hear more from Vice President Kamala Harris. Her team says she will speak to the media more as she enters what they call a more aggressive phase of the campaign. They are pushing to keep the momentum from her largely praised presidential debate performance. North Carolina is her first stop today in what the Harris-Walz campaign is calling the new way forward tour. They are also launching new TV and digital ads highlighting what they believe are her best moments from the debate stage. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in North Carolina for us there in Charlotte. What are you learning about the plan that the campaign has today?",

      "sentences": "Well, they certainly want to amplify some of those debate moments where they thought that she was at her strongest. In a state like North Carolina, one of the top issues is reproductive rights. That is something that the Vice President has been talking about for the whole year. And she has become a key voice on this issue. And that's a message that she's expected to bring here to North Carolina.The North Carolina Governor, Roy Cooper, who backs the Vice President, also said this week in the moments after the debate that healthcare and abortion are two of the key issues. And he believed that her debate performance does move the needle. But the resounding message from her aides and allies has been that this is going to be a close race. So, while they're trying to build on the momentum from Tuesday night's debate, they're also keenly aware that there is a long way to go. So, the narrative from this campaign has been that she is the underdog in the race. And that is the message that the Vice President will continue to deliver on the campaign trail, including here in North Carolina, which, by the way, is where her reproductive rights bus tour is right now. Of course, we've talked about this before. The campaign launched this in Florida. It's going to be running until the Election Day with at least 50 stops. And this stop here in North Carolina for the Vice President is coinciding with that. And I mention it because it gives you a good sense of how they are trying to capitalize on this very issue, particularly in states like North Carolina, where -- where President Joe Biden lost by a very small margin. And so, these are some of the messages that we'll be hearing from the Vice President today here. And then she goes to Pennsylvania again. Of course, that is going to be such a crucial state for her heading into November. So, the play here by the campaign and their strategy is to use the debate to build their momentum, to highlight and amplify what they found to be the most notable moments where she drew a stark contrast from former President Donald Trump. But still to make the point that she is the underdog with a very clear understanding that it is going to be a close race and it by no means has been decided yet. Sara? SIDNER: Take nothing for granted. The message from the campaign. Thank you so much. Priscilla Alvarez there on the trail, Charlotte, North Carolina. John? JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: Donald Trump on the campaign trail today as well, with a stop in Tucson. It comes as his closest allies are doing damage control, trying to clean up after his debate performance. CNN's Alayna Treene is with us now. What are you hearing this morning, Alayna?",

And look, Trump has remained non committal about whether he would do another debate. However, when I talk to people close to him, people within his own campaign team, they all kind of at argue that they believe another debate will happen. So, I think stay tuned for any new developments on that. BERMAN",

So despite being happy with what they saw on the debate stage from Kamala Harris, some fellow Democratic senators say that they're still worried. Let me play this for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): Concerned. And I tell people all the time, you know, somebody asked me in Chicago, what'd you learn from 2016? And I said, you can't win by a little. You got to win by a lot. You want to win big to overcome the electoral college effect. You want to win big so that every reasonable person knows you won. And his lonely complaints about that he should have won are really just lonely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, are you worried after this debate or is this kind of a concerted effort to try to get people to not be complacent?SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Of course, this is a concerted effort to make sure folks don't get complacent. I'll remind you. I'll remind your viewers that Senator Tim Kaine, my friend and colleague, was the vice presidential nominee in 2016. And there was some significant problem in the 2016 campaign by then Secretary Clinton and Senator Kaine in that our base, Democrats around the country, took for granted that she couldn't possibly lose to Donald Trump. And she did very narrowly. And the point Tim was making in that interview you just showed was that because we can count on Donald Trump to challenge the results of the 2024 election, as he has every day, the 2020 election, we need to win decisively, not by a tiny, thin margin. So if folks were excited and energized by Vice President Harris' compelling, powerful performance on the debate stage in Philadelphia, they need to get up, get out, volunteer and get engaged. If folks were alarmed and concerned by former President Trump's unhinged performance on the debate stage, they should also get engaged and get involved by making sure that Democrats win in races for the Senate and across the country in the race for the next presidency.",

You see it there. But also voters who watched the debate gave Trump a 20-point win over Harris on handling the economy. 55 to 35, which is a margin that is slightly wider than the measure was pre-debate. If that does not change, can Kamala Harris win?",

It's been trending in that direction, though, for months, yet Harris, again to reinforce, is still 20 points behind Trump on the economy in this snap poll I'm talking about, and broadly ahead in other polling. If this really is a result of people just not getting engaged enough, isn't that also the campaign's problem? COONSAmericans were dying of the pandemic every single day. We were in a very desperate and difficult place four years ago, and we are a lot better off today. But your average American doesn't associate the economic chaos and the failure to deliver of that period with Donald Trump. So it is our job, our challenge to remind them that Donald Trump talked and talked about rebuilding our infrastructure, but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris delivered. Donald Trump talked and talked about restoring manufacturing, but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris delivered. When pressed on that debate stage, what are your plans for health care? Donald Trump, a decade later, still says he doesn't have a concrete plan for how to, in his view, repair and replace the Affordable Care Act. And Kamala Harris is committed to keeping the Affordable Care Act in place as a floor that makes sure that all Americans have access to basic, affordable, quality health care. If you look at the record, Kamala Harris has a much stronger record and vision for our economy. And yes, that's a challenge for us to connect with the average voter, remind them of the chaos Donald Trump caused, and the progress we've seen under the Biden-Harris administration.",

Watch as a good samaritan risks his life trying to help a stranded driver whose pickup truck was submerged in high water. You see the truck there, just beyond that bridge, that railing there, and you see the first responders also start to show up, making it to the scene to help them out. There are now more than 450,000 people without power in Francine's wake, and there's still the threat of flooding across the southeast. Let's bring in CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, even though it is weakened now, I think, is it a Tropical Storm at this point? We can still see what is left behind.
