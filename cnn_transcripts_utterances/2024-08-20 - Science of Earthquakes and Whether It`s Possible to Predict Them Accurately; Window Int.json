      "sentences": "Why is Japan concerned about a mega quake? Japan is an earthquake-prone country, and it`s beendreading the big one for years. But in early August, it issued its first ever mega quake advisory, meaning there`s now an increased risk of it happening. The big one, also known as the Nankai Trough earthquake, would hit somewhere along the southern coast and could be massive, measuring eight or higher in magnitude. It could trigger huge tsunamis like what we saw during the March 11th disaster, causing trillions in damage and potentially killing hundreds of thousands. Japan advised people to stay prepared, but it didn`t suggest any evacuations and downplayed any immediate danger. Still, the Prime Minister cancelled his trip abroad, people are stockpiling food, and some are cancelling their summer plans. It sounds alarming, but how worried should we really be? Government experts estimate that within the next 30 years, there`s a 70-80% chance of this mega quake happening. And even with the risk increase right now, the chances of it happening are still under 1%. This 30-year estimate is also based on just one theory that uses past quake data and records of seabed changes in southern Japan. We don`t yet have the science to predict when, where, or how big an earthquake will be. But those in Japan remain prepared because an earthquake can happen anytime, anywhere. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
