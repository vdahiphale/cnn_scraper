And this is really going to be a test for Donald Trump. As we know that he is somebody who likes to spin his own narrative. He likes to be in control of the situation, and really, he isn't in control of this situation. Now, we do believe he will go talk to the cameras, as he does, try to turn this into a spectacle, try to put out his own words. But remember, he is under oath. And we know that lawyers have been prepping him, that they're giving him the logistics, walking through exactly what this is going to look like. But Poppy, as you mentioned, a lot is hanging in the balance here. This is not just the fact that it's the fate of his company, but it's also his reputation, his brand.

This is a very tightly-controlled environment in the courtroom.He is only going to be able to -- or should only be able to answer questions as posed to him by the attorney general's office. And then there's the judge, also, who's going to be sitting next to him enforcing that. So you don't get to go on monologues and stemwinders and say whatever you want to say in court. I think Donald Trump is going to have a little bit of an issue with that.

It's never a great idea, but it's definitely not a good idea when is also your, quote unquote, jury. He's going to be the finder of fact.And so the judge has already said the Trump Organization has committed fraud. He's already said that. This witness is not credible, that he basically lied on the stand under oath. A lot of the tactics, I think, are going to be trying to use the judge. I think we're going to see Donald Trump continue to use the judge as a foil, and sort of say, this system, which is rigged against me, this guy is the symbol of it. The judge seems fairly unflappable. He doesn't -- you know, he doesn't express a lot of emotion, from what the reporting suggests. He's just kind of marching through this. He's making these decisions that are devastating against Trump's case, and he's doing it really just kind of in the normal course of things. He's been dealing with this for three years. So he's got a real good measure of who he's going to be talking or hearing from today in court. That's not going to help Donald Trump either. I expect him to do more campaigning than testifying, if he can get away with it. And that means talking outside of the courtroom, talking past the judge, talking about, you know, himself and his business and how all of these forces are arrayed against him, although it's going to be difficult to do that when he's going to be asked a lot of yes/no questions.",

First of all, a lot of people, by the way, think that testifying is going to be a lot different than it really is.When you get on that witness stand, there is a lot of pressure intentionally, institutional pressure, put on that person to, one, answer the question that's asked. It's called responsiveness. And so, if you're asked, did you have anything to do with this financial statement and Trump starts giving a campaign speech, what the A.G.'s office should do is say objection, your honor, and then the judge says \"overruled\" if he disagrees with it or \"sustained\" if he agrees with it. Now, if Trump just keeps going, the judge -- the judge is in charge. The judge literally sits higher in the courtroom than the witness. It's like, I order you to stop. I order you to knock it off. I strike it from the record. He can kick him out of the courtroom. I mean, the judge has various tools at his disposal which, again, ordinarily are very, very effective. But Donald Trump is not your ordinary witness. So I'm really watching that dynamic between the judge and Donald Trump, see can the judge keep control over his courtroom?",

Concerns about his age are also a key topic of discussion. Not just among swing state voters, but also amongst Democrats.
