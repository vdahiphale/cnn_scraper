      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper. Ahead, one of the most closely watched events of President Biden's entire five decade plus career. He is moments away from a news conference wrapping the NATO Summit. No script, no teleprompter, live, maybe he'll have some notes, but for sure, he will face a barrage of questions from a roomful of journalists, many of whom feel lied to.The big question this hour, can this moment actually change any minds? What about for members of the Congressional Black Caucus? Many have been staunchly loyal to President Biden. I'll speak with a senior member coming up. Plus, what Republicans will be looking for when President Biden speaks tonight. Could it change plans for their convention now just four days away? We're in touch with sources in the Republican Party. We'll get to all of it this hour. But let's start with CNN is MJ Lee at the White House. MJ, bring us inside Biden's preparations for this news conference, which -- do I have this right? This is the first solo news conference of 2024?",

But this really is, is such a big opportunity for him to really show that and prove his critics wrong. Certainly, we can't predict how many questions the President is going to take or what exactly the questions are going to be.But I certainly expect that the age of his issue and his fitness to serve another four years is going to be a key theme. And sort of regardless of what exactly the questions are, that are asked to the President, this is his opportunity to really prove to everyone that is watching his theory of the case, and particularly why he believes that it needs to be him that is at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now, one thing I do want to just note about the backdrop for this press conference being at the NATO summit, is that the President has said after the debate that he really blames his foreign travels leading up to the debate for why he performed so poorly. I had reported last week that he had privately told an ally, I have done way too much foreign policy. Well, here we are at a moment of real political peril for the president. And he has spent a lot of this week having to engage precisely on foreign policy.",

You know, we've heard from a lot of people who have basically said, look, we knew that the President is 81, we know that he has, of course, aged, he's not the same person that he was even a year ago and we've seen some of the signs. But what has been so striking is that so many people that we talked to said that they just did not recognize the President Biden that they had seen on the debate. And a lot of this anger is being directed at his inner circle of advisers and family. And a part of that anger is driven by the fact that so many of these Democrats say that the advisors are just so unwilling to accept and hear whenever they hear any of these concerns and criticism about his age.This is what one top Democrat told me. They said, \"Everyone who expresses any level of suspicion or contrary views? They call everyone and they beat the shit out of them and they say, \"Stay on message.\" Now, obviously, that is a really heated quote, but we're highlighting it because it does just get at the level of anger that we have heard from so many Democrats across the party.",

Unfortunately, that's not going to matter.

He was questioning the value of the organization.And then Joe Biden, and his team did a masterful job of reenergizing NATO, pulling them together around the Russian invasion, and backing Ukraine. So like, he's been an incredible president. But I think the challenge now is that, you know, time comes for all of us, you know, at some point, you're just not capable of doing the things you did. And I think what he's asking voters to do, is to give him four more years in the most difficult job in the world.

But there is a reality, they are running against an opponent who is historically lacking in approval inside the country who has had a really terrible last 14, 15 days.

He's a Democrat from the great state of Missouri, and he's a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. We're moments away from President Biden's press conference, rather high stakes. What are you going to be looking for? REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO): Well, I think the President is obviously going to have to demonstrate rather clearly and cleanly, that he is able to prosecute the case against Donald Trump. Look, this thing is about winning. And we believe that it is one of the most dangerous moments in the history of the United States, maybe since the Civil War. And so the President's got to come in and let people know I'm ready to do this. And he's got he's got to be clear. And I'm pulling for him, because I love Joe Biden. He has been perhaps the most significant President in terms of accomplishments during my lifetime. And maybe LBJ would be close and FDR for my parents, but this man has to win if he's going to go ahead in this campaign.",

Someone used the term pragmatic a few minutes ago, that's where we are.More and more people, unfortunately, because I really respect the President are coming out against him continuing my colleagues. And I think that we ought to give the President all of the chance that we -- that is practical for him to win over the public, win over my constituents. I had a meeting earlier today with the labor leaders in Kansas and Missouri, my district, and they were saying, we're ready to go, we want to go. But they said we want to win.

And we did not waste time, and now we have a solid architecture of security guarantees. I thank President Biden for his leadership and all the efforts to make our security cooperation full of strong actions. There are 23 strong agreements, and there will be agreements with other countries. And we have a historically significant security agreement with the United States. All of these helped us obtain the necessary air defense systems. Thanks to America and to all the partners, to all the leaders and your societies, your people, of course.

And that was kind of a headline coming out of that because it spoke to that moment. And so this is what they are bracing for. And what this press conference and the unknown of what this is going to look like is for anyone to mix up names.
