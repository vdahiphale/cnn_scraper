The hope is that this is a permanent ceasefire that is not just a cessation of hostilities on a temporary basis. I saw a lot of reports that this is a 60-day ceasefire. It is not. It is a permanent ceasefire that will require Hezbollah to move away from the border. But Israeli positions inside Lebanon are going to continue to be there for a few more weeks and will, as they depart Lebanon, on a gradual basis. So the Lebanese military will now come in and as they deploy to the south, the Israeli military will redeploy back into Israel. And look, there's a lot of military gains that were achieved here, but at some point you have to translate those gains into an agreement. The government of Israel felt that this was the right time, as did the Lebanese, and so this ceasefire came about. We were determined not to just have a ceasefire, but a comprehensive agreement that will include components of implementation to ensure that Hezbollah is not there, and most importantly to ensure that the infrastructure is not there and is not allowed to be rebuilt. And so the United States, for the first time, is going to play a role in the monitoring and the implementation of this agreement in order to give more confidence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Jeff Zeleny has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Some potential members of Donald Trump's new government facing threats in a series of incidents that took place at their homes this week. A spokesman for the Trump transition said several potential nominees were targeted in violent un-American threats ranging from bomb threats to so-called swatting incidents when police are summoned under the hoax of some type of criminal threat at a particular address. The FBI and local law enforcement officials are investigating. Now, several top officials were targeted, including Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary. He said Wednesday night his Tennessee home was the target of a pipe bomb threat. Others include John Ratcliffe, who's tapped to lead the CIA, Elise Stefanik, selected for U.N. ambassador, and Lee Zeldin, chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, the FBI said it takes all potential threats seriously, but one law enforcement official who's familiar with these incidents and investigations told CNN these types of swatting calls are quite common and often target those people who are in the news at any given time. When President Biden was briefed on these threats, a White House spokesman said the president and the administration condemns all threats of political violence. It's unclear if all these incidents were linked and how credible these threats actually were, but the timing suggests some type of coordination heading into the Thanksgiving holiday.

Now, the reason why U.S. car companies make cars and parts in foreign countries like Mexico is to keep costs down. It's cheaper to make cars and parts there. Labor is a lot cheaper. And currently, there's free trade between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, something that President Trump helped negotiate under USMCA. Now, the average car price in the U.S. in October was about $47,000. But with tariffs, that price will go a lot higher. So why can't we just keep the production in the U.S. to avoid these tariffs?  Well, we don't currently have facilities for that. And wages for workers are a lot higher here. And the U.S. is currently trying to build 16 semiconductor plants.

Now, some of their titles are things like director of climate diversification, senior advisor on environmental justice and climate change. And in one of his reposts, Musk commented, so many fake jobs. But whatever one may think of these jobs and whether they are worth to have in the federal government, all of the people that were listed are in relatively unknown bureaucratic government roles and they are relatively private people. None of them have public facing positions. And these posts by Elon Musk or amplified by Elon Musk, they have now been viewed tens of millions of times and people are leaving a torrent of negative comments, some of them calling out these employees directly by name. Now, we've reached out to these employees. They've either declined to comment or were unable to be reached. But we know that at least one of them removed all of our social media accounts, likely as a result of this targeting. And we've been in touch with other people who have been targeted by Elon Musk in the past. He has done this before with people he thinks that have wronged him or have been critical of him or he believes might be in the way of the progress of his companies. And they said to me that when they were targeted by him, they ended up getting threats from others. Sometimes these were death threats. Sometimes they had to leave their home. Some of them even moved permanently. And that is a fear that a lot of federal employees now have, that in this effort to try and make the government more efficient, which some federal employees actually support the idea of, that this may be something that may happen, that Elon Musk may post the names, may post titles like this in a way that could actually lead to threats to the safety of these federal employees. Now, we have a statement from the president of the union that represents federal government employees. And he said these tactics are aimed at sowing terror and fear at federal employees. It's intended to make them fearful that they will become afraid to speak up. Now, what's interesting in the process of reporting this, I reached out to several experts on cyber harassment and online abuse. And some of them actually didn't want to speak to me on the record using their names because they themselves were fearful of becoming Elon Musk's latest target. We reached out to X for comment, trying to seek a comment from Elon Musk. They did not respond.

It easily passed in the lower house on Wednesday.The time is running out because today is the last day of the parliamentary year. And senators have about 30 bills they hope to bring to a vote. Hanako Montgomery is monitoring this story. She joins us now live from Tokyo. Good to see you, Hanako. So, will the Senate pass this in time? And if they do, how will this social media ban for kids under 16 work? And how will it be enforced? HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Hi, Rosemary. It's good to see you too. Of course, this is a monumental bill, right? And if it does pass the Australian Senate, which many experts believe it will, then it would be some of the strictest laws on social media that we've seen in the world. Now, we know that tech companies would have about a year to remove under 16-year-olds from their social media platforms. And if they don't comply with the new restrictions, then they could face fines of up to 32 million U.S. dollars. Now, we also know that there would be no exceptions, meaning even if kids get consent from their parents, they still can't create accounts. But, Rosemary, what we don't really know yet is how this ban will actually be enforced. It's a huge task to verify each user's age. And also there are some security concerns here, because if you're asking each user to verify their age with government I.D., very highly sensitive data, and then storing that information online, of course there could potentially be a security breach. And that could be very problematic. Now, in the bill, the Australian government has said that social media platforms shouldn't ask users to submit that kind of highly sensitive information. But, again, Rosemary, not that many details about how it would be enforced. Now, the bill has received widespread bipartisan support from the Australian government. But, of course, it's been criticized by tech companies that would be affected, and also some human rights groups. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who owns X, has criticized the bill, saying that it would infringe upon children's human rights. And Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, has echoed the same concerns, and has also said that Australia should take more time to deliberate the details, iron out the details, before it actually becomes law. Now, Australia's Human Rights Commission, which is an independent government body, has also said that there are better ways, less restrictive ways, to protect children from online harm than simply imposing a blanket ban. But Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has dismissed this criticism, saying that children still get access to important educational and also health services. Of course, also, Rosemary, this bill comes after several high-profile cases where kids took their own lives because, their parents say, they were bullied online. Now, also importantly, Albanese has the support, much of the support, from the general public. According to a YouGov poll released earlier this week, as many as 77 percent of Australians supported a social media ban for under-16-year-olds. And again, of course, this is also very important for Albanese personally, because he's facing very important elections in the new year around May. So again, Rosemary, lots more details that still need to be discussed here, but it could very likely become law very soon. Rosemary.",

As we know, it's very hard for countries that are very small, like Australia, population-wise, to change U.S. government laws and things like that, but we can make a difference with doing it in our own backyard first and that's what the Albanese government is trying to do.

So, you know, something had to happen, Rosemary, to be honest. I have, in the last couple of weeks, it is the first time in the history of my career that I've actually walked out of a school in tears because of the behavior of the students. Now, I know because of the behavior that was put towards me, it was directly influenced by social media. It couldn't have been any other thing because of the particular things that were said and done in that session. So something had to give and with the amount of bullying, Australia is now one of the highest rates of bullying anywhere in the world for such a small company. That's abhorrent and something really needed to change and I think we're all just getting a bit sick of the things that are happening online and no one doing anything about it and it's just getting worse and worse and worse. So it really had to change and I think it's a big brave step that our government doing to put this in place or attempt to, at least.",

United Airlines sent out a memo saying that this is a significant disruption for the airline. Newark is a huge hub for United and it says that 343,000 of its passengers have been caught up in these air traffic control delays in the month of November alone. 46,000 this past Saturday.

Of course, this is part of the big pregame show. The parade's tomorrow, but tonight they will be inflating the balloons some of which have already been inflated others of which are under netting. Tomorrow on their way down Central Park West here in Manhattan all the way down to 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Of course, a big question tomorrow is the weather. Now, the weather forecast ain't so hot to trot. Rain is in the forecast, but I dare say that is part of the reason why we have hats. We have hats here to cover ourselves up from the elements. Look, the good news is that the wind forecast is supposed to be rather minimum in terms of wind and that is key because those 17 giant balloons including new ones such as Minnie Mouse who's making her debut in the parade will be able to fly as long as the wind stays minimum.
