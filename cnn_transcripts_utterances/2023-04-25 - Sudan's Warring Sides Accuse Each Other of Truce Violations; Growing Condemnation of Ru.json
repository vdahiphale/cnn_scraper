But there are certainly signs, significant signs, that it's not holding in totality. And this is what we've seen multiple times now, that these protracted ceasefires that they're hoping for are broken by ongoing fighting. Meanwhile, you do have these countries desperately trying to get their nationals out. You've had the U.S., Britain, Australians getting moved out, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Chinese, French, South Africans, a whole host of different nations assisting their citizens to get out either via air or two ports, Sudan on the Red Sea or through Egypt. Those seem to be the three major routes that foreign nationals are taking to get out. But you do have this growing sense that, with the ceasefire not holding and the humanitarian situation deteriorating even further, that Sudanese are possibly trying to get out as well. Some have gone north through Egypt. The vast majority of this stage, at least according to the UNHCR, the refugee agency, have crossed from Darfur into Sudan and the west of the country. They have been able to reach some of those people, some 20,000 of them, who join an existing population of about 400,000 Sudanese refugees from previous conflicts.

You heard the president there really trying to warn of the threats that he believes American freedoms are facing when it comes to issues like abortion rights, especially as he says, from what he has described as these MAGA extremists on the Republican Party. In that video they show footage of that January 6th insurrection as well as images of two men that he could potentially face off against in a general election. That is former president Donald Trump and also Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to enter the 2024 race. Ultimately President Biden is hoping that he will have a record that will resonate with American voters heading into the general election in November of 2024. But even as the president is putting together this campaign, advisers say he's not expected to hit the campaign trail immediately. He -- they argue that part of what he can sell to the American public is his ability to do the job, day to day, as president. So a bit later today, we're going to hear him speak to a union group, as he tries to highlight some of his labor ties. But one thing that is really facing the president as this campaign operation comes into shape, there are challenges ahead for him. There are -- there's polling that shows that the majority of the American public does not think he should run for reelection. And there were even facing some headwinds within the Democratic Party, as a little over half say he shouldn't run. Now one thing on the Democratic side is that, so far, they really haven't - - there haven't been any candidates that are appearing to pose any formidable threat to the president. But we have been hearing from Republicans over the course of the past 24 hours in anticipation of this launch. One person, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, said that there shouldn't be a rematch of President Biden and president Trump. That is something that could potentially face voters down the line. But certainly right now, the president is hoping that voters will side with his record and ultimately decide that they want him over the Republican alternatives out there.",

The Brits had been hoping that this ceasefire might mean that they could avail themselves of a reduction in violence so that they could get some of their citizens. They estimates some 4,000 people they might have to evacuate to a location outside Khartoum that they could land. That's unclear as to whether or not they've been able to do that. That was their ambition at the beginning of today. But more the focus now, even with this air operation, is turning to Port Sudan, where the French authorities have said that they are embarking some 500 people that were able to get there from Khartoum in a U.N. convoy. They're getting 500 people onto a frigate and taking them to Jeddah across the Red Sea. Now that is a significant development in that they've been able to dock their frigate at Port Sudan. That would indicate that American and British plans to try to use Port Sudan and some of their warships might come to fruition and might mean that they are -- no obligation or no necessity at all to deploy troops themselves to secure that port. Clearly they've been able to negotiate that. So that is a significant step forward. But the issue really is the length of this ceasefire holding and the conditions in Khartoum. And we were sent a voicemail by a Sudanese individual, whose name we're keeping a secret, because he was able to communicate in very clear terms, I think, just what ordinary people, whether they're locals or international citizens, are up against. This is what he sent us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As for the food situation and the supplies,food is OK but shops are running out of food completely. All the factories in Bahari (ph) have been looted by the -- by some people. And as for the water supply, still, we don't have water for the 11th day continuously. We only get water from a well nearby. I wish to stay to see how this is going to be -- going to progress, if it's going to be worse indefinitely, I will escape and there is no other way -- or there is no -- it is what it is. War, you cannot say at a war situation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, that is some hope that this ceasefire may facilitate that. We're not getting any strong indications that it is proving as sufficiently strong a ceasefire to do that. Indeed, we've just heard they're very much the contrary. So that will then accelerate planning for possible mass movements of air, possible use of Port Sudan. Every military contingency is being planned for. There have been no decisions yet as people wait to see how this ceasefire plays out over the next few hours. It was 72 hours  supposedly from midnight last night in Khartoum time.",
