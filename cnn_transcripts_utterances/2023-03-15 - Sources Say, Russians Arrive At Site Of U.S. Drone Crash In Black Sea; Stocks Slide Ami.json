I'll ask key White House Official John Kirby what, if anything, the Kremlin might learn from the wreckage.Also tonight stock prices slide amid fresh chaos in the banking industry. New troubles at two banks adding to fears that more failures are on the horizon as many Americans are wondering if their money is safe. And former Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen just wrapped up his second round of testimony in the investigation of hush money he says he paid to Stormy Daniels. The adult film star meeting with prosecutors today as a grand jury considers criminal charges against the former president. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the breaking news, sources now telling CNN that Russian naval craft have arrived at the site of the U.S. drone downing in the Black Sea. CNN's Oren Liebermann is working his sources for us over at the Pentagon. Oren, U.S. officials believe the wreckage would be extremely difficult to retrieve, but the Russians appear to be trying. What are you hearing from your sources?",

That crash site about 70 miles or so, approximately 70 miles southwest of the Crimea Peninsula. The Russian navy has ships based in Crimea so it wouldn't have been that difficult for them to get their ships to crash site.Of course, the crucial question and this is what's unclear is how much, if anything, would the Russians able to uncover from the MQ-9 drone. Earlier today at a Press Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chief General Mark Milley, it was Milley who said there probably isn't all that much wreckage there to recover. It was about 4,000 to 5,000 feet deep of water there. But the Russians, according to the U.S. officials, were able to get to that site. Earlier today, a senior Russian official promised that the Russians would try to recover what they could from that drone and learn what's possible. Milley had said the U.S. had taken steps to mitigate the collection of any sensitive data. We reported earlier today that before that drone, the U.S. drone that has crashed into the Black Sea, its operators were able to wipe the sensitive data, the sensitive software information used in intelligence collection from the drone, meaning that though there may be some wreckage there, the U.S. believes there isn't sensitive top secret data that just sitting there on top of the Black Sea. Meanwhile, the Pentagon promising it will keep operating over international waters and giving a sense of what the Russians and how they view the Russian actions here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

MARK MILLEY, JOINT CHIEF'S CHAIRMAN:  So, was it intentional or not? Don't know yet. We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional. We also know it was very unprofessional and very unsafe. The actual contact of the fixed wing Russian fighter with our UAV, the physical contact of those two, not sure yet, that remain to be seen. But I can't -- I can tell you with certainty, though, that we have absolute evidence of the contact and the intercepts, et cetera. And it's very aggressive. You've heard about the dumping of the fuel and everything else. We have video evidence of all that. We know where it landed in the Black Sea, it's probably about 4,000, 5,000 feet of water at that depth. So any recovery efforts are very difficult at that depth by anyone. It probably broke up, there probably not a lot to recover, frankly. As far as the loss of anything sensitive intelligence, et cetera, as normal, we would take, and we did take mitigating measures. So, we are quite confident that whatever was of value is no longer of value. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

However, the cause of the incident, that's where we have entire disagreements, the U.S. making their case clear there from both Milley and Austin that it was the Russian fighter jets who were acting in a reckless fashion there. Meanwhile, in a call between Austin and his counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Defense Minister, it was Shoigu who essentially tried to lecture Austin about the U.S. actions here, saying the U.S. flew the drone in a provocative fashion, the flying around Crimea is itself provocative and that Russia had essentially declared that there was some sort of airspace around its, quote, special military operation that the U.S. should have avoided. So, Wolf, there's still certainly disagreement on the cause of this, but at least it seems there's no desire here to escalate from this point.",

The S&amp;P closed off less than 1 percent and the Nasdaq actually eke out a small gain there toward the end of the day. Part of the reason why, just to put a fine point on what Phil already said, is just these regional banks, still concern growing about these regional banks and their fate, even despite the U.S. government intervention that we saw over the weekend. So, First Republic, up 21 percent. To put some context to this, these shares are off almost 70 percent over the last week. Two credit reporting agencies downgrading, two credit rating agencies downgrading this company on fears that depositors may flee, similar to what we saw with SVB. So, a concern growing here. PacWest also saw -- it was put on a potential watch list for a potential downgrade. And essentially what that means, Wolf, is that it's more expensive to borrow. It would be as if your credit score went down, most certainly, those interest rates go up it becomes more expensive, you become a bit more riskier. And so some concern growing here, and that's what you saw reflected in the stock market as well.

Now, look, a defendant can be convicted on the strength of testimony of witnesses who have bad or sort of ugly or complicated backgrounds.

And if you listen carefully to the questions that the judge asked the plaintiffs, your takeaway is that he is skeptical of being that aggressive in one clear swoop. Wolf? BLITZER:  Rosa Flores in Texas for us outside the courthouse, thank you very much. Let's get some more on all of this.

If he -- if this happens, that means that 40 million more women of reproductive age will lose access to medication abortion.Let's talk about what medication abortion is. So, this typically happens in the first ten weeks of pregnancy, one pill Mifepristone is taken and then a day or two later, four pills of Misoprostol is taken. So this combination it came on the market in 2020. You can see that it's become a more and more common way to have an abortion. So now, about 53 percent of abortions in the U.S. are medications, so not the surgical procedure but this medication amounting to more than 490,000 women a year and it is very safe. Data shows -- let's compare it to two very common drugs that people take. So for Mifepristone, you have about five deaths per million users. For Penicillin, a very common anti-biotic, 20 million per user, and for Viagra, 49. So, this is considerably safer than drugs like Penicillin and Viagra. Wolf?",

But this third phone call was to the speaker of the House of the Georgia state house, a man named David Ralston. After this phone call happened in December 2020, Ralston gave an interview and said Trump would like a special session of the Georgia general assembly. He's been clear on that before and he was clear on that in the phone conversation yesterday. You know, I shared with him that my belief that based on the understanding I have of Georgia law that it was going to be very much an uphill battle. So, here was the House speaker saying Trump wanted to gum up the process of the election results or the election. Now, David Ralston passed away last November, so he would not have been able to be a witness going forward in this. But there is this recording now, Wolf, and five different jurors on that grandeur he did speak anonymously to \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\".
