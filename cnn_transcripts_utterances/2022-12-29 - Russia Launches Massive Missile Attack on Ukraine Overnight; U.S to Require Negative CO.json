A 14-year-old girl was caught under the rubble. We spoke to her grandmother who spoke to the girl while she was still under the rubble on the phone. The girl hysterical, desperately asking for help as soon as possible. Inside of the house, her mother was also wounded. She went through surgery. It seems to be in more serious condition, and a man nearby was injured as well. Now, clean-up crews came very quickly to try to put the place these areas in order. But it has resulted, for instance, here in Kyiv, 40 percent of the city is without power. The mayor of Kyiv telling residents to stock up on water and also charge, if possible, their cell phones. Now, in Kharkiv, in the eastern part of the country, two people were killed as a result of this nationwide Russian barrage. Four of the missiles hit their targets in Kharkiv, damaging what is being described as critical infrastructure. In the far west of Ukraine, in the city of Lviv, the mayor says that 90 percent of the power has been knocked out for the moment. Now, despite all of this, the Ukrainian authorities are expressing a certain amount of satisfaction. They say 69 missiles were fired from Russia and from Russian warships in the Black Sea. 54 of them were intercepted. Jessica?",

So, that means you have to have over a country the size of the state of Texas, air defense systems positioned perfectly to intercept these missiles.So, the intelligence that when they're about to launch is critical but it is also important on where you're placing not only the systems but even the handheld shoulder-fired weapons to shoot these things down and Ukraine is getting good at it. But, again, both sides seem to be using a lot of ammunition during this fight in this very conventional fight and it is difficult to continue on that kind of level of defense and offense.",

I give them huge credit in terms of how they're defending against these strikes and even having vehemence and not willing to take Russian attack without any kind of distress.

      "sentences": "Well, I do think this really reflects the growing alarm among American officials at the surge of cases in China and more concerning than the numbers themselves is what federal health officials say is a lack of transparency on the part of Beijing about what is going on, on the ground there, specifically when it comes to genomic sequencing, essentially what variants may be circulating as part of this surge. And that is what led to yesterday's announcement that these new rules would go into effect on January 5th.Still among them, any passenger traveling from China to the United States will have to show proof of a negative test that was taken no fewer than two days before they departed. It can be either a PCR test or a self-antigen test that's conducted by a telehealth proctor, essentially a test that you take on a webcam. It will apply to flights from Mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong, applied at both direct flights from China to the United States but also passengers who are transiting through third countries. And it will apply to all passengers over the age of two. But, really, I do think you cannot separate this from the growing mistrust between the U.S. and China that has been building over the last several years, specifically when it comes to COVID. You had at the very beginning of 2020 the Trump administration applying restrictions on Chinese citizens coming from the United States. Now, there is a key difference in this new rule, it will apply to everyone coming to the United States, American or Chinese citizens or anyone else. It will also apply to all adults who are over the age of two. So, U.S. officials really do hope to get a handle on this in the coming weeks. They say that they don't have a set time for when these rules will expire. It goes into effect next week so they could allow the airlines some time to get the infrastructure in place to start checking these tests. But it certainly does reflect the concern in the United States about what is happening on the ground there in China, Jessica.",

She wasn't there to hold her hand of her grandmother during her final hours.For some other passengers, a little bit of comfort now that Southwest has outlined how they want people to take steps to file for a reimbursement. First and foremost, the airline does not want people to call because their phone system, as you can imagine, is overloaded. Instead they want you to submit your claim online and that is if you have plans to fly through January 2nd. You can submit your missing baggage information online, you can request expense reimbursement online and you could request refunds for those canceled flights.
