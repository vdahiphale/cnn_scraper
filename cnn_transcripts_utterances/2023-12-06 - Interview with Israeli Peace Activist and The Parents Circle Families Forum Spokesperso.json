I asked peace activist Robi Damelin how she remains hopeful for the future. Next, we have Liftoff. Tom Hanks tells me about \"Moonwalkers\", his new immersive documentary that sends us all into outer space. Then, an American president indicted, but it is not Donald Trump. Scholar and writer Jill Lepore looks at history for answers with Michel Martin. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world, with shelters overflowing and no safe zones, that is according to the U.N. agency providing humanitarian aid. Despite mounting warnings from around the world, Israeli forces continue to strike targets in Gaza with reports of high casualties. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to insist the Israeli military will disarm and control the enclave after the war. The United States rejects renewed Israeli occupation there. While some freed hostages and their families are venting their anger at Netanyahu, revealed in this leaked audio from a meeting between them.

And instead of being consumed by hate and revenge, she devotes her life towards peace between Israelis and Palestinians. And she's joining me in the studio. Robi Damelin, welcome here face to face. We've talked to you several times since October 7th. You were in Israel when we spoke the last two times. And you do keep talking about how one must be able to still see the humanity in each other.

And that's not what you want really, but that's the end product. And so, I spoke about, maybe instead of having an opinion, you might want to find the story of one Palestinian, of their loss, and the story of the loss of an Israeli family now, and maybe even the story of a hostage.

And theminute that you would hear my personal story next to a Palestinian personal story, even the hardest of hearts cannot be affected by that. Mainly, the people with the grand opinions rushing around with their placards have absolutely no idea what is going on? I don't think they could find Israel on the map. And you know, I was just thinking about my granddaughter yesterday. In the middle, I have an app on my phone, which tells me if there's going to be a rocket. So, there was a rocket outside my house. And suddenly, this whole fear starts to come up. And that fear is very dangerous. There's a lot of fear around Israel now and trauma and of course, the fear of the Palestinians running away in Gaza is so horrific. I can't believe that I'm part of something that allowed that to happen. And I keep thinking about the next generation. If you were a young kid growing up in Gaza and every two years, there's a war, and every two years they are bombed and you have no shelter and maybe no food and maybe no water, and you're running away. And so, you have no freedom of movement, and no hope. So, what kind of an adult are you going to actually be? And I'm looking at the West Bank now, at the occupation, and I look at my friends who have not got freedom of movement. There's a total closure. Otherwise, I would have been here with a Palestinian partner. Can you imagine what that's like from the 7th of October? They've been more or less stuck at home. The settlers are running rampant and doing exactly what they want with very little punishment or accountability for that matter. All of this is a keg waiting to blow up. And so, what I'm telling you now is that we have to work 10 times harder. And we have to work with the families that lost. Because, you know, a lot of the families that were killed down in the south were actually from the left.",

People thought he would be brought to trial for treason and war crimes right away, and that that would set the stage for a whole chain of events that many other Confederate generals and leaders would it be put on trial as well. His was to be the test case. And there was a whole concatenation of reasons why the trial never came off. It sorts of stretched on for four years before the thing finally resolved. And I think therefore, Civil War historians kind of set it aside as an irrelevancy.

And the resonance really jumped out for me, mostly because we're having this big constitutional argument in the United States today about Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the so-called disqualification clause which provides it -- people who were -- took an oath to the constitution, but then engaged in insurrection against the United States were automatically ineligible for federal office, it was really written for Jefferson Davis.

The judge in the case in Virginia, a guy named John Underwood, was a radical Republican, had been an abolitionist, was really committed to equal rights. Congress had endorsed the idea that black men should be able to serve on juries. This was part of the debate over the 14th and 15th Amendment and, you know, assuring -- guaranteeing equal rights regardless of race. Underwood said, I'm going to put -- he appointed black men to the grand jury conducting the investigation. It was a mixed-race jury. And he pledged that the trial jury would also be a mixture of black and white men. It was such an extraordinary thing and such a novelty. There's actually a beautiful photograph taken of the 24 men and paneled to be the jury pool, 12 black men and 12 white men, the jury that would have tried Jefferson Davis. So, when you look at the correspondence between Davis' lawyers and Davis and Davis' wife or in the prosecution, there's an enormous amount of anxiety about the idea that a jury that it will be half composed of black men could convict a white man to death, to be hanged that -- so, there's this just, whoa. So, it would be good to prosecute this guy for treason. On the other hand, we'll have another war in our hands if we do.

The president of the Confederacy would never be held to account. Partly through the course of ambition the part of certain men. So, that -- in a formal sense, the way he got off was by his defense, entering this motion regarding Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Ultimately, the government just dropped the case. They decided not to pursue the case. And then Andrew Johnson issued a pardon. And there's all this movement by 1870 or so for amnesty for anyone involved in the Confederacy, the country sort of just deciding, we need to move on.",

You know, when Trump was in office -- I remember \"TheWashington Post\" did a forum about whether Trump should be tried after he leaves office. And I wrote an opinion essay saying, you know, no, like it is a tradition that we are blessed to live in a country where we don't prosecute and send to prison political leaders when a new party takes office. That's not the American tradition. We have a very different -- we accept the outcome of elections and we move on. And for whatever Trump had done in office, you know, it would be the best thing for the country to move on. This was before the insurrection, before the documents, the classified documents travesty. And, you know, I've absolutely come to see it is essential -- as much as it appears to defy all precedent, it is essential to the rule of law. And it's not a trivial matter to bring criminal charges against the president, but more is it a trivial matter to attempts to overthrow the results of a democratic election. And there has to be an attempted reckoning with it. The process has to proceed, because without it, you're left with the kind of failure to reckon with the Confederacy essentially. It's a redo of that moment. It's very different scale, different political moments, but there was a cost to not holding the leaders of the Confederacy accountable for undertaking a regime to defend the institution of slavery. There was a cost and it was not borne equally, nor will the failure. If Trump manages to delay and delay and delay these trials, gets re-elected and pardons himself, there will be a tremendous cost in the United States, and it will not be borne equally.",

It's not -- there's not a secret cabal of people that choose how these things will proceed. That at the end of the day, if you don't have faith in trial by jury, what is there left in the world that we share that you trust to arbitrate truth? That is the one institution that Americans still have a tremendous amount of faith in. That's my case there. I do think it's essential that the prosecution be above and beyond fair, that there be no, like, by any means necessary we prosecute this guy. I mean, I think there's different quality to the indictments in the different jurisdictions where Trump has been indicted. I think the D.C. case is really, really important. But I don't think -- for a second, as someone who is interested in seeing the prosecution proceed ever cut a corner. And I do think the degree to which in many realms in American life and politics and culture our standards have shifted to adjust for Trumpism, that has always been an error. I think the right thing, this steering the ship straight is to say, we have no choice. This is probably going to get him re-elected. We got to indict him anyway.",
