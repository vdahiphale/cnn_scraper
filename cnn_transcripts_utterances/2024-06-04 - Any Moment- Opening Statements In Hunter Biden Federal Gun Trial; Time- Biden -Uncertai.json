That is especially notable because she is scheduled to head to France with her husband this evening, but she is still here today to show support for her stepson as this trial gets underway.In a short time, we expect to hear opening statements from defense attorneys and prosecutors. This is their opportunity to lay out their theory of this case before the jury. Let's talk a little bit about this jury. It was really interesting yesterday, the jury selection process. In many ways, it was a reminder of America's drug addiction epidemic, because the vast majority of potential jurors said that, yes, they had some experience with drug addiction when it came to a loved one or even themselves. Now, the eventual jury is comprised of six men, six women. The majority of this jury is black. There are several gun owners on the jury, including one juror who says, even if you smoke marijuana, you still have the right to own a firearm. And several of the jurors who said that they have experience with loved ones and drug addiction also made it on the jury. So today, they'll hear opening statements, and then once those wrap up, the first witness we expect to hear from is an FBI agent who worked on this case. Now, this is one of several federal agents who will likely testify during this case, in addition to some of Hunter's romantic partners. So, this case is expected to last anywhere from three to four days to two weeks. Unclear how this is going to turn out, though. This jury, several sources close to Hunter Biden say they believe it's favorable for them. But we'll see, John.",

I think, as Joey said in his defense narrative, you know, we're not here to demonize. We're here to uplift. I think that there's a legitimate chance of jury nullification here because people are going to be empathetic to this situation.

How does a person react? They can't do that. So, what do you do? You readjust.And I think with regard to jury selection, that was the readjustment. You have jurors who are very empathetic, who have, right, to Bill's indication, experiences with this addiction. And as a result of that, they know the face of it. They've been involved in it. And I think they could be understanding and they could be empathetic to that.

Jurors are human. They don't leave their humanity or common sense at the door. And they're going to hear from people involved with the defendant, former romantic partners. I believe one witness is the former wife of his late brother, which he -- with whom he had a relationship with. And this is going to be compelling and powerful testimony because these witnesses called by the prosecution, I'm sure have love and affection for the defendant.

      "sentences": "Well, that's a big question, Kate, and President Biden did not rule out the possibility that Israel has committed war crimes as it's conducted its campaign to root out Hamas in Gaza. This is significant at a time when the administration has increasingly expressed frustration with the way that Israel has conducted its war. But at the same time, the President in this Time Magazine interview also pushed back on the International Criminal Courts, whose prosecutor has said he is seeking arrest warrants of top Israeli officials including, you know, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Now I want to read you a bit of what President Biden said in this interview when he was asked point blank whether he believes Israel has committed war crimes. The President said, quote, the answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize. He went on to say, but one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians, have suffered greatly for lack of food, water, medicine, et cetera. And a lot of innocent people have been killed. But it is, and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population. Now, the President also, in this interview, acknowledged criticisms of Netanyahu, as some have, charged that he has prolonged this war for his own political benefit. The President in this interview said he would not comment on that, but added, there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. Now, this interview notably was conducted one day before President Biden outlined the broad contours of that Israeli proposal, a three- phase proposal that could lead to a cease fire and secure the release of hostages. I'm actually told National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan this morning here at the White House will be meeting with the families of the American hostages, still being held in Gaza. But this all comes as President Biden is urging Israel, urging Netanyahu to put an end to this war. He says that Hamas, their capabilities to conduct another large-scale October 7th style attack have largely been degraded because of Israel's efforts. And so, he's encouraged and pushed the Israelis to work towards some type of deal to secure the end of this war and also secure the release of hostages. Of course, the White House has said that they are waiting for Hamas to respond to that proposal.",

The White House and/or the campaign, I should say, and President Biden have really been hesitant in recent months to weigh in specifically on the legal cases.They don't want to give any perception of political interference. But in a off camera fundraiser last night in Greenwich, Connecticut, the President specifically referred to Donald Trump for the very first time as a convicted felon. He warned that Trump is trying to wage a full out assault on the American justice system, as you have heard the former president call the election -- the -- this court proceeding, the verdict rigged. Now, it all comes as the President is preparing to face off against Trump in that first debate in the coming weeks. And another thing that Biden said in -- in this close door fundraise or off camera fundraiser, I should say, he tried to warn that a second Trump term would be more dangerous than the first. He said, quote, something snapped in him when he lost in 2020. He can't accept he lost and it is literally driving him crazy. Throughout this campaign, Trump has made it clear he is running to exact revenge. So, what the President's trying to do in these types of remarks, they were at an off-camera fundraiser, potentially road testing for campaign rallies down the road. But it adds to his arguments, trying to provide further evidence that Trump is unfit for office and should not be elected for a second term.",
