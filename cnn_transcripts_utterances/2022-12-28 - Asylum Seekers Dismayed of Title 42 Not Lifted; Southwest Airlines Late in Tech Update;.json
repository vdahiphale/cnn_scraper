There was one mother who told me she was fleeing violence in Venezuela, and she took months bringing herself as well as her two young children, including a toddler all the way here, said that they had been robbed in Mexico and that her intentions had been to cross into the U.S. legally, but because of Title 42 she was sent back.So, hearing that that remains in place for many of these migrants, not just this mother, many of the migrants we spoke to kind of echoed that same sentiment because as you can see behind me these are migrants that have nowhere to go at this time. The city says that they have capacity at shelters. But many of these migrants say that they fear getting on any sort of bus, not knowing exactly where they will end up, not having trust in any sort of individual who may be trying to help them. So, the city is saying that this is an issue trying to find a place where they can put some of the migrants that have come up that are refusing to go into shelters and staying on the sidewalk here where you will see children and toddlers under blankets sleeping overnight. The other big thing that the city is also continuing to do is they are moving ahead with their contingency plans. They are working on two vacant schools to serve as potential shelters in the future. Because despite this decision from the Supreme Court that keeps Title 42 in place, they still expect to have a lot of migrants because of what they're seeing across the border. Seeing a lot of migrants just waiting for their moment to enter into the U.S. whenever that may be. I did speak to one shelter who said to me, an organizer at one of the shelters who said that he too was disappointed with this decision saying that this is something that could extend the bottleneck that they're seeing and put unsustainable pressure on law enforcement on the border. But for Republicans, this is a win. The Republican states that escalated this legal fight, this is a win for them. Governor Greg Abbott here in Texas was very quick to tweet when this was announced.

Southwest was faced with two major issues as they sought to recover the network. The first is the fact that their planes fly very interesting routings, they don't necessarily go from hubs and back to hubs. They zigzag across the country. And this has led to flight attendants and crew members being out of place. Additionally, what we're seeing is that the crew scheduling system hasn't been able to keep up with the rate of cancellations that Southwest has had, which has led to this utter chaos meltdown that we've seen over the last few days.",

And those bans are in effect so that workers can clear all of the roads that they possibly can to make sure that the city's emergency operations can come back to functioning at a hundred percent.At one point during the storm, the sheriff of Erie County said that more than 400 calls for emergency services went unanswered. Officials also want to make sure that the roads are clear so that trucks bringing supplies, you know, food at grocery stores, or supplies for drug stores can get through. Many of the main roads are now passable less so for the side streets. And I want to show you one of the things that we have observed all over the city of Buffalo. You see here these cars piled under, maybe about a foot of snow. We've seen several cars along the main roads, of course, along the side streets. Some under much more snow than that.

Snow pack across the U.S. and of course in Canada, still very high and getting heavier in the mountains from British Columbia down to the central Rockies. A lot of snow in the upper Midwest. Winnipeg picked up 200 centimeters of snow. That's the earliest they picked up that much snow. And then you get into Ontario. But of course, travel bans still in place in and around Buffalo. The governor of New York has opened up the freeways, thank goodness. But the only advisory, and it is just an advisory, is Watertown and the surrounding counties. The warmup begins, but with problems. We're not going to see temperatures warm up and refreeze. They get up above freezing in Buffalo and stay that way. But however, rain comes in Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. And with this massive warmup coming, of course, the flood problems, we could see with ice jamming the drainage areas, we could see the water main breaks, and that could be a big problem. But above average, how about much above average for the east staggering. Out to the west however, the first in a series of storms have moved in, heavy mountain snow, heavy coastal rain, about 100,000 lost power in coastal areas of Oregon because trees are down and how winds are so high. But this atmospheric river is like a fire hose. Again, it's not one system, it's a series of them. This is a multi-day event that we'll see this atmospheric river plow into the area. With all the fires we've had out west burn scars could really create some debris flows, but it's going to be flash flooding. As heavy rain already in San Francisco, is sliding down toward L.A. all the way to the Mexican border. But it's the high mountain snowfall from the front range of the Rockies where the advisories and already the warnings are in place. Excessive rainfall from coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest all the way down into Southern California. So, big travel problems here, flash flooding is going to be a big concern. And when you look at the New Year's Day in the first week of the 2023 above average precipitation, which is good news, although it comes with the flip side, and even though temperatures are warmer in the east, it's rain for most locations, which is good news for everyone.

He says, see how the system works when you're not allowed to beat up a person, but your leadership ordered you to hurt them badly. For example, he says, I have a problem with my spine. It's clear what one has to do to make the problem worse. Keep me as a immobile as much as possible. This is a reference to the fact that we know that the conditions that he's faced in his penal colony, certainly the one as he's been reporting it, have been getting increasingly worse. In June, he was moved to a high security facility. In November, he reported being put in -- put in a cell type room, a sort of solitary confinement of sorts that he's only allowed to sit on a stool, for 16 hours a day. And he says, this is making his back problems much worse. He tried to get proper medical treatment. He filed a request for a doctor, he says it took a month and a half for one to arrive. Then they didn't tell him anything about his diagnosis. After that, they started injecting him with what he says was an unknown sub -- substance. Gave him a vague response to his questions about what it was saying it was B vitamins. It didn't help him, and he then had to file a request through his lawyers for his medical records, which turned up always illegible. He continues to do this to fight for his rights in prison through his lawyers, through the courts. And he also continues, Rosemary, to do exactly what the Russian government does not want him to do. And that is to openly criticize his treatment, but also the war in Ukraine. And it should be noted that his situation right now, he was sentenced to another nine years in prison in March, the month the war started.

Because by that point she left her Trump world attorney for a neutral counsel who told the committee that she really needed to correct some of her previous testimony to clear up the record about what she had previously said. And the details that she gave are indeed damaging.So first off, she told the committee that she saw Mark Meadows burning documents in his office fireplace about a dozen times, which she says amounted to about once or twice a week between December, 2020 and January, 2021. And that at least twice she saw Meadows burning documents after meetings with the Republican Congressman Scott Perry, who was ultimately subpoenaed by the committee but never complied. In addition to that, Hutchinson also told the committee how discussions about some QAnon conspiracy theories really permeated the White House after the election. She said that Mark Meadows brought it up. Also, Congressman -- Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. She made mention of this far-right wing political movement that, of course has those outlandish conspiracy theories. And then Cassidy Hutchinson said that she had this exchange with White House trade advisor Peter Navarro. And at one point, I had sarcastically said, is this from your QAnon friends, Peter, because Peter would talk to me frequently about his QAnon friends. And he said, have you looked into it yet, Cass? I think they pointed out a lot of good ideas. You really need to read this, make sure the chief sees it. And then when she was asked by vice chair Liz Cheney if Navarro was being sarcastic, Hutchinson said, I did not take it as sarcasm. So, in addition to that, we're also getting new details from Deputy White House Press Secretary, Judd Deere. He told the committee that he heard gossip the week after the 2020 election from some of his colleagues at the White House. That Trump, in fact, was considering conceding and even considering inviting the Bidens to the White House. Judd Deere told the committee here that he was looped in on this, on these conversations because he is the one who would've been arranging the press access for any sort of visit for the Bidens. So, obviously neither of those things happened. Of course, instead, Trump refused to concede and held onto those claims of a stolen election. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.",
