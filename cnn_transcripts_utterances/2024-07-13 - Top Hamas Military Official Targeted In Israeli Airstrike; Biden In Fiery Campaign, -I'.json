But an Israeli security official is, indeed, telling me that Mohammed Deif was the target of this enormous Israeli airstrike that took place in the expanded humanitarian zone of Al-Mawasi, this area that the Israeli military has designated as a \"safer area\" for civilians, many of them displaced from other parts of Gaza to head to.But this morning, around 10.30 a.m. local time, it was the site instead of an enormous Israeli airstrike. The plume of smoke that can be seen in this video as well as the enormous crater are indicative of a very powerful type of munition used by the Israeli military. The crater is quite similar to what I've seen in previous strikes where the Israeli military has dropped those enormous 2,000 pound bombs, although at this stage we do not know exactly what kind of munition the Israeli military used. So far, the reports of casualties, at least 71 people were killed, nearly 300 people were injured, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. If indeed, Mohammed Deif, who is the number two official of Hamas in Gaza, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, if indeed, he was killed in this strike, that would obviously be a very, very significant moment in the nine months of this war. Mohamed Deif was not only the head, or as of now, is the head of Al- Qassam Brigades, but he is also viewed in many ways as the mastermind of the October 7th terrorist attacks that Hamas carried out. In the past, he has also been responsible for multiple suicide bombings in Israel, ordering at least four suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. But again, as of now, we do not know, nor is the Israeli government or the Israeli military confirming that Mohammed Deif is indeed killed in this strike. But again, if that were to be the case, a very, very significant moment. And of course, we should not lose sight of what appears to be an enormous civilian death toll as well as we are watching the number of people killed in this strike continuing to rise.",

Camila, let's talk about first this rally where the president showed a lot of energy. He pivoted to Donald Trump. What did he say? CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden was met with a very enthusiastic crowd in Michigan yesterday, and he made two things clear. One is that he's not going anywhere and he's not going to step down from running to be re-elected. And the second thing is he firmly believes that former President Donald Trump is unfit for office. Now, Victor, Biden also took time during this rally to acknowledge that he has had some slip-ups when it comes to his memory in the last few days at these really public events.

Can he make that pivot now? STEF KIGHT, AXIOS POLITICAL REPORTERBut the reality is, this is going to be a difficult pivot to make. Of course, it will be helped by the fact that the Republican convention begins next week, and so that may help try to push the attention back on the former president. But the Biden campaign really has been the topic of conversation for the past two weeks, and the fact that Biden continues to say that he's going to stay in the race, and we continue to hear from more and more Democratic lawmakers calling for him to step aside or at the very least raising concerns, it seems unlikely that they're going to be able to fully avoid the media coverage.",

There were one or two significant floods, but overall, he seemed to be able to answer the questions well and had a lot of, you know, in-depth content to talk about when it comes to the foreign policy space. And Republicans think that, that performance will make it harder for Democrats to force Biden to step aside, even as it was not good enough to end all questions around whether he is actually up to the job of president now and for another four years.And Republicans, that's ideal for them. They think that Biden at the top of the ticket is their best chance at winning the White House in November, but also sweeping the House and the Senate as well. They would rather have a known commodity, Biden, at the top of the ticket, someone who they know what his weaknesses are, rather than a different candidate. They hope to weaken Biden through this conversation, but they not, they don't particularly want to see a different Democratic candidate at the top of the ticket for the presidential race. They're very comfortable keeping Biden there, and they felt like the press conference kind of spreaded that needle for them.",

And so, there are rules that say you need to turn it over. And some things happen, Amara, and they're unintentional. But when you have evidence submitted to you, you don't put it in another file, you don't bury it, you don't make a decision as a prosecutor that it doesn't matter, nothing to see here, you make a decision to freely share it, you come before the court, you make a record of it, and when you don't do that, you're sanctioned. And in this case, the judge has to fashion an appropriate remedy.

So, in this situation, this was fair, and in other instances, it does happen, you know, where the prosecutor does it, and if you act in bad faith and you act intentionally, this is what goes on.

He is the number two official of Hamas inside the Gaza Strip right after Yahya Sinwar. He is also considered to be the mastermind, or one of the masterminds of the October 7th terrorist attacks. Now, this Israeli security official says that the Israeli military is still conducting a damage assessment to see whether or not Deif was, in fact, killed in this strike. But they do say that he was the target of this strike, alongside the head of Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade, a man by the name of Rafa'a Salameh. But one thing that is clear is that there are also a number of civilians who were killed in this strike. At least 71 people were killed, according to the Palestinian ministry of health, nearly 300 people injured. And if you look at the imagery that we are seeing, not only of the strike itself, but of the aftermath, you get a sense of the kind of large types of munitions that clearly appear to have been used in this strike. An enormous plume of smoke emerging from that area and a very, very large crater in the place of the tents of displaced people that once stood in that very same zone. Now, interestingly, Hamas has just put out a statement, and they are denying that Mohammed Deif was targeted or killed in this attack. They say that the \"claims\" of targeting leaders are false claims, and they say that these \"false claims\" are meant to cover up the magnitude of this horrific massacre. If Mohammed Deif was, in fact, there, and if he was killed. This would be a very, very significant moment in this nine-month long war now. Mohammed Deif was not only a very powerful Hamas official. He was also responsible for four suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in both Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. And again, as the commander of Hamas' military wing, he has been leading the fight against Israeli military forces in Gaza since October 7th. But again, his death has not yet been confirmed. His presence at that area has also not yet been confirmed. But at this hour, an Israeli security official telling me that he was the target of this airstrike, and now, Israeli military officials are working to confirm whether or not he was killed.",
