We are following the latest.And it's a law that sparked a fierce debate and protest inside Israel. Now the nation's top court just struck down the plan to limit the powers of the judiciary. And it is a drug that millions and millions of Americans need to survive. Starting today, it just got a lot cheaper. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Hello. I'm Brianna Keilar. Boris Sanchez is off. 2024 beginning in catastrophe for Western Japan. A short time ago, the tsunami warnings were lifted some 10 hours after what the USGS labels as a very strong 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit at a depth of six miles beneath the earth surface in the Ishikawa prefecture. Japanese broadcaster NHK reporting multiple incidents of people trapped beneath the rubble and rescues under way, the quake igniting fires like this one that you see here. It crumbled buildings, it cracked roads and disrupted power and rail lines. We are going to show what happened in one parking lot in the prefecture next to Ishikawa, the shaking lasting for more than 30 seconds. And as you can see later in the clip it actually seemed, to intensify before easing. CNN's Marc Stewart is joining us live from Seoul. Marc, incredibly scary as we see these videos. It is, of course, the middle of the night there in Asia. What can you tell us about rescue efforts that are under way?",

      "sentences": "Right.I think it's important for people to understand that these advisories could be in place for a while, because, while the main quake and the tsunami that came from it may start to be dwindling down, you can have landslides that could trigger additional tsunamis. You can have aftershocks that can trigger them. So this is something we're still going to have to keep a close eye on, not just for the Ishikawa prefecture, but all of these areas up and down the west coast here, where you do still have that tsunami advisory. Here's a look at some video from earlier. You can see all of those waves kind of sloshing over that break wall there into a lot of the communities. And it's been kind of that back and forth, where you get one wave and then another wave comes in. And part of that has to do with the topography here, this Suzu area here. Even though you have this little bay here, what's happening is -- think of it like this. You drop a toy or a stone inside of a bathtub or a hot tub, that wave will go back out to the walls and then it's going to come right back in. So, you're going to have this sloshing back and forth taking place. Now, some of the highest waves, we have seen as much as 1.2 meters, which is just about four feet, some of these other areas picking up just under one meter, roughly about two-and-a-half to three feet there. What's happening is, when you have that earthquake take place, the land that's there, that plate gets thrust upward. It displaces all of that water, and that water instantly starts moving outward. Now, for a while, it's just over water, but, eventually, that water will spread inland. And, again, that topography and that coastline shape is going to play a factor into how quickly that water comes in and how high up that water goes as well. The main quake itself was a 7.5. We already had several aftershocks take place, at least 25 or more of them that have been 2.5-magnitude or higher. This is important, because, even if those aftershocks are, say, 5- or 6-point magnitudes, they can still cause damage, because that initial quake, Brianna, of a 7.5, buildings and homes are now structurally compromised. So, even a slightly weaker earthquake that comes after can still cause further damage. So this is something we're going to have to keep a close eye on in the coming hours, as more aftershocks are going to be expected throughout the day today and the coming days as well.",

The immediate worry is for a few days, but, actually, this area has been an area of the swarm activity, swarms of small earthquakes.

      "sentences": "Brianna, what this means is a couple of things, I suppose, first of all, the one part of Netanyahu's government's flagship judicial overhaul legislation that he managed to get passed is now dead in the water. It has been struck down by the Supreme Court.And I suppose the other broader implication is that this has the potential to reopen these very deep divisions that these judicial overhaul plans created for the most part of 2023, and which were only really pushed aside because of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th. Indeed, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who was the architect of this judicial overhaul, very close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, coming out and assailing the Supreme Court for the timing of this decision, saying that it's the opposite of the unity that's required right now. Now, I won't go into too many -- too much into the weeds and talk about why the Supreme Court had to issue its decision right now, but just to recap in terms of the significance, it was an 8-7 ruling, so very, very close. All 15 of the Supreme Court justices were there to hear this and to issue their ruling. It was an 8-7 decision. And what they said is that the government changes to a basic law -- this is the equivalent of Israel's Constitution. The government changes to this basic law to remove the Supreme Court's powers, to strike down government decisions on the grounds of reasonableness, the Supreme Court said that, no, you cannot do that. And I will give you an example. The government wanted to appoint a minister named Aryeh Deri, a key ally of Netanyahu who heads up the Shas Party, which is part of the governing coalition. Deri was appointed a minister by Netanyahu's government, but he's been convicted three times, most recently of tax fraud. The Supreme Court said, no, it's unreasonable for you to make this man, who's been convicted three times, most recently of tax fraud, as a minister, and, therefore, the government couldn't make him a minister. So, by passing this legislation, the government wanted to be able to appoint whoever it wants as a minister or make decisions that the Supreme Court couldn't strike down on the grounds of reasonableness. The Supreme Court has said that law cannot stand. And, as a result, it's a big blow for Netanyahu, but one that does potentially threaten to reopen those divisions in Israeli society -- Brianna.",

But, Joe, what can these non-Trump candidates accomplish here in this home stretch as you look at where things stand, as Kristen just took us through that? FMR. REP. JOE WALSH (R-IL):  Brianna, happy new year. Not a damn thing. I don't want to sound like a broken record as we launch 2024, but there's nothing new or different they can do. Look, from the beginning, Haley, DeSantis, none of these candidates have been running to beat Donald Trump. None of them have thought from the beginning they can beat Donald Trump. Their strategy has been be the alternative in case something happens to Trump. So I don't think you're going to see any changes this month. I don't -- I expect Trump to win Iowa going away. I expect him to win New Hampshire. I don't think this primary race has ever been much of a primary race.

They know -- they know his vulnerabilities. And so this is -- as he presumably starts to move toward the nomination in the next few weeks, they will really start to, I would imagine, dial up the rhetoric on, if you're somebody who cares about the right to make your own decisions about your health care and your body, if you're somebody who cares about your right to vote and having your vote count, they will start to really draw those contrasts. And I think, as Trump moves toward the nomination, it only kind of heightens the stakes and the urgency and the intensity as voters start to dial in, because that's the other factor here, right? I mean, those of us who talk about this for a living and probably the CNN audience has been dialed in. Most of the country really hasn't been dialed in on the presidential race and won't start to for months to come. So we will see that start to ramp up as well as these contests get under way.",

So I think, regardless of the topic he's talking about, hearing him say just there that he feels good about where we are, that he believes the American people have been through a lot, they're resilient, I think you can definitely expect to hear that be a consistent theme throughout the campaign. That's sort of core to who he is and to his public persona. I think, on the question of the economy, yes, I would expect you're going to continue to hear him make the case that wages have gone up, that inflation has gotten under control. We have not spiraled into recession, as many economists were predicting for two years now that we would. And so he -- I would imagine he will continue to make that case. But I think you will also -- as the campaign heats up, you're going to hear him draw that contrast. Nobody has shied away -- nobody has shied away less from taking on Trump directly than Joe Biden.
