We have new video taken by the Israeli military showing tanks moving into the crossing. The Rafah crossing is one of the main supply routes for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.A Rafah crossing official says that at the moment, all movement at the crossing has stopped. Also in Rafah, video shot from the Egyptian side of the border shows explosions from apparent Israeli airstrikes. Hospital officials say 15 people, including a child, were killed in the bombardment. Now this comes after a very different scene in Rafah on Monday. (VIDEO PLAYING) These celebrations in the streets happened right after Hamas announced it had agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release proposal. But later word came that what Hamas agreed to was not the framework negotiated by Israel and Egypt. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has spent decades covering Gaza, often from inside the enclave, and he joins us now live from Rome. Good morning to you again, Ben. So what more do we know about developments at the Rafah crossing and how significant is Israel's takeover of the Palestinian side? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we know, Rosemary, is that Israel is now in full control of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. They've put up flags. We've seen them. They've deployed armor there. And according to the Palestinian officials who normally work there, the crossing is no longer functional, which basically means that the main entry point for humanitarian goods going into Gaza is now closed. The Israelis say it will reopen when security permits. When that is, is not at all clear, because obviously this corner of Gaza, the southeast corner, the southeast corner of Rafah, is now a war zone. What we've seen is since shortly after midnight there have been airstrikes. As you said, at least 15 people have been killed, according to hospitals in Rafah. And obviously this is going to exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Yesterday the Israelis dropped leaflets on that area of Rafah, telling people, ordering people to leave that area. There are about 100,000 Palestinians who have taken refuge in that part of Rafah. Now, the United States has warned Israel time and time again not to undertake any sort of military operation in the Rafah area because of the very high probability of high civilian casualties. And also the United States has pointed out time and time again that the Israelis simply have not made, taken any measures to provide the basics in terms of shelter and sanitation and food for all of those people who are going to be fleeing the Rafah area as the fighting there intensifies.

Now, it's not altogether clear how far apart Hamas's proposal or the proposal that Hamas said it agreed to and the proposal that the Israelis apparently agreed to.It may be simply that the Israelis don't want to agree to anything that would suggest that there might be a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire. The phrase that we've heard time and time again is that part of this sort of the general outline of an agreement would involve what's being called a sustainable period of calm, which certainly does sound like a prolonged ceasefire. But the Israelis continue to insist that they will continue this war until the elimination of Hamas, even though they've been warned by many that eliminating Hamas is much easier said than done. And at this point, after seven months and more than 34,000 dead Palestinians, how much longer can this war realistically go on? Rosemary?",

And the sheer logistics of doing that, coordinating the move on the ground of that massive amount of people, I think means it's impractical for them to actually make that move. So, unfortunately, they are in the line of fire if Israel goes in. And in terms of the hostages, as I think everyone understands, Hamas have control of them. Hamas would probably try to move them out into a more protected area or potentially, you know, you could see those hostages come to some harm, unfortunately.

Airpower supporting those forces wherever possible, long range fires in terms of artillery and missile attacks.Ultimately, where that leads, I think, is a decisive battle to end Hamas' control of Rafah. The exit strategy, I think, is unclear. Israel would have to control the terrain to prevent any recurrence or re-emergence of Hamas until such time as some form of stabilization force from outside the region can go in to secure the area.

He's set to be sworn in for a new six-year term after winning the election in March by a landslide, though of course he faced no real competition. Most E.U. countries as well as the United States will not have a representative at his inauguration.And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now live from London with more on this. Good to see you, Clare. So what's expected and how will this inauguration ceremony likely play out? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it'll be much the same as in previous years, the previous four times that Putin has been inaugurated as Russian President. It's an opportunity of course to rubber stamp that record 87 percent majority with which he won, obviously having of course stifled all opposition and criminalized pretty much all dissent, especially against his war in Ukraine. But we will see the ceremonial part, obviously he'll progress, process through the Kremlin, the Grand Kremlin Palace, that red carpet, he'll swear on the Russian Constitution, he may make a speech as he has in previous years. So that will pretty much all be predictable. There is then the process where the government has to resign on the same day and over the coming days Putin will then appoint or perhaps reappoint a prime minister and cabinet members. There is a small amount of speculation around his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, he has been in that job for some 12 years and obviously things are right now going Russia's way to some extent in Ukraine. But one of his top deputies, a very close associate, was recently arrested on bribery charges. So that has led to some speculation there. And of course in terms of the international dignitaries at the inauguration, foreign diplomats are in large part boycotting this, the E.U. countries, the U.K., some of the Baltic States have had some choice words on this. Lithuania, which no longer has an ambassador in Russia, said that they would not be taking part in what they called Putin's fake inauguration theater. That's a tweet from the Lithuanian foreign minister. But at home, of course, he has a very clear mandate and as I said, things are largely going Russia's way at the moment. It seems to have the advantage, at least in the ground war in Ukraine, Rosemary.",

Our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London with that report.Prosecutors say they have roughly two weeks of testimony left in Donald Trump's hush money trial. And that has many wondering if the former US president will keep quiet long enough to stay out of jail. A judge fined Trump another $1,000 on Monday for violating his gag order and said that if he does it again, he is going to jail. The gag order bars Trump from commenting on witnesses, court staff or the jury. The focus then shifted to the paper trail and how former fixer Michael Cohen was reimbursed for paying off a porn star who claimed to have an affair with Trump. CNN's Kara Scannell has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Insiders at the Trump Organization on the stand walk through key payments at the center of the case against former President Donald Trump as the first criminal trial of a former president begins its fourth week. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It's a ridiculous case. I did nothing wrong. SCANNELL (voice-over): Jeffrey Makani, a former executive at the company, testified Trump used his personal account to reimburse his former attorney, Michael Cohen. Prosecutors allege the payments were reimbursement for a hush money payment Cohen made just before the 2016 election to adult film star Stormy Daniels to quiet her story of an alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies the affair. Makani said the reimbursements came in $35,000 monthly increments through 2017. MICHAEL COHEN, TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: It was actually 11 checks because one of the checks January and February were combined. SCANNELL (voice-over): Prosecutors aim to prove Trump's business records of the payments were falsified and the money was not for a retainer agreement as stated on Cohen's invoices, but instead payback for the hush money to Daniels. Prosecutors asked Makani if this was all happening above his head. Yes, he replied. Makani testified former Trump Organization chief financial officer Alan Weisselberg was the one who told him they had to reimburse Cohen. Weisselberg, who is currently serving five months in jail on perjury charges in Trump's civil fraud case, had sketched out the payment to Cohen on a bank statement that showed Cohen transferred the $130,000 payment to Daniels' attorney. The total paid to Cohen, $420,000, allegedly included reimbursing Cohen for the money he paid to Daniels' attorney to kill her story, cash owed for other expenses and a hefty bonus for Cohen. It was marked on the books as a legal expense. Makani suggested Trump kept a tight rein over his account, but Trump attorney Emil Bove in rapid fire questioning tried to show Trump was not involved in accounting at the company in 2017 when these payments were made. Bove asked Makani whether he talked to Trump about these payments. I did not, Makani testified. Bove pressed him further if Trump ever asked him to do any of the things he described. He did not, Makani testified. Also testifying on Monday, Deborah Tarasoff, a Trump Organization accounts employee who cut the checks to Cohen. Tarasoff said that Trump was the only one who signed the checks for his personal account. Only Mr. Trump, she testified, adding if he didn't want to sign it, he didn't sign it.",

He does not want that. No one wants that. In fact, he's also rejected all pleas from the Americans to set an international force, and indeed with an Arab component, to replace Hamas gradually. He rejected that and refused to even entertain that. So this Rafah thing, he turned Rafah into some kind of a Stalingrad, an inflection point after which the war will be won decisively, which beckons the question, if Rafah is the center of gravity of Hamas military activity, then why did you invade the northern part of Gaza back in late October and early November rather than begin the operation in the south? That's unclear. Not just unclear to me, Rosemary, unclear to the Pentagon, which has asked Mr. Netanyahu, and apparently the answer is political. But, you know, this Rafah thing, you know, the viewers need to understand. There are a million point four people concentrated in the southern tip of Gaza right now. There's no way in the world that Israel can invade or launch an offensive operation without removing at least 90 percent of them. And the question is, where are they going to go? This is, you know, this is not Canada. This is not Australia. This is not the U.S. This is a very small, dense plot of land.",
