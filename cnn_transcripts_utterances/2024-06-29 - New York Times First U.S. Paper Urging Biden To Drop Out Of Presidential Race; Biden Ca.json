There's no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump's deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It's too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden's age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes. Now, most Americans don't read the New York Times editorials.

Will he lose and hand the White House to the Trump presidency part two, and I think that's really the essence of the difference.

And headlines this morning, Steve Bannon, the conservative podcast host and former strategists for Donald Trump must turn himself in by Monday. The Supreme Court has denied his request to avoid serving a four-month sentence. Bannon faces prison time after being convicted for refusing to comply with subpoena orders for an interview and documents related to the January 6th investigation. Once again, a New Mexico judge has denied actor Alec Baldwin's request to dismiss his involuntary manslaughter charge. It stems from the fatal shooting on the set of his film \"Rust\". Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, she was killed in October 2021 when a gun Baldwin was holding fired a live round during a scene rehearsal. In their latest motion, Baldwin's attorneys are arguing they couldn't mount an effective defense after the FBI destroyed that gun during forensic testing. Baldwin's trial is set to start next month. Take a look at this video of fire crews in Arizona battling a wildfire near Phoenix. The boulder-view fire has already burned over 3,000 acres with zero containment. At least, 60 homes in the Scottsdale area have been evacuated as hot and dry weather fuels that fire.

What's actually quite remarkable that the Reform candidate Masoud Pezeshkian did really well in this first round of the election, essentially, what the moderates have been telling us is that they believe that they would need a massive turnout or a large turnout in the first round of elections for him to be able to make it to the runoff round.However, the turnout was only about 40 percent, and yet, he has managed to get by far the most votes than any other candidate. He has a million more than Saeed Jalili, who is the next runner-up and whom he'll be facing in that runoff election. Now, Masoud Pezeshkian is advocating for better ties with western nations, better ties with the West as well. In fact, Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he said that he's quite skeptical of politicians whom he believes want that too much better relations with the United States. Then, you have Saeed Jalili, who is going to be the gentleman that he is going to be running against. He came in second in the votes so far, he says that he wants a policy in the spirit of Ebrahim Raisi, that president who was killed in that chopper crash a little over a month ago, and that would mean a really tough line towards Israel, and a really tough line towards the United States. Of course, we know that Iran and Israel in the past couple of weeks came very close to an all-out war that could have also had massive consequences for the U.S. assets here in the greater Middle Eastern region. So, these two are going to be facing off against one another, and clearly, it is open who could decide that election or that run-off election for themselves. It certainly is the case that while Masoud Pezeshkian, the reformer, got the most votes, more people actually voted conservative in the first round of the election because there were three conservative candidates who were running. However, the big question is going to be turnout in the second run-off round in the election. Who's going to be able to mobilize their basis to actually come to the voting booth, guys.",

      "sentences": "So, a lot of people ask that, so yes, I would like to make the point that on average, the second named storm doesn't happen until July 17th. So, we are ahead of pace there. This also is likely to become a hurricane in the next 24 hours.We don't get our first hurricane until usually August 11th. So, both of those a little ahead of the system, but a lot of that has to do with those incredibly warm sea surface temperatures. So, let's take a look at where the storm is now. You can see it is just east of the Windward and the Leeward Islands, sustained winds right now about 50 miles per hour. It's testing up to 65. Now, again, this far east, it's very unusual to see a storm form this far east into the Atlantic, especially this early in the year. But as we mentioned, a lot of that has to do with the incredibly warm sea surface temperatures. Where that storm is located, it's about 3 to 5 degrees above average, so just warm enough that it's allowing these areas -- this area to fuel some of those storms. Now, as we go forward into the next 24 hours, we do anticipate this storm to get up to a category one strength. Then from there, it's going to continue across the Windward Islands and head into the Caribbean sea, likely heading somewhere say, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, up towards Cuba. Now, after that, I know, a lot of people want to know, OK, but where does it go after that? We simply don't know. It's too far out and there's too many other factors. But at this point, yes, it could continue on to areas of Mexico, Belize, Honduras, or it could make that right-hand turn. And I want to make it very clear, that is what storms normally do. They aim pole-ward. So, normally the pole is to have them go to the north, but we just don't know what's going to happen with this once we get past, say, Wednesday of this week, but certainly something to keep an eye on. And it's not the only thing, we actually have two other systems that we're keeping an eye on. This one just behind Beryl has about a 50 percent chance of development over the next seven days. This other one that's expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula has about a 40 percent chance of development. So, all of those likely to have to keep a close eye on. Chris and Debbie are the next two names on the list. One thing to note though, as Beryl slides its way because it is going to strengthen, you've got a lot of islands that are going to have the potential to have those tropical storm-force winds. So, that's 60, 70-mile per hour winds, not out of the question for multiple islands to end up seeing some impacts from. Now, in terms of the rest of the country, we're also keeping an eye on that incredible heat across the southern tier, and also a line of strong to severe thunderstorms that's expected for not only today, but also tomorrow. So, you can see the two days stretching here mainly for today, we're looking at the Great Lakes region, by tomorrow that shifts ever so slightly to the east, really main focus along the east coast, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. all looking at that potential for those strongest severe thunderstorms and still dealing with all of that heat just doesn't feel like it's ever going to go away across the south.",
