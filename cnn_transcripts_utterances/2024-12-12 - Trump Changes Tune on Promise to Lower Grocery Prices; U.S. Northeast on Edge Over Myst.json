(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. What Donald Trump said then, and what he says now. Tonight, the president elect says that he can't control what you pay at the supermarket. Here is the exchange from a new interview with Time Magazine. Trump was asked this question. If prices of groceries don't come down, will your presidency be a failure? And here's how he responded. Quote, I don't think so. Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know it's very hard, but I think that they will. Now, that is not nearly what he said on the campaign trail about the same issue.

We will end inflation and make America affordable again. It's not affordable. Prices will come down and come down dramatically and come down fast. Bacon is through the roof. They're all through the roof, the milk, everything is bad. And we're going to straighten it out. We're going to bring prices way down. And we're going to get it done fast. Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a car, and a home, common sense. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is no plan. There is not going to be a plan to get prices down. Grocery price inflation, which is about the growth rate of prices, actually already is down a lot. It's only about 1.5 percent. But that's different from getting the price level down, you know, getting prices to go back to what they were like pre-pandemic.

From Iran, which is now on a back foot that is tied up with Israel and strikes on their radar defenses, and drones are maybe all they have left that they can fly towards them. So, they're busy, which then brings us to China. Now, my experience in the intelligence community was that China was foot forward on collection of intelligence, especially defense intelligence, especially on the U.S. soil, that they were clangy, you know, they were noisy, you could hear them coming, but they were relentless. Yesterday, they unsealed charges against a Chinese national in Santa Barbara County for flying a drone over the Brandenburg Space Force base, collecting intelligence and brought federal charges he's being held. So, when you look at that in context, could it be China? Which then gets us -- it's heading back to the mothership, which is if it is China you can operate them from China but they have to fuel, charge, store, stay somewhere. So, you know, if it's not the mothership, is there a secret intelligence warehouse in Passaic, New Jersey that we haven't uncovered?",

I've never seen anybody shoot the ball the way she shoots the ball in the WNBA. I'm just being honest. She, early on, in her collegiate career reminded me of Steph Curry and that's where all this attention came from.But before she entered a league that started in 1997, there were the Lisa Leslie's and the Don Staley's and the Cheryl Swoops of it all who really built this league and they weren't getting the attention because, let's face it, the league was built in a way in which it wasn't mainstream. And all she's simply saying is that I want to respect those who come before me. Now, conservatives do one of two things that I am so fascinated with, especially when it comes to her. Either they whine or they bully. So, now, it's time to do both. They're bullying her when she decides to just like a post about Taylor Swift's post about Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala Harris. They, they, like saying go vote. And then they unfollow her in droves. And then she says, you know what, I am so grateful for all this money I make. I'm making more money. than most of these women will ever see in their lifetime because I am a great player, but I'm also someone that they are using as their message person, that they are using me as a conduit to get their message out. And she says, no, I don't want any of that. I'm grateful. And hopefully I can shine some attention on Bakari because no one's paying attention to Bakari. And so, I'm going to give Bakari some attention because you know what? Thank you for keeping this league alive, Bakari. Everything that you've done has really got to the point where I can be here and benefit in this moment. And Megyn Kelly, since she's on a knee apologizing because she's white, she's acknowledging the reverse DEI that no one wants to talk about. She has a privilege. She has been in this league for so, what, a year? And she makes more money than the people who built this league? And she understands there's a reason, not because she shoots the ball well. Yes, that also helps. But there's another reason, Scott. There's a reason that says, I'm white and it's a privilege and people love me. And I'm okay with that.
