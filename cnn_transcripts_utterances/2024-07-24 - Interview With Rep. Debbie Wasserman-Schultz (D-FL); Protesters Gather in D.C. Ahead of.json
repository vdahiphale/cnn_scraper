      "sentences": "Former President Donald Trump hits the road today holding a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. It's his first public campaign event since President Biden announced that he's dropping his reelection bid.Trump now faces a new opponent, a new race, and a new political landscape. All eyes and ears will be on how he goes after his presumptive opponent, Kamala Harris. This morning, we have new details on how the Harris campaign envisions a path to victory through the Electoral College. A memo says the presumptive nominee creates new opportunities for winning over swing voters in the all-important swing states that are up for grabs. Let's go to CNN's Eva McKend in Indianapolis for us. Eva, tell us. I mean, Indiana, not exactly a battleground state right now, but she's going to be addressing the black sorority Zeta Phi Beta there. Tell us about this new strategy and what the campaign is saying.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, they say that she can win because of this expanded universe of swing voters.And this is something that we have heard all along on the campaign trail. When you speak to people, they didn't want to vote for Biden. They didn't necessarily want to vote for Trump either. Well, they say that she can compete with these voters now in a real way where they couldn't before. But they also maintain that she's strong with key Democratic coalitions, black voters, Asian voters, female voters, Latino voters, and they said that grassroots support has been on display the last few days. So, since Sunday, 100,000 people have signed up to volunteer for the campaign. She's raised $126 million in just the last few days. I will read you a bit of this memo that we received this morning. It says: \"While the vice president is poised to build on the 2020 Biden/Harris coalition, Trump, on the other hand, has not expanded his support. This has become even more clear in the last month, where he largely failed to win over new voters following the debate and the RNC Convention.\" And so Harris here in Indiana today as part of her Summer of Engagement tour. She is going to address the black sorority the Zetas. And we, of course, Jim, know that black women have been so instrumental behind the scenes in Democratic organizing. So, strategically, this stop makes a lot of sense. She also recently addressed her sorority, the AKAs -- Jim.",

And I'm proud to be serving on the escort committee, an opportunity that I'm going to use to make sure that I relay to the prime minister the absolute necessity to make sure that we can finalize and he will agree to the deal that President Biden and Vice President Harris have proposed and have put together. So that we can bring our hostages home, especially the eight Americans, make sure that we can end the terrorist threat that no country, including Israel, should ever have to live with on their doorstep, and ensure that we can begin the rebuilding of a civilian governance in Gaza and ensure that the threat to Israel from the Houthis to Hezbollah is brought to an end. I'm going to relay that message on behalf of the hostage families that I have met with in recent days and over the last many months.",

We have President Biden exiting the race for the White House. He's making this speech this evening about this. We're seeing all these demonstrators in the streets of Washington, D.C., right now. Is it a good idea just to have this address? Should it have been postponed?",

And I expect and hope that we will hear from the prime minister a very important message, that he rebuild the bipartisan support that has traditionally been there for the U.S.-Israel relationship, and also to make sure that he thanks the president and vice president and the American people for solidly standing by Israel in her really horrific hour of need.",

And I'm told that his tone and tenor will be dramatically different, that he's coming to thank the United States, that he's coming to stress the imperative of the bipartisan nature of our support for Israel, which has been solid since October 7. And that's my expectation, and hopeful that my expectation will be correct.",
