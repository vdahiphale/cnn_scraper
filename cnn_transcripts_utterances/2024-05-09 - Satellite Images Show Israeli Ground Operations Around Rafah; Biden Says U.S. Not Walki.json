Today South Rafah has been hit with airstrikes as well as tank and artillery fire, and Israel now controls the Rafah border crossing. But the president says Israeli forces have not yet moved into the city of Rafah itself.

That's one thing. Second, though, the president has now decided to withhold this shipment because it's becoming tough for him politically to maintain the policy.I try not to veer into domestic U.S. politics too much, but it seems clear that his calculation is that the situation in the Gaza Strip or the potential for carnage in Rafah is too much for him and his party to bear. And he wants to avoid that, those fractures at all costs.

Analysts say if Trump gets elected again, he'd have the power as president to order the Justice Department to drop the January 6th case and the Mar-a-Lago case because those are both federal cases. The most likely case to survive against Trump, if he's elected, is the Georgia case because that is a state proceeding, but it's open to debate whether that case could survive.

It's also where a small number of wounded and foreigners have been allowed out of Gaza. And it's where many of the freed hostages crossed into freedom early on. This crossing is now under Israeli control. Troops planted an Israeli flag, you can see there, and filmed it. This footage was given to us by the IDF. Now outside this once Palestinian-controlled border station, footage shows Israeli tanks destroying signs which say \"Gaza\" and also \"I love Gaza.\" Several tanks are also seen in this IDF handout footage. In this area, we see no signs of any other presence apart from the Israeli military here. Now close via the part of Eastern Rafah where Israel's military has issued evacuation orders. Some 100,000 told to leave immediately on Monday to the area of al-Mawasi. Now that's about five miles, or eight kilometers, away. But of course, most have no transport, and fuel is scarce. It is an area the United Nations on the ground has called inhumane and has warned it is not suitable for habitation. Well over one million people are currently living or sheltering in Rafah. Some estimates are closer to 1.4 million. Most have been displaced once or more times by the Israeli military over the past seven months. Rafah itself is just 25 square miles. That's 64 square kilometers. It is a small area crammed with misery and fear, but it is also an area the IDF says houses the last stronghold of Hamas that needs to be destroyed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
