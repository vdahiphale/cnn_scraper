Plus, unsealed. The huge new trove of evidence in Trump's federal election subversion case released today. Why now and what is still being kept hidden? And stunning new reporting about the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. What CNN is learning about how Sinwar was killed, how his body was identified, and how Israel might use the body in future negotiations to strike a hostage deal. (MUSIC)",

Nearly 1 million ballots have already been cast so far in the great lake state where the Israel-Gaza war looms large politically as many Muslim American and Arab American residents had been dissatisfied with the way the Biden-Harris administration has handled the war and supported Israel. Harris just held a campaign event in Grand Rapids, Michigan earlier this afternoon and she will appear at a union hall next hour in Lansing, Michigan. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is set to hold a roundtable in Oakland County and around in Detroit tonight is his campaign grapples with this federal judge today, releasing a massive trove of documents in the 2020 election subversion case against Mr. Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith. We'll have much more on that just ahead. We're also at the point in this tight race where we are seeing some big name surrogates hitting the campaign trail. Two sources tell CNN that the Trump campaign is talking with former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to join him on the trail. As for Harris, former President Bill Clinton is sitting up small rural towns while former President Obama heads to Tucson, Arizona, tonight. Tomorrow at a Detroit rally, Harris will have Lizzo by her side. And later that day, Usher will take the stage for Harris at a rally in Atlanta. Both stars looking to help Harris shore up young and black voters who are key in each state. Let's check in on both campaigns with CNN's Kristen Holmes and Eva McKend. Eva, we just heard from Harris and her first event in Michigan today. What's the message she is delivering?",

She needs to do a lot better with union members than she's doing right now. Don't you think? MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think that's exactly the reason why she's doing this, Jake, and you're right. She needs to go there and remind people, not just what she will do as president, but what Donald Trump has done as he tries to gather more support among union workers then she needs to have them hold him accountable for the loss of 285,000 jobs while he was in office, for shutting down factories when he promised that he would keep them open and grow them, for giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas for saying, when President Obama under the Obama-Biden administration, when he saved the auto industry after the great recession, Donald Trump saying he would have let that industry fail. So this is a great opportunity for her to remind union workers of the facts of what Donald well, Trump actually both has done, has said and will do under his economic plan.

And we need to crack down on Iran and the illicit oil trade between China and Iran that has funded this entire situation.Iran has increased Iranian petroleum sales by almost $200 billion in the last three-and-a-half years. That is what is funding Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terror networks in the region. And so what is critical in this moment with the death of Sinwar is to get Hamas to surrender and lay down their arms and release the hostages. Obviously, long term in order for there to be a two-state solution, in order for there to be peace, Arab majority nations need to accept Israel's right to exist, and they need to normalize relations with Israel. That's why I along with Ritchie Torres, passed a special envoy for the Abraham Accords, we need to get Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel and other Arab states to follow. That will make it easier to deal with the situation in Gaza and the West Bank moving forward. Obviously, it needs to be an Arab led solution in Gaza. It cannot be American-led or Israeli led.

This is the tank fire, the Israeli military says was part of the attack that ultimately killed the man who orchestrated the October 7 attacks, shortly after he was caught in this remarkable drone video resting on a chair and lashing out with a stick last gesture of defiance. OK. Well, this is what's left of the neighborhood of Tel Sultan in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military says its the same area they took me to oppress trip last month was in the rubble of the same buildings Israel's most reviled enemy briefly emerged and was killed. Now, the remains of Sinwar are being held at secret location in Israel, according to local media reports. Israeli sources tell CNN they could eventually be used as a bargaining chip, an exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. As Israel weighs how to create pressure quickly on Hamas in the aftermath of the Sinwar killed. But Friday prayers in Gaza, the Hamas leader was mourned in his battered hometown of Khan Younis. Israeli soldiers tell CNN this concern, returning Sinwar's body would rally supporters and risk his gravesite becoming a shrine. But across Israeli, families of Israeli hostages are stepping up pressure for any deal to bring their loved ones home. That means swapping Sinwar's remains says one Israeli source then fine.

This is the moment, this is the person that Netanyahu has been talking about for over a year now that this is part of it, that this war cannot end until Yahya Sinwar is dead. And now that this has happened, the U.S. is very clearly trying to leverage this its moment to start those conversations about what the next day or the day after in Gaza looks like.The question though is still what that plan is going to be and us officials don't have a clear cut vision from what conversations they've had with Israelis about what that's going to look like, who is going to be in charge of trying to negotiate for the release of the hostages who are still being, what is that going to look like? So, they're trying to leverage this moment, Jake, but they're also looking and listening closely to what we are hearing from Hamas officials. What you were hearing from the Israeli prime minister who says, this is not the end as Netanyahu put it yesterday, he said at the beginning of the end. That's a big question for U.S. officials and, Jake, the election and the timing of all of this is a big moment and don't forget, there are also still waiting for Israel to respond to the attack by Iran. That is something that is very much still in the making, Jake.",

Jack Smith and went back to a grand jury gotten new indictment where he dropped out some of his allegations.

So as Katelyn said, Jack Smith's submission today is intended to argueall of my evidence is an official act and should there -- is not an official act and therefore should be able to stay in the indictment. As to why right now, Donald Trump's team objected furiously to this. They said we should not be releasing new evidence thousands of pages, just a few days before an election, Judge Chutkan rejected that. She says, it's simply its not my concern whether there's an election or campaign, or carrying on in the normal course of business. And the judge's rule usually prevails.",
