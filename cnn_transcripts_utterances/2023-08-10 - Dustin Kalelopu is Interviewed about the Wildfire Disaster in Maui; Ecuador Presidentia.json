Everything was fine. Just a bit windy, no electricity. By 3:30 in the afternoon, the fire that had started a few miles above us up on the mountaintop had made its way down toward our home and then crossed its way over the highway to the condominium across the street from us. And then our neighbor's yard was on fire. The smoke was filling our house. And we had no choice but to evacuate. We had no time to grab anything. We lost our kitten in the process of evacuating. And, honestly, we're grateful to my brother, who returned home, to retrieve my grandmother's urn before he left to evacuate as well.",

According to campaign aides contacted by CNN, in a video that appears to show the moment of the attack, all of a sudden a burst of gunfire was heard as he was getting into a waiting vehicle. Several people were hit by the bullets, including Fernando Villavicencio, a 59-year-old activist, journalist, and politician who was running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks, on August 20th. As Villavicencio gets in the back seat of the vehicle, at least 12 gunshots can be heard. A policeman quickly closes the door behind Villavicencio and many people are seen taking cover from the gunfire, including his security detail. The Ecuadorian attorney general's office later said that at least nine people were injured in the attack, including a candidate for the national assembly and two police officers. Current Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso, later said on social media that he's outraged and shocked. He called the attack an assassination. Lasso also expressed solidarity and sent his condolences to Villavicencio wife and daughters. He also vowed that this crime will not go unpunished. Lasso acknowledged that organized crime has come a long way in his country, but, at the same time, he promised that the full weight of the law will fall on them, meaning the criminals. In an interview with CNN En Espanol, Poppy and Victor, back in May, Villavicencio said that drug traffickers had already made themselves at home in Ecuador, polluting the entire nation since at least 2007, and calling his own country a narco state run by the political mafia. And, finally, the Ecuadorian government says the August 20th election will still go on as planned. Back to you.",

You can bet that the lawyers for all three defendants, including Donald Trump, are going to argue, well, the government has now brought new charges, they've added this new defendant, we need more time. We need to essentially restart the clock. I don't know how that's going to come out. This is strictly within the discretion of the trial court judge, Judge Cannon here.
