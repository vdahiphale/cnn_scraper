Then, officials are calling it the largest Russian missile strike since the war began. Ukrainians say it could have been so much worse. Plus, some signs of relief on the horizon for tens of thousands of Southwest passenger passengers who have been stuck in the airline's meltdown for now eight days. (MUSIC)",

The committee today released more testimony transcripts from 19 witnesses, including Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., Trump attorney Christina Bobb, former Trump adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller and former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. There's one key thing that sticks out in many of these transcripts, and that's the role of Mark Meadows. He was, of course, Trump's chief of staff on January 6th and the closest person to the president throughout that day, and multiple witnesses recounting texting Meadows during the insurrection, desperately asking him to persuade Trump to condemn the violence. CNN's Sara Murray is with us now. And, Sara, you've been poring over Donald Trump Jr.'s transcripts and probably every other one transcript, too. What have you found and what you've seen so far?",

You know, he is saying to Mark Meadows, talking about his dad, he's got to condemn this expletive. He says, they will try to F his liar legacy on this if it gets worse.So, he's imploring Mark Meadows to get his dad to do something and call off the rioters as the attack on the Capitol is unfolding. The other thing that's interesting about this transcript with Donald Trump Jr. is there's a whole lot he doesn't recall when it comes to direct conversations that he was having with his father, and he lays out why he was in touch with some of the aides around his father after he and his dad were separated on that day. He explained that Donald Trump doesn't use email, he doesn't text. So, he's saying, if I was on a plane with Wi-Fi, my father doesn't text. So, I couldn't reach out to him directly, so I reached out to his chief of staff. And this is important, Phil, because this is the kind of thing that's been really problem problematic for investigators who look into Donald Trump. The witnesses around him can say, I don't recall these exact conversations and there's not a paper trail, because Donald Trump himself doesn't text, he doesn't use email. At one point, Donald Trump was used about messaging apps, and he said, I don't think my dad even knows about those.",

He's saying, give me a couple of examples so I can go out there and I can be a champion for Donald Trump and claim that he won.

She made some interesting comments about how Trump viewed the riders who say they were there to support him. Quote, he was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. He also didn't like how they looked. His comments were that the people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they are.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says, Russia launch more than 120 missiles targeting infrastructure in many cities, including Kyiv and Odessa.CNN's Ben Wedeman reports at least three people died in the attacks, thousands more are struggling without power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dawn breaks and the strikes begin. Phone video captures it Russian cruise missile heading toward Kyiv. [16:30:03] Russia fired nearly 70 missiles, plus drones, at targets across Ukraine. Air defenses managed to take down most of them. But this Kyiv suburb did not escape unharmed. The mayor of Kyiv says all 60 missiles fired in the direction of the capital were successfully intercepted, but as a result of those interceptions, debris fell to the ground. In this location, massive destruction. A 14-year-old girl was injured, as well as her mother and a man nearby. Tetyana was at work. That girl, her granddaughter, called her, desperate for help. She was really scared and hysterics, Tetyana says. She cried, grandma, the house was hit, it's on fire. She told me, my mother is unconscious under the rubble. Not for the first time, the crews worked to clear the rubble of homes and lives shattered by war. Serhii lives just down the street. How is it possible that we do this to each other, he asks? I understand that this rocket didn't target this place, but how is it possible to shell peaceful people? In another part of Kyiv, 79-year-old Leonid is still in his bathrobe. He was jarred awake when missile debris hit next to his house, setting his son Alexander's car on fire, shattering windows and walls, ripping trees out by the roots. Yet he remains stoic. I was born in World War II, so I'm very calm about explosions, Leonid says. Today, I was only worried about my son. His son is fine.

So, we are looking. Unfortunately, the U.S. plan to test passengers two days before they depart China just will not work. If you are going to limit transmission, what we've learned is that you really have to test passengers with rapid (INAUDIBLE) basically as they're getting on board the airplane. If you're testing them two days before departure, you are missing many, many people who are infected. So, I think this is mostly performative. I think it's also probably intended to try and pressure the Chinese to be more cooperative and release more of their genomic surveillance data.
