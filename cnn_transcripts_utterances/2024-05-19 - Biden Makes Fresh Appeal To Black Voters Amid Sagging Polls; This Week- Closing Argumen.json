Now, behind the scenes, Biden and his team had been deliberating with prominent Black leaders as they craft his message for this morning speech, where it's expected highlight, triumph over adversity, and the lasting impact of peaceful protest. Now, Georgia provides a snapshot of Biden's challenges four years after he narrowly carry the state. In 2020, Biden won the state's Black voters by 77 percent and voters ages 18 to 29, by 13 percent. A new Georgia polling from this month shows how his margin with Black voters has shrunk to 46 percent and is actually losing those young voters by 18 percent according to that poll. Now, keenly aware of his challenges with this critical bloc of his coalition, Biden has spent the week speaking directly to Black voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I think one of the first things everyone's going to watch and is look back to that film. How have each of them changed since that debate four years ago. But obviously, the country's circumstances are entirely changed as well. And so how that gets incorporated into the debate, we know both campaigns agreed to debate without an audience in front of them this time. So that's also going to be a different dynamic in the space as well. But as we were talking about the last segment, you mentioned at the top here. Because this race has been so stable, I think these debates are seismic events in this election potentially that can actually be a destabilizing force in the race? AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Yes. And if you think back to that debate that you just showed that was at a time when the Trump campaign needed to shake things up, right? Biden was ahead. It felt like a race that was sort of stuck with Trump trying to get back up on top. Now, it's the opposite problem. Trump is the one who can sort of sit back and not be as aggressive.
