That city, according to Ukraine's air force, hit today by a Russian intercontinental ballistic missile.Let's go straight out live to Kyiv and CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who's standing by. Nick, I know there is very limited information coming out about this attack in the last few hours, but what more are you hearing about this ICBM and any damage it's caused?",

      "sentences": "All right. Our Nick Paton Walsh there reporting on this live from Kyiv this morning. Thank you, Nick. Let's turn to retired U.S. Army General Mark MacCarley, who is live this hour also from Kyiv. General McCarley, thank you so much for joining us. I'm sure you were listening to what Nick had to say there, knowing, of course, that we have limited information at this moment.What we can say at this juncture is that this is a new type of weapon that is being used in this war from Russia, that it is a much more powerful weapon than Russia has used previously. And by all accounts, though, as we know, it did not carry a nuclear payload. What is your reading of the significance of this moment, the message Russia may be sending? MAJ. GEN. MARK MACCARLEY (RET.), U.S. ARMY: I think your last three words, it is a message sent by Russia in response to Ukraine's utilization of our ATACMS and as well as Storm Shadow. But it's really important just to get into some of the technical aspects, if you would allow me, regarding what has now been labeled intercontinental ballistic missile versus the previous tactical missile systems. These ATACMS that we've discussed over the last couple of days on this station, and as well HIMARS, which were also used and are used by Ukraine, are essentially short range weapons. When you reach the classification of intercontinental ballistic missile, you're talking about a weapon system, a rocket, which has a range, most often in excess of 3,000 miles, it's most often much larger, it carries a significantly greater payload. And the very term the acronym ICBM is incredibly intimidating because it suggests since those countries who are nuclear armed, use ICBMs for the most part for delivery of nuclear weapons, that somehow this is a statement from Russia, that Russia could move to that next ultimate step of the use of the existential nuclear weapon. But right now, we don't have, as was indicated by Nick, we don't have sufficient information. I'm not privy to intel, data sources, we don't have any satellite imagery at this point, with respect to battle damage that was done in Dnipro. All we know is a much bigger rocket that has not been used before has been deployed by the Russians and has caused fear.",

I mean, there seems to be a peculiar focus of it, the target here being Dnipro itself. I mean, Nick mentioned just now, that there were potential sort of industrial infrastructure damage in that city.Do you have any insight as to why Dnipro would have been the target here?",

It is sort of an intermediate statement, if in fact, we're kind of speculating on the reasons that the Russians chose to shoot at Dnipro. One, it is significant from a mercantile business perspective, both agriculture and industrial activity.And if you begin to do this, what's called escalatory analysis, you could say that Russia shot first at Dnipro, as a statement suggesting that if Ukraine does not back away from the use of, let's say, the newly provided ATACMS from the U.S. and the Storm Shadows from Britain, that Russia will use the same longer ranged intercontinental ballistic missile and hit Kyiv. And I can tell you personally that we heard the sirens early this morning, which corresponded to the launch. The sirens ultimately ended. But there was still a rush to the basements and to the concrete parking lots, because it just creates a tremendous amount of fear. And that's what the Russians wanted, fear amongst those who are living and surviving.",

      "sentences": "Once again, we're trying to analyze what is the effect, what's the benefit when this whole thing started, if you can say that there was an initiation, that initiation, both from British and especially from our President Biden, who came forth and said, now I release and give authority to the Ukrainians to use the ATACMS, we get another 190 mile range, which in and of itself is insignificant, although it allows Ukraine to penetrate Russia and to attack supply depots and troop formations.And I think this is consistent when Russia launches, it is a counterpoint. Again, it's a statement in response to. There's just one statement that I want to make, and that is that perhaps from a strategic perspective, when President Biden came forth and announced the utilization of ATACMS and the fact that he has now allowed President Zelenskyy and his Minister of Defense to use the ATACMS, you know, from a military strategy and tactical perspective, making that announcement before you take action, probably precipitated a lot of this. I'm not suggesting that any of us have a superior tactical ability. But if it just took place, and one day, three days ago, the Ukrainians launched the ATACMS and entered Russian airspace, it would have been a protest. But to embellish that attack with a statement about the enhanced capabilities of the ATACMS just sort of precipitated this escalation. And frankly, I don't know where it's going to stop. Is Ukraine going to suddenly stand up and President Zelenskyy say, I'm not going to use these anymore, we're too frightened? Or will Russia come to some sense of rationality and suggest we don't want to move there either, it's too dangerous? We just don't know.",

Stay safe, General, thank you.Now we are following developments out of northern Gaza, where one medical official says Israel launched deadly strikes overnight on the city of Beit Lahiya. A director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital says 65 bodies have been pulled from the rubble. He says doctors and medical staff are digging with their bare hands because there are no rescue teams and no ambulances to provide assistance. And he expects the death toll to rise. He's making a desperate request to international organizations to bring in much needed medical supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. has vetoed a U.N.

Video shows social media -- from social media shows large smoke plumes rising on Wednesday after the strikes. State media also says more than 50 people were injured and there was significant damage to buildings in the area. The strike would rank among the deadliest Israeli attacks in Syria in recent years. The IDF said it didn't comment or is not commenting on foreign reports. And in the coming hours, U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will be back on Capitol Hill, this time with Donald Trump's pick for the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. Sources tell CNN they'll be meeting with key Republican senators hoping to drum up support for Hegseth, one of several cabinet nominees facing a rocky reception from lawmakers. Vance was in similar meetings on Wednesday with Matt Gaetz, Trump's controversial pick for attorney general. His nomination is in limbo over sexual misconduct allegations and a looming House ethics report, one in which House Republicans have so far blocked from being released. Gaetz appeared unbothered by it all.

Potentially undercutting his ability to become the Attorney General of the United States and they argue that it should be released. Now, this is not over yet, because Democrats say that they plan to force a vote on the House floor, and that vote will have to occur under the rules of the House. It would have to happen within two legislative days, meaning that this could happen since we're running up to the Thanksgiving recess. It could be punted until after Thanksgiving, but the vote would have to happen in some form at least by that point when they return after the Thanksgiving holiday. The question will be if Democrats have the majority of the House to force a vote, to actually force this report to be released. That means they would have to ensure that at least three Republicans break ranks, join with them to move ahead on this issue.
