And, also, in touch with my extended family here, and girlfriend, and her family. And the ohana of 120 people who worked at my restaurant that I gathered at some point fairly early on was threatened. And then literally, within minutes, had gone. All of these things you're trying to sort of assimilate. And then immediately clock in - or click in to how to find out who is where, which is the appropriate -- not only the appropriate thing, it's still continuing, there are people missing. We were blessed in the restaurant that we didn't know where about 15 people were for quite a while. They, in this instance, were safe. As you know, many others -- it was not to be such a positive story. We're all in shock. And people are way more in shock than the person you're talking to now, being me.

I had no idea it was coming.So, I talked to the commissioner and people in the audience are complaining about the books. And I get an opportunity to explain how our book challenge process works. And -- and so I encouraged the audience, if they had problems, to use that process with the library. Following that, that same day, I get a call from a county commissioner concerned about a children's summer reading program that featured a magician. The complaint was that this magician was transgender. And in looking into it, we had no idea, but had no problem with that and planned to continue with the program. But the community, the same anti-library crowd that has been on the commissioners meeting, started really protesting and the magician had received some threats. She decided to cancel the program for her safety and the safety of the children. And in spite of that, the same group chose to picket in front of the library that day. Picket signs, don't trans our kids, or, your library Oks LGBTQ. So, that's how it all started was with that kind of drama at the library. We were all taken off guard by it. Later into the - a few months later into the year we started getting book challenges. And I - I did have a couple of these activists go to the sheriff's office to press charges against me for having obscene materials that would harm children. And so a special prosecutor was brought in to review the complaint, and it was found by this prosecutor that it was not prosecutable, so no charges were brought against me.",
