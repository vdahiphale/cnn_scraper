Violent demonstration, of course, erupted last week following the police shooting of a 17-year-old during a traffic stop. About 45,000 security forces are still deployed across the country. French President Emmanuel Macron is meeting with top officials today to discuss the next steps. I want to go to CNN's Nic Robertson. He joins us live from just outside Paris. And, Nic, I think the question is - I've watched throughout the course of the last couple of days is, does last night and kind of the easing of tensions, at least slightly, suggest that a turning point is coming?",

Three hundred and fifty-two fires reported. Last night, 871. The night before, 2,500. The night before that, 30. Nine hundred almost the night before that. So, this trajectory has been coming down.City halls, this is one of them, 99 of them have been attacked and vandalized. The interior minister today saying it's going to spend $22 million on replacing the CCTV cameras around the city halls. This city hall, protesters that attacked it couldn't get in over the weekend. Attacked the mayor's office. His wife was injured trying to escape with their two really young children. And the mayor's union in France has called for protests, demonstrations outside mayor's offices. Now, this is a small gathering here today. More protests or more gatherings like this have been called for to show support for the mayors. And that's really central to what the government's saying. They're saying, look, we're going to keep up with this heavy police presence, which seems to be a big part of keeping control of the situation. And we're appealing and saying, you're damaging your own communities. And it's interesting because just yesterday, Nahel, that young 17- year-old who was shot last week, killed by the police, his grandmother came out, made a very similar appeal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADIA, GRANDSON KILLED BY POLICE (through translator): I blame the policemen who killed my grandson. I'm the grandmother. I blame the policemen who killed my grandson. That's all I want. The police, they are here, fortunately. They are here and the people who are breaking things, I tell them, stop. Stop. They use Nahel's death as a pretext. Now they must stop.

You saw Reddit, a few weeks ago, said that they would start charging developers for some of that backend access. They got a lot of push back from their community. It seems like Elon Musk is trying to do something similar. But the difference, Audie, is that this is going to have a huge impact on the everyday user's experience with Twitter. You saw some people tweeting frustration yesterday - ironically tweeting frustration about Twitter -- that they weren't able to get severe weather updates, critical news and information because they were being limited to the number of posts that they were able to view. Now, Elon Musk has not said how long he's going to implement this temporary crackdown. But I do know that it's going to be frustrating for advertisers because they're reliant on heavy usage in order to fulfill their ad campaigns, make sure they have enough people watching and reading tweets in order to insert their ads between them.",

And that's because Twitter is really struggling with profitability right now.Now, to be honest, Twitter has always struggled with profitability, even before Elon Musk took over. But the difference is that they are not a publicly traded company. They do not need to be transparent about their finances, what money they're bringing in and what money they're spending. And so it seems like the company is just in this sort of chaotic spot where it's trying to stay afloat, but it's not necessarily doing it in the most transparent way. We keep getting reports, not also just about not paying bills, but they're still in litigation with former employees about paying out severances, et cetera. So, expect Twitter to continue to be in this sort of financial chaos until maybe they can turn the platform around. But I'm still skeptical, Audie.

And the thing that you keep hearing is that Twitter is still the most relevant public square for discourse. You have Meta, which is the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, that's trying to build out a rival. You have small budding rivals like Mastodon and Bluesky. But, at the end of the day, Twitter is still the biggest public square in the world. And so if Elon Musk can figure this out, there's definitely a product case to be made for it being relevant.
