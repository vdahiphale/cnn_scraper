In the strike today, the IDF spokesman, Rear Admiral Hagari, was asked specifically that question, just in the last few minutes actually, about whether or not they targeted the senior Hezbollah commander. And he said he wasn't going to respond to claims that have been made in foreign media. So that's not exactly a denial. And it certainly bears the hallmarks of Israel strikes in the past. And it was notable here that within a couple of hours of that becoming sort of current news, the killing of this commander, Hezbollah commander, six rockets were fired from Gaza towards the southern suburb of Tel Aviv, coming from two different origins of fire. They came from two different directions, which shows some command and control there. The last time rockets were fired towards Tel Aviv from Gaza was right at midnight, coming into the new year. It indicates that Hezbollah, whoever fired them, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, chooses a time and moment to fire. Did they choose this time and moment as their own minor without incident? No injuries here, reaction to show Hezbollah that they're in support of them. Because certainly, Hamas has been desperate for Hezbollah to do more to support their fight in the south. So the potential for escalation and for misreading for potentially for Israel to misread what's tolerable to Hezbollah for Hezbollah to misread Israel's calculations as well, that's what concerns everyone at the moment. Both sides seem to think that they're operating below the threshold of the other's escalated responds. But it's a concern. And Israel did say that, that strike by Hezbollah over the weekend did actually hit and damage using accurate and destructive rockets. Part of their air defense and air monetary -- air surveillance system in the north of -- in the north of Israel. They say that it's still working, but it's a concern for them.",

And this wasn't the first time that he was interrupted, but it was, you know, among the most public protests of his speech. And what he has said and what he said today is that he is working quietly behind the scenes to apply pressure on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scale back the intensity of the conflict in Gaza. And when you talk to officials here at the White House, they do say that they feel like they are having some effect on that front. But certainly it does underscore the challenges that President Biden will face over the coming year as he works to re-gather this coalition that fueled him to the White House in 2020. And part of that is also Black voters who -- the constituency that he was in South Carolina to speak to today. And really the fear among Biden's aides is not that these groups of voters will go ahead and vote for President Trump. It's that they will not vote at all. And what you hear President Biden doing is really trying to underscore the stakes of this election and really trying to convince people that this is about nothing less than the future of American democracy. He began that last week in Pennsylvania in Valley Forge with that very passionate speech marking the anniversary of January 6. What you heard him do today is really try and tailor that message around Black voters specifically trying to tell them that, you know, the January 6 and what President Trump was doing on January 6 was not simply just an insurrection attempt, but it was an attempt to deny them their votes, to disenfranchise them. And that, of course, is very resonant with this particular group of voters that he's trying to convince. You also heard him talk about, you know, not a racing history trying to acknowledge history and embrace history and certainly the hope is that that will convince these voters to vote for him again in November.",

(END VIDEO) PLEITGEN (voice-over): \"The Russians are constantly changing tactics trying to make their attacks more lethal, making air defense like a chess match,\" the commander tells me. \"They used to fly in a single trajectory,\" he says, \"but now there's zigzagging. A drone can fly then circle, hover, go down completely then rise about half a kilometer then fly sharply down. They are now very maneuverable and must be seen and destroyed.\" Now, another massive drone and missile attack killed and wounded scores in various areas of Ukraine. Russia used some of its deadliest and most advanced ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles, Kyiv says. Of the 51 missiles launched, they were able to intercept 18, the Air Force says because they simply don't have enough high-powered western surface-to-air batteries to cover the whole country. \"There were a lot of ballistic missiles today,\" the spokesman says. \"Such missiles may only be shot down by means such as Patriot systems that's why the result is such.\" The mobile air defense units celebrate every missile and drone they manage to hit while understanding the ones they cannot take down often cause catastrophic carnage. \"They are trying to hit our energy infrastructure and military infrastructure,\" the soldier says. \"But the most painful thing is when they're hitting civilians, houses, kindergartens. This is not in line with the customs of war and not in line with human morality. It is immoral.\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In 2016, Beckenbauer and three other German football officials became the focus of a criminal investigation related to their bid for the 2006 event, Swiss prosecutors alleging financial corruption, including fraud and money laundering. Beckenbauer and the other strenuously denied any wrongdoing. A trial would follow but proceedings having earlier been put on hold due to the global Coronavirus pandemic ended in 2020 without a verdict because the statute of limitations had expired, but it's as a superbly gifted and decorated player that Franz Beckenbauer will be best remembered, undeniably one of football's all-time greats.

And my understanding now is the Astrobotic team is trying to figure out what kind of science they may be able to salvage with the remaining propellant left. As you mentioned in your report, at first they had a great launch. They looked good, a good separation and then they had some anomaly where they were having difficulty pointing the solar rays at the sun. They got that solved, but then -- got their batteries charging, and then discovered this loss of propellant. So, it's really too bad. This was an ambitious mission with many years in the planning but this kind of thing happens when you launch new spacecraft sometimes.",

And so they were looking or watching this mission very carefully. I'm sure NASA is very concerned about this and they're going to be offering all the help they can. But, you know, this kind of thing, it's going to take months probably to figure out what happened and, you know, maybe even longer to affect the repairs for the next Lander that they're building. So, it's difficult to say at this point. It just depends on how serious of the issue is and how easy a fix can become up with. But it looks like they're getting some good preliminary data. That's the good news and hopefully they'll be able to salvage some kind of science out of this flight.",

I mean, we've last landed humans on the moon in 1972 with Apollo 17. Since that point, we have not sent any more robotic missions to the moon. We've focused on Mars and other places in our solar system and so with our plans with Artemis to go back to the moon with humans, part of that is NASA's, you mentioned the commercial lunar, you know, landing system program to where NASA's helping companies like Astrobotic to get back to the moon commercially. That's all part of this infrastructure that NASA wants to build to do sustainable exploration of the moon. Of course, we're not the only ones. China is very interested in the moon. China has launched several probes and landed rovers on the moon. India also had a successful landing not too long ago. Commercially, it hasn't been done yet, you know. Many companies have been trying to do this. Not an easy thing to do. We saw the Japanese, a commercial Japanese company fail to land softly in the summer, just this last summer and so, you know, NASA's helping some of these companies and I think they will be ultimately will be successful.",
