Shortly, we will see David Pecker, the man who ran the National Enquirer, back on the stand. This will be the meat of the cross-examination. After Pecker testified in vivid detail how he buried bad stories about Donald Trump, and in vivid detail about how Trump would keep asking about the Playboy playmate with whom he allegedly had an affair, and in vivid detail, a conversation that Trump had about Stormy Daniels with David Pecker.Now, remember, Trump is charged with falsifying business documents to hide hush money payments to Daniels. Today, we expect the defense to question Pecker's memory and also suggest that there was nothing unusual about the catch and kill arrangement he had with Trump. We could also see the next witness today. Will it be Stormy Daniels herself? And, really, any moment now, Trump could be found in contempt for violating the gag order. Let's get right to CNN's Katelyn Polantz for the latest on what we will see this morning. Katelyn?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, we don't know who the next witness will be, but we have more testimony from David Pecker first. There will be more questioning of him from Donald Trump's defense team, and then the prosecutors will get another shot to ask him a little bit more of their questions for him.But in his initial round of testimony, the prosecutors used him to lay out the full arc of the scheme and the motivation of Donald Trump to catch negative stories about him before the 2016 election and kill them, catch and kill. In this arc, we have learned quite a bit about Karen McDougal. That is the first woman that came to the National Enquirer with a story to tell about an alleged affair that Trump and his team denied. David Pecker testified that he had Michael Cohen in the loop. He had a conversation with Donald Trump about Karen McDougal's story, and then the National Enquirer, to the boss' pleasure, that's Trump, decided to pay for that story and bury it so it would not be published before the 2016 election. He then testified about another type of very similar situation with a different outcome, where Stormy Daniels came to the National Enquirer. Pecker looped in Michael Cohen, let them know, he's not going to be paying for that. The National Enquirer wouldn't be buying Stormy Daniels' story, and he testified that Michael Cohen told him that Donald Trump would be furious that the National Enquirer wasn't helping. Underlining all of this is David Pecker testifying over and over again that he clearly understood Trump had motivations to protect his campaign at that time, that their relationship shifted, that the way that they were buying stories and burying them shifted once Donald Trump became a presidential candidate, and that he understood at the National Enquirer as the former chairman of the company running that, that buying Karen McDougal's story could potentially be problematic for campaign finance reasons, a key point for the prosecutor's case.",

Jean Carroll defamation case, saying that he wants to take the stand, and at some points he did briefly. But for the most part, he normally says this and then backs off. And that's kind of what we're seeing happen here. His attorneys have repeatedly told him this might not be a good idea and especially in this case where you have this gag order in place.

He's expected to travel to Wisconsin first, and then to Michigan, of course, two very crucial battlegrounds.And it's interesting because we haven't really seen him campaign that much. So far, we have heard Donald Trump repeatedly criticized the judge, criticized this trial, for what he says is keeping him off the campaign trail. However, there are days that he has been able to travel Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. He is not in court or forced to be in New York, but he hasn't really used that opportunity too much to campaign. He tried to do one rally last weekend in North Carolina, and they had to cancel it at the last minute because of weather. But otherwise, he hasn't been campaigning that much. So, I think, you know, we'll see whether these trips on Wednesday ends up being more of a regular thing for him. But as of now, he's really trying to maximize as much of the time on the trail as he can while also being in New York. Kate?",

Days into this and these wide sweeping protests, and it all really started here.Now, after some initial reports about the potential deadline between the negotiations that are happening between the leaders of the pro- Palestinian encampment and university officials, we heard a little bit more clarity from some of those students yesterday saying that that's really more of a timeline versus a deadline in these ongoing negotiations. And I should add negotiations that both sides maintain plugged (INAUDIBLE) actually being made. So, they have not reached a stalemate. Days into this, it's important to remind viewers what the objectives are here. When you hear from the students, they insisted divestment and also looking for amnesty for the students that have been punished for participating in some of these demonstrations. That's one of their key goals. The university really just wants this encampment dismantled, fearing that it could potentially interfere with activities on campus, especially as we get closer to commencement next month. In terms of what we've heard from some of those participating in these negotiations, we are told that they are focused and they are also quite friendly, according to one negotiators, and that's a new reporting from our colleague, Abby Washer, that suggested that really tells us a little bit more about what happened last night at the encampment, that students participating in that encampment were told that part of negotiations include a possible statement that may be issued by the university president, possibly addressing the events of last week. You recall, that's when Columbia actually reached out to the NYPD for helping clearing out an encampment. Now, CNN has reached out to Columbia University for more, but that really paints a little bit of a clearer picture in terms of where negotiations stand between both parties here and what may be in the way. But, again, some positive news that we heard from both sides here saying that they are making progress, but in the lessons in terms of what we've actually heard from the university, they are very clear in saying we have our objectives and they have theirs. And as we heard from the University, Sara, they also said that the president of the university is certainly hopeful these negotiations are successful. At the same time, they are also preparing to consider other options in restoring calm. Now, finally, I should mention, we've been allowed on campus every day for a couple of hours since it is still technically restricted access. And while we're there, the situation has been very calm at that encampment. Sara?",
