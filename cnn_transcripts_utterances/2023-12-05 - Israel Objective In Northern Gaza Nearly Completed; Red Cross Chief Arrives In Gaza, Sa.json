The Israeli Defense Forces has confirmed a ratio of two Palestinian civilians killed for every Hamas militant death, describing it as tremendously positive for urban combat. The Israeli military reports war objectives in northern Gaza and nearly completed. The defense minister Yoav Gallant says the entire area including Gaza City, will soon be broken. And despite the U.S. and other countries urging Israel to conduct a more precise and accurate renewed offensive, U.N. says civilian casualties are rapidly increasing. New video appears to show an Israeli tank on one of the few north- south roads in Gaza erode used by those who have had to flee their homes for relative safety in the South. Here's the Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Today fighter jets struck across the Gaza strip.

Now the Israeli military says an investigation into specifics will get ahead before the end of the war. Under investigation, at least partly, will be Israel's decision to move reinforcement troops from the Gaza border to the West Bank in the days before the surprise assault. Israel's Channel 11 reported Sunday that more than 100 reinforcement combat troops were relocated two days before, October 5th, to coincide with the Jewish high holidays. New research shows some financial traders may have actually cashed-in on October 7th. A report titled, \"Trading on Terror\", law professors from Columbia and New York University say they found a significant and unusual spike in short selling a bet against Israeli companies in the major popular funding to Israeli companies. That also happened October 5th two days before the surprise attack. Researchers though stressed these findings are preliminary and say, as of yet, they are not able to link specific traders to the actual deals. Israel is also demanding that the world pay attention and condemn what it calls systematic gender-based violence by Hamas. Authorities say Hamas militants committed brutal assault against women and girls on that day. Hamas denies the allegations saying they are unfounded lies but Israel is (INAUDIBLE) possible war crimes, using witness testimony and forensics to build their case. CNN's Jake Tapper has the story. And a warning: his report contains extremely graphic descriptions of rape and sexual violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
