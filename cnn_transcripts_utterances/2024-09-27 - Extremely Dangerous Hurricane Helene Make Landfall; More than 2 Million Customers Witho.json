It is Friday, September the 27th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in the Florida Big Bend region where Hurricane Helene has made landfall overnight, sweeping across the coast as an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 miles per hour. It's now weakened but continues to unleash life-threatening storm surge, flooding rains and destructive winds across the southeast. Helene has knocked out power to more than 2 million homes and businesses in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. One Florida sheriff says they're fearing the worst when the sun comes up.And Tallahassee's mayor says his city has never seen a storm like it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN E. DAILEY, MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA: None of us have experienced a Category 4 hurricane this close to Tallahassee. This is a historic storm for us. Right now, everyone stay safe, shelter in place, stay home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So you look at southwest Florida, you look at the Tampa Bay area, you're seeing really significant amounts of surge. There's going to be streets that are that are flooded and will continue to flood all up and down the west coast of Florida. So it's hazardous conditions right now.

      "sentences": "Max, good morning. The surge was a massive conversation for so many communities across the state of Florida. Here in Tallahassee, also a big conversation was also how damaging the wind was going to be.We were expecting earlier today a direct hit possibly here in Tallahassee. Wind speeds up to 110 miles per hour and the damage we could see because of that. I can tell you, though, Max, we haven't seen any extensive damage so far. So a lot of people waking up this morning here in Tallahassee are very thankful that that trajectory shifted a little bit more eastward. And Tallahassee was able to stay a little west from the eye wall of Helene. So not seeing many downed trees or power lines here. But, again, this is just one county. Many other counties are reporting early assessments of damage. We know in Suwannee County, you mentioned earlier, sheriff's office there is hoping that they don't see too much damage when the sun does come out. They're already asking for people and folks to prepare for what could be extensive damage. We know that they've already reported trees that have fallen on top of homes. Also extensive damage to people's property in other counties. In Sarasota County, for example, there are some pieces of land, some islands that are no longer accessible because the waters have risen so much. Bridges are no longer accessible to many emergency crews. People are going to have to wait for that water to recede. Sarasota's mayor says that this, she believes, is the worst storm that the city has seen in more than a century. So, again, a lot of these communities are going to be waking up to a lot of destruction and devastation. And all this is what we're talking about as Helene continues making its way northward. And, Max, here where we are in Tallahassee, many students with university campuses also were sheltering in place. We know that they sheltered in place in a conference center specifically here at Florida State University that they said was prepared to handle and withstand these hurricane force winds. Across Leon County where we are, more than 1,700 people sheltered here as well. So, Tallahassee, it is good news, but we are waiting to see those images this morning in other areas.",

That figure is according to Power Outage U.S., an organization that collects live data from the utilities. A local news station caught the moment the power went out in a neighborhood in northern Florida. Residents in southern Georgia are being asked to shelter in place as trees and power lines are down from Hurricane Helene. Georgia is taking the brunt of the storm now that its center is out of Florida. Forecasters say Helene sustained winds are down to 80 miles, but they say dangerous winds, rain, flooding and tornadoes could still cause plenty of damage. The storm's already blamed for two deaths in Georgia and one in Florida. We're joined now on the phone by Bill McIntosh, the mayor of Moultrie, Georgia. The town is located about 40 miles, or 64 kilometers, from Florida's border. And as Ivan was describing, you don't quite know where the eye of this storm is going to end up. How are you doing where you are? WILLIAM M. MCINTOSH, MOULTRIE, GEORGIA MAYOR (via phone): We're settled down now. The storm has passed us and we had prepared very well for a big storm. And fortunately, I know there's damage in a lot of different places, but we have about a thousand people in our community without power. Limbs are down and some trees, some trees and streets are blocked. But fortunately, we seem to have missed the big blow that we were expecting, that we were preparing for. So we feel like we've been very fortunate.",

So we feel like we've been very blessed that we were prepared, but we didn't have what we thought we were going to get. So still a little gusty here and raining. We had six inches of rainlast night. And the problem is that we are extremely agricultural. That's the backbone of our economy. And Wednesday night, we had six inches of rain, which put, you know, the trees, tremendous pine trees in our area. And that's what we were really afraid of, is that the roots of these trees were soaked and we were going to have a lot of downed trees. But it doesn't look like that happened. But it is the harvest season. It is a time for that -- we depend on cotton, peanuts, things like that. And we were -- the farmers were really going to be devastated.

It roared ashore a few hours ago in Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 storm with winds estimated at 140 mph. Helene has since weakened to a Category 1 as it barrels north through Georgia but remains dangerous and life- threatening.Officials were concerned the storm surge could push water 20 miles from the coast due to Helene's massive size and powerful winds. Water levels have reached record-breaking levels in areas that are not even close to the storm's so-called eyewall. And the National Hurricane Center is warning people not to go outside when they're inside the eyewall and it depends -- well it becomes relatively calm in the eyewall and it can be deceptive. They say dangerous winds will increase very quickly once the eye passes. Chris Gloninger is a meteorologist and climate scientist and he's in New York for Climate Week.

The Gulf of Mexico is warm, not just the surface, but all the way down to the ocean floor. That's called the ocean heat content.And typically, storms turn the ocean into a washing machine and the cold air mixes up to the surface. It weakens the hurricane before it makes landfall, but this just isn't happening anymore. Because of climate change, those ocean water temperatures are warm all the way down to the ocean floor. So these storms intensify right up until landfall and they maintain at least hurricane status well inland. So this is our new normal. The Gulf of Mexico, the warmth that we're currently seeing 300 times more likely because of climate change, and that is using attribution science. And for every one degree of warming we see, Max, the atmosphere holds 7 percent more moisture. It manifests in 30 inches of rain when you have a storm come ashore. It was moving fast, but then it stalls out across Tennessee.",

So to your point, it doesn't have to do at that point with hurricane intensity. Just an atmosphere that's a lot warmer, holds a lot more moisture, and it comes out in the form of very heavy rain.So again, another sign of a changing climate is that we have these storms, not even that are very strong, but produce a whole lot of water. FOSTER: And just take us through this warning that they put out to people who find themselves in the eye of the storm, because people who haven't experienced this would assume it would be pretty frightening. It's actually not at all, is it? That's probably the calmest place you can be. We still need to stay indoors.",

But when you are on the back side of the eye, it goes from zero to 60 within seconds.You don't have that buildup, and that is why, Max, it is incredibly dangerous to venture outside during that brief lull, that intermission in between the two acts, so to speak.",

We know there have been massive amounts of cancellations at the airport. So it seems like people are staying inside. But as you know, as we call this 7 a.m. hour when first light sort of pops up, that's where people sort of venture out normally. Hopefully, they will heed the warning to stay inside because that's when the heavy parts of wind is expected to be in this area. You add the heavy wind plus all these large trees and the saturated ground, that's when the issues could start. So hopefully, we'll move through this time period without having massive amount of power outages. Looking at the power company, they say they are ready to stand up crews to go out and take care of the trees and to get things back up and running. But obviously, they wait till almost first daylight before putting their crews in danger that way.
