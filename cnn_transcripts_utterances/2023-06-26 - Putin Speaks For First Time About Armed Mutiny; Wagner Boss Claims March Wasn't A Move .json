Prigozhin's whereabouts are unknown at this hour, adding to the uncertainty about the fallout from the revolt and what might happened next. And here in Washington, President Joe Biden says the United States and the west has nothing to do with the Wagner rebellion. Now, CNN now learning that the U.S. had detailed intelligence on the plans for the mutiny but kept it secret from most of its allies. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in The Situation Room. We are following fast-moving development in the aftermath of the armed mutiny that posed a serious and surprising threat to Vladimir Putin's regime. Putin going public just a short time ago blasting the rebels as traitors as he attempted to show Russia and the world that he is still in control. CNN's Ben Wedeman has been covering it all and what it could mean for the war in Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin even said today said, good day, and then he corrected himself and said good evening.So, it was clear that they were meeting today. And it was to show the Russian public and it was to show the world, really, that he couldn't be pressured by Yevgeny Prigozhin to change leadership of the military, to change the defense minister, and as well as Valery Gerasimov, who was overseeing the war. No one can argue that they've done a good job in doing this. But, as you know, this is a president who values dedication and loyalty above all else.

You can see it there, reportedly a Russian military plane that was taken down by Wagner forces over the weekend. So, Yevgeny Prigozhin does appear to have killed Russian troops. General, do you see a world in which Putin simply lets Prigozhin go live in exile in Belarus?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't, Alex. And what we're talking about, we have the film of the one aircraft. Open source intelligence says there were somewhere between six and eight with multiple pilots being killed. That's an air attack by Mr. Prigozhin's Wagner Group against the Russian Air Force because they had air defense equipment in that march with them. But in addition to that, there have been multiple occasions where the Wagner Group has engaged ground forces of the Russian force. [18:10:02] So, we have a combination of this private military company engaging the Russians in both Ukraine and in Russia. And it is really just -- as I've said before, these folks are criminal thugs and, in some cases, interspersed with some military capabilities. But we're going to see more of this. I'm not sure Prigozhin is done. But it's fascinating to me how in that six-minute speech that Mr. Putin gave, that he went back and forth between the heroes of the Wagner Group while at the same time not condemning the leader of the Wagner group, who he condemned the other day during the whole campaign. So, there's just so much that is typically Russian in the way this approaches. And if I may add one more thing, you mentioned Shoigu before. Shoigu is martinet. He is not a military leader. He is not well liked by most of the generals in the Russian military. So, the combination of most of the generals disliking him and Prigozhin absolutely detesting him is going to have -- is going to force Putin into some tough decisions.",

But is it a different situation here with Prigozhin, who has done so much fighting in Ukraine and elsewhere, and we then saw him cheered on the streets of Rostov?COL. MATT DIMMICK (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE: Yes, it's really a unique situation with Prigozhin. He's unique in the band of people that Putin has labeled as a traitor. Usually, if Putin labels you as a traitor, that's it, you pretty much have a death sentence if Putin can get his hands on you or if you're within the reach of his security services. Prigozhin is a little bit more complicated figure because he's got a ton of resources that actually help the Russian government in many places and many continents, in the Middle East and Africa and otherwise. So, I think Putin has to be a little bit careful in how he deals with Prigozhin because, as he saw when Prigozhin was somewhat welcomed with open arms there in Rostov and in Voronezh, he's dealing with someone that's got a little bit of popular groundswell support. So, he can't mishandle it but he certainly is not afraid of taking on Prigozhin. And if he needs to snip Prigozhin in the bud, he'll do it and reap the consequences later.",

But this intelligence was extremely detailed, and it was very closely held, we're told. It was only shared with a number of very high level senior U.S. officials, as well as the gang of eight, members of Congress who are briefed regularly on very sensitive information. And British officials, we are told, were also briefed. But, largely, U.S. allies were kept in the dark. And that has frustrated some NATO officials that we spoke to who say they really wish the U.S. had shared this intelligence with them. But, at the same time, sources told us that this would have compromised potentially very, very sensitive sources and methods and so they really wanted to keep it close-holed here. And the Ukrainians, we are told, were not told either before all of this played out because of fears that those plans might be intercepted in the conversations between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. So, there was a lot of concern about keeping this intelligence very closely held, but then, of course, once this all started to play out on Friday, the U.S. began scrambling to clue their allies in on this intelligence, and, importantly, advise them to stay quiet on the matter and not give Vladimir Putin an excuse to say that the U.S. or the west had anything to do with this, Alex.",

And then when Prigozhin started speaking out and criticizing both Putin as well as the Russian military, Putin took no steps, really, to discipline Prigozhin. And when they did, when they tried to finally bring Wagner into the Russian army, that's when Prigozhin decided to conduct this coup.

The fact that Prigozhin is bringing this not very well kept secret into the light does not have much impact on the day-to-day struggle of the Russian soldier fighting in the trenches for his own survival. And as far as how this plays out, you got Shoigu still sitting in his office in Moscow, and now Prigozhin is exiled off to Belarus or elsewhere. So, I imagine that Shoigu is probably -- his seat is safe for the near term, and then Prigozhin is going to pick up the pieces and figure out how to move on from here.",

We just don't know.But one way to regain power and respect and authority for Putin would be some better Russian performance on the battlefield in Ukraine. And I think that's where his highest risk. I might just note one thing. For some time now, people have been using the figure of 25,000 Wagner forces being in Russia and Ukraine. That's certainly what Prigozhin says. But the British press has been reporting yesterday and today that British intelligence says that total Wagner forces in country are about 8,000. Now, I don't know what the right figure but that's a pretty big difference. And the idea that 8,000 Wagner group forces, if that's the true number, were going to take Moscow, just adds to the delusional nature of what it looks like Prigozhin tried to do.",

They are sprawling. They sprawl in the Middle East and they sprawl over Africa. And I think it's important that we consider that today, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Wagner forces in Africa and presumably in the Middle East would continue in operation, maybe not under Prigozhin's control.
