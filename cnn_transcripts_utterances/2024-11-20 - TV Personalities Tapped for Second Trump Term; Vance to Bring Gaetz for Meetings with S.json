Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. This morning, it's increasingly clear it is Donald Trump's world, and we're just living in it. The most powerful rocket ever built, blasting off from Texas yesterday with its creator, Elon Musk, looking on with the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, wearing a hat, said 45 and 47, making the trip with his billionaire buddy to take in the launch just days after they both attended a UFC fight at Madison Square Garden, where the winner did Trump's signature dance after the knockout. All of this as President Biden prepares to step off the world stage. Here he was in Brazil earlier this week, the first sitting president to visit the Amazon, seeming to wander into the jungle. He missed this group photo of the G-20 leaders, apparently due to a scheduling conflict.
