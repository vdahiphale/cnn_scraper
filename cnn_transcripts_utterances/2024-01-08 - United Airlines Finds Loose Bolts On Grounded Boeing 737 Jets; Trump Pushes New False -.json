      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextThe breaking news, United Airlines says inspectors have found loose bolts on more Boeing airplane doors, the same type of plane that had the midair disaster with the door blowing out on that Alaska Airlines plane. And Donald Trump provides another birther conspiracy, this time he's bringing it up against Nikki Haley, as Michelle Obama is sounding her loudest alarm yet about another Trump presidency. And tonight, an OUTFRONT investigation. We follow the fastest growing group of migrants crossing illegally over the southern border. This group is from China. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with breaking news. United Airlines revealing that inspectors have found loose bolts on more play indoors plugs. It's really sobering, right, just to hear that. It comes just days after terrifying incidents that you're looking at here on that Alaska Airlines flight. The door plug blown out of the Boeing 737 that took off from Portland, Oregon, with 177 people on board, left that gaping hole in the plane, they were flying right that moment that you're looking at an altitude of 16,000 feet. The new statement from United tonight says we have had instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug. For, example bolts that needed additional tightening. Now, let's just show you some images of the door plug itself. That's where it was ripped on the plane on Friday night. You can see the size there. It's about the size of a refrigerator. The NTSB now saying the plane is actually restricted from flying long routes over the ocean the time this happened. Obviously, this didn't happen over the ocean, but it had been restricted from the sorts of, flights because of a warning flight from pressurization had come on three times in recent weeks, which had led them to think, well, then you can't fly over water, in case you need to land quickly. But thank goodness for that, they were following that, because they did land quickly and everyone was alive. Additional maintenance was requested but it was not completed before Friday's incident. Now, Boeing shares plummeted today, nearly $13 billion were wiped out from Boeing shares today. I mean, this is hugely significant. Boeing, right, a stalwart of the Dow Jones industrial average, a black eye for Boeing does impact all of America. It is the largest exporter for the entire United States, it is the largest commercial aircraft manufacturer in the world. It is a brand, and it's airplanes stand for American greatness around the world. And now, you've got this, on top of other disasters, you know of course evolving those best-selling MAX planes in recent years, including two terrible ones -- the fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. This now raises major questions about the company, its rigor. Which leads us to this \"Bloomberg\" headline that we saw today, China's Boeing alternative starts to look enticing. Not a headline that Boeing ever expected, or wanted to see. Mike Valerio is OUTFRONT live from Portland to begin our coverage. And, Mike, I mean, that terrifying discovery, right? Another airline, right, that had taken the planes out of service after this incident, sort of out of abundance of caution, and you often expect in these situations take it out of service, although there's no problem, now it's just too cautious. Now they're finding loose bolts on multiple door plugs? What more do you know.",

And they found loose bolts around the door plugs of these aircrafts.Now, these are ongoing activities and questions that are being asked from hangers across America to neighborhoods like here in Portland. We are about 20 minutes outside of the airport. And while we're here, just imagine Friday night from 16,000 feet, a door plug from the Alaska Airlines plane comes crashing down into that backyard, just over my left hand shoulder. That is where Bob Sauer lives. He's giving an impromptu news conference of sorts, a local science teacher, talking about the principles of physics behind the impulse and the freefall of this piece of the airliner.

So, now, United takes their MAXes out, we're just going to double check, abundance of caution and all of that business, I'll be back tomorrow being the implication, and then guess what? No. There are loose balls on earnest close number of planes inspected. When you hear that, does that kind of make you worried or no? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: It's kind of horrifying, Erin. I mean, this is the system builds to tighten the bolts, and put wires through them, and inspect them and sign off on them, and then seal things up and ship the aircraft. Something went very wrong along the way here apparently. When you look at that door, and you look at the hole in that aircraft, it does look as if it was just kind of removed.

I'm amazed at how quiet it was. It's just how unbelievable that is to try to imagine being there. But, of course, you are there. And now, you're hearing loose bolts found during these inspections on other Boeing MAX airplanes that are even with other airlines. They've been grounded now after your terrifying flight and your plane, of course, itself had had the warning light go out three times, and was not supposed to be flown along water routes because of that pressurization warning light. Gosh, what if it goes through your mind when you hear all of these new developments, Stephanie? STEPHANIE KING, PASSENGER ON ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT 1282: It's pretty concerning I'll be honest. When you go on a flight, you expect that everything is going to be okay. The plane has been assembled properly, everything is tightened up, the pilots are trained, the flight attendants are trained and you expect it to be flying. And to have something like this happen was so shocking, and I think that's most of the reason why it was so quiet after the event happened because nobody knew what to do or say. What do you say in that situation? (CROSSTALK) BURNETT: And, I can only imagine. I mean, you get on a plane like that, it had only flown, you know, for a few months. It's brand new.
