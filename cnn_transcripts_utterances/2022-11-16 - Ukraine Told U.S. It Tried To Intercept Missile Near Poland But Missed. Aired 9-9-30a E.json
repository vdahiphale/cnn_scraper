I can share with you this hour, the Ukrainian military has told the U.S. and allies that it attempted to intercept a Russian missile with its own air defenses. And that strike taking place within the same timeframe and near the location of that Poland missile strike that according to U.S. official speaking to me, it's not clear that this air defense missile is the same missile that struck Poland. But this information has informed and ongoing U.S assessment of that strike.A Pentagon spokesman referred CNN to these comments by President Biden last night quote, \"It is unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we'll see. We'll see.\" Clearly the U.S. and its allies still looking into this to confirm all details. CNN Senior International Correspondent, Matthew Chance is live from the site of that missile strike just across the border in Poland.

The Polish Prime Minister saying that the indication at the moment is that this was Ukrainian missile defense system fired by them to intercept a Russian missile. And it seems that the interception they say was successful, implying that there are fragments of both of the missiles, interceptor and the Russian missiles as well that have been recovered from the scene where as you mentioned, those two Polish citizens farmers, in fact, in his very small tight knit community were killed sort of out of the blue when these were hit by these, these rockets and this explosion. So that's the latest from the scene. You can see there's a bit of a flurry of excitement here with police still sealing off. There's a big military presence in the area as well, Jim, because as part of the precautions that the Polish military have taken, the government's taken is increasing the level of security around these border areas.

But it appears the most likely scenario is that this was either a Ukrainian air defense missile, or perhaps a combination of that and a Russian missile that it strike. But that kind of strike in the midst of a massive Russian barrage on Ukrainian territory, which was taking place during this time timeframe. Who bears responsibility? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.) FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS: Well, look, I mean, ultimately, Russia bears responsibility for this. They're the ones that shot the cruise missiles.

And I think that's why you saw less of that 2020 rhetoric that we have heard in the past.But if this speech is any indication of what his campaign is going to look like, it is going to be very divisive. And very dark. This was not your traditional campaign launch presidential speech, where you talk about hope and change and coming into the country and, and vibrancy. This was a very dark speech, it is the same rhetoric that he latched on to back in 2016. That largely carried him to the White House. Unclear if it would do that again. Now take a listen to just some of what he said last night. (BEGON VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground. This decline is not a fate we must accept. When given the choice boldly, clearly and directly, I believe the American people will overwhelmingly reject the left's platform of national ruin. And they will embrace our platform of national greatness and glory to America.
