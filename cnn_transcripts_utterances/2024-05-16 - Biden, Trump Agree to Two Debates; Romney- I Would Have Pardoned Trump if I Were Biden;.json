This is not a visit just between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and to show off this no-limits partnership between China and Russia. This is very much a way to snub the West and the United States, especially as China really tries to assert itself as this leader in a a new world order of sorts of way of viewing the world than the West. On this topic of Ukraine, which is of course, at center of so many of these observations, it's the fact that Xi Jinping and China has not condemned the war in Ukraine. It is saying that it's a neutral observer in all of this. In fact, Xi Jinping is calling for peace talks, or has suggested that at one point. In fact, I heard from one source here on the ground in mainland China who suggested that Xi Jinping very much would like to be a peace negotiator between Russia and Ukraine. So in many ways, this is also tilting to a beneficial relationship for China. With all of that said, Vladimir Putin did not travel alone. He brought top military advisors with him. He brought top security advisors with him. So this is going to be very much an involved conversation between all of these different parties. Not only about the war with Ukraine, but also the worldview and the conflict in Gaza. I should also point out, Kasie, of course, it is evening now here in China. It's Thursday.
