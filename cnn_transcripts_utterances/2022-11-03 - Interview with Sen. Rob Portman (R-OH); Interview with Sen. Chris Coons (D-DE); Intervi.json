And so, it has an outside impact on conversation in the United States because if something goes big on Twitter, you will see it on cable news that night. Kind of famously on the right, you see a lot of Fox News content come from random people on Twitter who will find something, will post a video, that will get raised up through a network of conservative influencers and could very well end up with within hours on a Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson. And so, Twitter, while by itself is not hugely influential, it is a really big deal in its ability to set the stage which is why we see continued efforts. Just this week, Twitter took down six campaigns by China and Russia, most of which were actually attacking Republicans. One of the campaigns was specifically attacking Marco Rubio. And the reason why that is effective is because it reached -- reaches the activist class, the media class, the journalist class, and politicians.

A check mark is supposed to say that the person who has the well-established real-life identity for this person that they have control their Twitter account. In full disclosure, I have a blue check mark. I've had it for a while. I did not pay for it. I got it based upon some of the work I did in security. And they've never really been transparent about who gets it. People have posted stories about texting friends inside of Twitter and they can get a blue check mark. So, I don't think it's some kind of -- there's -- this is not a temple that is being defiled by Musk. It's -- the blue check marks had a lot of problems in the past. Going forward, I think part of Musk's argument is, he probably experiences more spam than any other person on the platform. Just based upon his personality, his flirtation with cryptocurrencies. Anytime Musk posts anything, you will see a bunch of replies that are mostly cryptocurrency spam. And so, that totally warps his idea of what the normal use of the platform is.

There were people who voted not to certify certain states, who still believe the president -- that President Biden is rightfully and fairly elected. But they registered their concern about a particular state. And then there are others who not only voted against certification on January - - in the wee hours of, I guess, January 7th, but who continue to, this day, to press the narrative that the president was not fairly elected. And I think that those people makes it a lot harder to work with those.",

And one of their avenues for reaching out is saying that the Democrats are communists, basically. The Democrats are socialist or that the Democrats are opening the door to socialism. I mean, there have been campaign ads that basically come right out and call people, Democrats, you know, socialists. Do you think these messages are resonating? And if so, why?",

In fact, in the 2020 election, I cut and ran an adpushing back on that narrative that run in South Florida. Not even my district. But I felt so strongly that it was a weakness that the party was not addressing, that I went out and did it myself. It is resonating. And it's resonating not just with the Vietnamese community, in the Cuban community. But it's resonating with other Latin American communities who either flirted with communism or are impacted by the migration of people out of countries where that failed system is driving people's departure. And so, I think it strikes very close to home. Once you have fled socialism or communism, you don't want to have anything to do with it ever again. And if there's even a hint at that, I think, you know, people will pick the other choice. And because the Republicans narrative is going unanswered, really. by the Democratic party, it's been a potent hit on Democrats. I will also note that I think many in my party are afraid to talk about the kind of capitalist system that we would like to see. And for me, it has to be a Democratic capitalist system. Those are the two pillars that make this country so strong, our form of governance and our economic system. And what that means is proper guardrails on our, you know, economic actors so that there's equal opportunity for everyone and no one is exploited. But I think a lot of people in the Democratic Party are shy to admit that they support our capitalist economy.",

And I think people are horrified by this. A lot of people are horrified by this. But more than that, it does make you wonder whether people -- it gives people a sense of whether this kind of public service is worth it or not.
