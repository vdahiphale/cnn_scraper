We have a lot of breaking news happening right now in Israel, in Washington and potentially in Georgia. We're going to get to all of it right now.Happening right now in Georgia, jury selection is underway at the Fulton County Courthouse there in the racketeering case against former Trump attorney, Kenneth Chesebro. You see his mug shot there. We've also learned that he has been offered a plea deal, and we could learn any moment if he's going to take that deal. Just yesterday we learned on this show, another person charged alongside Trump and Chesebro, Sidney Powell, she pleaded guilty as part of another plea deal and in doing so agreed to testify in future trials which would mean testifying against Donald Trump. We've got a lot going on here and it's playing out in court as we speak. We've got CNN's Katelyn Polantz here in New York, Nick Valencia is outside court in Atlanta and Elie Honig joining us as well. Nick, let me start with you outside court, you broke the news about the plea deal being on the table, any details of what is in that offer and what is happening in court as we speak?",

This source with knowledge of these discussions didn't give me the details of this plea deal, only to tell me that Ken Chesebro was offered the deal by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office. And those discussions went well into the evening last night. The source familiar with these discussions tells me it was not clear whether or not Ken Chesebro would take the deal.But the likelihood of him cutting this deal with the district attorney's office did increase. After his codefendant, Sidney Powell, surprised everybody with her about face doing a complete 180 and pleading guilty herself to six misdemeanor counts. Ken Chesebro of course inextricably linked with the former president, a former attorney for the President and an architect of this so called fake electors scheme in 2020, to offer an alternate slate of electors to keep Trump's hope alive of contesting this election. Now, let's be clear about this. If Ken Chesebro does take this deal, it would be a huge monumental even win for Fani Willis, who would narrow her case against the former president who really is the key here for the district attorney's office.

Ken Chesebro and Sidney Powell, the codefendant of all of them, Powell and Chesebro was set to go to trial first, outside of the rest of the 17.And they're at the top of the pyramid as well. They are lawyers that were very close to Donald Trump that were connectors between Trump and others. Chesebro specifically had a lot of insight and was writing memos about the use of fake electors in battleground states. And so that's the area of this conspiracy, where he would have knowledge and a lot of focus. But it's important to see what happens with these two because it was a trial for just these two people separate from the rest of the 17. But it's all one case. And so --",

It is not at all uncommon to see people plead guilty on the eve of trial, as we may see here, in a few minutes. There's nothing like having a trial looming right in front of you to focus the mind both ways defendants get nervous, if they get convicted, they could go to prison, prosecutors see a way to avoid the trial and to get a conviction on the books.And in this case, as Katelyn pointed out, if they get a plea deal with Kenneth Chesebro, we're not going to have this early trial that was supposed to happen next week. It was supposed to be Sidney Powell and Ken Chesebro. Both if Chesebro pleads today, then they're both gone and there will not be an early trial, which is a good thing for the DA because then they don't have to put on their entire case and let Trump's team sit back and watch it. Of course, the biggest question to watch for if Chesebro does take a guilty plea, will it be a cooperation deal? Because not all guilty pleas require cooperation. There is such a thing as just a straight up guilty plea. You would make your guilt.",

There's a situation where sometimes you say, look, it'd be great to just plead them out, not have to try him, not have to worry about it. We don't need his testimony. There's another situation where you say, we really want his testimony. Therefore, we're not going to give him a deal unless he agrees to testify.

People won't remember much about his deal, kind of a smaller player, if you will, in the grand scheme of this racketeering case. And then you have Sidney Powell. And maybe then you have Ken Chesebro. Is this does have a domino effect?",

      "sentences": "It very much can. And it's very possible. We haven't heard from Sidney Powell directly or her lawyers about why she changed her mind. But, you know, they were starting to get evidence. And one of the things in the evidence that they were realizing and seeing is that another person, Scott Hall, he's a bail bondsman in Georgia, he's part of this conspiracy case as well.He was charged as one of the 19. He was the first defendant to take a plea deal and plead guilty agree to cooperate. And the area that he pled guilty in was about what happened in Coffee County, Georgia, this rural area where there was an attempt to breach voting systems and get voter data there. That also is what Sidney Powell is admitting to as part of her plea deal and the things that she's pleading guilty to, the specific charges. And so Hall was about Coffee County. I would imagine that would be something that would put pressure on Sidney Powell to think through, does she want to go to trial now that they have this cooperating witness? And then with Powell yesterday, of course, Ken Chesebro would think, do I want to go to trial now that Sidney Powell is cooperating witness, another lawyer that was in the White House that was around Trump in the Trump campaign after the election? And as Ken Chesebro think, do I want to go to trial by myself? It was going to be both he and Sidney Powell, now just him. And so that's probably something that he's very likely considering weighing on him this morning, as the jury selection is going to beginning. Does he want to be the only person to go to trial on these 2020 election massive conspiracy case against Donald Trump and others first? Or does he want to do something that could potentially reduce the prison time he faces? What choice does he have? There's a lot of factors going into it.",

You have one more person, one more insider, who will be telling his story to prosecutors and potentially testifying. And again, even if Chesebro had limited or no direct contact with Donald Trump, remember, this is charged as a broad racketeering conspiracy. So Chesebro will be able to give testimony that explains that conspiracy, what the overall goal was here to try to steal the election.On the other hand, if you're Donald Trump's attorney, and there is a guilty plea here, you're a little disappointed, because now you're not going to get to sit back and watch the early trial. Now you're not going to get to sit back, see all the government's witnesses, take notes and sort of adjust your own strategy accordingly. So Trump's team will have win and half lose if there's a guilty plea that comes through especially if it involves cooperation by Kenneth Chesebro.",

But they did confirm the following, 20 of the hostages are children under the age of 18 and 10 to 20 are older than 60 years old. It's not clear the exact number of hostages being held. But the IDF says as many as 200 people are missing. Now the update comes just hours after thousands of Israeli troops stay or started staging right now, are just outside of Gaza. They're staged just outside of Gaza. And they have been told that they will soon be seeing Gaza quote, from the inside.

I'm here in the town of Qiryat Shemona. There's just over 20,000 people here. And that order came through this morning.It's voluntary. They don't have to go if they don't want to. But we are seeing an uptick in the number of rockets being fired across the border from Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, into these areas in northern Israel. And of course, as the Israeli military prepares to go into Gaza, as we anticipate it will over the next couple of days perhaps, then the threat of rocket strike from Lebanon, from Hezbollah, from Syria as well is growing. And that's why this order to evacuate, this advice to evacuate has been issued buses are being sent people out. Also within the course of the day, there's been an incursion by armed individuals, armed gunman from Lebanese territory into Israel through a border fence. Three of those gunmen were killed, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. But there's another one person, another one gunman who is still at large somewhere in this area in northern Israel. And so earlier, we saw a big or the edge of a big security operation underway to try and find that person who is said to be armed in this part of northern Israel. And, of course, given the experience of Israelis last week, I mean, there's a particular sensitivity to the damage that could be done by just one gunman who's come in on this occasion from Lebanon.
