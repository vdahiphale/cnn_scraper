Republicans want a deal on immigration first before they agree to more aid to Ukraine. So, even as Zelenskyy is making this pitch, we don't expect many minds to be changed, the includes the chief negotiator on the issue of immigration, James Langford, who I just caught up with and asked him about this very issue, whether or not Zelenskyy, if he asked to punt on immigration, would they be amenable to moving forward on Ukraine, he said no.

Now, with this step, the push by House Republicans will gain strength and power. CNN's Lauren Fox tracking this, she's back with us.

The question, of course, are House Republicans going to be 100 percent unified behind this move to launch officially an impeachment inquiry.If you remember, this was announced earlier this fall by then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He announced that he was opening an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This is a step that essentially formalizes this by having a vote. In many ways, it doesn't change the underlying work that these three committees have been doing. But on the other hand, it does send a signal that Republicans are united behind this effort. I do want to distinguish, though, that House Republicans might be open to voting for an impeachment inquiry because in the minds of some of those who were skeptical before, they believe that this might be an effort and a way to get more information from the Biden administration, from the White House. And they want to continue working through and getting the information that they need for their inquiry. But on the other hand, you have a lot of Republicans who are still arguing that this is different than a vote to impeach Joe Biden. And many of those Republicans who are running in swing districts still say that they have to get more evidence, they have to understand a close tie between the president and that money that was coming from foreign governments. They want to see a direct tie that has not been established yet. And I think that that is a key difference here between an impeachment inquiry and a vote to impeach President Biden. Tomorrow, of course, will be that vote on the impeachment inquiry. But, Kate, again, the question is, at the end of this investigation, what do Republicans do then? Kate?",

The biggest issue with this impeachment inquiry is that after years of looking, including an intense investigation since Republicans took over the House of Representatives, there is no evidence of Joe Biden engaging in any financial or other impropriety that would give rise to an impeachment or even an impeachment inquiry.The Republicans are making claims about Biden's involvement in pressing for the ouster of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine. But, Sara, we looked at that in the first Trump impeachment. There's no there, there, and many authorities have said so. They're claiming payments were illegitimate, but they turn out to be loans or the president making payments for his son's truck. There simply is no connection of Joe Biden to any wrongdoing, therefore, no basis for an impeachment or even an inquiry.",

To me, it allows the inference that the House Republicans don't want people to see behind the curtain to have that full transparency because they've found no basis to open an impeachment inquiry.I mean, consider the contrast with 2019 when you had a whistleblower later proven to be correct, saying that Donald Trump had shaken down Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, by coincidence in Congress today, shaken him down by withholding almost $300 million desperately needed U.S. aid. There's nothing like that here. If you can open a government inquiry based on nothing, whatsoever, Sara, they can say we're going to open one into you or into me or into anyone. That is not the United States of America. You need some indication of wrongdoing, not complete goose eggs. That's all Republicans have here, and that's why they don't want transparency.",

So, we expect more of that exchange of documents today. However, in court paperwork that was filed yesterday, prosecutors hinted that they want to strike a deal. They asked for another status conference hearing in 30 days, saying that the hope is -- the goal, rather, is resolving this matter without the need for a trial. And, actually, George Santos hinted at this himself when he spoke to our local affiliate, WCBS. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY):  The plea is not off the table.

It needs to be done, otherwise Ukraine will be kneecapped. I tried to ask Chuck Schumer there, is that the message in the room? Does it need to be dealt with this month? Because right now, there is no indication that Congress will reach a deal on that separate issue of immigration that Republicans are assisting on first before Ukraine aid can be approved. There is expectation it will be punted into next year. What will happen if that situation does occur, which is widely expected in the Capitol? He just said that money needs to be approved quickly. What does quickly mean? That is a much different -- that's a debate, of course, in the Capitol because almost certainly this will wait.

Also with us is retired U.S. Lieutantn General Mark Hertling. Ambassador, let me just start with you. Volodymyr Zelenskyy at this point is actually a pretty seasoned politician. He's been through a lot. He knows that the aid to Ukraine right now is being held up by U.S. politics. Without judging what those U.S. politics are, it is U.S. politics holding up that aid. How does a foreign leader approach that? JOHN E. HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  I think Zelenskyy, more perhaps than any leader in a long, long time, has been enmeshed in U.S. politics for reasons having nothing to do with him and his country. It happened under President Trump. It's happening now under President Biden. So, he's pretty savvy about this. And I think he understands that while he desperately needs that aid, and American interests desperately need to send that aid, politics are in the way. This is unfortunate, but, sadly, it has to be dealt with. So, immigration has now become tied to Ukraine aid.",
