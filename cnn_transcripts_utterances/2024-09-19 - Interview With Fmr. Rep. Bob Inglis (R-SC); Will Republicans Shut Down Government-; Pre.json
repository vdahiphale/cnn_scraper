The booby-trapped devices detonated in coordinated explosions, killing at least 37 people and injuring thousands. That's according to Lebanon's health minister. Today, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, hinted at retaliation, warning -- quote -- \"The reckoning will come.\" The escalating violence leading to growing fears of a wider Middle East conflict amid new cross-border attacks.

That has been the focus of Israel's aerial campaign in Lebanon since the beginning of the war.And, certainly, we have witnessed an intensification of the cross- border clashes today, earlier today Hezbollah drones hitting targets in Northern Israel. Two soldiers have been -- two Israeli soldiers have been confirmed dead by the Israeli military. Several others were injured in that attack. And there's no doubt about it that we are at a moment of heightened tension in this region once again, as the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, saying today, for the second day in a row, that Israel is now entering a new phase of this war. Yesterday, he talked about the center of gravity of this war moving northwards, away from the Gaza Strip towards Israel's northern border as Israeli troops from the 98th Division were diverted away from the Gaza Strip and towards Israel's northern front. There's no question that the Israeli military and the government are focused on being able to return some 60,000 Israeli residents in Northern Israel who have been displaced from their homes, to get them back home. Doing so, of course, will require a much more intensive military campaign if a diplomatic solution cannot be achieved. And so far, we know that diplomacy has not succeeded as of yet to achieving some kind of a sustainable calm between Israel and Hezbollah. Instead, we see that things are ramping up, particularly after those attacks caused by exploding pagers and walkie-talkies over the last two days resulting in one of the deadliest periods for Hezbollah since this conflict began.",

Colonel, Israel's military says that it is striking Hezbollah targets and Lebanon, says plans for the northern arena have been approved. What do these movements, all of these movements, what do you make of them here in the last 24 hours? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Brianna, there are several different aspects to this. Right now, you're looking at some Israeli airstrikes that have occurred in Lebanon. And it shows that the Israelis are moving forward. They're ramping up in certain areas. You can see Israeli air force jets, among them, F-15s, coming in and not only dropping flares like you see here, but also dropping munitions in certain areas. And the fact that these things are happening indicates that what the Israelis are trying to do is, they're trying to make it very clear that, by moving forces from Gaza, from this area here, to the northern part of Israel right here, they're getting ready possibly to go into Southern Lebanon, which is, of course, Hezbollah's stronghold right now.",

And when you look at first hitting the enemy's command-and-control with the pagers and then the walkie-talkies and now perhaps softening up targets that might be used in a response, it all looks like they're preparing. You have seen some troop movement to the north, but we don't see Israeli troops massing on the border as if they're going to do some sort of 2006-style invasion yet. But the other thing we have seen is, the Israeli government made public a couple of plots by Iran to attempt to assassinate Israeli leaders. They have done that in just the past couple of days. Again, it's like they're creating a reason to go in, but Hassan Nasrallah in that speech also said, if any Israeli troops come in, we will take advantage of that. So, basically, each side seems to be goading the other one, but doesn't want to get the blame if all-out war on that border breaks out.",

But, on Telegram channels, Hezbollah has been posting name after name after photograph of people in its command-and-control who've been taken out. However, as we know from watching this for a while Lebanon, Hezbollah, Israel, they don't telegraph their punches beyond, we're going to do something at some point. They will take a few days to absorb this blow and then figure out what their response will be. Will it be something like firing a missile at a populated area in Israel, which Hezbollah could do, but has chosen not to do? It's chosen to hit military targets. That is one type of escalation it could choose. But, again, then that's escalation, and with that comes blame. And they have been wanting to do so far things that go below the radar. But let's just remember that all of this Israeli military response is slowly improving Benjamin Netanyahu's political standing in the country. So expect to see this Israeli friction continue.",

They were using a walkie-talkie like this one. This is an IC-V82. And, basically, what this is, is what we would in the military call an intrabase radio, or, in civilian terms, a walkie-talkie. And it's produced by a Japanese company called ICOM. They say that it was impossible to get into the supply chain at the factory itself, that part of the supply chain, so the manufacturing process was apparently not compromised, according to the company. However, what they must have been able to do on the Israeli side is get into the actual distribution point and alter the receivers and the transmitters here in order to actually go in and put that explosive in there, and then use that explosive to actually conduct the blast once it was triggered by a message or another trigger of that type. So what you're seeing here is the ability to go in and take out something that really is part of the communications network, part of the command-and-control link, and the very fact that they were able to do that means that everything that Hezbollah does when it comes to this kind of technology is at risk.",
