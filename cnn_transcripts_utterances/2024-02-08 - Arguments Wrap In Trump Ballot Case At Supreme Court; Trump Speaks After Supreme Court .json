You have millions of people that are out there wanting to vote and they happen to want to vote for me or the Republican Party or whatever you want to -- however you want to phrase it, but I'm the one running and we are leading in every poll. We're leading in the local polls and the state polls, and we're leading in the swing state polls, and we're leading very big in the national polls. So, it's been a very great honor. We love the country. I think the reason we have such big leads, frankly, is that they loved four years of us compared to the three years plus, the three years that they've gone with Biden. We have open borders. You have crime. Nobody has ever seen crime like this, what's happening. And now the crime is being committed much of it by the migrants that have come in illegally to our country. I was wondering about that. I said, you know, a lot of these people come out of jails. They come out of mental institutions. They come out of places that you don't want to know about. We don't even know where they come from. We don't know who they are, where they are. They're being dumped in from mental institutions, from prisons and jails. And many terrorists are coming into our country. We're going to be paying a big price. They have to stop it.

If it was an insurrection, which there were no guns, there were no anything except for the fact that they shot Ashli Babbitt, somebody from police force shot Ashli Babbitt. So unnecessary, so sad, so horrible. But there were no guns, there were no anything. But if you take a look at my words, right after, you take a look at my speech from the Rose Garden, which was very shortly after, or you take a look at my -- I'm only on truth now, but at that time, we were tweeting, and I was on Twitter -- if you take a look at those five or six tweets, you will see very beautiful, very heartwarming statements. Go home, the police are doing their job, et cetera, et cetera. Beautiful statements. If you see my statement made in the Rose Garden, I think you have to watch that, because today they said the words of Trump. Now, if you take a look at the words of Democrats over the last period of time, look at Schumer's statement about the Supreme Court, on the steps of the Supreme Court, he sounded like a mob boss. Take a look at any of them. Take a look at any -- we put together a tape of vicious, violent statements made by Democrats. Nobody brings that up. Take a look at Maxine Waters and the vicious statements that she made. I didn't do that. I said, peacefully and patriotically. The speech was called peacefully and patriotically. It's peacefully and patriotically. He said I said bad statement. It was the exact opposite.

He ignored how he also told them to fight like hell or they wouldn't have a country anymore that day or how long it took him to urge the rioters to go home that day, despite how he and his top aides were having many conversations about that with his own, you know, children pleading with him to put out statements, and yet he declined to do so for hours, Jake. Of course, we heard much more from Donald Trump as he was standing outside Mar-a-Lago, preparing to go to Nevada and weighing in on what happened today. For more on that, I want to bring in CNN's Daniel Dale. Daniel, obviously, there's several fact checks in the former president's comments, including just the one I heard about crime alone, saying that crime is up when actually in 2023, most crime in major categories was actually down.",

However they vote here in favor of Donald Trump, and they will, it will not be because they're in, in any way, endorsing the kinds of things he was just talking about there. You know, his role in the insurrection is not central to where they're headed.Where they're headed is kind of another reality check against the theoretical argument here that one state, as several justices said, one state could eventually keep a candidate off the ballot and it would affect every state. Justice Elena Kagan, a Democratic appointee, was, you know, with the right side of the bench on this. It would be extraordinary, she said. Chief Justice John Roberts stressed how consequential all this could be. And I have to say, Kaitlan, in terms of kind of the body language and how they operate up there, this is not one of their harder cases. I mean, I could just feel, once the rhythm got going, once Jonathan Mitchell stood up there and they were kind of soft on him compared to where they've been aggressively on any advocate who stands there, you could feel that the tide was already going in a certain direction. And then Jason Murray on behalf of the Colorado voters got so many questions about how impractical this was and how could it possibly be what the framers of the 14th Amendment wanted. And even Justice Jackson who's the one member of this bench who had some personal experience as a trial court judge handling January 6th defendants, said, she didn't -- she suggested that this provision of the 14th Amendment wouldn't cover Donald Trump. And as I say, it was kind of a reality check bringing people back to where we all were in the beginning on, you know, this theory that a state could keep a candidate off the ballot. Now, one thing I would say, Kaitlan, as much as I said that this is an easy case for John Roberts to get an easy majority, if not nine zip here, it will be a little bit in the writing. But they don't need to be unanimous in all their grounds. The key question is, did the Colorado Supreme Court err in some way? And they could say that 9 to 0 and then splinter in their rationale. And it might not be so consequential how they splinter because, inevitably, we are not going to see a case exactly like this, Kaitlan.",

You know, we've seen very experienced lawyers, great lawyers, in federal courtrooms sometimes saying things that otherwise they wouldn't if they weren't representing the former president appearing to play to an audience of one. Sometimes getting in contentious exchanges with judges. Kaitlan, today, we saw none of that. Even when a justice appeared a little skeptical of his argument, he was able to manage up on them on a way that didn't make it contentious at all. It was really interesting to note how he focused on the merits, he focused on the law, and remained respectful. A complete contrast to what we've seen in the two civil cases recently in New York, and it'll be interesting to see. Going forward, is this going to be the new approach that they take to legal proceedings? Let lawyers go in and do serious, right, a disciplined work inside the courtroom.

He should be nervous if the justices will take that appeal and if he would prevail. Here on ballot eligibility, as we saw, they seemed to signal, to suggest that they will likely rule in his favor.Immunity, even sources in and around his legal team will concede. It's not their strongest argument. The idea that the president has absolute immunity, that is not something that is likely to prevail at the highest court. They lost at the trial court, they lost at the district court, but really it's almost not as much about the merits as it is. Just the possibility that they might take it up, that's all they really need because the strategy is really about trying to delay that federal case until after the 2024 election. Because as you know, if Trump is reelected, he likely, through his attorney general, could make both of Jack Smith's, federal prosecutions, go away. So while he should feel really good about what happened today legally, succeeding likely on the merits through this approach, going forward, there is an enormous amount of legal peril that he is facing. And even though he's appointed a third of this court, it's unlikely they're going to be able to help him much.",

I'm guessing they might, but I don't think they've thought through the mechanics of how they're going to go forward. But the big question, I think, is going to be, how long does it take either the circuit and or the Supreme Court to get back to him on what they're going to do? Because every day is a gift for Trump and his legal team. Every day it takes them to decide that's one day closer to the November 2024 election.

I know that we went deep into the January 6 revisionism, but the other part of this that he said, so when he was talking about the 2020 election. Donald Trump, still privately and publicly, is often calling that election rigged, saying he won, but he did not do that today. He said, had the election results been different, I wish they'd been different. Clearly trying to moderate his language there on topic, that he still, again, publicly and privately, almost always doubles down on saying that there was election interference that the election was rigged. So that was really interesting to me to stand out. Now, I do want to be very clear because obviously we've said this many times since 2016, I do not in any way think this is Donald Trump pivoting or changing his rhetoric. I just think that today, this day, after the Supreme Court arguments, he did clearly soften the language that he has used in the past about a rigged election.",

And, you know, honestly, I'd be dying to know what you think about this, Steve. It seems like someone has gotten to him and said, that would be a really bad idea.
