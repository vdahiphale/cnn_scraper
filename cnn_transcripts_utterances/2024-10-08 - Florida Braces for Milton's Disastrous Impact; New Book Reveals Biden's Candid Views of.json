Look, this is where we are at the moment, but bear in mind the crucial fact here isMilton as it goes out across the Gulf of Mexico, because these are the warm waters, exceptionally warm waters, warm at the moment, and that is what will create a fuel as it goes into the atmosphere, rises into the hurricane and give the whole thing a considerable power and punch. So the meteorologists using pressure to measure the intensity. Typically, the lower the pressure, the more intense its biometric. Milton is the fourth most intense storm to form in the Atlantic. You can see those numbers. Only five Atlantic hurricanes have been stronger than Milton at the peak in terms of speed. It was also the wind speed and the strongest storm on the planet at any point of the year. And by the way, talking about how strong, it has already actually covered Hurricane Gilbert back in 1988, drove through the thing from Texas all the way down into Mexico. So the strength of these things, as you're going through them, is really phenomenal and deeply difficult. As you can see, a tropical cyclone has become more common in the Atlantic Basin over recent decades. 2020, we always have to be careful or we just seeing an anomaly. Well, we're not. 2020 this year is now heading towards being a record. We will see if it beats the previous. Isabel Rosales is in Tampa in Florida. Hi, good to see you. I mean, what can one say?

Coriolis force, of course. These really don't happen right at the equator because there's no spin. You get them away from the equator and this is what you get, 155- mile-per-hour storm, 250K as you've said, and it's still going to be a huge impact for the Florida west coast, whether this lands as a category two or a category three, or heaven forbid contains all of this energy because there's something right here, Richard. This is called the loop current. The water comes out of the Caribbean between Cuba and Cancun, and parks itself up here. Then kind of runs up toward New Orleans and then kind of loops back out toward Florida Keys. And that's the warmest water in the Caribbean. The warmest water in the Gulf of Mexico because it's coming from either farther south. There is so much energy in this water that we're going to get the hurricane to keep to be a hurricane itself all the way across the Florida Peninsula, even though it's going to run out of water. It's going to have so much momentum. It's going to have so much for wind speed. I've had so many people today asked me, where is it going to hit, and I know they're talking about the eye. But when you take a look at here, all the way from well north of where the other storms have been hitting all year, to all the way down to Fort Myers, this is all major hurricane damage. 110, 110 miles per hour or greater. And then all the way across to Daytona, and all the way across the Cape Canaveral where they launched the rockets, that's all hurricane force winds. Millions of people will be without power. But the true, true damage is going to come from a five-meter storm surge because the one that just came through with Helene was two meters and it did so much. This is going to be three meters on top of that. Nine feet on top of what came in just with Helene proper. So many people are going to be in the way. And I think the mayors of the cities that say you need to leave are not lying to you. I know there is some distrust in government, and all that.",
