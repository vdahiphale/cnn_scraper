I'm Omar Jimenez, in for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin in the Middle East where the region -- where the region is on a razor's edge waiting to see how and when Iran will retaliate against Israel, potentially the U.S. over the killing of senior Iranian military officials. Now, sources say the U.S. expects Iran to carry out a direct attack on Israel in the coming days. New today, Iranian authorities have seized a container ship -- container ship near the Strait of Hormuz. Now, the ship which Tehran links to Israel has been directed toward Iran. And overnight, Israel and Hezbollah exchange attacks across the border with Southern Lebanon. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem and Jennifer Hansler is in Washington. We've got a lot to keep an eye on here. Jeremy, I want to go to you first. How is Israel preparing for a possible attack here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, Israeli forces are certainly on high alert, anticipating a potential Iranian attack that could even come on Israeli soil. That has yet to be confirmed yet, but it will certainly determine the size and the scale of a potential Israeli response.So, what the Israeli military's top spokesman Daniel Hagari is saying today is that Iran will bear the consequences he says for choosing to escalate. Yesterday, we also heard from Israelis -- Israel's top generals, saying that Israeli forces are well prepared and ready to defend against any threat, in any scenario. We know that Israel has been trying to deter a potential attack even as they are preparing to respond to one as well. And that's being done mostly through messaging, that messaging about being prepared to respond to any attack. But also, the images that we saw yesterday of Israeli officials, including Israel's defense minister, and its top general, side by side with the head of CENTCOM, General Kurilla, trying to send a message that the United States will also be involved in cooperating in plotting out a potential response. And also, in defending against a potential Iranian attack. We know that the United States has moved additional assets into the region. And we also know that the U.S. is prepared to intercept any missiles that are fired towards Israel. We know that they have done so in the past. For example, when Iranian proxies fired on Israel from Yemen, as well as those Iranian proxies that are in Iraq. So, that is certainly a possibility. And we know, of course, that U.S.-Israeli cooperation is being put at the heart of potential Iranian response by both the United States and Israel.",

The secretary of state has called a number of counterparts over the past several days including China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, to tell them press Iran do not do this.

Really appreciate it.And now back here to the United States and the historic hush money trial, former President Donald Trump, which starts in just two days. If convicted on all 34 counts of falsifying business records, Trump could face up to 20 years in state prison. Now, his indictment stems from his alleged role in a scheme to silence salacious details about alleged affairs with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, before the 2016 election. Now, Trump has denied all of that. But with an unprecedented trial comes unprecedented security as well. The NYPD Secret Service and the New York court system are taking a multi layered approach to ensure all parties stay safe here. Meanwhile, the former president is spending his weekend on the campaign trail. Today, he's hosting events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. So, a lot to get to here. CNN's Mark Morales and Alayna Treene are covering all of the latest. Mark, I want to start with you. Look, Trump's trial in New York is expected to draw crowds of supporters and critics alike.

And what that means is that this area is going to be even more secure than it has been in the past.Now, what's changed between then and now is that the former president is now the presumptive nominee. And according to law enforcement officials that I've spoken to, that does two things, it raises the stakes, and it also increases the threat level. Now, a multiple things are going to be going on, on Monday, when the security package is put into place. You are going to have boots on the ground. Meaning it's going to be intense police presence, barricades, bomb sniffing dogs, drones, all the electronics that the -- that the NYPD and other federal law enforcement partners are known for will be here in the area. But in addition to that, it's also going to be intelligence. So, there's going to be this push to really make sure that threats that are being -- that are going to be made online over the Internet -- how legitimate are they? Are they lone wolves? Are they threats that don't have any teeth to them? Are they even disturbances like planned protests that are going to be in the area?

I mean, this is going to be a very difficult and challenging balancing act that the former president's campaign is going to have to juggle over the next several weeks.And you're right, the court has required him to be in trial every single day, throughout his criminal hush money case. And so, what we're going to see is he'll be in the courtroom. Mondays, Tuesdays, he'll have Wednesday off, and then, he'll also be required to be in the courtroom on Thursdays and Fridays. When I talked to his campaign, they said that they're going to really try to have them host campaign rallies on Wednesdays and on Saturdays, when he's not in court. But, of course, this is taking him off the campaign trail at a very critical part of his general election campaign. And we're also going to see the president, President Joe Biden, stomping all days of the week and going out there without any limitations. So, this is something that's really top of mind for his team. And I am in Pennsylvania today. And we're really going to see a preview of this juggling act play out this weekend. He's going to be coming to Pennsylvania first for a donor event, then, he'll come here to Knoxville for this political rally. Tonight, he'll go immediately to New York City, sleep there overnight, and then tomorrow, he's going to be prepped by his attorneys about court protocol. And so, that's we're going to see play out this week. Now, we did hear the former president himself addressed this yesterday during a press conference where he hinted that he may want to testify in his case. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I would testify. Absolutely. It's a scam. It's a scam. You know, jury selection is largely luck.

And then, he ultimately does not ended up doing so.So, we'll see whether or not he actually does take the stand in this trial. The other part, of course, excuse me. The other part of this, though, of course, is he mentioned jury selection, and this is something that his team is very much worried about. The former president himself has been frustrated that his trial is happening in New York City and wasn't moved to elsewhere. And so, we'll also see that play out this week when jury selection begins on Monday. Omar?",

Now Israel has vowed to retaliate over the killing of senior Iranian military officials early this month in Syria.

Fortunately, no injuries reported here, though there was some damage that was reported at a local -- locally owned Marina there but outside of that, no major damage. But it really made for some pretty dramatic pictures overnight, as you see some of those barges actually pinned up against the Emsworth Locks and Dam which is actually just north of Pittsburgh.
