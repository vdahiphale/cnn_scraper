A top pro-Russian official has suggested Russian troops will likely pull out of the strategic city but Ukrainian officials say they're not necessarily buying that, and they believe the statement could be an attempt to lure their forces into a trap.While that's happening as Ukraine faces widespread blackouts after waves of Russian strikes on its power system. President Zelenskyy says about four and a half million homes and businesses are now in the dark. But despite the difficulties the U.S. defense secretary is confident Ukraine can still retake Kherson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  On the issue of whether or not the Ukrainians can take the remaining territory on the west side of the Dnipro River in Kherson. I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that. Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe that they have the capability to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is one of, part of the regions that were illegally annexed a few weeks ago by President Putin, and of course, very strategically important as well, it's a corridor that connects Russian occupied Crimea to those other regions. So, the kremlin is not going to back down easily here. But it appears that Russia might be muddying the waters a little bit. We heard from a Russian backed official yesterday saying to state -- to Russian state media, rather, that most likely Russian troops would withdraw from the city of Kherson itself. Pulled back to the eastern part of the Kherson region. And we did see social media video that showed the Russian flag that had been flying over the main administrative building in Kherson taken down, but a Ukrainian official saying, yes, we've seen some troop movements. It appears there are less Russian checkpoints in the city, but they believe this is a trap that potentially Russian forces are trying to lure in Ukrainian troops.

They were given unfettered access, according to the IAEA to three separate sites among those names by Russia in these, as I said, very elaborate materials that they put out on this claim, including a mining and processing plant in the central part of Ukraine, a research institute, a nuclear research institute in Kyiv, and a machine building plant in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

But then Russia was using this entire story to sort of provide cover for its own potential radiological or nuclear attack. And I think even with these findings by the IAEA, that does not endthose fears. We know that western officials are watching Russia's nuclear posture very closely as yet they see no evidence that Russia is planning anything in this regard. But certainly, they are concerned, for example, about the situation around Kherson where Russia finds itself on the back foot there. Mixed signals coming out.

This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just days after Israel's fifth general election in less than four years, a far-right government is starting to take shape one that could mark divisive new era in Israeli politics. It could still take weeks to form that government after election results became official next week.But by all indications, Benjamin Netanyahu will serve an unprecedented sixth term as prime minister. That's after his Likud Party and its ultra-nationalist allies won a better than expected 64 seats in the Knesset. They only needed 61 to achieve a majority. But Netanyahu needed the support of the far-right fringe to make it happen and there are concerns about what its members will expect in return. The fiery leader of the Jewish Power Party has a history of inciting anti-Arab hatred and now he wants authority over the police. CNN's Hadas Gold has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Until recently, this man, Itamar Ben-Gvir was considered a fringe far-right activist settler lawyer. His signature white kippah almost always askew on his head. Now, a leader of the projected third largest block in the Israeli parliament set to be a key component of Benjamin Netanyahu's now likely comeback as prime minister. The 46-year-old has been a provocateur since his youth. Once a supporter of the Jewish Nationalist Kach Party deemed a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and ultimately outlawed by Israel. He was once filmed holding a hood emblem he claimed was from the car of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an architect of the Israeli Palestinian peace process vowing we got to his car and we'll get to him too. [03:35:026] A Jewish extremist assassinated Rabin three weeks later. Exempted from the military draft, he says he was denied for his political views, Ben-Gvir became a lawyer often representing Jewish extremist settlers and famously hung a portrait in his home of Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli doctor who massacred 29 Palestinians in a mosque in the West Bank in 1994 before being killed himself. Ben-Gvir later tweeted he would take the portrait down. In 2007, he told CNN the holiest most contested site in Jerusalem, third holiest site in Islam is for Jews only. ITAMAR BEN-GVIR, JEWISH POWER PARTY LEADER:  Temple Mount is for Israel, for the Jewish people, not for the Islamic people. They have Mecca, Medina, we have the Temple Mount. GOLD (voice-over):  That same year he was convicted for inciting anti- Arab racism and supporting terrorism. In 2020, his sights turned to politics winning a seat in the Knesset in 2021 on a platform that included annexing the West Bank, relaxing the Israeli military open fire policy against Palestinian rioters and pushed for the death penalty for terrorists. He spent his time in parliament attracting the spotlight. From stunts like pulling a gun during clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in east Jerusalem telling police to shoot Arabs who throw stones. To being forcibly removed from the floor of the Israeli parliament for calling a fellow member, the leader of the Arab Movement Party who is also an Israeli citizen, a terrorist, saying he didn't belong in Israel. Just last, year Netanyahu himself dismissed the idea of Ben-Gvir leading a government ministry saying, \"A minister, no, not in my government.\" But this, year his tune changed, asked again if Ben-Gvir would be a minister, he answered, \"Of course, he can be.\" (Inaudible) to be put in charge of the police as a Minister Ben-Gvir, that could affect Israel's relationship with its most important ally, the United States. NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  And we hope that all Israeli government officials will continue to share the values of an open, democratic society including tolerance and respect for all ends of a society particularly for minority groups.
