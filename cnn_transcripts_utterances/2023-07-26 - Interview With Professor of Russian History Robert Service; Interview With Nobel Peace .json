We discuss with former players Brandi Chastain and Lianne Sanderson. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London, where the British government is facing major criticism for overlooking the threat of Wagner, the Russian mercenary network. A parliamentary committee says the U.K.'s, quote, dismal lack of understanding about the group's work in Africa allowed it to flourish. But according to The Washington Post, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin himself, was so stunned by Wagner's march on Moscow last month that he froze with indecision for almost a day. The Kremlin spokesman strongly denies that. But it's a revelation that draws a sharp contrast with the image of strong macho leadership that Putin has always projected to the world. The war he launched on Ukraine has dented that image somewhat, and the Ukrainian counteroffensive is now making small but significant gains on the battlefield. My first guest tonight believes that Putin has brought all this damage upon himself. Robert Service is a historian and fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. His latest book on Russia, Blood on the Snow, will be published in the fall and he's joining me now from California. Welcome to the program, Professor Service. So, as we keep the microscope on the fallout from this failed coup, do you think that Putin is strengthened or weakened? Because on the surface of it, Prigozhin is exiled to Belarus, Wagner has been moved or integrated into the military, Prigozhin's enemies in the military are still running the show and Putin is still firmly installed in the Kremlin.",

He said to the world and to Russia, in particular, things are really going badly wrong in the Kremlin. He didn't mention Putin by name, but he did lead an armed unit, from Rostov in the south of Russia, up towards Moscow before he decided to surrender. So, this was a really big -- this was like one of the 18th century peasant revolts, except that the peasants who revolted always said that they were against the current leader. Prigozhin took a step back from that. And he must have had an inkling that there were elements in the Russian military who were on his side. He wouldn't have done this without that.",

He was being supplied with equipment and finance by the Kremlin itself. So, it's going to be difficult for Putin to unscramble all of this.

But Prigozhin has challenged Putin's rationale, has used the word war instead of whatever the Kremlin says. And not only that, he actually reminded publicly that President Zelenskyy was elected not to challenge Putin, but to actually try to bring the war to an end, try to make better relations between Ukraine and Russia.

China has shown no serious interest in helping Russia in the way that Russia needs at the moment. I mean, just look at that Silk Road that is being built all across old Soviet Central Asia. The Chinese are moving into what Russia thinks of as its own sphere of influence in a big way and there's nothing that Russia can do about it.

In other words, another million more are at risk, according to the U.N.

What we are witnessing in Sudan is not just a humanitarian crisis, it's a crisis of humanity.

I'll confess, Michel, to sort of arrogantly thinking I knew how bad another term could be, because I had witnessed the policies that were thwarted in the first term. Some of the really ugly things, illegal things that the president wanted to do that were thought. And so based on that, I thought I knew, you know, pretty clearly what they would want to do in a second term. But after probably close to 100 conversations with ex-Trump officials, it was a much more grim portrait than I had expected. Because quite frankly, I didn't realize in how many other departments and agencies, there had been this corpus of very ugly rejected policies that we would expect to make a return if Trump himself does return.",

And most of my time in theadministration was working on counterterrorism and intelligence. But I, of course, was exposed to Trump's immigration fixation, because it's all he ever wanted to talk to the department about. And there were a lot of descriptions about Trump wanting to use the nation's counterterrorism apparatus against unarmed innocent migrants. And that's really concerning to me. But Trump had learned in the first term that post-911, we got really, really good at counterterrorism. What do I mean by that? Watch listing bad guys, going after them with lethal force and tracking them. And he wanted to use those tools against migrants. And so I had, you know, people telling me about how in a second term, Trump would designate migrant groups as foreign terrorist organizations. He would deploy the military and give them authorization to use lethal force, really shocking things that again, I have to be clear, are not legal for a president of the United States to do. But even beyond the border, a number of officials who were there till the end of the administration, long after I had left, said that Trump had an interest in deploying DHS counterterrorism forces into U.S. cities, especially democratic cities to exert control. We saw a sample of that in Portland, during the riots in Portland. But I had one official tell me in a second term, Donald Trump would deploy DHS forces to the polls during the election to try to intimidate voters. In other words, to scare Democratic voters away from the polls. And we've seen a sample of that with so-called poll watchers in places like Arizona showing up with weapons.",

In other words, if their parents are here in the United States, and they were undocumented, to punish those families by kicking their kids out of public school. Well, how could that possibly happen? You ask? Well, Venable explained to me that all the Department of Education would do was say to public schools that they would no longer receive funding from the Department of Education, if they were teaching undocumented immigrants. And a lot of public schools don't have the ability to go without the federal funding that they need. So this would be a way to coerce them to kick these innocent children out of school. In fact, Venable said, the White House was so serious about this, he called it quote, the cockroach that wouldn't die. And that they resisted the policy. But in his view and a second term, they would implement that policy. And another one was on LGBTQ issues. You know, we've seen in Florida how Ron DeSantis and his administration implemented what's the -- what's been referred to as the don't say gay law, forbidding teachers from talking about same sex couples, even if a student's parents are saying sex couple. Department of Education officials explained to me that that policy would be federalized on a nationwide scale using the same tool, is that school districts would be threatened that they won't get federal funds if they don't implement don't say gay policies. That's something that a second Trump administration could do without consulting Congress at all. And it's a really chilling implementation of the culture wars, in my view.",

And I ended up on election night 2020 in a safe house under armed guard with a pistol under my pillow. And grappling quite frankly, Michel, with addiction issues. The pressure was so intense from the threats across the political spectrum, frankly, that I ended up doing something I never thought I'd do is I took to coping by drinking and in excess to the point that it almost cost me my life.

If we ignore our democratic guardrails, we risk self-destruction.

So I'm afraid that window has passed. But what we still have the ability to do in the political draft that is arrest Donald Trump's rise in the primaries. I don't literally mean arrest him. That is maybe something the Justice Department will end up doing, yet again, with another indictment, but separately, to stop his rise in the primaries. And I am encouraged to see some Republicans starting to speak up very vocally, Chris Christie, Will Hurd, Asa Hutchinson. It remains to be seen whether their efforts to expose who Donald Trump really is will impact Republican voters. But in the long run, I think all of this rests on everyday Americans. Because I say in the book, what we've figured out is that the price of dissent in the United States has become very high. And surveys show that your average Americans, the moderate majority of Americans are self- censoring their political views. In other words, they're not speaking out against the MAGA movement or Trump because they're scared of being attacked in their communities by more extreme people with more extreme political views. We've got to make it easier to dissent, easier for us to share our opinions and our concern. And the only way to do that, the only way to lower the price of dissent is to increase the supply. We need more people coming forward, and we've all experienced it. You don't want to upset the MAGA guy at the picnic. But if you engage in that conversation, you actually might change someone's mind.

Do you feel that the Women's World Cup is getting, you know, all the exposure, all the glory that it deserves given the sky high, you know, viewing figures and the tickets sold, Lianne? LIANNE SANDERSON, FORMER WOMEN'S ENGLISH FOOTBALL PLAYER: I would say yes or no. I mean, I've lived in America for 12 years. And Brandi is obviously iconic. They celebrate and she was from his national team, and those types of things. But I think in America, when I first moved there, the players are embraced. They're like rock stars, you know, Alex Morgan's big thing is bigger than the Statue of Liberty in New York. And that's exactly what we need, the exposure. So I think in England, it can still continue to grow. And we can learn a lot from the way the Americans expose the players and the marketability. And I think it's definitely getting better.",

It's all about being able to be comfortable with who you are. But I think with my Lionesses team, I'm happy now that they've stuck together. Because I think when I played there, I spoke out and it was almost seen as taboo or you're like a troublemaker for speaking out. But I just wanted it for the greater good. And I've said that many times before. And I think living in America, I finally got to a place where I felt like I was enabled, embraced to be myself, and the individuality and that's why they win all the time.
