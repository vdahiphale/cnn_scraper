And these previous attempts have included either a path to citizenship or, in some cases, amnesty for people already in the country, or help for Dreamers, et cetera.

That is the unanimous ruling of a federal appeals court. Three D.C. circuit judges flatly rejecting Trump's argument that he should not have to face trial on federal election subversion charges. The former president has until Monday to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the landmark decision from Colorado's top court that ruled the 14th Amendment insurrectionists ban does apply to Trump, knocking him off of the state's ballot. Let's bring in Jeremy Saland. He is a criminal defense lawyer and former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Jeremy, good morning. It's wonderful to see you. I mean, I think the phrase that stood out to me in this immunity ruling was citizen Trump -- in them saying pretty directly this man is no different than anybody else in this context. And they really did take a sweeping view and talk about previous presidents and how they clearly had viewed that they could be prosecuted. How there -- you know, Nixon was ultimately pardoned. When this came down what did you make of how they framed this and how that sets this up potentially for the appeal to the Supreme Court? JEREMY SALAND, CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER, FORMER MANHATTAN ASSISTANT D.A.:  They were very thorough. They were very clear. There is no questions left unturned here and no answers that they failed to give. President Trump, as you just noted, is President Trump when he is sitting in that Oval Office -- but if he is not, he is not that person anymore. He's citizen Trump. And he doesn't have this blanket pure categorical immunity for everything that he did. Yes, there are some immunities for civil actions. There are some there and the court acknowledged that. This is quite different. And it's not as if Trump said it would have a chilling effect on future presidents to do things within their role -- absolutely not. This was very, very -- and from a conservative judge mind you, as well as two Democratic or liberal judges. It's setting the -- a very good path forward, if it goes forward, for Jack Smith, not Donald Trump.",

I'll be honest. From a political perspective, the sources that I talk to, including Democrats, will say when they are being honest that kicking him off the ballots is politically challenging. It's politically bad for Democrats. That if they are actually going to beat Donald Trump it needs to be something that is perceived to be fair and square, and if he's not on the ballot that can't actually unfold.
