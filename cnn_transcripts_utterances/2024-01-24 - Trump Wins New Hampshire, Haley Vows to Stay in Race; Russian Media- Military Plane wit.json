      "sentences": "Right. And honestly, at this point, they can't answer that question. They can point to some states where perhaps they might do better than others.But we cannot lose sight of where this race stands, big picture. It was historic that a non-incumbent president would win Iowa, would win New Hampshire. And it is extraordinarily difficult to envision a scenario where Nikki Haley really goes forward and takes him on in the traditional way. Right now, the people that are holding out hope for her are talking about scenarios that relate to his legal problems or, you know, other things that we can't see coming. Now, the big question, I think, for Donald Trump, and when you talk to, you know, people kind of around him, who support him, they really like the guy that they saw after the Iowa caucuses: the one who thanked Ron DeSantis, who thanked Nikki Haley, who came across as a gracious person who was trying to unite the party. I mean, it felt very different to us, right? I mean, gone was \"Ron DeSanctimonious.\" All of a sudden, Donald Trump was using Ron DeSantis' real name. That was not the Donald Trump that we saw last night. Instead, we saw someone who was clearly angry, who was focused on his politics of grievance. I mean, I think he said at one point, you know, \"I don't get angry; I get even.\" You heard him, you know, in Omar's piece, that moment with Tim Scott, where he says to Tim Scott, \"Well, you must hate Nikki Haley.\" I mean, anyone who's covered Tim Scott, I think, knows that's not the kind of guy that Tim Scott is. And he stepped up to that microphone and said, \"No, no, I just love you.\" But we're kind of back in that frame, right, of Republicans who had previously stood on their own, standing kind of behind the frame, behind Donald Trump's shoulder, right? I mean, we saw Chris Christie in moments like that in 2016. It's -- it's all very familiar. And I think it really underscores where -- what we have learned about the electorate, which is that Republicans do not want to move on from Donald Trump. I mean, certainly, people have been pushed out of the party who are now, you know, independents. We saw that here in New Hampshire, even saw some of it in Iowa. But the people that remain here as Republicans, we sound like broken records, Poppy, but it's Trump's party now.",

Now, the latest that we have is that this took place about 5 to 6 kilometers outside of a small village Northeast of the city of Belgorod. Belgorod, of course, a big military hub for the Russians. But as you were already mentioning, right now, you have these claims and counter claims coming in from the Russians and the Ukrainians. The Russians, for their part are saying that there were Ukrainian POWs on that plane meant for a prisoner exchange. Also, the head of the Parliamentary Committee for Defense in Russia, he came out, and he unequivocally said that the plane was shot down by the Ukrainians. He said that it was three surface-air missiles that took down that plane. Those claims coming from the Russians. At the same time, you have the Ukrainians -- and this is information coming in from Ukraine's state news agency -- citing sources within the Defense Ministry of Ukraine saying that there were S-300 missiles onboard that plane. Those are surface-to-air missiles. However, they are often used by the Russians to shell ground targets, often originating from that city of Belgorod and hitting Kharkiv in Ukraine. So you have those claims and counterclaims right now as to what exactly was onboard that plane. However, one of the things that the governor of that region, of Belgorod said, he came out just a couple of minutes ago and he said that he is now sure that everyone who was on that aircraft died in that incident. Again, the early stages still of all of this. We're still trying to get the information that is incoming. Right now, you have those claims and counterclaims, but definitely, a huge incident that took place there. And obviously, a big loss of an aircraft for the Russians, Poppy.",

It was a similar story for those who identified as independent. Haley beating Trump there by over 20 points. Trump's legal issues also standing out, more compared to their importance among those voters in the Iowa caucuses. Forty-two percent in New Hampshire said Trump would not be fit for the presidency if convicted of a crime. That was just 31 percent among those who caucused in Iowa. Joining us now, CNN senior political analyst, John anchor -- John -- and anchor John Avlon, Republican strategist and pollster, Lee Carter. John, to you. You were just nodding your head through all those numbers. Yes, they are weaknesses for Trump. Are they an Achilles heel for him? JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST/ANCHOR: Absolutely. Elections are won by the candidate who appeals to independent voters and moderate voters. It's not simply a play to the base exercise. That's general election. And I think Trump's weaknesses were revealed or heightened last night in New Hampshire, which is a state that's predisposed to do that, because the open primaries -- the fact there are more independents than Democrats or Republicans. And on the flip side, I think Joe Biden's strength with the write-in vote is an enormous sign of strength that hadn't been anticipated. But Donald Trump's fundamental weakness as a general election candidate, it illustrates all the fundamental problems of our politics, which is polarization, hyper-partisan.

Haley gets a lot of comments. When I was -- I ran some surveys last night, and a lot of the comments I got is that she's a chameleon. That she seems like -- They're not sure where she stands. And so I just -- I think that she's got a really tough road ahead, whereas -- whereas Donald Trump has really solid support. Three-quarters of his supporters had decided more than a month ago they were going to support to him. Eight in ten of them are solidly behind him. Eight in ten of them are angry. I thought that was such an interesting statistic. They're angry with the way things are in the country.
