Vance as his vice presidential running mate, emotions running high, as Trump with a bandaged ear made his first public appearance since Saturday, when he was nearly assassinated.Vance was a very vocal Trump critic in 2016, but is now a trusted ally. In fact, some top Republicans now view Vance as possibly the future of the MAGA movement. Let's begin this hour at the RNC in Milwaukee with CNN's Alayna Treene. Alayna, walk us through your reporting, how J.D. Vance traveled from -- I mean, all the way back in 2016, he once described Trump as America's Hitler. He was very sharply critical of Donald Trump back in 2016. And now he's seen as the future of the MAGA movement and is on the GOP ticket.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right.And it's interesting, Jim, because, actually, when Donald -- or -- excuse me -- when J.D. Vance was running for Senate, there was a meeting between the two of them in early January 2021, when Vance was going to meet with the former president. And the criticism of Donald Trump had actually come up then. But over the time and over the years, Vance has really gone to one of -- a very sharp critic of Donald Trump's to, of course, a fierce defender and ally, a close friend of Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son, as well as a key ally for the former president. And now, of course, he is his vice presidential nominee. But, look, I'm told that, really, Donald Trump was waffling on this decision even up until Monday morning. He didn't make his final decision until mid- morning, right before, really, he called the Ohio senator and told him, you're going to be my running mate. Now, look, I think there's a couple reasons for why I'm hearing that Trump ultimately landed on J.D. Vance. One is that he thinks that Vance will be very loyal. We know that that was a key criteria for Trump in finding a running mate, especially after really the dissolving of the relationship between Trump and his former vice president, Mike Pence, after everything that had happened around January 6. I'm also told, though, that many people close to the former president and those who had been pushing and lobbying for Vance to Donald Trump, they really argued that they think he could be very helpful in appealing to some of the working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt. We know that Vance grew up in a very poor town in Ohio. He documented that journey in \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a very famous book, and it's something that really attracted Vance -- or the Trump team to Vance. Now, Vance kind of touched on this in an interview last night with FOX News. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He just said: \"Look, I think we have got to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way. You can help me govern. You can help me win. You can help me in some of these Midwestern states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's something that Trump has even remarked privately that he didn't have with some of the other top contenders he was considering, people like Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum. Vance was really the one that he had the closest personal relationship with. And just an interesting note from my reporting over the past couple of days. Even up until mid-morning yesterday, people were in Donald Trump's ear pushing Vance, including on Sunday. He got a call from Elon Musk, saying -- or urging him to pick Vance -- Jim.",

And it's really a testament to the unpredictability of his time in public life, but also the fact that now this is Donald Trump's Republican Party. And to that end, I want to bring in now Republican U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno of Ohio. He's looking to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. And he lost to J.D. Vance in the 2022 primary. Bernie, you have been endorsed by Donald Trump, so you are sort of living proof of Donald Trump's dominance over this Republican Party. When it comes to your friend J.D. Vance, who was just selected as the vice presidential pick, the Democrats are saying this is mega-MAGA. This is doubling down on MAGA, but they see that as an opening. How does J.D. Vance help Trump expand beyond his base, which he really would need to do if he's going to win this thing? BERNIE MORENO (R), OHIO SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I think he appeals to young people. He's 39 years old, so he'd be one of the youngest people ever on a ticket. So that's great. Also, look at his resume. This is a guy who lived in poverty from a broken home, a mom who suffered from addiction, went to the Marines, served this country, rebounded from all of that, wrote a book, was able to start a venture capital firm, and then ran for the United States Senate. So his resume is one of resilience. It's the embodiment of the American dream. And, most importantly, J.D. is just fundamentally a very, very good person. And I think what people want in America is just good people in leadership positions, good-hearted people that are there to do the right thing.",

I'm very happy I was wrong about that, because what we saw with President Trump for four years is prosperity, not just for certain groups, for all groups, for Hispanics, for women, for black Americans.

President Trump in person is a great human being. He's a great man. I talked about that in my primary. I wish America could see the person that I know to be.
