So, any pictures that you might see coming from this are only going to come from that talent walking in and out of the building.To your point, they've erected a big tent, so it looks like we're not going to be able to see them. That's meant to protect them, and it's also meant to protect people like Rupert Murdoch, who don't want to be seen here having to take heat for some of the things that happen on its air. I also expect one of the more contentious things to happen is when we get those executives inside testifying as witnesses, we already have a sense of what some will say.

Obviously, there's a lot of Republicans at the NRA. Obviously, I'm very strongly considering running for president. So, there's a voter base out there.And I think there's a big message that has to be told that isn't being told enough, which is how do we get bigger? How do we make this party bigger? How do we bring that disenfranchised voter back on the team? We lost pretty big in 2022. I don't care what folks say. 49 U.S. senators is not enough and we lost some governorships we probably should have one. So, I can try to make the team bigger and any opportunity to talk to.",

But when you look at New Hampshire's record of success, we're one of the most flexible when it comes to the Second Amendment and firearms regulations, and yet we're still one of the safest states in the country.So, my message is it's not just about the gun laws and just about passing more laws and patting ourselves on the back and trying to take a win, that's not what gets it done. You've got to deal with mental health issues. You've got to deal with the core of those issues and violence.

Look, I think Republican leadership across this country gets too wrapped up and I think we can say the same for Democrats but I'm a Republican, so I'm going to take our side on it. We get too wrapped up in talking in our own echo chamber, telling each other things we want to hear as opposed to saying why aren't the independents coming on board? Why are why are young Republicans disenfranchised and not participating in the conversation?So, I wouldn't pin this just on Ron or former President Trump. I think both of them have issues that -- and a lot of us do, where we get in politics. We like to hear. We like to say something. And then hear someone reaffirm, it's like an endorphin rush or something, politically. But at the end of the day, that's not what gets our message out. That isn't an empathetic ear. What's the issue that a young voter wants to hear about? I think that young Republicans now they care about the environment. They're not climate change crazy. They're not socialist and all that kind of wacky green new deal stuff, but they want to know Republicans are making smart, fiscal responsible investments in the environment. I think Republicans should own the homeless issue. Homelessness is a disaster in a place like California. You can't blame a single Republican for that. The left-wing liberals have to take full accountability for the inhumane treatment of individuals, homeless individuals in California. I have the lowest poverty rate in the country. It's not by accident. We do hard work to make sure we get folks' treatment and housing and all of those sorts of things.
