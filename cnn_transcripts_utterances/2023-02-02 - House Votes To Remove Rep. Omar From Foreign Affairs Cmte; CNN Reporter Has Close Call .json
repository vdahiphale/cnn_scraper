Just moments ago, the House finishing its vote to remove Congressman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. That vote was 218 to 211. One member of the House voted present on that vote. There's a separate vote happening now. That's the screen you see there.But 218 to 211, one vote present. Ilhan Omar will be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The resolution doing that does offer her an opportunity to appeal to the House Ethics Committee. We'll watch that as it plays out. But a major victory for the new Republican Speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Ilhan Omar will be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Moving on now to some important global news. Some new Russian missile strikes targeting civilians in eastern Ukraine, sending plumes of smoke over the city of Kramatorsk as residents scramble to take cover. Our CNN Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was right there near one apartment building hit during that attack. Here's how he described his close call with CNN's Kate Bolduan last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we heard a loud bang. There were obviously a lot of civilians there on the street, many of them then trying to take shelter.We did the same thing. We then went towards another building to try and take shelter there. And then as I looked up, I saw another missile that then hit almost the exact location, obviously, causing a huge explosion there, leading to even more people trying to flee the scene. We then tried to run for cover or went for shelter, and then after a while tried to get out of there. But I think one of the things that's very important to point out, Kate, is that there was a big search and rescue operation going on on the ground. And the Russians targeted exactly the area where that search and rescue operation was going on, in the city of Kramatorsk. This was not some sort of military facility. We saw no military facilities in that area. We saw a lot of civilians, however, who were in that area. And this was right in the center of town. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The Pentagon as well as the U.S. government have watched China, its actions, its military operations, and view it as a growing threat not only towards Taiwan, but also other countries in the region as they view China as becoming more aggressive. This clearly, and especially from China's perspective, puts more U. S. military forces closer to China. And of course, as you see on that map, closer to Taiwan.There are already forces on the northern side there in Okinawa, where the U.S. just announced it would repurpose a Marine Corps unit giving advanced capabilities and advanced weapons recently. And now, with this new access agreement, there could be forces even closer on the south side. Now neither the U.S. nor the Philippines have said where these four bases are, but we know from previous statements from the Philippines that the U.S. has requested access in the northern Philippines. Again, that's that spot very close to Taiwan. So this is all part of the broader access, the broader move to shift from the wars of the past in the Middle East and towards China, towards the Indo-Pacific. It's also worth remembering that from the sort of 10,000-foot level, the previous Philippine administration had moved the country toward Beijing. And this appears to be a clear realignment from the new Philippine government moving back towards Washington, a bit back towards the U.S. Even as the government remains very careful with how it interacts and works with Beijing.

This is nothing like the last Congress where they would deny the rights for bills to even go through committee.This is nothing like the last Congress where you never had an open rule. So let's just judge the few weeks we've had now to the last Congress. This is the first time in seven years any bill has come to the floor in an open rule. Almost a decade since that has come to the -- bill has come to the floor, that's not an appropriation bill. Look at what we've also done the first week in a bipartisan way. 146 Democrats joined with us where we opened a select committee on China. This is actually a fundamentally different Congress. I've had Democrats coming up to me telling me, we're running it much better, especially the time allotment. They like the openness and the working. I'll give you another example, for inner workings, right? There's times that I was going to be given a briefing. I call up the minority leader, take the briefing with me. Because there's ways that I look at the way we were treated in the past, I don't think was right. And I'm glad you asked this question because this is a much different Congress, much more -- now the public can actually be here. You can be here. How different is that? The public is going to be back in the people's House. We're going to have a State of the Union where the public can actually watch it. So, yes, I'm really excited how this is so different than the last Congress. (CROSSTALK)",

Because every group that has more than five people has power because the majority is so slim. KING: And so these are his early days. Critical, critical for any leader. He's the new leader of an organization with a very narrow majority. He also said he's trying to be upbeat about his meeting with the President yesterday. They are very far apart. The White House says it will not negotiate the debt ceiling, but the President of the United States did say you'll have a separate conversation about spending cuts or spending reductions if you vote. Kevin McCarthy says you have to have the spending cuts with the vote on a debt ceiling, that they won't have a clean debt ceiling bill. Meaning, he'd have to spend. Can they do that?
