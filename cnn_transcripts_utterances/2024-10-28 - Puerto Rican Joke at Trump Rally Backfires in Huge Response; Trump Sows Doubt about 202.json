There are over 1 million Puerto Ricans who live in New York where this rally was held. And perhaps most relevant to this presidential campaign, there are about half-a-million Puerto Rican who live in Pennsylvania. They are American citizens. They vote. Perhaps that's why the Trump campaign did something that they almost never do. They quickly disavowed a statement that was widely perceived as offensive. Quote, \"This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,\" end quote, a spokeswoman told CNN. The Florida Senator Rick Scott, a Republican running for reelection, wrote this on X: quote, \"This joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans.\" There are about 1.1 million of them in Florida who could vote for or against Scott. Famous Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny, J.Lo, Ricky Martin, millions of social media followers among them, quickly posted pro-Harris videos as Harris herself had campaigned at a Puerto Rican restaurant earlier in the day.

It's not the same incentive structure. Like, we -- I've seen this so many times over the years. And this is why you'd be so careful with this sort of thing. Comedians want laughs. Politicians want votes. That's not usually in alignment in a lot of respects. And you saw why in this sort of thing. And, you know, if you're Trump's campaign, it unfortunately, overshadowed a lot of this for them as they go into this last week. DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Yes, and it was a problem for the campaign, because this joke of rage, contempt, and hate terribly distracted from the campaign's message of rage, contempt, and hate. No, this is ridiculous. This is -- this is the message. This has always been the message. Rage, contempt, hate. Police women, expel people who are different from you. Be angry at the world. Denounce criminals from the mouth of a convicted criminal himself. That's the message. There's not some other Trump campaign that is about accelerating depreciation rates or about accelerating economic growth. Their economic ideas are moronic and anti-social. Their immigration message is completely -- trips over its own feet. This is what they are. And so, I think this -- this rally was a true public service. Show America what is the choice. That's it.

So, yes, people -- Americans reject this. And I think you're absolutely right about Trump voters. There was a story that went round last week about Donald Trump lending his plane to fly Nelson Mandela to the United States. The story is completely fictitious. In fact, Trump's air -- he owned an airplane company at the time. It was on the verge of bankruptcy. They needed money from anyone they can get. And they chartered flights inside the United States to Nelson Mandela's group at the market rate. They did no good deed. So, why did that story circulate?
