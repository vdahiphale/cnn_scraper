They can't govern based on policy. They're communicating as if TikTok is a mind control device used by the Chinese to manipulate us against our own interests as Americans. It is not that. It does not do that. And again, because Republicans are all about fearmongering. They fearmonger on the border. They fearmonger on China. They fearmonger on debt limit. They fearmonger on crime.
