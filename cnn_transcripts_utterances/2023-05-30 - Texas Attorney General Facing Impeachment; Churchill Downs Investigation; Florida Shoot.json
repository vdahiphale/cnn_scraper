One of the other things that was -- that was very interesting about that alleged attack that happened early in the morning hours is, the Russians were very quick to point out that these were actually substantial unmanned aerial vehicles that made their way towards the Russian capital. They say these were fixed-wing aircraft and not some sort of octocopter that's a lot smaller than that. They said, of the eight that they took down, three of them were taken down using electronic measures. But they also said that they actually had to activate their air defenses and use missiles to shoot down the five others. So, certainly, this was a substantial attack, as the Russians put it, on Moscow, absolutely unprecedented since the Russians started their full-on invasion of Ukraine. And you are absolutely right. Vladimir Putin, seemingly quite angry, pointed the finger of blame squarely at Kyiv. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Kyiv chose the path of intimidation of Russian citizens and attacks on residential buildings.

And, you know, this comes after what was really a very difficult night here in the Ukrainian capital. Having witnessed this overnight, there were waves of attacks by those Iranian-made Shahed drones that the Russians have been sending here for the past couple of months. And it really was over the course of several hours that Ukrainian air defenses were firing in the air. And we were hearing them firing in the air and hearing explosions of those unmanned aerial vehicles being hit and falling to the ground. There was one woman who was killed in a large residential building. We were on site there just a couple of hours ago, and there was substantial damage to that building.

She continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones.\" There was a full statement as well there that accompanied that tweet, and I can tell you that it just made mention of the fact that she has been now diagnosed with dementia. She is somebody, they mentioned and remind people of, has had a long history of advocating for people with diseases of the brain and mental illness, and reminds people that one in 10 Americans who are seniors over the age of 65 gets diagnosed with some type of dementia. So, this is just coming into us now, Brianna. We don't know many more specifics. I will tell you that people are typically, as you know, diagnosed with dementia later in life. Rosalynn Carter is 95 years old. She's been pretty healthy up until now. She was in the hospital for a fainting spell in 2019. She had an operation to remove scar tissue from her small intestine some years ago, but generally pretty healthy.
