So, we've been told by both our sources and by Hamas that this is a, quote/unquote, humanitarian release because presumably Hamas doesn't want to deal with someone who is not in very good health.So, we've been told that they have been handed over to the Red Cross. So, they're now with an independent body. They're not with the militant group anymore. And that they are heading to a crossing to get out of the Gaza Strip. In southern Gaza, there is both the Rafah crossing that goes into Egypt and the Kerem Shalom crossing that goes into Israel. And right now, we are not clear on which one they're going to and which officials they will be handed over to. But this is certainly excellent news for the families. We will -- we can assume that once they are handed over that they will be given the medical treatment that they need. But there are still major questions about the remaining hostages. And there have been all kinds of numbers that have been put on how many remain. The IDF saying earlier today that that range could be between 100 and 200. Hamas has said that it is closer to 200. So you know, big questions about where those hostages are. We have been told, we've reported, that they are spread out among different groups, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, other militant groups. And that has certainly complicated the prospect of Israel going into Gaza on the ground, which, of course, they are expected to do.",

I mean, clearly, there is yet another void. We are going to have a couple more days of chaos as we try to get a sense of what's next. To me, it reminds me how incredibly irresponsible it was for 208 Democrats and eight Republicans to put this House into absolute chaos without any kind of a plan for how we were going to move forward. Now, we really do need -- we really do need somebody to step forward, somebody who is mission-driven, somebody who is focused on doing something rather than just being something.

But one member, Byron Donalds, not ruling out running for speaker. Butbefore we came to air, I did talk to another candidate who's going to be a speaker candidate, Kevin Hern, a Republican from Oklahoma, who's the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. He told me he is going to run for speaker. This will be a contested race. Several other potential Republican candidates here could jump in the race, Jodey Arrington being one of them; Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, being another one. There's another congressman here. I want to grab him once he breaks away from this gaggle here. But just to take a step back, this is a hugely significant moment. Jim Jordan, who had been the candidate for speaker for three ballots, as someone who had been pushed by members of the hard-right, people who had pushed out Kevin McCarthy, is bowing out of the bid for the speakership amid a revolt -- mostly from more moderate members, more establishment-aligned members, members aligned with the leadership who simply thought it was time to move on. He lost a secret ballot election vote. They put it to a test, asked the members. Do they want him to vote for speaker -- do they want him to continue to run for speaker or will he -- or should he step aside? The Conference, a majority vote, said it was time for him to step aside. Now, once again, Republicans are going to have to pick up the pieces, try to figure out what the next step is here and whether another candidate can actually get the votes to become elected speaker. That is going to be a very difficult proposition, as we've seen time and time again. In the -- following the unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, no candidate has been anywhere close to getting 217 votes. And can anyone do that? Now they're going to solicit their membership. By noon on Sunday, that is the next deadline for candidates to come forward and say that they might be a candidate for the speakership. And then Monday, there will be a candidate forum in which the members will have to go behind closed doors, make their case about why they should be speaker of the House. And then potentially by Tuesday, that's when we could see another floor vote for whoever gets nominated for speaker. Maybe even -- it'll push into Wednesday. The time frame is a little uncertain about the floor vote for all of this. But just such a significant moment, as Republicans remain so badly divided. And as what you heard from Congressman Dusty Johnson, just going after those eight Republicans who initially voted out Kevin McCarthy, blaming him for all of this. Saying they have no plans, they are motivated by a political agenda, and taking direct and personal aim at some members, including Congresswoman Nancy Mace. Just a pretty revealing moment here for the GOP as they struggle to figure out their way forward. Guys? SANCHEZ: Manu, it was really telling, your conversation with Congressman Dusty Johnson. And something that he said stuck out to me. When you think about the potential for a future speaker, he said that whoever wins may have to accept that their time on Capitol Hill will be short. Essentially saying that they're not going to win over the majority of the Conference. They may not win over their district. Usually, speaker of the House is like a position that you aspire to. But it seems like it's a difficult position to be in right now, for anyone.",

So, whoever can get the job may not even be in the job for very long.And I can tell you, there is real concern among Republicans about whether or not they can actually keep the majority here and whether or not this this effort, right, this whole messy episode will just simply cost them what they battled on -- this battle (ph). Let me talk to Congressman Austin Scott. Congressman Scott, we are live here on air. You have been very, very upset at the way the whole -- all of this has gone down here. What do you say to the people who had started this, the eight Republicans who initially voted out Kevin McCarthy at this moment? REP. AUSTIN SCOTT (R-GA): Same thing I say to the 208 Democrats that voted with those eight Republicans. It was a dangerous game that was being played. The consequences are real for the country. If men were angels, we wouldn't need the government, as you know. But, men aren't angels, and we need the United States House of Representatives to open. And so -- and so, certainly we have eight Republicans that are guilty, but there are 208 Democrats that voted with them to put us in this position.

People get excited. They get -- sometimes, really, their blood boils, but it's not acceptable and we should condemn it across the board. But again, what I'm saying is that I saw members trying to blame this on Representative Jordan, who's the chairman of House Judiciary. And if we're talking about moving forward, I think it's important for people to remember that what you say on television, that what you put out from your office, whether or not it's personal, it's going to have long-lasting effects.
