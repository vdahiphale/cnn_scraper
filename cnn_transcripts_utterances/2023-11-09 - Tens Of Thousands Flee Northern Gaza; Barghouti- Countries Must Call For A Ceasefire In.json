And the season of strikes finally ends in US. Actors reached a tentative deal with Hollywood Studios. Live from London, it's Thursday November 9th. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest. And, of course, I, too, mean business. Good evening everyone. Tonight, Israel says it has captured a Hamas military stronghold in northern Gaza. The IDF said it took control of the outpost after 10 hours of fighting. It said Israeli troops eliminated terrorists, captured weapons, and uncovered more tunnels shafts. Israeli officials said, in the last 30 minutes or so, there's 80,000 civilians -- 80,000 civilians in Gaza fled the fighting in the north during today's six-hour evacuation window. Prime Netanyahu insisted once more that there will be no ceasefire until Hamas frees its hostages -- 240 hostages, of course. A US official says the heads of the CIA and the Mossad discussed hostage issues today with Qatari leaders in Doha. A lot for us to get through. Our Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv for the very latest. Jeremy, good to see you. So we've had, what, 50,000 crossing from the north to the south yesterday; 80,000 today. This, as we hear, are potentially more pauses from the US side. Put it all into context for us here, Jeremy.",

I mean, it is all -- you know, we really do have to bring it all together becausethe number of civilians who are fleeing is not disconnected from the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, which is worsening by the hour. And also, of course, the ongoing military operation in the area, it is very much all connected. But today, the White House's National Security Council, announcing that Israel has agreed to carry out these humanitarian pauses in fighting in the areas of northern Gaza for four hours per day going forward. Now, in many ways, this is what we have already been seeing over the course of the last five days. Israel, every single day for the last five days, has allowed at least a four-hour, sometimes five or six hours, for civilians from northern Gaza to be able to flee to the south safely using a pre-designated evacuation group, which the Israelis are calling an \"evacuation corridor.\" The Israelis though are not calling this a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire, insisting tonight in the words of the Israeli defense force spokesman that there will be no ceasefire, once again, until the hostages are released from Gaza. But this seems to be more than anything an issue of semantics. The White House very much wants to show that it is attending to the humanitarian concerns and the pressure that it is facing to rein in Israel following the numbers of civilian casualties and following the really downward spiraling humanitarian situation in Gaza. They want to show that they are acting on that and delivering here. The Israelis, for their part, don't want to indicate to the public that there is any kind of ceasefire or serious pause in fighting. But by and large, these are the same thing that they are talking about -- a safe way for civilians to flee south without military activities being conducted in that area. What is also significant here is that these humanitarian pauses are intended to try and give a little bit more space to those negotiations that we are .",

West Virginia is a deeply red conservative state. It went for former President Donald Trump by double-digits. And without an incumbent, it is much easier for Republicans to flip the seat. And even Joe Manchin was going to likely have a tough time seeking reelection because Jim Justice, the popular Republican governor, is running on the GOP side. Jim justice also endorsed by former President Donald Trump. And in a very telling statement, the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm put out a statement and said, \"We like our odds in West Virginia.\" Now, there is a question about what Manchin is going to do next. He said, as you noticed in his video statement, that he is going to travel the country and see if they can find common ground between the two parties. Joe Manchin, of course, has been a very prominent centrist voice in the Democratic Party. But it's unclear exactly what he meant by that statement, but he has been toying with the idea of running on a third-party ticket. That is something that he has not ruled out.

The four that have previously been released, a mother and daughter and two elderly ladies about a week later were released by Hamas. CNN's not releasing the names of these two, the 77 year old woman and a 13 year old boy, or releasing the video that has been released by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. That is in deference to the wishes of their families. The spokesperson for the IDF says that they have never missed an opportunity and will not miss an opportunity to have people released if that is possible. That statement doesn't lead us too far but it indicates that something is in the works here. The IDF and Israeli government have been resisting a drip by drip release by Hamas, by Palestinian Islamic Jihad of hostages that they hold. It's not clear how many are held by Hamas and how many are held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The commander of the military wing, the Al Quds brigade, the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Abdul Hamzah, said that one of them was being released for humanitarian reasons and the other is being released for medical reasons. These are really all the details that we have at the moment about their condition, about how any release may take place, about what are the terms of the release. Just not clear at the moment but it's an indication that perhaps a thaw in the release of some hostages is approaching. But really not clear at all.",

You can see him here in a brown jacket accompanied by U.N. officials after his release by a guerrilla group. He was kidnapped in northern Colombia nearly two weeks ago. His son, who plays for Liverpool FC, has been pleading for his father's release after scoring. On Sunday he revealed a T-shirt under his jersey that said, \"Freedom for Papa.\" Liverpool FC posted this message on X, welcoming the safe return of Diaz Sr. and thanking everyone who helped achieve it. Stefano Pozzebon has been across the story for us, he joins us from Colombia. Stefano, what more do we know about this release? How did it come about?",

He was received by the bishop of Sriracha (ph), which is the Catholic dioceses where the hometown of Luis Diaz is located, Barrancas. And a few hours ago and just a couple of hours ago he was allowed to return to his family. We'll show you some of the images of him finally reunited with the family. It was welcome news here, Isa, not just for the family of Luis Diaz but for the entire nation, all of Colombia. It's hard to think of a more popular figure right now in the country that the most representative and most popular football player that plays for such a renowned club as Liverpool. However, this is perhaps a red herring. It shows how brazen the auction of the ELN, this guerrilla group, has been in kidnapping the father of one of Colombia's most well-known figures. And it shows how hard it is for the Colombian government and for everyone in this country to really try and start a conversation about pacification. We had a historic peace deal seven years ago between the Colombian government and the left wing. The ELN was not involved. They weren't part of the deal. And they remain active. And just this month in relation with the kidnapping of Luis Diaz Sr., they realized and said it was a mistake to kidnap such a renowned and popular figure. But they defended their tactic of ransom kidnapping to defend their struggle and it shows you how distant Colombia is from the real peace across the country.",
