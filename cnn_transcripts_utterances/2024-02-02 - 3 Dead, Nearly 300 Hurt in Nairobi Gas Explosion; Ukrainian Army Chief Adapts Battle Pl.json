At the same time they stressed, nothing's agreed to until everything's agreed to, which is a problem since Trump and Republicans have descended into a circular firing squad that has everything in flux at a moment when there are no holiday deadlines looming and no jet fumes in the air to spark an actual outcome. Or to put a fighter point on it, this is a huge problem because what hangs in the balance is of enormous consequence.",

He writes, in part, we must contend with a reduction in military support from key allies, grappling with their own political tensions. Russia, taking note of how developments in the Middle East have distracted international attention, might seek to provoke further conflicts elsewhere.Let's go straight to CNN's Fred Pleitgen. He's live for us in Kyiv. Fred, this is fascinating because the biggest question on the U.S. side is what's going to happen if aid stops. He starts to dig into that a little bit.

And that is that the Ukrainians are both outmanned and outgunned. And they probably are going to remain outgunned in the future as well.And that's something where Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the top general here in Ukraine really says, look, that's the reality that we have to cope with. And he says that the only way to get out of that is by using modern technology. And he refers to unmanned systems, sea drones, land drones, air drones. He said that could be the big equalizer on the battlefield. I want to read you another quote from this, really fascinating essay that I really urge everyone who's watching right now to go to our website and read. He says, quote, our goal must be to seize the moment -- to maximize our accumulation of the latest combat capabilities, which will allow us to commit fewer resources to inflicting maximum damage on the enemy, to end the aggression and protect Ukraine from the future. So essentially what he's saying is that he believes that these unmanned systems are going to allow the Ukrainians to lose fewer of their troops on the battlefield while inflicting harm on the Russians. Because the big question is, are the Ukrainians going to have the volume in unmanned systems to be able to do that, guys?",

And one of the things that every single commander that we met on the ground told us is they have a shortage in artillery shells, but they also have a big shortage in manpower. And it's two things. They don't have enough soldiers on the front line. And the soldiers that they do have on the front line have been there for a very, very long time. And a lot of them are tired and need to be rotated out.And that's where Valerii Zaluzhnyi says, he needs about 400,000 people to be mobilized. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of this country, didn't take to that well at all. He said, look, how are we going to do this? Who's going to pay for this?

And he apparently offered him of some other post possibly an ambassadorship, that's not really clear. But Zaluzhnyi declined that and yet Zelenskyy said, look, you are out, you are going to be fired.Well, since then, this entire country has been waiting to see a presidential decree that would actually say that he has been fired and also who the possible successor could be. Now, one of the things we have to point out is that the top General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, he is extremely popular among the military and among the population of this country.

The neutrality rule 11 is a big deal. We won't nerd out on that. They see a message that works. And their concern is, if Donald Trump is the nominee, most likely to be, that messaging works regardless, because we focus so much on Donald Trump's -- or on Joe Biden's age, for obvious reasons. Donald Trump's not that far behind. And both of them are at an age where you age a lot faster, in roles where you also age a lot faster. And so they're concerned about this.
