The January 6 committee has decided to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department as part of its investigation into the deadly attack on the Capitol. This news comes as lawmakers just honored, as we were just watching it together, honored the -- honored the heroes and law enforcement that defended the Capitol, defended American democracy on that day.Sara Murray is live in Washington with much more on this.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, I was just talking to Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the committee, along with some other reporters, and he'd made it clear that they have decided that they are going to do criminal referrals. We asked him a couple of times to clarify this has been decided. He says it has. He says the committee will do this.And this is a significant move, you know. Obviously, the Justice Department doesn't have to listen to what the committee refers to. They do their own investigations. They decide who they're going to investigate, who they may prosecute, but members of the committee have been telling us for weeks and weeks that they thought it would be a significant step to send a significant signal about their work if they moved ahead and issue to criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Now, Thompson, as you might expect, was playing coy about who may be on that list of potential criminal referrals. We know that this is something that is still an active discussion among the committee members. They're expected to meet later today. Here, we're also waiting to hear more information from them about the basis of these potential criminal referrals, you know. Is there potential perjury, or potential witness tampering? Those are all things that the committee has been looking at. So, we're waiting for more information on the specifics of exactly what this will look like. But of course, we know the committee does not have much longer to do their work. And this would be a very significant culmination for them to wrap this up.",

He said those decisions are still being discussed exactly who will get referred to by the Justice Department for potential criminal prosecution.But he did say the focus of the committee is on the people who are at the center of the events and who masterminded the attack on Congress and the vice president on that day. So, very likely, it seems that Donald Trump will be on that list, people around Donald Trump, people who were the committee has, of course, heard a lot of testimony about this as well. Now, this will all culminate, Kate, in a report that this committee will put out after its exhaustive investigation for the past two years of the -- more than a thousand or so witnesses, the thousands and thousands of pages of documents all put together in a report. Raskin told me that they are making great progress in finishing the report. He does not know if it will be done this week but of course, it is expected to be done within the next couple of weeks because come January 3, when Republicans take power, this committee's job, and its work is over.",

But the investigation has also shown they have made clear that they believe he is at the center of all of this. So, would you, in the end, be surprised if he -- is surprised if Donald Trump is not among the people who they have a criminal referral against, I think that they give to the Justice Department? WILLIAMS: I think it'd be surprising if they didn't base on the evidence that they put out the statements they've made and where it seems that the committee is going. But let's be clear, the before the president is already being investigated by the Justice Department, they're on the record about that. They're even independent of -- this would be an additional recommendation of -- you know of a possible criminal prosecution. But at the end of the day, the president's already, potentially in a significant amount of trouble as it is. But you're absolutely right. If you hear what the members of Congress are saying, certainly they are debating it robustly and trying to figure out which way to proceed. I'd be shocked if he wasn't, but again, many people around him ought to also be cautious and worried right now.",

They are working on all of that in which they believe they're made great progress on.Now, there are also some outstanding questions too. What do they do about the subpoenas that were issued to Republican members of Congress, including Kevin McCarthy, who might be the next Speaker of the House? They have not made any decisions yet about exactly what to do for -- about the fact that those Republicans defied those subpoenas. They had suggested, perhaps that there could be a referral to the Ethics Committee, maybe even a referral to the Justice Department, but those questions are still unresolved at this hour, Kate.",
