And he said he wanted it shot down as soon as possible.Now, the military advised that the president wait as by that time the balloon had really drifted over these more densely populated areas and it could have damaged property or potentially American lives. So, the president took that recommendation. And then the military hatched the plan to wait until it was over open water to shoot that balloon down. Really waiting a full seven days after the balloon entered U.S. airspace. Now, you're right. The president is now facing criticism for that extended period of the wait really from Republicans and even some questions from Democrats. And the White House is for the last like 12, 13, 14 hours really defending the president on this decision to wait. I want to read you a statement from a White House official because it's pretty strong here. They said that, \"This is the responsible action for the commander in chief to take.\" Waiting, that is. \"He prioritized the safety of the American people. He ensured that the military take steps to protect against the balloon's collection of sensitive information, mitigating any intelligence value to the PRC,\" the People's Republic of China. And they also said that in that time that they took they were able to study that payload and really get information off of it. So, of course, this will be the defense that they use for the domestic problems over the course of the days as those on the Hill ask for more questions from the White House. Then diplomatically, of course, they are going to have really some issues to sort through as of course this White House has spent last few months really trying to iron through and warm relations with China.

Instead, we are talking about 47 feet of ocean water. So they do anticipate that it's going to be fairly easy to go ahead and recover some of this. Now, they are going to be using skilled Navy divers, according to a senior U.S. military official, as well as unmanned vessels that are going to be able to go down and actually lift up that wreckage and get it onto a recovery ship. Now, how long is this going to take? So, the official was not sure of the exact amount of time, but because of where it was shot down they do believe that this will take a fairly short amount of time. They said -- quote -- \"I don't anticipate months and weeks.\" Look, here in Myrtle Beach they did kind of give a warning saying that if remnants of this balloon begin washing up on the shore here, don't touch it. Do not take it. Don't go home and put it on eBay. They need that so they can take it back to Quantico so the FBI and other intelligence agencies can examine what's left of this balloon.",

Thank you so much, Dianne.Let's get some more insight now from CNN military analyst and retired Lieutenant-General Mark Hertling. Good morning to you. So, first off, I mean, do you think the Biden administration acted quickly enough waiting until the spy balloon was over water? I'm sure, as you know, Republicans have been claiming that this was a national security failure. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It was definitely not a national security failure, Amara. And good morning to you. I said even before some of this events happened yesterday that they needed to leave it to the professionals, that there was probably a whole lot more behind what was going on from both an intelligence perspective and a search perspective and an over watch perspective that some of the Republicans who were tweeting just shoot it down, just shoot it down for the last day that they knew about it, just didn't understand. Now, that's not a bias on my part. You know, I know the fact that when you are talking about tracking a satellite or something that's coming into your airspace you not only want to see what it's going to do, you want to collect intelligence on what the other side is doing, and that's what the Biden administration did. As that balloon went across the Bering Sea, into the Aleutian Strait, into Canada, both NORAD and others were tracking it and coordinating what to do with it. NORAD, by the way, as you know, is a consortium between the U.S. and Canada. So, there were other nations that were actually observing this satellite -- or this balloon as well. So I think the administration, the military and the intelligence community was very prudent. And I think those who were insulting them about what they were and were not doing just don't understand how some of these things work.",

And we saw that there were solar panels suspended below the balloon and now we know the debris that's being recovered will be taken to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. Do you think China was able to, you know, retrieve some sensitive information? I know one U.S. official said it was used to monitor sensitive military sites.",

And it's quite rich to hear China's reaction to the shoot down saying that the U.S. was overreacting and seriously violating international practice when it's the one that first, you know, violated U.S. sovereignty and U.S. airspace.

I would bet as we get more and more information from the U.S. government, from the administration, we will learn that there were multiple demarches towards the Chinese government in the week ahead of the shoot down. You know, we knew this balloon was going across the Bering Sea as early as about a week ago, last Sunday or even last Saturday. During that period of time I would assure you the U.S. government handed demarches to the Chinese government saying, hey, we don't know what you are doing but you really need to knock it off. And we have been coordinating with other allies as well. Canada, as I mentioned earlier but there were probably other allies we were telling and passing intelligence to about this device that was over -- flying our territory because other countries like Japan and Taiwan have experienced this kind of action by China also.

And now they are trying to bluster to cover up their blunder.I mean, just think about it. The Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to get on the plane to leave for Beijing. That would have been a huge diplomatic win for the Chinese and they stepped on their own plans by provoking the United States the day before the trip. And now they realize that was a really stupid thing to do and they have no choice but to double down. I mean, what are they going to say, we messed up? I have never seen the Chinese Communist Party say that ever. So now they are going to say, oh, well, you know, I'm rubber, you're glue, anything you say bounces off me and sticks to you. But there is a deep realization in Beijing and a deep understanding on the U.S. side, according to my sources, that they really screwed up here because both sides have an interest in wanting smooth U.S.-China relations, but we don't want it so bad that we are going to accept this kind of provocation and just go on like business as usual. Biden can't do that. Politics in the United States won't allow for that. The Chinese don't seem to have understood that. They get it now. And now they've started something that they can't finish. And what that tells us, I think, is that actually this trip was not really something that was going to change U.S.-China relations in the first place. It's not as if we were about to enter a kumbaya moment and everything is going to be fine. Actually, the problems in the U.S.-China relationship are deeper than a trip or a balloon, and that's why I think U.S.-China relations are destined to go down.",

In other words, not that someone went rogue in Beijing. That's not really how their system works.If you did something in U.S.-Chinese relations that Xi Jinping didn't like, you go to jail or die. So, it's unlikely that was the case. What's much more likely is that they thought we would just eat it. They thought that they could humiliate the United States on the eve of the trip and that we would just go anyway because we want peace so bad and we want good relations so bad and they were wrong. They didn't understand that on our side, sure, we want to reset if that's possible, if everything's fine, but not at any price. And again, this goes back to the basic problem in U.S.-China relations, which is really what we need to be talking about, which is that it's not really about a visit or a balloon. It's about the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is an aggressive totalitarian genocidal dictatorship which is doing things that we can't tolerate and about the fact that the things that they want us to do, which is to ignore all of their bad actions, is something that we can't tolerate. You know, it doesn't matter whether or not Tony Blinken goes there once or twice or three times. Until we get to those problems, the structural problems are just going to get worse. So, yes, this is a setback and it's a setback that the Chinese brought on themselves. And, yes, they intended to do it but they miscalculated what the result would be. That's my take.",
