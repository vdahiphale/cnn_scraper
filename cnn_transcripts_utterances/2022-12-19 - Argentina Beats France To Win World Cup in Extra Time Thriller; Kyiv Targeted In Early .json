The forward went out with a stellar performance he scored this opening goal to help Argentina build a two nil lead but France stormed back with two late goals from superstar Mbappe which sent the match to extra time. Messi and Mbappe again scored in the next 30 minutes in the match ended in a three-three draw. Argentina eventually won four-two in the penalty shootout with this kick from Gonzalo Montiel, or that, Argentina has pulled off a fairytale ending to a remarkable tournament.

And the people behind my back have taken over the streets of Buenos Aires, clearly show no sign of keeping up with the party and no intention of going back home. It's a moment that Argentina has been waiting for more than 36 years since the times of the great big Armando Maradona, who won it in 1986. And it's a moment that comes when Argentina is frankly in dire straits. The economy is in trouble, the inflation is at over 90 percent. And the political polarization is really as high as it has ever been. But this Sunday, all of these troubles have been simply swept away by the joy of football, and by the greatness of the achievements of the trials that this national football team managed in Qatar. It's a football team that has really embodied the spirits of Argentina. It gave all the thosuands of people that are here in the streets of Buenos Aires, a reason to feel proud to be Argentinian. It's also a moment to rejoice for Lionel Messi, the captain of the national team for many considered one, if not the greatest player of his time, but still without a World Cup victory. Well, on Sunday, Messi did manage to conquer the only trophy that was still missing from his cabinet. And by doing that, he gave me a joy beyond comprehension to most -- to all of these Argentina that are here with us in in Buenos Aires.

So that's just one province, for example, and a projection of where they think it will be over the next couple of months. Another projection coming from a report that's come out from Hong Kong University, where epidemiologists had been studying not only what's going on in mainland China, but also here in Hong Kong, which also tried to maintain a zero-COVID bubble until it kind of spectacularly popped some months ago, make some projections that now that Omicron is spreading like wildfire across China, that if you have the status quo, they have a model that suggests China could lose up to a million people as a result of the Omicron variant spreading across the country. With the caveat that if China manages to ramp up vaccination and the availability of antiviral drugs, that that mortality rate could reduce by 25 to 35 percent. You're still talking about hundreds of 1000s of people potentially dying. Now, one of the challenges here is the Chinese government has been warning its population for three years that COVID is really this deadly, deadly, terrifying disease. And that's why cities had to be locked down for months at a time. That's why the borders have had to be closed. And now in just the last month, you have top health care officials, as well as the government pivoting dramatically saying, Hey, this is a weaker variant of this disease. We can handle it now and one epidemiologist saying hey, we should call it the Coronavirus cold now.

The agent says the player expressed his support for Iranian women in an Instagram post which has been deleted. Dejagah has played for a German club and is a dual German-Iranian national. Meanwhile, global popstar Shakira is voicing her support for another jailed Iranian soccer player. In a series of tweets, she urged the world to remember the plight of Amir Nasr-Azadani saying quote, \"the fight for equality and human rights should be praised, not punished.\" The player has been in Iranian custody since last month. State media reports he's accused of being part of a group involved in the killing of security officers at a protest and he could face the death penalty. And just days after those protests erupted across Iran, earlier this year, a 16-year-old protester went missing and later found dead. Iranian authorities said her death was a suicide, but with the help of witnesses and rights groups, CNN has uncovered a different story. Katie Polglase has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They would show me the photos from that Telegram to claim I was the admin. But I kept denying it. She says the Iranian authorities had obtained these chats despite not yet having Nadeem's phone. She believes they hacked her account. And she now faces six years in jail. While in prison, the Iranian authorities reactivated Nadeem's Telegram account. He says it was to see who tried to contact her, and revealed a network of activists she was in touch with. The same tactic may have been used with Nika's Telegram account, as weeks after her death, two of her friends noticed her account was back online. It disappeared shortly after. Nika's family are still reeling from her death. One close family member told CNN authorities are still refusing to return her phone. The Iranian authorities have not responded to CNN's request for comment. While Meta said they could not share specifics on Nika's account, they confirmed they did not originally disable it. Telegram told CNN in every case they had investigated, the device had been confiscated or the user had unwittingly made such acts as possible by not setting a two-step verification password or using a malicious app impersonating Telegram. Still, questions remain as to whether Meta, Telegram, and other tech companies are doing all they can to protect their users. As the world wakes up to the increasingly tech savvy ways regimes such as Iran are using to monitor and hunt down activists. Katie Polglase, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
