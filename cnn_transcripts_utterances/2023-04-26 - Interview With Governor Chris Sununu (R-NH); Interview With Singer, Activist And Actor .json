Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. It is a busy day in the nation's capital as South Korea's President Yoon comes to town while tensions do mountain Asia. President Biden is probably eager to smooth out tensions between them after a Pentagon leak expose the U.S. eavesdropped even on its allies. The leaders are also set to announce more U.S. support for Seoul amid growing nuclear threats from North Korea. Earlier today, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart in a much-awaited phone call. President Zelenskyy says their conversation was meaningful. But will it make Beijing exert its influence on Xi Jinping's friend for life, President Putin? With so many challenges and questions, a seat at Americas top table may seem like a poisoned chalice. But more and more are jumping into the 2024 presidential race. And my first guest tonight is tipped to join the growing crowd. New Hampshire's Republican governor, Chris Sununu. When he joined me from Manchester, he carved out a very different path from the one GOP contenders like Donald Trump are carving out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, two very good questions. And so, obviously, I am very interested. We'll make a decision this summer. Obviously, you know, I thinka lot of folks are looking to a governor, to someone who understands how systems work. They really want things to get done. I mean, at the end of the day, Republican or Democrat, Washington just hasn't gotten a whole lot done in terms of really providing opportunities and I think folks see, you know, governors as a potential. So, we've been traveling the country. I am a Republican. I want to make my party bigger. I want independents to get on board. I want the younger generation to kind of be -- that have been disenfranchised to get back on the team, so to say. I think there's -- I am not one of these people that yells at folks and I don't think anyone gets inspired by being yelled at. I try to be very positive and optimistic because I woke up in the United States of America, like let's start with a sense of gratitude. So, I think when it comes to, you know, why -- I'm not going to compare myself to Kennedy, as you did or anything, but in terms of New England, I will say this, New England governors know how systems work. We talk -- we don't just talk about more money to mental health, we talk about what are the doors of access for family? What's happening in our schools? We don't just talk about more money to drug and treatment and overdose in the -- with the opioid crisis, we talk about, how do we blow up and rebuild the system to be more modern, to have wraparound services, really attach themselves to the communities? We are very community driven here. And I just think America is looking for folks that, again, know how those systems work. It's not about headlines, it's not about political stunts, it's not about saying one thing and getting nothing done, it's not about the money in politics, because we all know that that's a problem. It's really about just brass tacks, getting back to the basics, putting people first, not government, it's not about me. I'm the governor and I will tell you it ain't about me. I'm not here to solve your problems. We are here to create opportunity, and then, let the folks do what they're going to do best in walk that.",

      "sentences": "Indeed. But you also sound very sensible. And sensible is not really the term one might use for the strongest wing of your party rightnow, the Trump wing. So, what I want to ask you is a serious question about how you are a four-time governor in a purple state, neither, you know, very Republican or Democrat, it could go either way. That is a big deal because it means you have to work by consensus on issues that matter to people. Last election, you won by 15 points. How -- can you translate that into a primary wing when there is so much flames throwing by the other candidates, notably, Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "Sure, sure, sure. So, look, everybody wants a fighter, right? You got to be able to fight, you got to be able to stand on your shoes andfight hard, but we got to remind folks, more important than being a fighter is being a winner, right? There is no use in having a fighter if they are always losing the fights, if they can't get stuff done. You know, a lot of us backed Former President Trump '16 and in '20. I was 100 percent behind him because he said he was going to drain the swamp, he didn't do it. He said he was going to fix health care, he didn't do it. He said he was going to secure the border, he didn't do it. He said he was going to be fiscally responsible, lord knows he had -- was anything but with another $8 trillion added to debt. That is real money. So, when -- those are all Republican values, right, limited government, local control, that's really what Republicans are built on and that's what we can all rally around. So, yes, I understand there's a lot of headlines and flame throwing on one side, especially with the very extreme part of our base, not dissimilar to the Democrats, right, they have their extreme side out of their base, more socialism and all that sort of thing, but most of us are in here, right, Republican or Democrat. Most of us are in here and we just want to get stuff done. And I think as the debates transpire, as the arguments get made, I think there's going to be a path and opportunity for folks like myself or others to step forward and drive forward on results driven leadership. And you got to know how to do it, not just in the private sector, but you have to know how to work within the public sphere, how to actually lead Congress, lead the Senate, give a little, to get a lot, how to negotiate. If you can't negotiate, nothing is ever going to get done, and people want results.",

As perhaps in your -- you know, yourfather's generation, you know, he worked for more moderate Republicans before he was governor. He worked in the White House. And we know, we have seen how that works for people. So, does it concern you that the latest poll, NPR, shows that 71 percent of Republicans said they think Trump should be president again? That drops on the eight points to 63 percent even if Trump is convicted of a crime. It is pretty dire, isn't it, for your vision of politics for the people in getting things done?",

So, I think what those polls are saying are people see the indictment that has come down, even of onewatching -- if you watch CNN or MSNBC, even those legal analyst, very liberal legal analysts say, this is a very weak case. They know it's very politically driven. So, when you see those polls, they are saying, do you support President -- Former President Trump? And people are saying yes because they support him because they feel like he's gone -- the people are going after him in a very political way. So, they're going to show that support. Now, does that translate to an actual vote in the ballot box -- on the ballot nine months from now? No, no, no, not necessarily at all. We haven't even had the debate yet. We haven't even had a chance to narrow down the candidates, get behind one or two others. So, there is still so much more politics to be played out. I think a lot of folks are showing support for the former president because they feel like he's, you know, the left wing, if you will, the liberal elite, whatever you want to call it is going after him. He is playing the victim card, right? This guy was supposed to be a fighter, but he's playing the victim card. And he's building a lot of sympathy from it. But I don't necessarily think it translates into some overwhelming win in terms of the ballot box. Republicans want winners and folks to get stuff done. And what -- not just winners in the nomination, that's easy, winners in November, November of '24. The last time I checked, you can't govern if you don't win. So, unless we have someone that can cross the finish line in November, I think that argument will be loud and clear from a variety of different sources as we hit these primaries, and I think voters will go in that ballot box and say, look, they might have been picking on that guy, but I need to win. And so, they're going to galvanize behind some other candidate.",

I think we do have to be careful of that populist mentality,but at the same time, you have Joe Biden that wants to, you know, just pay everybody's loan off, they want to keep the free rent program going, they want to just keep spending money, creating money, without understanding that it creates inflation and hurts the lowest income families We're going to just whistle past the graveyard when it comes to this massive homeless crisis in places like California or the massive violence issues that you are seeing in Chicago and other major cities. I mean, these are the places that Democrats should do very well, should be supporting their community and are failing them. Why? Because the populist voices are out there. So, I think it is a problem on both sides. I think both sides have to deal with it. And the bulk of America wants winners, they want folks that just get stuff done. I guess the primary process is hard, you know. And there's too much money in politics. We all get that. I think there should be massive campaign finance reform. I was at an event actually with Speaker Pelosi yesterday and she said it, I agreed with her 100 percent, all this dark money going in there that, effectively, allows incumbents to solidify themselves, right? You add gerrymandering on to that, that is a major problem. The genie is kind of out of the bottle there. I don't know how you kind of get it back in. But the gerrymandering, the big money, these are real problems that allow folks to go -- and almost push folks deeper into the left, deeper to the right corner, force them to take more extreme positions because they are more afraid of being challenged by their own party than they are by the other side. So, it's really -- that's really at the crux of it. Then you had social media and the fact that everyone wants -- just wants to sell advertising and all that sort of thing, that's not going away.",

Our words matter, whether it's how we treat people, whether it's what we say and not, you know, putting out the truth or whatever it might be.

Now, his own party and many others, you know, obviously pushed back. He had to push back and retract. You have said in your \"Washington Post\" column, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is not a territorial dispute, as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis described it this month.

But this administration, the Biden administration, doesn't even talk to China. They don't even go over. Make no mistake, China is no friend to the United States right now. They don't believe in capitalism or our western ideals, but we are going to have to be partners in some realm economically and for other reasons for quite some time. So, let's make sure that we have this relationship, make sure they know who is in charge, and that is the United States of America. You can't assert your authority over the partnership if you're not even willing to pick up the phone and have the conversation. So, this administration, I think the secretary of state has to take full responsibility, has been a complete disaster when it comes to maintaining our strength over the Pacific, maintaining our position with that relationship, whether it is technology, whether it's batteries, whether it's materials and supplies and -- we are just going to have to be partners with them and rely on them for a lot of our supply chain, at least in the near term.

Hitler, his white supremacy, fascism, so all those things we said we wanted to defeat and that America was on its way to fulfilling the greatest promise of democracy. And we said, well, this is where we have to be. When we came out expecting that the victors would be adorned with generosity of the nation for what we have done, we found that America was more cruel than it was even before we left. The Ku Klux Klan and the race issue resurrected itself viciously. Many servicemen were in conflict with the rules of the day. And we found ourselves launched into this great fight against these discriminatory laws. A lot of black servicemen paid a terrible price because they resented the laws that they came back to. One soldier in particular, named Isaac Wooden (ph), not only resisted stepping into back to the bus as he was required to do when he got mustered out of the service, but they gouged out both of his eyes with the Billy club and they blinded him and he became ward of the state for the rest of his life. Those images and those experiences really made those of us who are quite -- still quite young feel that we had another fight on our hands. We could either acquiesce and did what many of our forebears chose to do, just to give into the system, or to resist the system, which was the forerunner not too long after it came all of the things that we know about in the civil rights movement.",

We were distributed through these pockets of ghetto existence, and I just really felt that the idea of nonviolence was not a winnable idea. But slowly but surely, I saw it in his method and in his technique and in the strategy that this thing could work, and I became deeply committed to it. At first, I became committed to it because I thought was a great tactic.

But he was not too distracted with how long he would live.  It was much more important to him about what quality of life did he live, what did he do with the time he was given and his preoccupation with making it a time of quality displaced his concern and preoccupation with how long he would live.
