He is facing a potential revolt from his far right flank over his plan to bring three different foreign aid bills to the floor this weekend. It's a move his fiercest critics say could ultimately cost him the speakership. But Speaker Johnson tells me he's not worried about what could happen. He's going to do what he thinks is right, even if the bill gets Democratic votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: This is very simple, I'm operating with the smallest margin in U.S. history. I have a one vote margin, Jake. So, in order to get something into this underlying package, we have to have the votes on the floor to pass a rule. I don't have all my Republicans who agree on that rule. And that means the only way to get a rule on the floor is that it requires a couple of Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Coming up in just moments, one of those Republicans, Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, is going to talk to us. He said today he's past the point of giving grace to the speaker. What's his response to what we just heard? I'll ask him, but we're going to start with CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju.Manu, Speaker Johnson admitting, saying the quiet part out loud he needs Democrats. You know, he's -- I only have a one vote majority, and I'm only doing this because I won't get support from Republicans on that. What's going to happen? Do you think he's going to get the votes for this package? And will Democrats ultimately save his speakership if it comes down to it?",

They wanted to tie Israel aid with Ukraine aid and ultimately in the process, somewhat convoluted process, they plan to eventually get to the point where this will be all one big package, probably totaling about $95 billion. Now, the speaker indicated to you there might be some changes here and there around the edges and some of the policy provisions. But for the most part, this is very similar to the bill that passed the United States Senate about two months ago.And that is one big reason why Democrats are signaling that they may very well come to Speaker Johnson's defense. Now, I spent the day speaking to Republicans and Democrats up and down the line, it is very clear that Democrats are -- the Republicans are badly divided on this subject about this bill and about whether Johnson deserves to remain as speaker.

There will be -- there needs to be a procedural vote first to take up that bill.Typically, those procedural votes are done along party lines. But that's not going to happen this time, Democrats are going to save this rule from going down to allow the underlying bill from going forward. And what has angered more folks on the right is the decision by the speaker of the House to move border security measures, a separate bill on border security along a separate track. It will not be included as part of this big foreign aid package, even as Johnson had indicated for months that border security must be tied with Ukraine aid, which is one big reason why many of those Republicans are now gunning for him and saying that he should be out from the speakership because of that decision, Jake.",

And that had to be part of Johnson's calculation here.He knew Republicans were never going to fall in line on that issue, but Democrats would. And this is different than the fall when Kevin McCarthy was ousted by Democrats and eight Republicans. This time, Congressman Tom Swazi of New York told me that he would vote to keep Mike Johnson in the job. Adam Smith of Washington State indicated that he might as well. As well as Jared Moskowitz of Florida, just among the few who are indicating that they are not support this effort to oust Mike Johnson. And Hakeem Jeffries says it's time to save Mike Johnson, that will happen. The big question, though, Jake, can Johnson survive sustain a speakership propped up by Democrats?

If you had Ukraine with border security attached and border security, I offered numerous options, right? Not just H.R. 2, take it or leave it, but some variations of H.R. 2, maybe you could take out E-Verify and be able to move it along with it because there's some ag community that have some concerns about it.I mean, I support E-Verify, but there are things we could do to try to move it around. There's voter identification that we've got legislation that we're working on, that I've been working on with the speaker on. There's other issues that we could deal with to stop the abuse of parole. These are all things that we threw out there as options. We don't know what the rule vote would look like because we've never tried, that's the truth. We've never tried to send over an actual border security package with Ukraine so that we can make clear to our Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the Senate and in the White House that we're serious about that and that the American people want to see that first because we're dealing with that crisis from Laken Riley, to the bodies --",

This is not an open process. This is precooked to give you the exact result that came out of the Senate. The numbers that are put forward are all the defense industries numbers. It's all the lobbyist numbers. It's all the Pentagon's numbers. They're all doing it to give you exactly the same as the Senate bill. It's all precooked. It's not going to be an open process for amendments. And border is specifically left out. And I said, hey, would you just put Ukraine on the floor standalone? The answer is no. Why? Because they want to be able to manage the votes with Israel. I said we put Israel on the floor standalone. No, because Democrats want support to Israel. Look, the bottom line here is we ought to try to move this stuff to regular order. This is not regular order.
