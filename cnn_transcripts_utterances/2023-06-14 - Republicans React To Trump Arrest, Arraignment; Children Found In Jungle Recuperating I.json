Initially, right off the bat, a number of them rushing to Donald Trump's defense. Most of them doing that over Twitter and social media because Congress was not in session.Over the last couple of days, there have been more members expressing some concern about the allegations about the mishandling of classified records, as well as the allegations of obstructing this investigation into him and making misstatements to prosecutors. Now, I just caught up with some of Donald Trump -- one of Donald Trump's closest allies. That's Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He though is defending the former president saying it would have little impact on the election, the indictment. And also warning about a major blowback if Donald Trump is indicted in future cases, including the federal probe into January 6. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): It seems to be selective prosecution. So, President Trump has every right to defend himself. And politically, it probably makes him stronger in the primary. If the special counsel indicts President Trump in Washington, DC for anything related to January 6, that will be considered a major outrage by Republicans because you could convict any Republican of anything in Washington DC. And I fear that's where this is going as sort of an insurance policy. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): I do have concerns about all the news about misuse of classified information. I happen to be on the Senate Intelligence Committee and I get classified briefings on a regular basis. And what they did was unacceptable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's an often defense that we're hearing from Republicans even these are different sets of circumstances and facts in each of those cases. But some of Donald Trump's defenders trying to use the legislative process to pay -- to pay back the Biden administration of sorts.One of them, Senator J.D. Vance announcing that he would place a hold on all Justice Department nominees who are not part of that Marshall Service but U.S. Attorneys and the like. Until the Justice Department changes its approach, the prosecution is going forward. Any individual Senator can hold up the process. U.S. attorneys in particular typically are confirmed very quickly on a voice vote, but otherwise, it could go through a much more time-consuming process on the Senate floor. So, that's what Senator Vance is aiming to do as Republicans in the House, looking at other ways to try to go after the investigation. Undercut it by using the funding process on Capitol Hill. Even though not all Republicans are online, some of them lining up behind Donald Trump trying to defend him as his case unfolds. Rahel.",

He said under the Presidential Records Act, I had every right to have these documents. Absolutely not true.This Act is unequivocal. It's short. You can read it. The key part in like 15 seconds online. It says clearly that the moment a president leaves office, all of the official -- the presidential records from his or her administration belong to the federal government, belong to the National Archives. There was nothing in there that would say that a former president could take classified documents to his club residence in Florida. This Act was passed in the wake of the Richard Nixon Watergate debacle. And it was passed for the very purpose of making sure that former presidents could not take sensitive documents with them. The second claim was that the Presidential Records Act says he was supposed to negotiate with the National Archives about returning documents. Again, completely false. There was no provision in that law for negotiation. Again, it simply says that the moment the president leaves office, those documents belong to the public, to the federal government.",

So, if you're a senator, you can take the records your office created and maintain and throw them in the trash. You can give them to passers-by on the street. You can light them on fire. They are not subject to anything like the Presidential Records Act. And there was nothing wrong with this donation by former senator and now President Biden. The second claim that Trump made is that he won't let anyone look at these boxes at the University of Delaware. That is also false.
