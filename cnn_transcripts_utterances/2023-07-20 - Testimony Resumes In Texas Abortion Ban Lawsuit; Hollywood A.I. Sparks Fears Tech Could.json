That's a spike that reversed a nearly decade- long decline. Joining me now is Dr. Erika Werner. She's chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. Really tough testimony, Dr. Werner, to listen to, when we look at what is an 11.5 percent increase in infants dying in Texas. Can you tell us, is that just due to this increase in infant deaths that is caused by severe genetic and birth defects? DR. ERIKA WERNER, CHAIR, OBSTETRICS &amp; GYNECOLOGY, TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER: You know, I think we need better access to the data to be sure. But from what I have seen, it does seem that the spike is because of an increased rate of neo-natal deaths following situations like the one we just heard about.",

Most women, many of your viewers probably had their detailed anatomy scan between 18 to 20 weeks. And that's often when we find out about this. And that's in the second trimester. Which is part of the problem with all of the restrictions is that they take away the choice for patients and force them to carry pregnancies that won't lead to a live infant for months.",

But then to add on top of that, you're going to have to carry that pregnancy, you're going to have to put your body and your ability to take care of our other children at risk for months, because there are many complications that can compromise your health, the anxiety and the stress that it puts on individuals is unimaginable.",

BRONFMAN: The demand for visual effects way outstrips the supplies but there are a finite number of artists in the world that are able to execute on that demand. O'SULLIVAN: MARZ has also built an AI dubbing tool aiming to make awkward out of sync voiceovers like these a thing of the past. MARZ uses deep-fake technology to reconstruct an actor's lips to match the dubbed audio. They tried it out on me first. We sent them this short clip I shot in a CNN studio.

What's interesting about this story is actually, if you knew the right place to look, a lot of it you were already able to figure it out around since 2015. Which is when a rumor started popping up on an anonymous form called pub here. A lot of folks focused on allegations of manipulation. Places where it looked like something had been photoshopped and photoshopped out to make results look like something that they weren't. Obviously, there have been a lot more things that have come out since then. Since we started asking questions.

The report pushed Tessier-Lavigne to questions and retractions that he had repeatedly failed to issue more than two decades. The committee found -- the committee that was set up to investigate him and that he found opportunities on a scientific record on multiple different occasions.
