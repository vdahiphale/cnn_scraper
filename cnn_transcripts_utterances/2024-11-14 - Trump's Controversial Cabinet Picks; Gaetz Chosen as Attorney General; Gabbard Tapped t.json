That is the consensus from human rights watch who say Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza. We are live in Gaza in just a moment for you. Also ahead, President-elect Trump delights in appointing loyalists for critical administration roles despite the overwhelming lack of experience among his choices. We'll have a closer look at the reaction from Capitol Hill and beyond this hour. Plus, a tense match kicks off in Paris this hour. These are live pictures as thousands of police are in force for the France-Israel match after violence, if you remember, in Amsterdam, as the French President promises that France will not give in to anti-Semitism. We'll go live to France a bit later this hour. But first tonight, hopeless starving and besieged. That is the title of a new human rights watch report on Gaza that accuses Israel of carrying out a deliberate, systematic campaign of forced mass displacement of Palestinians. And it says the policy is a state-sponsored war crime that appears to meet the definition of ethnic cleansing. Our Jeremy Diamond has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For more than a year, this scene has played out in Gaza day after day on an endless loop. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to flee their homes in an elusive quest for safety, spurred by Israeli bombs and missiles, as well as military evacuation orders.",

Today, northern Gaza is the focus of that displacement, as the Israeli military mounts one of its most devastating offensives yet. This woman says Israeli loudspeakers blasted a warning to residents. It was saying either get out or die, one of the two. So, we left with our children taking only what we could carry. She says they left without food or water, just the clothes on their backs. Fleeing is one thing. Finding safety is something else altogether. Yet, another school turned shelter for the displaced was struck Thursday by the Israeli military.

And for months now, pretty much since May, aid organizations have been asking for alternative routes, because the ones that Israel designates are not secured and are not safe. And trucks are getting looted, drivers are being shot at. And so, we've been asking for alternative routes, and there are alternative routes, but those requests are not being met.

Well, Israel's new Defense Minister says the IDF hasexpanded its military ground offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. And it's also escalating airstrikes. The blasts rocked the south of Beirut this morning for the third straight day. Israel says it's part of an ongoing effort to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities. But despite the repeated attacks, Hezbollah is still keeping up its own strikes as well. It says it launched at least 20 attacks against Israel and Israeli troops in Lebanon on Wednesday using drones, missiles and rockets. Well, state media in Syria, meantime, is reporting one of the deadliest Israeli strikes on Damascus in months. It says 15 people were killed in attacks on several residential buildings including women and children. Israel's military said it targeted a Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. Well, shockwaves are being felt in Washington as well as beyond after Donald Trump's choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the U.S. Justice Department, the very agency, of course, that investigated Gaetz over allegations related to sex trafficking. The now former Florida Congressman was a stunning pick for Attorney General given his very limited experience as an attorney, and his history of clashing with both fellow Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Gaetz was at the center of a Justice Department investigation over sex crimes and drug use that ended without him being criminally charged. He was also the subject of a House ethics probe, but after he abruptly resigned from Congress on Wednesday, it's unclear if its committees findings will be released publicly. Top Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach to Gaetz's nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  I barely know Gaetz. All I know is he likes picking fights on social media. He'll have to deal with that in committees, but I don't know his background. I'm going to look at it and give him a fair hearing. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  The process I will follow here is what I've done with everybody. I will -- elections have consequences, he chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee and he will be asked hard questions and we'll see how he does.",

In fact, on Capitol Hill, you are hearing from a number ofRepublicans that they would like to take a look at it as part of their vetting process, even if it is not publicly released by the committee. But I actually did just catch up with Chuck Grassley. He's going to be the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They will be the committee that's responsible for vetting Matt Gaetz's nomination to be attorney general. And he did not give a definitive answer as to whether or not he wanted to see that report. It ultimately will be up to him and his staff what they request as part of their vetting of the candidate. And you know, it's a really interesting moment because Chuck Grassley really has this history of being someone who takes whistleblowers really seriously, takes his congressional oversight responsibilities really seriously. I would note also, there are other Republicans who just have concerns about some past statements that Gaetz has made about the Justice Department, yes, they are concerned about this ethics report that's floating out there. But they also, you know, may have other concerns about just his tenure, his style, his bombastic-ness. There's also a number of Republicans who have voiced concerns to me and my colleagues about the fact that he was really the ringleader of that effort to oust Kevin McCarthy just a little over a year ago now. So, there's a lot of reasons why people might have concerns about Matt Gaetz, but obviously, the question of whether this ethics report is going to be released by the committee, whether it gets released to the Senate as part of their vetting, that is still very much a jump ball right now, and something that a lot of lawmakers, especially Democrats are looking into.",

It was described tome by one source as we were watching everyone melt down, and they knew this was going to come.   It's not as though they thought that Matt Gaetz was going to go over easily with Republicans, Democrats and the general public. However, what I am told is that they simply don't care. I mean, the idea is that you want to get everyone that you nominate confirmed. But what I was told essentially by these senior advisors is that they're aware that some people won't get confirmed. However, Donald Trump, because he particularly -- because he won the popular vote, feels as though he has a mandate to hire people and bring people on who he believes will do what he said, Donald Trump said he would do on the campaign trail. And one of his biggest promises was to essentially gut the Department of Justice, move it back underneath the executive so that he would have control, or that the President would have control over the Department of Justice. Matt Gaetz has been out there saying this for quite some time. But the other thing to look at here is how they are viewing some of these various cabinet positions. And that is that, a lot of these figures are going to be just simply that figureheads of the department. It doesn't mean that they're not going to do anything, but what it does mean is that they're going to serve as the chief communicator. We know something that's very important to Donald Trump is how these people and how people close to him communicate about him, communicate about what he's doing, his talking points, particularly when it comes to television. And he was meeting with these various candidates for attorney general, and he didn't believe that any of them would have the kind of fire that Matt Gaetz had. Now, we do know this came together last minute. Essentially, the entire thing unfolded on his plane ride from Washington back to Palm Beach. However, they are not unhappy with the choice. They're sticking by it, and they do believe they're going to do anything they can to get him confirmed.",

These pictures are from inside the home of Francisco Wanderley Luiz, the main authorities -- the man, I should say authorities have identified as killing himself in a blast outside the court building. Federal police detonated explosive devices after raiding Luiz's home. Wednesday's attack prompted the evacuation of court staff as well as legislators there in Brasilia. The incident comes just days before Brazil hosts global leaders for the G20, and that's taking place in Rio de Janeiro.

Great to have you here. Let me pick up with what you wrote in that article when you're comparing what the three of them have in common. You write, none of them, Gaetz, Gabbard, and Hegseth have shared an ideology. What brings them together is not just fidelity to Trump, you say, but a shared sense of having been persecuted by the departments they've been nominated to lead. It's what they share with Trump as well as one another, and it's their main credential to serve under him. Is this then -- in your view, is this a new administration fueled by retribution? DAVID A. GRAHAM, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC:  I think it is. And you know, this is what Trump promised he would bring on the campaign trail. And it's always hard to know, you know, how much a politician means what they say and how they'd really go about what they would say on the campaign trail.

PLEITGEN (through translator):  Donald Trump said that he definitely wants to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. Do you think this is possible, through talks, through military action, what do you think? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I don't know how Donald Trump can resolve this. But I would really like this to be resolved as soon as possible and resolve in the most peaceful way possible that is, through negotiations, and through the actions that are happening now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  You know, there's still a bit of ambition here, with those in power. And I don't know if Trump will stick to his line. But I hope that there will be a good agreement between Russia and Ukraine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Yes, through negotiations of course. I don't think any military action will -- who benefits from this? Neither Russia nor American, it's definitely not beneficial. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  While Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he's willing to talk to Donald Trump even before Trump takes office, Putin's foreign minister ripping into the U.S. and its incoming administration. Washington's fundamental attitude to Ukrainian and European allies will not change in the sense that the United States will always strive to keep under its control everything that happens in the near NATO area and naturally in NATO itself, he said. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  And that was Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, there speaking at the end. And the Kremlin, Isa, was asked about all of this as well. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying, of course, the Russians and the Russian government are watching some of the picks that are being made by Donald Trump. At the same time, they also say that is not their top priority. And so, at this point in time, they are not going to officially comment on any of them. Isa.",

Iwonder then, from what you're hearing, from your sources in terms of how they see this new administration, how they will handle the war in Ukraine? Because you and I were talking a couple of days ago, over the uncertainty and the unpredictability of someone like President Trump. Does Putin -- the Putin administration, they believe that they know him better and they know what to expect from him now?",

I do believe that they think that a lot of the foreign policy that will be made in the upcoming Trump administration will very much depend on Donald Trump, despite whoever the secretary of state is, who the director of national intelligence is and who the national security adviser is, they believe that it will be Donald Trump himself who will want to end the war in Ukraine, who would want to try and find a way to do that, and of course, the way to do that goes through Vladimir Putin. So, I do believe that on the part of the Kremlin, on the part of the Russian authorities, there is a good deal of optimism there that they could be able to end the war on Ukraine on terms that are favorable for Russia.
