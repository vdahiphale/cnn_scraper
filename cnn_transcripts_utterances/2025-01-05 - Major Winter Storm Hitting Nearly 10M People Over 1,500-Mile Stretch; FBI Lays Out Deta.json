A massive winter storm is targeting nearly 70 million people. A dangerous mix of snow, ice and high winds is hitting the Central Plains states already today and tracking all the way to the Mid- Atlantic Coast. NOAA's Weather Prediction Center warns some areas like Kansas City and Indianapolis, could see the heaviest snowfall in over a decade. The governors of Kentucky, Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri and West Virginia have already declared states of emergency, while Maryland is under a state of preparedness. Officials are warning of treacherous road conditions. And if all of that snow and ice isn't enough, then brutal cold temperatures will set in. The South, right there, facing a very different threat. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas with severe storms and hail expected to pummel those states. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking all of this. I mean, it really is cutting across at least half of the country with severe conditions.",

This will be a problem for two reasons. One, if there are long standing power outages, that means no access to heat. That could really be a problem. Number two, that means any of the snow and ice that falls will likely stay around, because you have these temperatures well below freezing that will last through the next several days. In fact, through the next seven days, we're looking at more than 70 percent of the country with these temperatures at or below freezing. So that means, again a lot of the ice and snow is just going to freeze and hang around. Look at these overnight low temperatures. In Chicago, we're dipping into the teens by Wednesday morning. And New York, again well below freezing. Same thing in D.C. Even Atlanta, we have our morning lows in the 20s as we go through the next couple of days. So a big chill on the way on the backside of this storm, Fred.",

And yes, it was a very significant press conference because essentially, FBI officials released two crucial pieces of information. Number one, that the attacker, Jabbar, visited New Orleans twice before the attack on New Year's Day. The first time he came on October 30th, stayed for a few days. And what's significant about that first trip is that he rode a bicycle through the streets here in the French Quarter. And this is the number two fact that they revealed that he was wearing what is called -- what are called -- what is known as Meta glasses. These are glasses that have video recording capabilities. So in essence, he was riding his bike through these streets and as he was doing so, he was recording all of that. Now, Jabbar visited New Orleans again in November. That was the second time before the attacks. A new revelation, officials say the attacker planted two improvised explosive devices that didn't go off because he used the wrong device to try to detonate them. During the same press conference, they also talked about the travels that he went to, including going to a trip to the Middle East. This is how Special Agent Myrthil explained it.

And this, as I said, this is not -- the army doesn't train their people to make IEDs and run people over. This is not training you get in the army at any kind of, you know, normal level. So I think what happens is we have to determine where he got his training and his communications are going to be absolutely essential.

I was came down to Plains and he was my final interview to get the job at Habitat in 2005. And I expected, you know, a whole retinue and a -- and a group of and staff.And once I was cleared through secret security and I think their house was bigger than the Carter's house, you know, he greeted me at the door. He and Mrs. Carter sat holding hands in a double rocker and just were so kind to me, and that pattern continued all the way through his compassion and caring about people. And I had the chance over the years to be with some of the most powerful people in the world and some of the least powerful people. And President Carter was always the same person. And I think that personal integrity, along with that great drive to make the world better and personal kindness, I will always remember.",

The bad news is there's never been a greater gap between what it costs to create a home and what families can afford. The last five years have been tragically bad with the pandemic and inflation and all the other things that have happened to housing costs. So we now have a deficit here in the United States of, depending on whose math you use, between 3 million and 6 million units of housing. And that's one of the reasons we're seeing housing inflation of almost40 percent from five years ago. And so that's a huge burden on families, whether you're renting or trying to buy. And the same issues are true globally. So we have a -- if you use U.N. data, 1.8 billion people living in substandard housing. So there's still plenty of need for the work.",

It would be lovely of affiliate directors and families who -- who for whom President Carter actually worked on their houses, visiting the president, lying in repose at the Capitol. And my wife and I will be at the funeral on Thursday.But I think the most important thing and the best way to honor President Carter is to keep the work going. If there's time for a short story, he -- one of our bad stories that turned out well was we were building in Canada in 2017, and we built 150 homes across Canada for the 150th anniversary of the country, and one of the main sites was Winnipeg. President Carter was working hard, as he always does, and worked a little too hard. It was a very hot day and got a little bit dizzy picking something up and out of abundance of caution. Secret Service rushed him off and unfortunately all the cameras were lined up. We were about to have a press conference. And President Carter called me slightly grumpily from the car, being irritated, being pulled off the build site, and I asked him, what do you want me to tell the press? And he said, tell them I'm fine and to get back to work. And of course, he was back working the next day. But I think that message is still the right message. Knowing his faith that he is with our God and back with his beloved Rosalynn, and I think his message to all of us would be, I'm fine, get back to work.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, one of the ways they have been preparing for tomorrow is by making sure that it happened at all. Remember, if the House did not elect a speaker by January 6th, then the certification of the election could not take place.And so, that is one of the reasons why you saw Donald Trump. So, involved last week with ensuring that Speaker Mike Johnson had the votes to continue with his role, leading the Republican conference and the House of Representatives. And so you saw him. Vocally support the speaker Johnson publicly, as well as make phone calls on his behalf during those sort of tense moments when it wasn't clear that Johnson had the support he needed. So that is clearly one way that they have had this date on their mind. But look, this January 6th is normally a pretty mundane process that doesn't necessarily attract a lot of attention. And the only reason it is this time around is because of what happened four years ago and because of what Donald Trump is promising to do for the individuals who were part of the January 6th attack on the Capitol in 2021. So that that is what is making this notable. Otherwise, its just basically a date on the calendar. And his transition, which is now two weeks away. Hmm.",

Lots of Joe Burrow, lots of Ja'Marr Chase. Burrows had an MVP season statistically, leads the league in passing yards and passing touchdowns. And with continued plays like that, he is still a legitimate contender. How about this throw and catch to chase again? Fourth quarter, Bengals up 16-7. Chase is like poetry in motion. First player in NFL history with 1,700 yards receiving and 17 touchdowns in a season. Bengals win 19-17 and now grab their popcorn and watch to see if the Broncos lose to the Chiefs and Miami loses to the Jets. Lamar Jackson and the Ravens hosting the Browns with a chance to clinch their division on the line. Lamar continues his sorcery touchdown to Mark Andrews. Lamar finishes the season with just four interceptions with 41 passing touchdowns. But watch this one -- Rashod Bateman. Jackson pulls the Steph Curry turns and celebrates before the ball is even in the bucket. First player with 4,000 passing yards and 800 rushing. But best play of the day, big man interception Michael Pierce, all 355 pounds of him, stepping in front of that one and then taking a slide to seal the win. His team goes absolutely berserk. Baltimore are your AFC North champs after a 35-10 beat-down of the Browns.",
