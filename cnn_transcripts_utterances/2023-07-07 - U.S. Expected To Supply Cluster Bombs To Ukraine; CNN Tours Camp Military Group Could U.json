But first, your headlines this hour. The Biden administration is expected to announce a new military aid package to Ukraine that includes cluster munitions, weapons that are banned in more than 120 countries. Experts warn they pose a threat to civilians because they may leave behind unexploded bombs. Media outlets, including CNN have visited a site in Belarus, where the country's president says Wagner fighters might be housed should they be transferred to the country and two Palestinians have been killed in Nablus during an Israeli operation in the occupied West Bank. Latest deaths coming just days after Israel's largest West Bank military operation in decades that ended in Jenin. Welcome back to Connect the World. In the next hour, we expect Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul. The conversation will focus on the vital Grain Export Deal, Turkey helped broke with Russia. It expires in just 10 days. And it is seen as a crucial cog for the global food security. So tonight we ask will the deal be allowed to expire. For more than that, let's go back to standards Ben Wedeman in eastern Ukraine. Ben, look, meeting happening very shortly. grand deal, as we said expires in 10 days. Can Zelenskyy get Erdogan to help extend this deal?",

He was critical along with United Nations in working out this deal in the first place last year, and therefore, certainly he is the one who could perhaps convince Vladimir Putin to renew this arrangement because the Russians have complained that as a result of Western sanctions, they don't have the ability to export their goods in the way they would like to at a time when Ukraine is able to over the last year export more than 30 million tonnes of wheat and other foodstuffs. So certainly, President Zelenskyy is eager to make sure that this deal continues. But obviously, the final decision really comes from Moscow, and we've had no indication that the Russians are willing to budge on this yet. In the past, they have expressed objections and threatened not to renew the agreement. But perhaps President Erdogan can pull this off. Now also, when the two leaders meet President Zelenskyy is going to be talking with his Turkish counterpart about Sweden's membership in NATO. So Turkey has objected to that, because they feel that the Swedes have not been harsh enough on Kurds who are sympathetic to the creation of a Kurdish homeland on Turkish territory living in Sweden. And until he's satisfied with that, those objections are essentially a veto power over Sweden's membership in NATO. Eleni.",

But this time, Russia has three solid concrete demands, which are, which can be categorized under three headings. One is about the insurance problems, you know, Russians have been having difficulty finding insurance for their shipments of grain and fertilizers from the Black Sea ports. So they have been overcharged and insurance has proven to be an impediment to their grain exports under the deal. Secondly, they are asking the readmission of their agricultural bank to the SWIFT system so that they can receive payments on the deal. That is the second point of concern for the Russians. And finally, they are demanding the resumption of transit of ammonia from Russia, via Ukraine to a Ukrainian port in Odessa. And of these three Zelenskyy has power, has power to exercise, has power to influence only one. That is the transit of ammonium through the Ukrainian territory. The rest depends on the -- on the decision of the countries which impose -- which have imposed sanctions on Russia. Therefore, under the circumstances, Erdogan will try to find alternative benefits for Russia to remain in the deal or to renew the real deal for another 120 days. And it seems that Russians have been keeping a very close eye on the outcome of the visit, as the Kremlin spokesperson himself stated so. But under the circumstances, indeed, there is very little Erdogan can offer to Putin to get him on board again, with the deal.

So at the strategic level in the Turkey contributes to Russia's resilience by not imposing sanctions on Russia, but at the tactical and operation level, it supports Ukraine substantially. And both sides have learned to live with the fact that Turkey has a differentiated role to play in that conflict. So for Putin, I guess this is not a huge consideration because the alternative is to sever all the links with Turkey and loose -- push Turkey to the Western alliance totally and have a Turkey which impose sanctions on Russia.",

And for the most part, empty at the moment. And that's because the plan to invite Wagner and its leader over here into Belarus after their military uprising in Russia now appears to be on hold. Recent satellite images showed how quickly the camp at Osipovichi was transformed, ready to house large numbers of troops at short notice and the Belarusian general who gave us access, told me Wagner forces could still be deployed here if the political decision is made. There's room for up to 5000 soldiers at this camp alone themselves. And we have other facilities too. Have you been told to prepare this camp for the possible arrival of Wagner fighters? Is that what you were told? We've prepared it for training and for territorial defense, he says. It was the sudden announcement by the leader of Belarus that neither Wagner nor its leader was in fact in the country that seems to have thrown planning into disarray. Lukashenko insists his offer, which helps bring Wagner's armed uprising to an end last month is still on the table. But with new questions over Wagner and its leader, it seems unlikely this would-be Wagner camp will ever now be filled. Matthew Chance, CNN Osipovichi in Belarus (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is not a typo. Scientists are pointing to the climate crisis combined with this year's El Nino. And they say the Earth's average daily temperature touched 17.23 degrees Celsius on Thursday. That's 63 degrees Fahrenheit, I want you to remember, this is just an average number for the entire world. Temperatures in the low 60s Fahrenheit may not sound that hot to anyone sweating through a summer heatwave. But researchers say this figure represents a new indicator that Earth's climate is heating up way faster than anticipated. Now summer is in full swing. And that means more people looking to cool off at the beach. With that officials in the U.S. are ramping up shark patrols after a spike of shark bites. Five people were bitten in just two days along the beaches of the Long Island region of New York. I want to bring in Polo Sandoval joining us now from Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York. Do we have an explanation as to why all the sharks are moving closer? And why there are still people swimming on the beach despite the sharks?",

And if you have baitfish, you're likely to have sharks and what is what we've all we've always seen sharks. The concern, though, is just what we saw this week alone, at least five incidents up and down New York state beaches here, non- life threatening injuries that these folks state. Authorities believe that it was -- that they were victims of shark bites. Yes. Earlier this week, there was a large group of what was initially believed to be sharks just off the coast here. Today, we find out that officials have amended that saying that it was in fact a school of harmless fish. But nonetheless, when you look, when you take in the sights, it's very clear that people are still coming out to enjoy the day. Of course, people are still keeping in mind that it was just yesterday that it was about a 10-foot shark that was located off the coast here. The lifeguard springing into action, asking people to get out of the water for a little while allowing for that shark to go up back out to sea. So it's certainly not keeping people from going out and enjoying. But it certainly is something that folks are at least keeping in mind. And this is why New York State officials are not only on the beaches via lifeguards, keeping a close eye on the water, but also in the air. We've seen helicopters, we've seen boats, we've seen drones being deployed up and down the New York State coast to keep a watchful eye on the water, warning people of any potential dangers.
