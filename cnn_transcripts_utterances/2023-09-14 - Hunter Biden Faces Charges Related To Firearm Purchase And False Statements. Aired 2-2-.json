It really depends on the person's prior record and it really is on a sliding scale of what the criminal activity was, what kind of gun it was, if it was a particularly dangerous firearm, if it was used, discharged.In this case, with Hunter Biden having a regular handgun for a brief period of time, not using it or discharging it in any other way, having no prior convictions on his record, at least as far as I know, he would be looking at not very much time, maybe around a year. Twelve months could be even less than that, depending on whether they consider the gun to have been possessed for sporting purposes or collection. And I don't know if he could make a case for that or not. But you know, we're talking about probably somewhere in the 12-month neighborhood, I would think.",

They have filed charges against the son of President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, three different charges, two of them related to lying on statements in an effort to buy a firearm. The third charge for actually possessing that firearm as a prohibited person.A reminder, the case being brought by Special Counsel Daniel Weiss is based on Hunter Biden's purchase of this weapon as he wrote in this form that he was not abusing narcotics and later in a biography wrote that he did. We have a team of reporters and analysts with us to break down this news. First to Paula Reid. Paula, you're getting some new reporting about what's going on.",

They really thought that they were going to be successful with that plea deal that they had negotiated. Even when it first fell apart, they felt like ultimately the judge would approve it. And when that didn't happen, there was quite a bit of despair because Hunter Biden is facing millions and millions of dollars in legal debt from his various legal issues, and it's very difficult for him to find employment right now or raise money. So these charges today, I am told these came as news to their team. They have not scheduled an initial appearance or how exactly he'sgoing to turn himself in, right? Will he be arrested? Well, typically you arrange a time to turn yourself in. But I've also been asking a lot about his relationship with his father and with the White House. And I'm told by multiple sources that he's actually still very close to his dad. They talk frequently, but they don't talk about this criminal case a lot. I'm told that Hunter doesn't want to burden his father with it.",

That has been the official line from the White House ever since this began. The White House has pointed out the Trump appointment of David Weiss as essentially legitimizing the investigation back when it was expected to result in a plea deal, and also suggested that the five-year nature of the investigation meant that wherever it was going to end up was going to be done in a way that evaluated all of the facts at hand.Certainly, it has taken a different turn than the White House, than the president had expected. The president was said to be relieved when this was headed toward a plea deal, and that when the plea deal fell apart, there was quite a bit of uncertainty and frustration that entered the situation. But when I spoke to some people who are close to the White House about the efforts by Republicans to try to tie the president to the actions of his son, they said, at this point, the only thing the president is guilty of is loving his son and keeping him close, and that aides within the White House know that. They know not to cross the president when it comes to issues involving Hunter, that he remains extremely close, as Paula said to his father. The two men speak regularly. Hunter is still invited to official White House events. He's invited on the president's plane, on his vacations, and that despite these legal troubles, the president has not been willing to keep Hunter at a distance. And so that is the nature of this relationship behind the scenes at the White House. There is said to be some frustration that this did not end the way that it was expected to end just a few weeks ago.",

So you have Republicans claiming there's a two tiered system.[14:05:09] You're trying our president in a way you're not trying. But the fact is this is the first time the Justice Department has ever charged the son of a sitting president happens to be Joe Biden's son.

They have tried to do that in a hyper partisan world that we live in. Everything has political implications. This of course has political implications for a variety of reasons. You remember our polling that just came out. Fifty five percent of Americans believe that President Biden acted inappropriately around what the handling of this investigation into his son.Again, as you mentioned there's no evidence that the president has done anything wrong. But when you look at that and you separate it out into Democrats and Republicans it tells a story that I think everyone is going to think is exactly the story we would expect which is that Democrats a much smaller group of Democrats think that that happened. It is the Republicans, a much larger swath of Republican voters believe that President Biden has acted inappropriately here. But the fact remains that in a general election this is going to be an issue and it is going to come up. And I covered President Biden's campaign in 2020 and it was already coming up. The Hunter issue came up again and again. And they went back to what we are hearing still from them which is this is a president that loves his son. He has struggled. And so the question is to voters is is the cake bake with Biden in the sense that you already factor in Hunter and you've made your decision on how you feel like everybody has behaved there.

And they did this over objections from the White House. There are senior advisors in the Biden White House who would prefer that Hunter just you know take his licks. Stay quiet. Don't engage. But it got to a point where Hunter and one of his lawyers said no we don't want to do that anymore. We want to punch back. He brought on a high profile and very aggressive attorney Abby Lowell who's been working with his longtime friend and attorney Kevin Morris and they have started filing off lawsuits filing off letters to the Hill seeking ethics investigations into certain Republican lawmakers.Just yesterday we saw them file a lawsuit against a former Trump -- Trump White House official who they accused of hacking into his iPhone and the backup for his laptop. Again this is it sounds clear he's going to be successful. But this is a much more aggressive forward leaning strategy. It makes waves. It makes headlines and it makes some people at the White House a little crazy. They would prefer that this not be the approach. But also we need to do something. We can't just sit here. So this has caused tension with some White House advisors. But again every source I've spoken with that our colleagues have spoken with on all sides agree that the president and his son are extremely close and he has his support.

Now, this investigation went on for five years. They looked at a lot of different things for a time. They did look about questions, questions of possible foreign lobbying, things like that. And when they came to have to decide on what charges they were going to bring to potentially pursue this plea deal, they believe that their strongest case, the case that they could support with evidence, possibly beyond reasonable doubt, it had to go to trial, would be the tax charges. And then they're diverting this gun charge.And I think as Kara and others have said, you have to look at this and ask whether this case would be brought against anyone else. And Hunter Biden's attorneys believe it would not. They believe that for a first- time person who failed to pay their taxes for the first time, paid them back with penalties and fees, that that is not a criminal federal prosecution that would be brought against other people. The gun charge, it's really interesting to watch how that is changing almost in real time because the Fifth Circuit recently ruled on this issue. It's something Hunter Biden's legal team was watching very closely, that people with prior drug use should not necessarily be barred from owning a firearm. And they believe that if that ever went to trial, that they would be able to easily win. It's interesting that laws that expand gun rights, something his father has fought against, could actually wind up helping his son here. But they would argue to you, they've argued to me, that they do not believe this is a case that would be brought against anyone else. But to your question, when the Justice Department, a Trump-appointed prosecutor, came to present his case, the plea deal that he had was focused on tax crimes and a gun charge, neither one of which had anything to do with President Biden.",

But at the same time, I think a lot of voters also look at the Biden family in context and they'll say, yeah, he lost his wife and his daughter decades ago in a terrible car accident. He lost his son, Boda, cancer. And now he's got a son who has admittedly had substance abuse issues. And so there might be some sympathy there, too. So I think Republicans need to be really careful.

I mean sometimes you might use the gun charges in connections with other crimes that you're charging but to somehow go out and suggest that a particular time you said something that was wrong and had it for a short amount of time that's different.This is not a situation where you had a convicted felon in possession of a gun. That's a totally different case than it is filling out a form like on this questionnaire about whether or not it's time he was using drugs or addicted to drugs at the time which I guess gives some room a little bit a little bit of a squishy answer perhaps at that particular moment he's filling out the questionnaire. But we just we just wouldn't have done it. And so it is in fact the law. That's that's the truth. But most of the time we spent the resources we had and we were always asking for more resources. We were looking for things like child sex traffickers whether or not there was civil rights violence. Those types of cases where I think the money of the federal government is is better spent. I have more concern I think about the nexus and the status of the case given that there was agreement to resolve all the charges and then suddenly to see the case brought back to life. Lawyers don't like to do that because it certainly weighs on your credibility as you deal with other lawyers in the future and whether or not they can count on your word.
