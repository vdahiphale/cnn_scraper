This bank has been in trouble for years. But they were basically pushed to do this build -- deal by the regulators because Credit Suisse was facing this crisis of confidence. They were losing a lot of deposits. So, the Swiss government actually had to sweeten the deal. They had to provide $9 billion to protect UBS from losses. This -- the Swiss central bank is also providing up to $200 billion in loans to make this happen. Now, a lot of people are probably wondering, why do we care about what's happening in the Swiss banking system?
