One of those concessions, lowering the threshold of how many individuals it would take to call for a vote to oust the speaker from five to just one person.

These handful of folks want a weak speaker with a four- vote majority.

I know that you were on that call. Let's just start with some news that we just got and get you to respond to. Damar Hamlin's father Mario Hamlin addressed the entire Bills team on a Zoom call on Wednesday, we're told, to personally update everyone in attendance on his son. That's per a source. Mario Hamlin informed the Bills that Damar was making progress, and in the words of one source, the team needed it. And I know that you have been closely, you were on that call, and you have also been in contact with the family. So what do you know, and what do you think of this call by the father?IAN RAPOPORT, NATIONAL INSIDER, NFL NETWORK AND NFL.COM:  First of all, as far as the call by the father, I was talking to a source explaining to me that it was pretty powerful. It was certainly something where the team felt it. This has been progressing over the last day or so, because his uncle talked to NFL Network I'd say about 24 hours ago about originally needed 100 percent oxygen, now down to needing 50 percent. This is all good. Things are heading into a positive direction. I talked to Jordon Rooney who has a family spokesman over the past 48 hours, very close to Damar Hamlin, told me this morning things are heading in the right direction. I would expect a statement from the family at some point today, updating us on that. But the emotion that Troy Vincent showed is something that you've seen all across the NFL. This is not something that affects Bills fans. It's really not something that affects football fans. It's something that has affected everyone. And Troy Vincent kind of encapsulated that. And on that call, so much of the focus was on how fortunate they are, how fortunate Damar Hamlin is, the unbelievably quick medical response and how integral that was just in essentially saving his life. It has been, it has really been an incredible thing to see, to witness, and to cover.",

The Guardian which is a newspaper in the United Kingdom, says the royal siblings were arguing over Harry's wife, Meghan when Harry says William \"ramps him by the collar and knocked him to the floor.\" CNN anchor Bianca Nobilo joins us live in London with more. Wow. This is the -- I think like they -- you know there's racism allegation, which is huge. And then there's this. This is really stunning. BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, I completely concur. I think those are the two most dramatic allegations that we've had from the Sussex camp throughout this entire debacle, this period of tension between the two brothers. I'll just read the entire quote that we've had published by The Guardian for our viewers because it really is salacious and full of detail. He -- Prince Harry described, he sat down the water, he being Prince William, called me another name then came at me. It all happened so fast. So very fast. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dog's bowl which cracked under my back. The piece is cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out. Now, Prince Harry goes on apparently to say that Prince William did come and apologize looking being quite saddened and aggrieved. He also said that he didn't tell his wife that would have happened immediately and that she actually noticed some of the visible signs on his back.
