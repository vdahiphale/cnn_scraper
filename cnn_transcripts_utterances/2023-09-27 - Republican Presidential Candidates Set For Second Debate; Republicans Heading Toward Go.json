Prosecutors saying that they both received cash, gold and a luxury car in exchange for favors for the Egyptian government. More than half of Senate Democrats are now calling on him to resign. Last night, when that number was slightly smaller, but not that much, he dismissed the idea outright, telling reporters that he will not step down because he's innocent.

The hearing lasted only about 30 minutes.And he -- we're waiting for him to exit the courthouse now. What happened inside was that he sat there in the court flanked between his attorneys. He sat with his hands clasped, and he really only addressed the judge twice to say, \"Yes, Your Honor.\" His lawyer entered the plea of not guilty. And when he entered the courtroom, he came through a side door, which is where defendants walk through and where defendants were kept. And you could see a cell in that hallway. So, it really gives you a sense of the seriousness of the moment. Now, this arraignment, again, only took about 30 minutes. He was released on a $100,000 personal reconnaissance bond. He has to surrender his official -- his personal passport. He can keep his official passport. And he also has a restriction where he can't have any contact with staff members of his office, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or political advisers who have knowledge of this investigation outside the presence of counsel. And as we know from the charges in this case, they relate a lot to his time on the Senate and these allegations that he took bribes in exchange for helping and aiding Egypt. So you can imagine a number of staffers were interviewed by investigators, and that is why this provision is part of his bail and his release. Now, he didn't answer any questions by reporters in the hallways. And, in fact, when he entered the courthouse today, he walked in holding his wife's hand, a co-defendant, a partner in crime, according to authorities. And when he left the courtroom today, they walked out again hand in hand, so a sign of alliance between them. Now, she also entered a plea of not guilty in the case. She was released on $250,000 bond secured by their home. And she has to surrender her passport. They both have some travel restrictions, though the senator's is less severe because he is a senator. But the other two defendants that appeared today also pleaded not guilty. We are getting a sense that they are starting to wrap up this process. They have to sign paperwork for their bonds, and they also have to surrender their personal passports. So that is what's taking place inside the courthouse now. But we're told that it's beginning to wrap up. We're expecting the senator and his wife to leave momentarily. Their car is out front. That's why you see the pack of cameras around it waiting for him. There's also microphones to see here. We understand he's walking out right now.",

Now, this is a picture of King on that tour before making a run for it. You see the back of his head there. Of course, this is a rare move, this release, considering North Korea's brutal record on human rights.

It is something that we are still trying to understand.North Korea saying today that they were expelling Private King, that he had confessed to crossing the border illegally. Why exactly North Korea decided to do this today is still unclear. But what we do know now from senior Biden administration officials is that, earlier this month, North Korean officials told Swedish officials that they were willing to release Private King. Now, why Sweden? Well, the U.S. doesn't have an embassy in Pyongyang. So, Sweden is what is known as a protected power. They represent U.S. interests in Pyongyang. Now, this was the culmination, this release is the culmination of months of what Biden administration officials are calling intense diplomacy, not just involving the U.S., North Korea and Sweden, but other countries as well. Certainly, China was involved because we know that Private King left through China. Now, over the course of the summer -- he's been held since July 18 -- there were concerns that Private King would be used for propaganda purposes. Those never really materialized. There were concerns, of course, about his health. He is said, according to these officials, to be in good health, to be very happy, very eager to get home to his family. There are also major questions about what North Korea might have gotten in exchange. Biden administration officials are insistent that there were no concessions, that there was no exchange here, that this is North Korea releasing Private King. Now, Private King was taken from North Korea to China. From China, he flew to South Korea to a military facility, and then he is set to fly onwards home to the United States. Boris, we have heard from King's mother. She said that she will be forever grateful to the United States Army and all its interagency partners. Now, when Private King arrives back in the United States, he's going to go to Texas. He's going to go to a medical facility called Brooke Army Medical Center for both mental and physical evaluation and treatment. Big question still, Boris, about what will happen in terms of disciplinary procedures, because he had been -- he was being sent home back in July because of an assault that he carried out in South Korea. Those issues, we're told by U.S. officials, will be addressed once Private King is back up on his feet -- Boris.",

Swedish officials had to fly into North Korea, and then they had to accompany him all the way to the North Korea-China border. The U.S. embassy had to coordinate with the Chinese government to pick him up on the Chinese side of that border and then get him out of China. And so all of that is a huge logistical operation. As for what the North Koreans -- why did the North Koreans let him go? I think that's the $65,000 -- $64,000 question, something that Private King may have some insight into once he gets stateside. But suffice to say they didn't see the value of holding him greater than the value of releasing him. And it shows that they don't want to deal with the United States. The Kim regime is pointing towards China. They're dealing with Putin. They don't want to talk to us, even to get something out of releasing an American hostage. That's not a good sign at all.",

But the Biden administration doesn't seem interested in that. We can see this as a sort of moment of cooperation, but it doesn't portend or indicate that there's going to be any real progress. I think all the signs, other signs coming out of North Korea state that they're going to get worse. They're going to build more missiles and more nuclear weapons and become closer to our adversaries.

But that bill is dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is pledging to his members that, no matter what, if the votes are there or not, on Friday, he is going to bring a short-term resolution to the floor of the House and force his members to vote on it. The expectation, the hope from some of his allies is that some of those hard-liners who have been saying all of this time that they are opposed to any short-term spending bill, that they will start to see the light, given the fact that they are closing in on a potential government shutdown on Saturday night. That, of course, is a huge gamble from McCarthy, because time after time, over the last several weeks, his hard-liners have proven again and again that they are not willing to cave. And one of those members, Andy Ogles, who came out of the House conference meeting this morning where leadership was trying to encourage their members to unite, to be a team, to work together, he said he was still a no on a short-term spending bill and to prepare for turbulence ahead.

He has delivered on issues that are important to not just Republicans, but general election voters. And he's going to make the case Donald Trump has been a loser on the general election stage. I am a winner. And he certainly has the policies and the winning record to win just -- not just the primary, but the general election.

This is a case to make for small-dollar and also large-dollar donors, to make your case directly to them.I think one of their challenges is, we have heard a lot from whether it's DeSantis or Nikki Haley or others that Donald Trump can't win. And the reality is, the polling shows that he's neck and neck with Joe Biden. The latest poll that we saw is sort of an outlier that has him well up on Biden. Anything that shows that Donald Trump isn't a guaranteed loser in this means that their rhetoric falls short, makes it much harder for them to make that real case.",
