This is promising technology for millions of Americans who suffer from heart disease. It's the leading cause, as you know, of death in the United States.So, joining us now to talk about this is our CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula. Doctor, this could be game changing. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it could. And I think we have to understand what the context here is. And Poppy and I were just talking, you said in the intro, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in this country. And so the holy grail of cardiology really is figuring out who is going to be at risk for having an event, like a heart attack or a stroke. And many times the problem is, things are silent until they're not, until the day you have your heart attack and stroke. And so we really need to get a good screening tool so that we can give somebody their prediction, we can get them on the road to prevention with things like statins and lifestyle changes. So, the best we have now - let's talk about what we have now -- is something called a risk calculator. So, when a patient comes in my office, as they did this week, and said, doc, what are my chances of having a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years, I said, let me take your information, your age, your gender, whether you stroke, what your blood pressure is, plug it into an equation and I'll give you a risk score. Whether that's 5 percent rick of having an event in the next 10 years or 10 percent. The problem is, we don't have all that data for every patient, so we can't always generate the risk score. And it's not always 100 percent accurate. Enter artificial intelligence, right?",

You know, the Buckeyes are now five after the loss to Michigan. Then it's two-loss Alabama who is sixth. And we take a look at the weekend's schedule. You know, Georgia and Michigan, they could lose their title games and still make the playoffs. TCU is undefeated as well. But if they lose to 10th ranked Kansas State, that is probably where the debate would begin. Would Ohio State, with one loss, then get in over TCU? If TCU and USC were to somehow both lose, would Alabama somehow sneak in? A two-loss team has never made it to the college football playoffs. So, we should be in for a fun weekend, guys. And, Kaitlan, I know I'm -- you're certainly hoping that both TCU and USC were to somehow lose. That's Alabama's only path to get in. You know, The Tide, both their losses on the very last play of the game. They could easily be undefeated right now. And they've only missed the playoffs once in their history.",
