This hour CNN reports from the South Sudan border with war torn Sudan, as international leaders gathered in Geneva to pledge financial support. More on that coming up. First, the other headlines this hour. America's top diplomat Anthony Blinken meets Chinese President Xi Jinping. This is the first US Secretary of State to visit China in five years, a high stakes trip aimed at managing tensions between the world's superpowers. Five Palestinians reported killed and 90 wounded after Israel's Military raided the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. A huge firefight erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants resulting in scenes not witnessed in some two decades. Prominent Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny faced a judge in a Russian court today. He is facing new charges of extremism, could extend his prison term by decades. He is already serving sentences totally more than 11 years. The 72-hour ceasefire is now in effect in Sudan, following intense fighting between its warring factions. Now previous ceasefires over the past few months have not stopped the conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary rapid support forces or RSF as they're known. The fighting has forced hundreds of 1000s of people to leave the country. This video said show people fleeing the violence in the Darfur region towards the country of Chad. The video was provided to CNN by a Darfur human rights group and CNN was not able to independently verify it. Well, the United Nations as we speak is hosting a conference in Geneva to raise critically needed funds to support relief efforts for those who have been displaced both inside and near Sudan. The U.N. says it needs $253 million. That's a quarter of a billion dollars with the South Sudan response alone in need of $96 million. According to the UN international donors have only contributed 10 percent of what is needed so far to properly fund humanitarian relief efforts. Here's more from the U.N. Secretary General at that conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, says that seven of its troops are injured.

He is forecasting what he calls a construction boom in settlement housing. Hadas Gold back with us this hour from Jerusalem. Let's talk about this Jenin raid first and foremost.

The UN Mideast peace coordinator, I want our viewers to see this, tweeting, \"deeply concerned by Israel's decision to alter settlement planning procedures, expected to expedite settlement expansion.

One is that the way the settlement units are approved for being built, was essentially transferred from the defense minister to Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister who himself is a settler leader. And in addition to that some 4500 new settlement units were approved for construction, that doesn't mean that they're going to be breaking ground anytime soon. That means that just the plans were approved. And Bezalel Smotrich calling this one of the biggest construction booms in a -- in a decade. And this is something that we often see the U.S. especially come to loggerheads about with Israel. But you have to keep in mind that now when you have people like Bezalel Smotrich, (inaudible) settler leaders in this new Israeli government, they -- it's not like there's not going to be settlement construction or approvals for these things. This is so much of what these leaders their political beliefs are based on. It's on settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank despite and in spite of whatever the United States or other international organizations may mean. And that is why we're hearing from the U.S. State Department saying that they are deeply troubled by the plan and reminding that actually Israel had agreed to no settlement expansions when they had all of those meetings in places like Sharm el Sheikh and Aqaba over the last few months asking -- the U.S. asking Israel to essentially adhere to those commitments saying that these sorts of settlement expansions are (inaudible) on our actions that make a two state solution more difficult to achieve and are an obstacle to peace. And Becky also very awkward timing, because actually today is when Assistant Secretary Barbara Lee, who's in charge of the Middle East is landing. She may have already landed to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian officials. So, I'm sure there will be some interesting conversations there today, Becky?",

That's given the fact that there have been two recent Military incidents between the U.S. and China just in recent weeks in the South China Sea, in the air and by -- and by the sea as well.

The Secretary of State said at the press conference, that he made clear that the U.S. has concerns about China's provocative actions when it comes to Taiwan. And the United States doesn't right now support Taiwan's independence, but they don't support either side taking unilateral actions that could upend the status quo currently. Now, there was progress forward movement on another topic, and that's an issue of synthetic opioids, which of course is a major killer of Americans back home, fentanyl, the precursor chemicals and fentanyl largely come from China. Secretary of State said that the two sides agreed to stand up a working level meeting on this, a group that can actually address this issue to stem that flow of those chemicals into the United States and on Ukraine. They also addressed the war in Ukraine. The Secretary said that Chinese officials once again said that they are not going to be sending lethal aid to Russia to be used in that war, but they're still watching Chinese companies incredibly closely.

Almost $700 billion worth of trade goes between the United States and China and we know that China, you know, it needs the United States, its post COVID recovery has not been as strong as it had hoped. We know that youth unemployment is soaring there, the property market is incredibly sluggish. And China needs its U.S. export market to flourish, you know, the US makes up 16 percent of Chinese exports. So that is why this is so important. It is hoped that from this visit this two-day visit, which we didn't know if Blinken was going to meet with Xi. You know, that came at the very last minute obviously off the back of 10- hours' worth of accumulative meetings with a foreign ministry and then China's top diplomat today. But -- but, you know, because of that, Blinken met with Xi. Now, Becky a short time ago, we heard from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they held a briefing with reporters in Beijing after Blinken departed for London. It was Yang Tao. He is the Director General of the Ministries, North America Oceania and Oceanian Affairs department and he said that this visit by Blinken marks new beginnings in bilateral relations, which obviously is very conciliatory, it's very hopeful, it's very positive language coming out of Beijing. He did however, say Becky, that he rejects Washington's strategy of derisking from China and that is something that we heard from Antony Blinken. He went on to say to the few if U.S. simply repackaging decoupling as derisking from China, the policy is turning away from stability and opportunity, it won't solve us problems, it will cause more problems globally. Now, obviously, Becky, the hope is that, you know, communication lines have been reestablished. That was always the aim. And that from this, the Treasury Secretary from the United States, the Commerce Secretary for the United States will now come to visit Beijing in in the coming weeks. Becky.",

You must deny yourself, you must reject yourself. You must reach a point of ending your life, he says, for the sake of Jesus. His anti-government stance got him arrested and detained but never prosecuted. In 2019, the church was closed down. Later the pastor started his forest community. We found a former cult member in Malindi. We agreed to hide her identity for her own safety. She escaped the forest last year. Why did you move your whole home and all your children and move into the forest? The pastor used to call me, she says he was calling me telling me, my daughter you are being left behind.
