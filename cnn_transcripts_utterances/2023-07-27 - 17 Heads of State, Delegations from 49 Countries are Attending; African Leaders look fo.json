Comingup Vladimir Putin offers free grain to six African countries in an attempt to caught regional leaders. Niger's army throws its weight behind a coup against President Bazoum as he vows to protect the country's democratic games. July is already the planet's hottest month on record. And we remember provocative Irish Singer Sinead O'Connor as new details emerge about her unexpected death. Welcome to the show and we start in St. Petersburg, Russia, where President Vladimir Putin just held a Summit with African leaders. A main talking point was grain supplies after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea grain initiative wheat prices shot up 20 percent. But Putin insists that won't impact food supplies to Africa, even promising to supply grain to six countries for free. The Summit was also an opportunity for Putin to appear politically supported by global allies alongside his ongoing war in Ukraine. But notably only 17 African heads attending down more than around 50 percent from the first and most recent Summits in 2019, but one unlikely leader spotted in St. Petersburg today is the Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group. CNN geo-located a photo showing the Yevgeny Prigozhin in St. Petersburg hotel, this is the first time Prigozhin has been seen publicly inside Russia since leading last month's failed rebellion. Meantime, the Kremlin says it also discussed the situation in Niger at Thursday Summit. Now Niger's Army Command says it is supporting Wednesday's military coup against the country's President in order to prevent what it says bloodshed and instability. We are across all of the angles for you this hour. We've got David McKenzie in Johannesburg; Nic Robertson in London CNN's Larry Madowo is in Nairobi for us. David, I want to start with you. We've said 17 African leaders attending the offering of free grain to six countries despite higher food prices going to be having huge ramifications across the continent. How important is it for Putin at this stage to ensure African allies friends aren't impacted by his war?",

And at the moment heis isolated from a large part of the world, but not entirely isolated and certainly, in several African countries, if not an ally. He has leaders willing to listen, willing to do trade, and to hear what he has to say in terms of all aspects of the bilateral relationship with Russia. But it is awkward timing because Russia just pulled out unilaterally from that Black Sea Grain Deal. Putin did say and this is largely accurate that much of the grain coming from Ukraine was heading to European companies and countries. But the inflationary pressure of the rise in grain price will affect countries all over the world, including here in Africa. Let's listen to the Russian President. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But just to paraphrasewhat the President was saying in Russia was that they are blaming the west on the impact of the Russian grain deal with Ukraine. And that they will provide an outlet for grain ahead to those countries that needed most, but he said that, in his words it's ironic that Western leaders are complaining about Russia pulling out of the deal when they are the ones he says that are using sanctions to stop Russia from providing its own fertilizer and grain onto the world market. I think this is an important moment for Vladimir Putin, though the numbers are down substantially. It does show that he has friends and illustrates the attempt of Russia to make more inroads on the African continent, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, Eleni.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it reinforces the image that Prigozhin has not entirely gone. It reinforcesthe image; the Wagner Mercenary Group is still going to do business in Africa as Prigozhin indicated when he was in Belarus last weekend. As he indicated in a voice note sent an African media outlet where he said, look, the countries we're doing business with, we're going to continue those we're starting to do business with will continue there as well. The only caveat for us is that we don't crossover with Russian national interests. And I think there's very much fits in with what David is saying about the overall tone of the conference here is Russia want to ramp up and continue to expand its influence in Africa. And Prigozhin, through Wagner, has very much been part of that sort of off the books operation for the Kremlin for President Putin. The two had been very much intertwined in the Central African Republic, and in Mali and Mozambique, and in Sudan, and in Libya, to name just a few other countries. Because the Wagner Group has been sort of forwarding and pushing Russia's interests. There have been security deals with some of the leadership's in these countries to provide security through the Wagner Mercenaries. And payment comes in the form of minerals that Russia wants, including gold, including diamonds. Now, how much of this because it's an off the books operation, how much of this goes through, the money becomes available to Russian people, or how it gets used is unclear? But what is clear in this is that Prigozhin still has an important role to play in that work that Russia has been doing in Africa. And I think you can look at that as being sort of his get out of jail free card because it was just a month ago that Putin was accusing him of mutiny of betrayal. And saying that there will be severe consequences, so one part at least Prigozhin it seems from this, pushing himself or the Kremlin allowing him to do it has a role to play in Africa for the Kremlin still, and that's why we're seeing this.",

And in those protests,we did see one sign saying they don't want any foreign troops in the country. This is important because the U.S. has about 1100 troops stationed in Niger for their counterterrorism efforts have been there since 2013. Two U.S. officials are telling CNN, France, on the other hand, has about 2500 troops in Niger and Chad, according to the French Ministry of Defense. And these people are saying they don't want any of these troops in their country, at least according to these protesters who showed up today outside the National Assembly. Just a day after other protesters, pro-democracy protesters were at the same place protesting this military action that detained the President. And one interesting thing during these protests, we did see somebody holding a Russian flag two people running with a Russian flag. One of them shouted Lugosi, meaning Russia. There's not much to make of it. It's still too early to tell. But this is something we also saw after the coup in neighboring Burkina Faso. This situation in Niger will come up at the Russia Africa Summit. The Kremlin is saying that it's been discussed on the sidelines will likely be a main topic of discussion.

Well, for years, Vladimir Putin has courted African leaders, in an attempt to broaden Russia's global influence and African states at the St. Petersburg Summit, will be eager to sway Russia into rejoining the grain deals. So tonight we ask can African countries influence Putin. My next guest is an expert in African Studies and writes, \"Russia is under a lot of pressure with what's happening in Ukraine and the ramifications of the conflicts in terms of commodity prices, particularly for Africans, and also what's happening with Wagner, and so on\". So this is an opportunity for Russia to try to assert its place on the global stage as well. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele Directs the African program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and joins me now via Skype from Washington to discuss Russia's burgeoning influence in Africa. Sir great to have you with us; thank you so much for joining us! Look, the numbers are interesting, 17 African states, heads of state, going to St. Petersburg, very different number to what we saw in 2019. There are a couple of things playing out here. Firstly, what influence does Russia have on the continent? And how much influence do African leaders have on Putin? He might want to supply free grain to six African countries, but the inflationary impact across the continent is going to be felt when grain prices globally up by 20 percent.",

And regardless of what's happening with the price of the grain and other foodstuff, I think that relationship will remain important for the foreseeable future, for a couple of reasons. Africans are very interested in this multipolar configuration of the world. Where we don't have only one center of power, meaning the West, so the fact that Russia, China, and other powers tried to provide a counterweight to the west, it's very appealing to the Africans, coming back to the grain issue. I think it was expected that once Russia pulled out of the UN broken deal, it will use the grain as a leverage, which is the point of leverage for them, because those are actually among the few things that Russia still has to offer African countries, namely, there's agricultural stuff, grain fertilizer, and so on. Weapons systems, defense agreement, Russia maintains about the -- Russia maintains 40 agreements, defense agreement across the continent that is with about 40 countries. And then technology transfer. They're involved in transferring nuclear technology to a number of countries. Those are points of leverage for Russia today.",

And so when you get when you're crushing records, like we have across all of these continents, for the last three weeks, they're able to go ahead and say, this is the hottest, hottest month with authority. I've been doing this for well over a decade following you know this, this record, increases in climate change. And we've seen those temperatures climb each and every time I've never seen them call the game in the 60th, 70th minute, if you will, the month is not over. And they're still confident. And here's why we're reaching sort of that peak of the annual year. But if you look, this is about 100 years' worth of data, that we have a lot of confidence. And so, we can say, you know, using a lot of different types of climate -- climate, its called records that go back 100,000 years. But just with actual temperature data, we're really confident in the last 100 or so the progression from blue to red is really that warming of the last couple of decades. But here this black line, ever since July, the third, we have been at temperatures globally average that we've never been before. And here's why they're so confident saying that this is the hottest month, because we're not just breaking it like we have over the past couple of years, by a 10th of a degree by a 100th of a degree, 200th of a degree. We're talking over a third of a degree warmer than any of these other months. So no matter what happens in this the last week of July, it would take a mini ice age in this last week to bring us back down here which we know of course, is not going to happen. And it's you know, so what does this mean on the ground. We saw the videos there in Europe of the devastating fires, the wildfires. We're seeing marine heat waves all in the oceans, devastating to coral allowing strength for typhoons and hurricanes when they form and heat domes, that has been sort of the word du jour for the month, heat domes over all three continents. Here in the U.S. we've got another one right now. That's hitting more Americans right now seeing extreme heat, dangerous heat than any point this summer.
