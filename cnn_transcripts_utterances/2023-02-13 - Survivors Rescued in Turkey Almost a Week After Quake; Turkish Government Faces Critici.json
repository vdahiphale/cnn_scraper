Incredibly, after more than 160 hours, emergency crews are still finding people alive under the rubble of collapsed buildings.But now, after surviving the earthquake, victims are trying to survive the bleak conditions that they now face. In Turkey, hundreds of thousands have been displaced and are living in makeshift shelters, many struggling just to stay warm. Others overcome with despair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It was not like any other earthquake. The roads were destroyed. Our houses were demolished. There was no building let. Whole cities were flattened. Everything disappeared. We can feed ourselves here, but no one knows how we're going to live. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It's freezing, and we will be frozen to death here. If we sit inside the tent, we will freeze. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: Now, meantime, a convoy of United Nations aid trucks crossed into Northwestern Syria on Sunday. That was through the Turkish border. The agency says the trucks are carrying comprehensive shelter kits. Now, a top U.N. official tweeted from the border that the people of Northwest Syria \"rightly feel abandoned.\" He added that it's his duty to, quote, \"correct this failure as fast as we can.\" Now, rebuilding efforts have been complicated in the country as political fault lines run deep. The sanctions have also created obstacles that humanitarian aid has to maneuver around. And in the midst of all of this uncertainty, a few glimmers of hope have appeared in both Turkey and Syria. CNN's Nada Bashir reports on the miraculous rescues that have defied the odds. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Reciting a prayer, hoping for a miracle. This time, their prayers have been answered. A weekend of remarkable rescues. Several survivors pulled to freedom after almost a week, buried beneath the rubble. In Hatai (ph), smiles of relief. This son telling his mother, \"We are here. We are with you.\" And this little girl, still in a state of shock. But free at last. Time, however, is quickly running out. This French rescue team working overnight to retrieve the body of a 6-year-old boy. Retrieving the dead, this colonel tells his team, is also a crucial part of their job. In Northwest Syria, the grief is almost too much to bear. Rescue workers here say they are no longer holding out hope for more survivors. This is a region already decimated by President Bashar al- Assad's brutal war. Now crushed under the weight of one of the worst natural disasters this region has seen in a century. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): No matter how horrific this disaster was, no matter how big this crisis was, we've seen and lived through such terror before. BASHIR (voice-over): Aid has finally arrived in Syria's rebel-held territories. Volunteers saying it's simply too little, too late. Across the border in Gaziantep, life has been transformed. This elderly woman says she lost everything. But these are tears of joy. A phone call from her son to tell her that he is alive. For others, hope is dwindling fast. This young woman sits waiting for news. Her mother and sister are still beneath the rubble beside her. \"They are dying under there,\" she says, \"and I am dying here.\" [00:05:01] And now, as the death toll continues to soar, grief for some is turning to anger, and calls for accountability are only growing.

Many say it failed to prepare for a catastrophic event like this, especially since the country had suffered devastating quakes in the past.The frustration grew as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the affected areas and admitted to, quote, \"shortcomings\" in his administration's initial response. Meantime, authorities say a property developer who was the contractor for some of the collapsed buildings has been arrested. Joining me now, live from Washington, D.C., is Gonul Tol.

There was an objects seen flying at about 20,000 feet over Michigan's upper peninsula and nearing Lake Huron. It was then that officials say an F- 16 fighter jet shot it down. Now officials have described this object is being octagonal in shape with strings attached to it, but no discernible payload. And officials have also said that it is connected to some radar contact that was found in Montana on Saturday evening. Initially, fighter jets were sent up into the skies in Montana on Saturday to try to track down a possible object. They did not find anything. And that led NORAD and NORTHCOM to believe that it was a radar anomaly. But then on Sunday, they reacquired that radar contact and did find this unidentified object flying over Wisconsin and then Michigan. Ultimately, there was concern because of the height that this object was flying at, 20,000 feet, which could pose some threat to civilian aircraft. There was also concern about the path that it was taking. So the military leaders recommended to President Biden that he shoot it down, and he ultimately issued that order. Now, this is just the latest in a string of puzzling events of aerial crafts being seen in the skies above the United States. Starting with that suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot off the coast of South Carolina just nine days ago. And still so many questions about these other objects that were shot down: one off the Alaskan coast on Friday, and then another shot in the Yukon in Canada on Saturday. Now, officials have been very careful and cautious about how they are trying to describe some of these objects. They say that they are still waiting for more information. And some of the big questions facing this administration is exactly the size of these items. Also, the origin and what their purposes are. All of these questions, they are hoping to get some answers to as these recovery operations are all underway. Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And also, exaggerated. And the always nationalistic global new -- \"Global Times\" newspaper, for example, in their editorial, portraying the U.S. military moves as clumsy performance art. And I quote them here: \"The grand takeoff of U.S. warplanes apparently satisfied some people's appetite for the 'China threat.'\" It goes on to say, \"It is not a good sign for the world if the country with the strongest military is constantly surrounded by this kind of extreme emotion and sees everything as a threat and, thus, wants to destroy it.\" So this kind of colorful language, obviously, echoing the official Chinese government stance after the U.S. shot down the first confirmed balloon, that the U.S. overreacted. Now, the Beijing authorities, obviously, still very much insisting that was a civilian device that drifted off-course because of weather, even though U.S. officials and many experts very much disputed that. And the U.S., of course, has now sanctioned six Chinese entities relate to that balloon, which according to CNN's own reporting, is believed to be a part of a sweeping global intelligence campaign run by the Chinese government. Now, the government here, obviously, has very much been working very hard to push back all of these allegations. And the latest sanction announcement is likely to get their condemnation as well as a threat of countermeasures, as well. But there is -- actually, there has been an intriguing development here in China over the weekend. That is, state media on Sunday quoting local maritime authorities as saying they have spotted unidentified flying object off the coast of Eastern China. And the preparation was underway to shoot it down. [00:15:1] Local fishermen off the coast of Shandong province being warned to avoid dangerous -- avoid the dangerous area, but also was -- they were told to take photographs and even collect debris if conditions allowed. So that obviously generated a lot of buzz, given what was happening over the U.S. and Canada over the weekend. Not to mention the Chinese military's previous promise to take similar actions after the U.S. shot down the first confirmed Chinese balloon. But the thing is, we have not heard much in the hours since the initial reports came out. And that kind of silence obviously generating even more curiosity and speculation. So Paula all of this, obviously, not happening in a vacuum. And these developments is now really part of a sign that this downward spiral in U.S.-China relations.",

That center, right there, that is actually the center of the post-Tropical Storm Gabrielle. The eye wall, per se, that's kind of the terminology we use. And of course, that's where we find the strongest of winds. You know how it's heading closer and closer to the Northlands, as well as the Auckland region. Well, let's take you there. Let me show you what it looks like on the ground, just North of the city of Auckland. You see how the water is starting to surged up and over some of the local roadways there. This is, of course, close to the coast. But you can imagine, as the storm edges closer and closer to the shoreline, we're waiting to see more scenes like this unfolding. That's a dangerous situation. There's a roadway there, as well, starting to be covered by some of this onslaught of water that's being pushed up by the ocean. Get back to my graphics, talk about what we can expect. This is the New Zealand Meteorological Agency's warnings. They have red warnings in place for the Northland, as well as Auckland, region. Much of the eastern sections of the North Island. Look at the wording they've used -- significant flooding, impassable roadway, even isolated communities with this. Really, a trifecta of hazards coming to the North island of New Zealand, from flash flooding potential to damaging strong winds, as well as the potential for storm surge. You saw that on a video, just a moment ago. And it's all thanks to this low-pressure system that continues to just really coast right along the Northern reaches of the North island. Now this is going to start to see a change in the wind direction. So at first, more of the Northeasterly win for Auckland. But as we head into Tuesday morning and into the day on Wednesday, we'll have more of a Southwesterly wind. And that's going to have a lot of moisture associated with it. So it's not just the North Island that will fill the impacts from this. But also the South island, as well. We've had wind gusts in excess of 150 kilometers per hour. That is significant, considering what happened two weeks ago across this region, with a deluge of rain that brought the flooding. There will be damage from this storm system, unfortunately. I don't like to report on that. But this is the reality that we're facing. Some of the locations, just in the past 24 hours, doubling their monthly average rainfall totals for the month of February. And there's still more rain to come. Look at this precipitation. Just starting to accumulate, very quickly across the North Island. And, the forecast rainfall totals going forward, Auckland, south into Wilmington and Christchurch, could exceed another 150 millimeters. Keep in mind Paula, the ground is very saturated here.
