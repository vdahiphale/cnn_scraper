Pattern is also Clarence Thomas speaking to a group funded by the Koch brothers, and a lot of the Koch brother money was behind campaigns to see all of these justices. So it's really the broader tapestry here that is the problem, and it's only going to pour kerosene are in this already burning fire for calling for court reform by the Democrats who say there's no way that these justices and they look at these things can be impartial when we're looking at an election where this court could very well be the final decider.",

It's top of mind today because Frank Bruni's new book is entitled, \"The Age of Grievance.\" And he writes in part, quote, \"The American soundtrack has become a cacophony of competing complaints.\"So beautifully said as is everything that you write, Frank, so much. Thanks so much for staying and talking about this. That was at a time where if you had to air grievances a la Frank Costanza, you had to do it in person. That was before even the notion of social media. I think this is such an important book because you're saying so much of what I think people are thinking who are wondering what's happening in society. FRANK BRUNI, OP-ED COLUMNIST, NEW YORK TIMES: And what's happening is we're at each other's throats and sometimes for reasons that make sense, but just as often for reasons that make no sense. We've lost the ability to draw distinctions and discern between the battles that we really need to fight and the ones that we can let go. People are itching to take offense in every situation. I mean, you just showed everyone that crazy scene in the House. Now that's a cartoon version of American life. But it's a version of American life, and it's an emblem of American life right now. And, you know, the story you had earlier about Justice Alito, and the upside down flag outside his house. That's something I don't think we would have seen 20 years ago, and that, too, is a reflection of how much we've fallen.",
