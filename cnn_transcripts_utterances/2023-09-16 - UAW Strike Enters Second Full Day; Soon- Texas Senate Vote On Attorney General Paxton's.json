I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with the historic auto workers strike that is now in its second full day. Negotiators for the United Auto Workers union and the big three carmakers are expected to be back at the bargaining table today. For the first time ever, workers are striking at plants from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, all at the same time. Workers say they want big raises and other benefits after years of concessions during rough times for the industry. The car makers say despite big profits in recent years, the raises being demanded would drive them out of business. President Biden weighing in, saying, now is the time for the companies to step up.

And so, there seems to be this big gap. We are hoping. I think all sides are hoping for progress today. But it's not clear if that's going to happen. Meanwhile, up until a deal is met, we're going to be seeing picket lines like this 24 hours a day. And to give you a sense of what's happening here in Toledo, we're outside this Stellantis factory, where they build more than 1,000 jeeps per day. But these workers have shut down this facility. And about a half mile down this stretch, this busy road, you'll see groups like the one behind me, like the one we're standing near, were outside rallying, and the energy level is still so high on this second day of the strike. We know that 13,000 workers across the country, including 5,800, here in Toledo are now on strike. They're making $100 a day in strike pay. But so many have told me they were prepared for this.

He faces 16 articles of impeachment, most of them stemming from allegations that he abused his office to help a friend and donor.

      "sentences": "Well, there is some sort of delay. We don't quite know what the delay is about. This vote was supposed to have started at 10So, we're a few minutes away. There have been a number of senators kind of coming and going from the chamber. We still have not seen Ken Paxton here this morning. He did not attend much of the impeachment trial. He showed up briefly at the very beginning. And then, yesterday during closing arguments. So, we still have not seen him. We have not seen the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate that essentially has served as the judge during this impeachment trial. So, we're trying to get a sense of when exactly this is going to start. We'll see if it starts here in the next few minutes. But this will begin the voting process and it will be a lengthy process, Fredricka. There are 16 articles of impeachment that these senators have heard testimony on, and that is, what the vote will take place on. Each of these articles of impeachment will be voted on individually, and each senators' vote will be announced individually. So, this is going to be a rather lengthy process. If he is convicted on just one of the articles of impeachment, Ken Paxton, who is currently suspended as -- from working as the attorney general in Texas, would be removed from office. So, there are 16 articles. He was charged with 20 articles of impeachment by the House, but only 16 of those have been heard in this trial. Four of them have been set aside for now. And essentially what Ken Paxton needs, he needs 10 Republican senators to vote to acquit him, for him to remain in office. There are 31 senators, only 30 of them are voting because the 31st is Angela Paxton, Ken Paxton's wife. And by the rules of the impeachment process, she is not allowed to vote. So, everyone's here kind of like parsing the numbers. You need nine Republicans to join 12 Democrats to reach 21. 21 is that number that it would take to remove Ken Paxton from office. And that is why Ken Paxton needs 10 votes to survive this impeachment vote. And as I mentioned, there will be 16 different votes. And if he is convicted on either of those articles -- on any article of impeachment, there would be a vote at the end to determine whether or not Ken Paxton can be barred from holding future office. So, there is a scenario here where Ken Paxton could be removed from office, but not barred from holding office in the future. So, theoretically, perhaps, you could see him run again. So, getting a little bit too far ahead of myself here quite honestly.",

And just talking to some of the local residents here, they have to agree, because we know that these hurricanes are a game of miles. If this thing was west by 50 miles, we would have significantly worse impacts here on Cape Cod and the Barnstable County where I am located on the shores of Massachusetts.Now, the same cannot be said for what's taking place now in the state of Maine. That is where the bulk of this most intense part of post- tropical cyclone Lee is located. And I just looked, Maine now seeing those numbers for power outages ticked up and up and up. They're currently at 80,000 customers without power. And just a few hours ago, that was about 40,000. So, I kind of just spells out what's been happening there. We're going to get to the graphics and just analyzing this latest satellite imagery. You see all those shades of red in Maine, that is the confection. That's the stronger part of what was Hurricane Lee. And that is why we're seeing the bulk of the power outages in Down East Maine, because they're getting the brunt of the storm. Right? They are getting the worst, part even though that's centered near the \"eye\" that looks like what will come ashore, either in western Nova Scotia or perhaps into New Brunswick here within the coming hours. It will be a weakening low-pressure system. But the thing that we have been trying to hammer home for the past few days is that the wind field is just so large. It's about 400 miles. Tropical storm force winds extend 400 miles and that is why where I'm standing on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, well away from the center of the storm, we are still feeling the impacts. We're still experiencing these tropical storm force gusts that come in occasionally. And we're actually pushing our tide right now. So, we're approaching a high tide which will occur later this afternoon, roughly about 1:00. Let's see here. 1:00 this afternoon, actually, according to my latest graphics. And that's going to not be so much of a concern because the bulk of the winds have moved on already. But as we move closer and closer towards the center, that combination between strong winds and high tide could cause still some coastal erosion. Here is a look at the winds. We've had gusts in Nantucket, which is out over the angry ocean of the Atlantic a few miles behind me. They had gusts today at five -- 55 miles per hour with 20-foot waves on their shoreline there.",

It's really going to be a question of what sanctions is she going to impose?With a regular defendant, you might expect contempt, even obstruction, tampering, you'll may be facing being held. Of course, there could also be financial sanctions, which might be a little bit easier to manage than trying to actually hold him in jail, temporarily. But that foundation is being set here.

It's not too hard for her to verbally make a distinction, which is you can proclaim innocence all you want, but you can't involve individual people, whether it's by name or not, doesn't matter.

The strike is now almost four months old and talks broke off in mid-August. And it comes as both Drew Barrymore and Bill Maher announced this week that their talk shows would resume production without writers. They joined several other talk shows that have been airing new episodes including The View and Live with Kelly and Mark.The writers went on strike back in May demanding better pay and a change to the compensation structure as the industry moves toward a streaming model and away from traditional broadcasting. The Actors Guild went on strike two months later over many of the same issues. But they also want an agreement that protects actors against some of the uses of artificial intelligence in film, and television. I want to bring in Michael Jamin. He is a television comedy writer and showrunner who has worked on shows such as King of the Hill, Rules of Engagement and Tacoma, FD among others. Good to see you, Michael. So are you any more optimistic today than I don't know, a couple of months ago, when all of this got underway, that perhaps negotiations can get underway, and there could be some sort of deal struck. MICHAEL JAMIN, TV WRITER/SHOWRUNNER: As a professional spectrum writer, I'm trying not to be optimistic about anything. We get our hopes up all the time, I really hope that we can get a much better offer from the studios because we all want to get to work. All of us. You know, I'm in my garage.

And so then, how do you get -- how do you get by sometimes your contract won't that good. Sometimes you could scramble and pick up some side work, sell it sell a pilot, or there's a lot of hustle. Back in 2008, when the last strike was, I remember the leverage from the studios was well, can you guys really afford to be at work for three months? And really, no, not really. But now they've lost that leverage. Can you guys be before to better work through once we're already out of work nine months out of the year.
