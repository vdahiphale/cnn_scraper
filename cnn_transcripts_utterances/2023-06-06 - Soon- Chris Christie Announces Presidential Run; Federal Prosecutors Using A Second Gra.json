They would have the ability to do that. Prosecutors, when you have a crime, you have to charge it in one of the districts where some of the criminal conduct occurred.

Now, the advantage to D.C. for prosecutors, let's just be real here, Donald Trump is very unpopular. He got 5.4% of the vote in D.C. in 2020. The jury pool is going to be way better for prosecutors in D.C.But venue is clearer to me in Florida because that's where the documents were kept, that's certainly where the obstructive acts occurred.

Now, California's Attorney General is investigating and evaluating potential criminal or civil action. And California Attorney General Bob Bonta -- Rob Bonta joins us now. Attorney General Bonta, thanks so much for joining us. You've been referring to this movement of migrants as state sanctioned kidnapping. Doesn't that seem a little strong? ROB BONTA (D-CA), ATTORNEY GENERAL: We are looking at the possibility of criminal liability, including kidnapping and related other crimes, including false imprisonment, based on the same major elements here, which is deception, lying, fraudulent, misrepresentation, plus the movement of the asylum seekers across state lines over thousands of miles. So we believe that it's appropriate to call actions what they are and to call out the inhumanity, cruelty and the political gamesmanship here, which is really falling on the backs of human beings and people here, all for cheap political gain.",

Elie, the story broken by Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan and Michael Schmidt suggests that they don't know when this testimony took place, but it was related to both the investigation into Mr. Trump's attempt to hold on to power the January 6th investigation and also into the special documents investigation, pretty big win for the special counsel, Jack Smith, to secure the testimony of Mark Meadows.",

I think he's the single most important witness as to January 6th.And as you said, he would have relevant information potentially as well about the retention of sensitive or classified documents that underlies the Mar-a-Lago examination and investigation.

One of the questions is what exactly did he convey to the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, if anything, leading up to that time?

And we'll recall Meadows actually did cooperate briefly with the January 6th Committee, and he turned over those hundreds or thousands of very revealing text messages where we saw members of Congress, members of Donald Trump's own family, white House advisors, reaching out to Mark Meadows, saying essentially, you've got to do something. You've got to get him to do something. Now, Mark Meadows then suddenly hit a wall and basically said, no, I'm not cooperating anymore. And he was actually held in contempt by the January 6th Committee, although DOJ declined to prosecute him.So one of the big questions I have about the testimony that we're now learning Mark Meadows gave is, under what conditions did he give that testimony? We know that he raised an executive privilege objection, basically saying, I can't testify about these confidential communications with the President. But he lost that fight. He and Donald Trump lost that fight in court. I wonder whether Mark Meadows took the Fifth and had to be given immunity in order to testify.

And frankly, if I was advising Mark Meadows, even if he falls into a gray area, the easy advice here is take the Fifth. Don't take the risk of incriminating yourself. Now, there's a way you can reach a deal for testimony in a situation like this where Meadows, if I was representing Meadows, I would say he's willing to testify DOJ if you give him immunity, meaning he will testify, but you cannot use his testimony against him, and essentially that means you cannot prosecute him.Those type of deals are quite common. We don't know whether that's what happened here with Mark Meadows, but the fact that he testified, I think, raises that question. Was there some sort of deal in place?

What instructions did you give to White House staff, to Archives personnel, about how to pack up documents, about how to go through documents, about which documents should stay, which documents should go to Mar-a-Lago?Did you know that some documents were being sent to Mar-a-Lago? Did you or anyone else review them? Did you have any conversations with Donald Trump about the status of those documents, the fact that they may have been classified?

And she gave us testimony about various things that she observed firsthand and various conversations she had with Mark Meadows.And there were other critical conversations that Cassidy Hutchinson testified about that happened right before January 6th where she said Meadows went and met with the President. Now, I wasn't in there for that conversation, but Meadows told me that here's what said or Meadows didn't really tell me much about it. And so what you want to do as a prosecutor is go through each of those and go, OK, now we've pierced executive privilege. You cannot hide behind that.

They've been very candid about their conversations with the President and in many cases, exceedingly critical.Former Attorney General Barr is a perfect example of that. It will be interesting when we find out what exactly Meadows said, whether he did effectively turn on the President or at least criticize or condemn the President, or whether he still is trying to be loyal to the President and maybe either not sharing everything he knows or at least trying to put a positive spin on it.

So I think now that they've spoken to him, I think, A, they have a complete consummate insiders perspective. And B, I think they've sort of closed the circle here on talking to the key advisers around Donald Trump, both with respect to January 6th and with respect to Mar-a-Lago. So to me, it's one more indicator that we're really getting into the end game of both of these investigations. [18",
