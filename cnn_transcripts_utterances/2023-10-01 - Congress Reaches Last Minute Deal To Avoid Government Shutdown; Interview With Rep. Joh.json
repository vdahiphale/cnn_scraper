It's a deal that may cost McCarthy his speakership. Republican hardliners are now vowing to bring a motion to the floor to oust the leader for ignoring the spending cuts conservatives were demanding in a package.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I do intend to file a Motion to Vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week. I think we need to rip off the Band-Aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy. Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. He lied to Biden, he lied to House conservatives. The only way Kevin McCarthy is Speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. Now, they probably will. I actually think that when you believe in nothing, as Kevin McCarthy does, everything is negotiable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Eva, you know what kind of tremors on Capitol Hill are being felt with threats against House Speaker Kevin McCarthy? EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Well, Fred, the speaker is clear eyed about what lies ahead. He says he'll survive challenges to his speakership from the most right leaning members of his conference, all but daring them to bring it on. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Yes, I'll survive. You know, this is personal with Matt. Matt voted against the most conservative ability to protect our border, secure border. He is more interested in securing TV interviews than doing something. He wanted to push us into a shutdown, even threatening his own district with all the military people there who would not be paid only because he wants to take this motion. So be it. Bring it on. Let's get over with it and let's start governing. If he is upset because he tried to push us into shutdown and I made sure government didn't shut down, then let's have that fight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thus far, Democrats have shown very little indication they want to bail him out and this is also a test for Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, as well, as his caucus will look to him for guidance. And new today, Arizona Congressman Eli Crane, he is one of the hardline Republicans who have been critical of McCarthy. Well, he's signaling support for ousting the speaker, as well -- Fred.",

And you heard that from President Biden today, as he urged McCarthy that in this next round of funding discussions to fund the government for an extended period of time for at least a year, but also to adhere to those agreements that they made a relating to the budget back when they struck that debt ceiling deal a little earlier this spring.

We absolutely have to fund Ukraine. The $24 billion that the president has recommended is the appropriate amount not only for Ukraine over the next several months, into the next year and beyond, but also to replenish our own stockpiles of munitions, and the various pieces of equipment that we have sent on Ukraine. So we've got to get this done, and we ought not wait until 17th, the next deadline. We can get this done next week.

We do know that he did not honor the agreement that was made for the debt limit, that legislation was about in May. There was an agreement, it was actually part of the law itself, and it was no sooner signed by the president then the Republican caucus ran away from that agreement.

We're still trying to work out these details and understand how this could happen in the first place.But here's what we know: This all happened on Tuesday according to Sergeant Steve Gaskins with the Florida Highway Patrol in a press release that he gave us. There was a driver slumped over in his car for unknown reasons, then have a Good Samaritan named Ahmed Gahaf and his wife who tried to help out that driver. That driver came back to awareness, ended up accelerating forward, hit Gahaf's car and then he also hit a secondary car. Inside of that car, according to rush report was Patrick Scruggs who got out, shattered the window of that formerly incapacitated driver and then attacked him with a knife. So this video obviously, pretty graphic right here. Let's go into that one more time. We see within the video Gahaf, the Good Samaritan, he's on the phone with 9-1-1, and he does that, he is right there on the side of the bridge right there before this portion. He tried to actually stop Patrick Scruggs, who then, it appears to be he attempted to make a swipe at him with that knife and then repeatedly stabbed the driver of that original car. That driver was injured, serious injuries, but is expected to survive. Now, Patrick Scruggs is a former federal prosecutor. According to his LinkedIn, he spent 10 years at the US Attorney's Office in Tampa. And then in the summer, he joined a private law firm right here in Atlanta. Now Scruggs was involved in the initial court appearance on behalf of the US government on Adam Johnson. He is known as the lectern guy. So the picture of Johnson became kind of a viral image of January 6. It was that image of Johnson making off right there with Nancy Pelosi's lectern. So again Scruggs, on behalf of the US government was involved in that initial court appearance of Johnson. Now, I spoke with the Good Samaritan, Gahaf, who's on that bridge, the Howard Franklin Bridge, I-275 southbound on that day, attempting to stop Scruggs from attacking this driver and here's what he had to say about that interaction.

And we would say to them, did you ever think about voting for two Protestant men? What difference does it make? So we tried to use our sense of humor. She always said two percent, maybe for the fat content of milk, but it's not good to just have two percent of women in the Senate. And we held hands all the way through. And what's interesting, Fredricka is, we came from different factions of the Democratic Party, and as a matter of fact, 10 years prior, when I ran for the House, she supported another woman, a different woman, a wonderful woman, but I won that race. But even with that background, we knew fate had thrown us together and we were bound and determined to work for California, side by side.",

But when we do, we're going to respect each other, we're not going to stab each other in the back, we're going to tell each other what our plans are, and let the chips fall.But on the issue of representing our great state, we were literally joined at the hip, and I'm only five feet tall, barely. And to me, she was a giant, you know, she's probably five seven or something. And so we used to kid around, I'd say to her, I'll take the short senators and lobby them for California. You take the tall ones. But that sense of humor aside, the fact that we did have different coalitions in the Senate really helped our state, because when we got there, you can't believe this, in 1993, we got sworn in. There was an expression that went around. ABC -- Anybody But California -- there was prejudice against our great state. We thought, well, we were the Golden State. We have Silicon Valley. We have all the defense installations. We have Hollywood. And so that meant that we didn't have any problems. The state our size now pushing 40 million people, of course, we have a huge number of problems. And I really think we turned that around, and by the time I left, we didn't see that kind of prejudice against our state.",

One voter in particular, her name is Pat Inman (ph), she told me that she's gone to a lot of different campaign speeches by people like Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeSantis, not just for former President Donald Trump, and she said as of now, her mind isn't made up. She's not sure that she's going to be voting for the former president.

The reigning World Series Champion, Astros, they celebrated with a refined toast heading to the postseason for a seventh straight year after beating the Diamondbacks. And on the right check out the Marlins partying hard after making the playoffs for just the fourth time in team history after they beat the Pirates seven to three. Now even though Arizona had just lost to the Astros, they still threw a pool party. Look at the cannonball and that's because they clinched a wildcard playoff spot, thanks to a loss by the Reds. This is Arizona's first playoff appearance in six years. The Texas Rangers, they clinched their first playoff berth in seven years with a six to one win over the Seattle Mariners. Just two years ago, this team lost more than a hundred games and finished last in their division. Now, have a chance to win the American League West if they win today or the Astros lose. Check this out: Team USA's Patrick Cantlay sank a putt on 18 to beat Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick at the end of yesterday's Ryder Cup action in Rome, Italy. Emotions were running high and then check out this drama. Rory did not appreciate Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava, who is perhaps celebrating a bit too long or too hard. LaCava still has words for Rory as he was lining up to sink a putt that would have tied the match. So let's take this out to the parking lot where Rory McIl-rage is ripping into LaCava with some fierce finger pointing. The four-time major champ clearly frustrated. His teammate, Shane Lowry had to come in and defuse the situation, and then he eventually would walk back over to LaCava, the caddie seemingly having a conversation like hey, this isn't supposed to happen in golf. All right finally, in pop news, ticket prices surging for a potential Taylor Swift appearance tonight at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. Apparently, there's an NFL game happening, too. Speculation that Swift will appear to see Travis Kelce and the Chiefs take on the Jets has sent tickets to the game soaring 40 percent, many wondering if the global pop icon is dating the NFL star after she cheered on the Chiefs while sitting next to his mom last weekend.",
