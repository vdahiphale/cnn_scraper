We start this afternoon with the race for speaker and a House divided, Representatives Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise courting fellow conference members behind closed doors right now, hoping to lock down enough support to win the speaker's gavel, even as emotions over Kevin McCarthy's ouster are still raw. Now, neither candidate has a clear path yet, but one huge voice in the Republican Party has weighed in, Donald Trump. The 2024 Republican presidential front-runner and criminal defendant just endorsed Jim Jordan, and he's actually offered to step in as interim speaker until all of this is settled. Let's get more now on today's closed-door maneuvering from CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona. So, Melanie, bring us up to speed on what's happening.",

Who can unite the conference, who can unite conservative Republicans in our party around the country, and then who can go tell the country what we're doing and why it's important to them, to their family, to their business, to their community? And, look, I like the job I got now. I never wanted to do this job, but someone has to who can bring the team together and can go communicate to the country. And that's why I'm running.

Obviously, the White House is celebrating this, crediting Bidenomics.

How do you square that with what's going on in reality? DAMIAN PALETTA, DEPUTY BUSINESS EDITOR, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Sure. I mean, I think inflation really knocked the country off stride, and it really affected people's psychology about the economy. Prices were going up, and they were going up faster than wages. Now we're finally in a situation where wages are going up faster than inflation, and people should be feeling better; 336,000 jobs is unbelievable this far into the recovery. And it's great at this point with just a quarter of the year left. We're heading into the holidays. With people having jobs, they're going to spend, and that's going to create more jobs. So that's a really good sign for the White House. But I think the lag, the shadow of inflation is really going to continue to haunt a lot of voters heading into 2024, and that's something the White House is going to have to deal with.",

There's still a lot of cash offers on houses, but mortgages are very expensive. But people continue to spend money. Now, that's good and bad. We're seeing credit card debt at very high levels. And you eventually have to pay that back. So, that's going to be something that's concerning heading into next year. But as long as consumers are spending money, there's going to be jobs out there. And, right now, there's plenty of opportunity for people to get into the job market. BROWN:  There was a lot of talk about a soft landing, and now there's a lot of questions about, are we in a hotter economy for a longer amount of time, and will this mean that the Fed raises rates more?

But I think the report today, when it came out this morning, we did see the stock market fell pretty sharply, because people assumed that the Fed was going to have to continue raising interest rates to get the economy to stay cool. And so now the market's back up because I think people realize, well, companies are going to continue earning money. That's good. We're going to have to see how the next few months play out.

Ukraine says that several trucks caught fire when a grain storage facility was hit. And the death toll is rising in Hroza, where more than 50 people were killed in a missile strike that targeted a cafe. People had gathered there to mourn the death of a local soldier when the building was attacked and, as you can see on your screen, reduced to rubble.

But, that said, this is another way that Putin simply ups the ante, and he immediately turns to nuclear weapons, which is one thing that -- it's about the last thing that Russia has that has any strength to it. The economy is not in good shape. Military is not performing well. So it's another threatening situation.

What he does is he says, it's all the West's fault. We want to have a new world, a new world that is not under the thumb of the West and the United States, but nobody would listen to us. He has used that phrase many, many times. And then he criticizes the arrogance of the West, and then goes on to say, I will do something, which is a nuclear part of it, because they're doing it.

It's not going to go away. And, by the way, we do mean -- at this point, we have to make it work if we want at some point to address this issue of having this influx. It's not going to go away, because people the world over still believe in the American dream, this idea that individuals can rise above their circumstances in life. And as long as people still believe in that dream, then we're going to continue to see these influxes. It's not going to go away. So at what point are we finally going to address it? And we haven't.
