And I do think that that would have signaled more confidence about what he is seeing on the jobs market front. So the fact that they are -- they went big here, right? They went with the first rate cut since COVID and the decided to do a half an interest rate -- a half a point is really, really telling. It shows they are very confident on the inflation side.

However, it can apply beyond that. What prosecutors have done here is they've said that Sean Combs ran a criminal organization that committed almost any crime you can think of, guns drugs, assault, extortion, obstruction of justice, arson, in order to promote his image, to satisfy his sexual urges and to intimidate witnesses. And then there's a separate crime. This is count two, that is forceful transportation of a person across state lines for sexual purpose. Forceful sex trafficking.
