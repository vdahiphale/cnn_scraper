There have been huge changes. So, a full-scale banking meltdown crisis, is it possible? Maybe. But is it likely? Absolutely not, so the experts say.I was talking to one such expert here in Israel where I am at, the tech sector which has been so badly hit by all of this, well, I spoke to Shlomo Dovrat who is the venture capitalist of the Viola Group. He said it's not a system at risk, but when it comes to runs on banks, today, they can be much faster than you think. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHLOMO DOVRAT, CO-FOUNDER &amp; GENERAL PARTNER, VIOLA GROUP:  Run on the bank in a world of internet, in a world where everything (inaudible) is very quick. But I do believe it's an isolated, you know, specific event. I don't think it will have huge impact. This is not 2008. (END VIDEO CLIP) QUEST:  And putting that into wider view, it's certainly going to hit the technology sector because tech borrowed from these institutions. But the speed at which the regulators moved, shoring up the depositor savings, making it clear investors and shareholders won't be bailed out.

But some more detail on what exactly was approved today. This is a major oil project, again, led by ConocoPhillips. It is in the northwest region of Alaska, very remote land. It's on federal land. It would hold -- it holds up to 600 million gallons -- I'm sorry -- 600 million barrels of oil. But it would take several years for this oil to make it to market because the infrastructure has not yet been put in place. By the administration's own estimates, there would be a release of the same amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases as roughly 2 million gas- powered vehicles added to the road, just to give you a sense of what the environmental impact would be.

It says, \"Leader McConnell's concussion recovery is proceeding well, and the leader was discharged from the hospital today. It says, \"at the advice of his physician, the next steps would be a period of physical therapy at an in-patient rehab facility before he returns home.

But the main headline here, Jake, is that he is seeking to bring this lawsuit under this Texas Senate Bill 8. Again, this conduct happened in July of 2022. That is after Texas passed this very expansive abortion ban, which effectively bans abortion after six weeks. And the way that the law is set up is that it makes civilly liable, regular people throughout Texas and physicians. And so here's how this law is written basically says anybody who performs or induces an abortion in violation of Senate Bill 8 is simply liable. Anyone who knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of abortion. And it's so broad, Jake, that it includes people who intend to engage in the conduct described by Senate Bill 8 could be held civilly liable. There's a floor for the damages in the law, and that's a floor of $10,000. So it's a minimum of $10,000 and then anything above that including attorney's fees. Notably, Jake, this man says in this lawsuit that he intends to go after the manufacturer of the abortion pills. So he's looking at basically everybody along the timeline here saying, OK, who was involved in my then wife's abortion and who is civilly liable and he thinks it's a pretty long list. Notably, Jake, his then wife, the mother of his unborn child, he says is excluded from this lawsuit that is carved out per the Texas Senate Bill 8.

The civilians are the ones caught in the crosshairs. But what they're trying to do is put pressure on Ukrainian forces to prevent them from being able to gather their forces ahead of what we expect will be a spring counter offensive, Jake.",
