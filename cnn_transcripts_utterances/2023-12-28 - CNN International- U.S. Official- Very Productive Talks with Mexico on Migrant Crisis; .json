That's when migrants that are in an area that is over capacity are transported to an area that has processing space. Now, when it comes to the talks in Mexico City, one of the things that I'll be looking for is a possible clue for the outcome of those talks is the posture of law enforcement on the Mexican side of the border.

The watches are manufactured abroad, but an import ban on the series nine and ultra two watches had gone into effect earlier this week.U.S. officials ruled that Apple's watch violated another company's patents. But now a U.S. federal appeals court has temporarily blocked that ban. Apple was expected to redesign the watches before January the 12th. A new kind of media battle has broken out between \"The New York Times\" and the firms behind ChatGPT. That's the chat bot that uses artificial intelligence to produce amazingly crafted, but often inaccurate text and answers to questions. The Times announced Wednesday that it's suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The newspaper says that the tech giants use millions of New York Times articles to train ChatGPT and other AI models without any compensation for them. Other media firms, including the Associated Press, have reached licensing deals with open AI for the use of their data. But that isn't the case with \"The New York Times,\" who are not getting paid for their content. According to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, the sources for the items are not being attributed either.

And a lot has happened previously. And the question is, is it fair use? Which is what OpenAI is claiming, which is well beyond fair use. I think most people would agree. Or is it something that they have to pay for? And the question is, what's the price? And it seems to me \"The New York Times\" spends a lot of money on its content. I know they paid me to write content for them and they should get paid for the content that that ChatGPT might scrape. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
