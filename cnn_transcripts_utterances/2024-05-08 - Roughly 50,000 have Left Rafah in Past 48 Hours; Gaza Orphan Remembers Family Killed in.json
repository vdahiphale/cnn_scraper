Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now 9:30 local time and it's just after 9 o'clock in the morning in New York. And that is a picture as far as the futures markets are concerned the indication at least is that these markets will open slightly lower today. We'll keep an eye on that bottom of the hour. We'll get you the opening numbers. Well, a U.S. official tells CNN that an American weapons shipment to Israel was paused last week over concerns that bombs in the shipments weighing 2000 pounds can be used in Rafah. Previous CNN analysis has shown that Israel has already dropped hundreds of these massive bombs on Gaza. Meantime, despite weeks of public opposition from Washington, Israel says its operations in Rafah will continue until Hamas is eliminated there or that the first hostage returns. About 50,000 people have fled Gaza's border city in the past 48 hours according to a U.N. agency. We'll stay across these moving lines for you. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. Jeremy, let me start with you. We're looking at images of Rafah. We are aware of the operation there. Now over the past what 36 hours and from airstrikes, continued killings of Palestinians? What's next for Rafah?",

      "sentences": "-- told from U.S. officials is that this decision to stop or pause, this shipment of over3500 bombs to Israel came amid these discussions between the U.S. and Israel about how Israel was going to move forward with a potential ground incursion into Rafah. And over the last several weeks, the U.S., of course, has not seen a credible plan by the Israelis that would protect the more than 1 million Palestinian civilians who have been sheltering there. And so we're told that this decision to pause this transfer of weapons came as a direct result of the Israelis not providing the U.S. with a plan to protect those civilians. And so the U.S. is now actually exerting its leverage over these weapons sales to send a message to the Israelis for the first time really since October 7th. We should note that the U.S. has been transferring these bombs to Israel repeatedly over the last several months, including as recently as last month. But we're told that it's these 2000 pound bombs that the administration has previously sent to the Israelis and that the Israelis have used to devastating effect inside Gaza elsewhere on the strip that is really concerning for the administration that the Israelis might use these bombs inside Rafah in an extremely densely populated area, where civilians have really nowhere else to go in the Gaza Strip. That led the U.S. to consider finally up putting a pause on the transfer of these weapons. Now, this is just a pause, it is potentially temporary and it could be lifted if the Israelis provide the U.S. with a credible plan to remove those civilians prior to conducting any kind of major operation in Rafah. But it is a significant, at least political message, at least a signal to the Israelis that the U.S. is willing, at long last to finally leverage the influence that it has in terms of military support to the Israelis to pretty much force a policy shift by the Israelis in terms of how they're carrying out this war, Becky.",

The Biden administration will present to Congress, its findings on whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law during the war. The report has been months in the making and the subject of intense debate within the White House. Kylie Atwood is with us. What can we expect and when, Kylie? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, the report was due to Congress today, Becky, but we're told by congressional sources that the administration has said it's going to be slightly delayed, probably you know, we'll see it within the next week or so here. But as you said, it's looking at the use of U.S. weaponry by Israel. And if they're using those weapons in accordance with international humanitarian law, the Secretary of State has to gather assurances from Israel that they are doing so but then make the determination as to if those assurances are credible and reliable. And there's pressure from lawmakers in his own party, Senator Van Hollen, who has been an advocate for this national security memo that required this report saying that the U.S. shouldn't just take on face value, the assurances they're getting from Israel. But should have actual evidence from Israel should have explanations from Israel, for why they carried out certain strikes that could have been perceived to be out of line with international humanitarian law. The other part of this report that it's going to make a determination on is whether Israel impeded the delivery of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza. That's another key one, because U.S. officials have consistently said that Israel is doing more, but they have also said that Israel isn't doing enough. So where did they land on that key question? And, Becky, this is not a report that is going to require a policy change. But it could certainly trigger one, it could certainly trigger pressure on the Biden administration to change the way that it has been consistently going ahead with these arms sales to Israel. Of course, we know that there's a pause on one of those at this moment in time. But this is a really key moment for when this report is coming to fruition. I also want to note that in the backdrop, there have been other organizations Amnesty International, just in the last few weeks that have said that Israel is using U.S. weaponry in a way that is not in accordance with international humanitarian law.",

And one of them is to get access to documents that Trump claims will show that this was a malicious prosecution. And the second one has to do with his -- claim that Jack Smith, the Special Counsel was unlawfully appointed again, both of these motions are things that in other cases have been discarded by judges very quickly. But she is going to actually hold hearings. And that's what she's been doing with a lot of these things. Typically judges often ask for lawyers to brief and to provide filings and then make decisions. She doesn't do that. And so what we see from her is that this is now delaying things, at least as you pointed out to July, which means that we're not likely to see a trial before November that seems to be pretty clear now.

MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Yeah small parenthetical point which is some wonders why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down potentially TikTok or other entities of that nature.
