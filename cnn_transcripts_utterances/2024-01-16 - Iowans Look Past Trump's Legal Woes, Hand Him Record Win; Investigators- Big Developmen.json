But the question still stands this morning, what, if any, is the possible path forward for Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. Both will end up in New Hampshire at some point today. For Nikki Haley, New Hampshire has really been critical to her entire race. But if you look at the results in Iowa, what can you pull from them to try and get a sense of if there's a path forward.Again, Donald Trump winning by nearly 30 points in the state, a state that if you go back to 2016 he actually lost by about three points to Ted Cruz. Where you see yellow is where Ted Cruz won counties in the state. That, obviously, did not happen last night. Donald Trump winning 98 of the 99 counties winning 97 of those counties by 10 points or more. It was a blowout in every sense of the word. So when you look at the entrance polls of Iowa voters that we got last night, it tells you about how this race actually went and whether or not there's a path forward. So there's been a lot of discussion about Nikki Haley having a real path forward with suburban voters, voters with a higher education level. Well, Donald Trump, when it comes to education, those with a college degree, 37 percent, actually more than Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. No college degree, always a dominant base play for Trump and his team, did so again in Iowa -- 67 percent. What about, though, particularly as you head into New Hampshire when you talk about ideology, moderates, independents, whether Democrats would come over as well. That is a pathway forward for Nikki Haley, and it shows, at least in these entrance polls, while it was not a huge segment of those polls, 63 percent of those who identify as moderate said they supported Nikki Haley, Donald Trump only 22 percent. Still, 55 percent of conservatives, the Republican Party is a conservative party at its core. South Carolina, which comes right after New Hampshire is a conservative state, and South Carolina is a state that most people when you talk to them realize even if it's where Nikki Haley was the governor, that is not exactly ground where she is going to have a dominant performance. So where does this all lead us? Well, obviously, we are now headed into New Hampshire. This is where everybody is going to be focused on what happened in New Hampshire in 2016. Donald Trump won that state, won it pretty handily. It is an interesting dynamic. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. And that is where we find Kasie Hunt. That's where the New Hampshire race is really headed right now. Some candidates already there, and Kasie is with Jeff Zeleny who is not only an Iowa expert, \"The Des Moines Register\" alum, but also spent many, many a day in Manch-Vegas and beyond.

But she needs a win here in New Hampshire, and then she'll sort of figure out her strategy from there. But you're right about the winner take all after super Tuesday, whichis more than a month away. That is winner take all, which means he has been the winner and is likely to win those races, so it's a very tough delegate math. But for now we've seen New Hampshire sort of, as she would say, correct Iowa. We've seen it be an echo. I'm thinking back to 2000. George W. Bush came with a head of steam out of Iowa, a huge margin. Trump's is bigger, but John McCain slowed that roll here. Hillary Clinton did the same with Barack Obama. So as you have seen this as well as I have, New Hampshire can change things.

Wow, look at that 60 percent, 65 percent who say he is fit, but I had a really conservative operatives look at this and say, this is the most conservative electorate possibly in the country, and a third of them have a problem with this, and that means that it's almost impossible for Donald Trump to win a general election, let alone for Republicans to keep the House and keep the Senate.

We also know that the grand jury has been continuing to hear evidence in this case as you know, as soon as last week, they were still hearing evidence and we have heard that the district attorney say that Rex Heuermann was the prime suspect in the killing of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. So we're waiting to see exactly what does happen when court begins at 9:30, but we're fully expecting an indictment to be unsealed and in that, we could learn more details of what ties Rex Heuermann, possibly, according to investigators to the killing of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Remember, there was so much detail in that original indictment that was returned on the three other killings. When it comes to Brainard- Barnes, we know that she was killed in a similar fashion. Her body was bound, and around her legs was a belt that was keeping her tight and it had the initials of WH, so that's something we're looking for, and on that was a hair.

And so now, you know, it's clear for Democrats that we can go straight at the message of the extremists. What's their message? They want to take away women's right to choose. They want to, frankly cut Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. And they want to take away food support for the poorest children in America. Those are easy things for us to talk about, the kitchen table issues that matter to people -- jobs, rising wages, the creation of jobs, and bringing manufacturing to the United States, all things that Joe Biden has done, not Donald Trump.",

Until people truly feel the benefit of this economy, right, they haven't been registering in the polls that they're in favor of the people who created this opportunity for them.But the truth is that now that we're months and months into the recovery of the US economy, and so many jobs have been created, and income levels have gone up above inflation, as inflation has fallen, as gas prices have fallen, as mortgage rates are falling. You know that in an election year, if the economy is going the way of, you know, in a positive direction, the election is likely to go the direction of the incumbent. So I'm very pleased, though, with the work that Joe Biden has done because the contrast between these two visions for America is clear, right? Joe Biden has been standing up for working families. He is the person that has exhibited empathy for the American people, understands the problems and tries to address them. Donald Trump is the one who has exhibited...",

Then, you went on to say, whether you like your MAGA Trump agenda wrapped in original packaging or with high heels or lifts in their boots, I hear that dig.

But I do think that Congressman Kinzinger has got it right in his own life. He separated himself from Donald Trump. He separated himself from the MAGA Republican Party, and that's not what Nikki Haley has done. That's not what Ron DeSantis has done. Their criticism has been light. In fact, they're afraid of Donald Trump. Now, maybe that will change in New Hampshire. We'll see. It certainly changed for one day in Iowa as they were trying to divide, you know, voters to make sure that voters were showing up for them. But the truth is all along, I mean, let's face it, they've been kowtowing. Nikki Haley even worked for Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis won his race for governor because he took Donald Trump's support.
