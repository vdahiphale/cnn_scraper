For weeks now the Biden administration has been pressing the Israeli prime minister to strike a deal with Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages held in Gaza. Many Israelis have been making similar demands for months.But at the same time, pressure is growing on Benjamin Netanyahu from within his own far right coalition to reject any deal and instead ramp up the military intensity and launch a major ground offensive on Rafah, the southern Gaza City home for almost one and a half million displaced Palestinians. But both publicly and privately the White House has voiced its opposition to a wide scale military incursion into refer. And on Monday, Netanyahu appeared to get into demands from within his coalition, announcing a date has been said, but not the actual date for a ground operation and to Rafah. But according to the State Department, Israel has provided U.S. with no details about the actual date, or any credible plan for evacuating hundreds of thousands of civilians away from the line of fire and to some kind of relative safety as a ceasefire and hostage negotiations as sources. During weekend talks in Cairo, CIA director Bill Burns presented a new proposal to try and bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas. Here's how Netanyahu reacted to that news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo. We are constantly working to achieve our goals, primarily the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas. This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there, it will happen there is a date. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now just one brigade remains a few 100 troops and the National Security Minister the far right extremists and anti-Arab bigot Itamar Ben-Gvir is now threatening to topple Netanyahu over the withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Israel's actions in Gaza have triggered a genocide hearing at the International Court of Justice, allegations Israel denies. And a U.N. Secretary Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. But hopes for peace remain elusive. \"The beach makes me forget our pain, our sadness, our martyrs,\" Um Ihab said. \"Every time I come, I complain to the sea hoping that God will respond and finally, take us away from this pain.\" Nada Bashir, CNN -- London.

His 20-page document called \"Infinite Dignity\" lays out where the church stands on inherent and (INAUDIBLE) worth and rights afforded to every person. It reads in part, \"Any sex change intervention, as a rule, risks threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception.\" This declaration was five years in the making. It seems at odds to another declaration the pope made last year, allowing blessings for same-sex couples. Francis has openly tried to make the Catholic Church more acceptable of LGBTQ plus individuals. But he remains in the vocal minority even if he does run the place. Mexico broke diplomatic ties with Ecuador over the weekend after Ecuadorian police stormed its embassy to arrest a former vice president. Now neighboring countries are holding talks, trying to head off wider regional tensions. But as journalist Stefano Pozzebon reports, Ecuador's president is defending his country's decision.

Many countries in the region have criticized the action, accusing Ecuador of crossing a diplomatic red line. Mexico has severed diplomatic ties with Ecuador and its government is preparing a case against Ecuador at the International Court of Justice. But in an open letter published on social media on Monday, Noboa said he offered to resolve any difference with Mexico after the incident and that bringing Glas that to justice, was non-negotiable. Glas himself was taken to hospital on Monday after (INAUDIBLE) refusing to eat, according to the prison agency of Ecuador. He denies the charges and says that they are politically motivated.
