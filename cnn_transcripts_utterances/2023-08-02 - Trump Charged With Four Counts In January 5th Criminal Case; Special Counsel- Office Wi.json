What's different about this indictment, of course, is how it personally affected members of Congress on that day -- on January 6 when they were trying to certify the election.You do hear from Republican leaders very swift statements yesterday basically defending President Donald Trump and his actions, arguing that the Justice Department is weaponized. And you heard from some of Trump's staunchest defenders yesterday that they want to go after the office of Jack Smith in terms of funding that office. But over the course of the last several weeks, this was a very orchestrated effort to make sure that Donald Trump had defense from Republicans on Capitol Hill. They were coordinating that response, making sure that they were in a position to defend him. Meanwhile, in the Senate, you see a very different story playing out, Phil, and that's because we haven't heard from Mitch McConnell. We haven't heard from John Thune. And we're not going to hear from them, likely, for weeks because Republicans are on recess, which means you can't go through the halls of the Capitol getting a response in the way that you normally could because lawmakers are away for a very long recess, Phil.
