We're going to speak to Secretary Pete Buttigieg about the latest. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Vice President Harris is about to take stage, in battleground Arizona, where early in-person voting just got underway. We're going to monitor those remarks, and bring you news, as it happens this hour. But this is all coming as her party's biggest star just hit the campaign trail, for the first time, to try to help supercharge the base, amid some growing anxiety, within the party, ahead of the election. Former President Barack Obama is embarking on a multi-state campaign blitz for her, starting in Pennsylvania, tonight, where he unleashed a blistering attack on former President Trump.

I think Democratic Party elites, like Obama and like others, have been viciously attacking Donald Trump, since 2016. And everything they said about him is what they have always said about him. And I don't think it's particularly effective, right now.I think their problem isn't attacking Trump. Their problem is finding reasons to give people to support Kamala Harris. The stop he made, and this plea he's making to African American men. I mean, he said today -- he insulted them. I mean, he first of all, admits that they're not enthusiastic about her. He said, You just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and reasons for that. And I think one thing we've seen about Democrats, over the years, is that when they can't convince you to do something, they begin to insult you. Obama, specifically, when he was having trouble with rural voters in Pennsylvania, go back all the way into his campaigns, he insulted them about their culture and values. I don't think it's helpful, to insult a group of people, who are already not enthusiastic about your campaign. But I think that's what he did today.",

And they have their heads down. They're doing their job. They're pros. But you can tell that many of them are rattled by the level of just online vitriol and straight-out false information, that, by the way, isn't just a problem, because it's hurting somebody's feelings. It is actively making it more difficult, for responders to do their job. Imagine if somebody sitting at home believes, for example, Donald Trump, that all you're going to get is $750? And they get that initial support, which is something that disaster victims can get, that help to get immediate diapers, food, that kind of thing. They think that's all they can get. If they believe that? Then they might not apply for other funding that they absolutely deserve and should be getting. That's just one example of the sort of thing that can happen when those lies go around. Now, I will also say this. Having looked at the level of misinformation and the number of lies that spread, the last week, related to Hurricane Helene, and President Biden's forceful response, and the fact that we had a lot of leaders standing up to that, and I would say leaders in both parties? I do think that had a beneficial effect with regard to Milton. Don't get me wrong. Lots of misinformation and scam attempts going around in the context of Milton too. But one thing that was critically important is that when residents were warned, by local trusted authorities, and by FEMA, and by the President, to listen to those evacuation orders, to get out? They did. And when they were told to -- that we're past the point, where you can do that, and if you are in one of these locations, there's a need to shelter in place?

And the U.S. would have to come to anyone in NATO's defense, obviously, if one of them was hit by a -- by an attacker, that is in the, of course, NATO Treaty.But that chapter in his first term, something that we have long heard him echo, has led some lifelong Republicans, including some of the ones who served in his administration, to say that they cannot support Donald Trump, a second time. My source tonight is one of them. Former Trump National Security Adviser, John Bolton. Ambassador, I just wonder what you make of, it's not just this comment, because we've heard Donald Trump say things like this before. But it's the comment in the context of what we've learned recently, from Bob Woodward's new book, which is that he and Putin have reportedly spoken, at least seven times since he left office. What do you make of the comment in light of that reporting? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Well, I think the number of times that he's spoken with Putin is in dispute. The Russians deny it. We don't have any other independent evidence. Wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if he did. And it would simply confirm what has been evident for some time, that Trump thinks he's got a great personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. And in Trump's mind, this is consistent, whether it's Xi Jinping or Kim Jong Un or other adversarial leaders like that, that if he has a good relationship, personally, then the U.S. and that country have a good relationship. That's just utter nonsense. And these comments about NATO, he's made before. Some of his advisers have written Op-Eds on how he'll interpret the NATO Treaty, about not defending countries that aren't spending adequately on defense. That means the end of NATO. Let's be clear. I wrote about this in The Wall Street Journal months ago. You can't defend Poland, which is spending about 3 percent, and if we're, unfortunately driven back to the German border by the Russians, to say, Excuse me, Russians, can you just pause for a moment? Where -- you can do what you want in Germany. We'll see at the French border, because they're spending over 2 percent. It means the end of NATO. And I'd just make one more comment, if I may. For Republicans who believe that Trump will be OK in a second term, that he won't ditch support for Ukraine, that he won't withdraw from NATO, that he won't interpret the Treaty of Washington in a way that makes it wholly useless, it's going to be OK? Go ahead and vote for Trump if you want. But for goodness sakes, do it with your eyes open. The odds that he will withdraw from NATO are very high.",

But I do want to say this about the general subject, of a former American official, talking to leaders of friendly foreign countries, or even leaders of not so friendly foreign countries. I think it's a gross violation of the First Amendment to say that somehow the Logan Act makes that illegal. It may be imprudent. It may be unwise.

Because this is a much warmer, more violent Earth than it was a generation or two ago. The response is robust, and we're seeing lots of efforts everywhere, the cleanup and getting things going. But Ron DeSantis, the Governor of the State, just this year, signed legislation that prohibits his agencies from considering climate science in new laws. And so, how can you plan for the storms, a few years from now? Nobody planned for the roof to get shredded off of the trop, when they put 10,000 cots in there, as a first responder staging area. Just last month, FEMA announced this partnership with the NFL. They're going to start using stadiums as these field hospitals and rallying points. But Raymond James Stadium, where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers play, also flooded.
