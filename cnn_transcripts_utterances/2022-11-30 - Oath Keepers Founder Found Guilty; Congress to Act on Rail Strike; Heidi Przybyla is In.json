First, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, and another high-ranging member of the right-wing militia group, Kelly Meggs, both found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their roles around the January 6th Capitol attack. Now the two face a 20-year maximum prison sentence on that charge. We'll have more on that in just a moment.",

Congress is also working on a deal to fund the government with a looming deadline in December. We're going to be live on Capitol Hill with all those developments just ahead.Let's begin, though, with a significant win for the Justice Department, the founder and another leader of the Oath Keepers found guilty of seditious conspiracy. CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid joins us now. The most serious charge brought so far in these ongoing investigations of January 6th, and not an easy one to prove.",

And defense attorneys have signaled that they intend to appeal these verdicts and they see hope for their clients in that this was a split verdict.But make no mistake, Jim, I mean, this was a victory for the Justice Department as it was the first time in a trial related to the Capitol attack where a jury found that the violence on January 6th was not a spontaneous disruption, but the product of an organized conspiracy. So, let's break down exactly what happened here. Rhodes, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers, the militia, and one of his subordinates, Kelly Meggs, were both convicted of seditious conspiracy. And this, again, like you said, it's the most serious charge that has been brought in any of the criminal cases stemming from the Capitol attack. Rhodes, Meggs and three other defendants, Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson, and Thomas Caldwell were all convicted of obstructing an official proceeding and several charges. Now, the Justice Department was alleging that the Oath Keepers conspired to forcibly stop the peaceful transition of power. The lead prosecutor told the jury in his closing statements that Rhodes and his subordinates, they claimed to be saving the republic but they fractured it instead. Now, I do want to note that on the day of the insurrection, Rhodes remained outside the Capitol, but prosecutors compared him to a general overseeing his troops. And, look, this trial was a major test for the Justice Department, for their ability to hold accountable those who participated in January 6th. And, Jim, I think you're going to see this really embolden prosecutors, not only the ones working on the cases already in the pipeline, but expand that beyond to the newly appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith. They're going to see that here a jury was able to see this wasn't spontaneous and were able to hold people accountable for what they saw as an actual conspiracy.",

      "sentences": "It's significant, Bianna, really in the sense that seditious conspiracy is very rarely charged. The last time it was even charged in a case was 2010. The judge threw that out. Before that, in decades it had only been charged, I think, three times prior to that, for a couple of reasons. One, people usually don't try to overthrow governments. And that's a good thing. But, number two, actually establishing that someone used force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution of a law is actually quite hard to do legally. And so on account of the fact that the Justice Department established here that they could get a conviction on the seditious conspiracy charge is very big. And then I think beyond that there's the macro almost moral point thatan attack on America ended in a conviction here. And so even setting aside the legal questions, it's just a significant moment for the country.",

And you have to establish not just -- so, for instance, that he thought he won an election and was zealously advocating on his own behalf, but that he set out to break the law. And with respect to, at least in this seditious conspiracy case here, Stewart Rhodes, it was clear to the jury that there was the -- that level - that extra level of intent, not just to do something bad, but to break the law, too.Look, it could be difficult to charge the former president with any number of crimes because of this intent question that we've talked about frankly for, you know, a couple of years at this point.

First they're going to vote on the deal that was struck in September but has since been rejected. As a reminder, that includes a 24 percent pay increase and better health benefits. And then the House is going to hold a separate, second vote on adding paid sick leave. That's something that unions have been pushing for and the reason why progressives were critical of the deal as-is. All of that will then head to the Senate. It is unclear if the Senate will take up the paid sick leave portion, but both Republican and Democratic Senate leaders are vowing to get this deal done. So, really it's just a matter of timing, which can be a little tricky in the Senate. But this is just one of several tasks facing Congress and the administration during these critical lame duck session period. The other thing that they're trying to do is pass same-sex marriage. Next week the House will take up the Senate bill. They passed that last night in an historic vote. Now it's on its way to becoming law. And then Congress is also racing to do an omnibus spending deal. That is a massive spending deal to fund the government by the December 16th deadline. It's a heavy lift. That's something that takes a lot of work around here, but the holidays are usually a pretty good motivating factor to get people to get their work done. And all four big congressional leaders, so Kevin McCarthy, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell left a White House meeting yesterday vowing to try to get an omnibus spending deal done as opposed to a short-term patch. We'll see if they're able to get it done or if they need to buy themselves a little bit more time, which tends to be the case around here, guys.",

Senator Sanders has already said that he's going to block the broader bill if he doesn't get a vote on his amendment to create sick leave, the seven days of sick leave, for the workers. But the interesting part of this is, he's got some unexpected allies, like Senator Marco Rubio, who we've seen huddling with on the floor of the Senate yesterday. Also some senators like Josh Hawley.Look, in the past, union bosses and demands from union bosses were seen as kind of like the boogieman of the Republican Party. And here you have, as the Senate Republicans are kind of going into this wilderness period over at least the next two years, a lot of soul searching about how they want to reposition the party and, surprise, surprise, here you have them coming out in favor, at least with Rubio and maybe some others, of these pro-union measures.

Does anyone think, for instance, that Steve Scalise wouldn't have an equally difficult sledding trip here with some of the right frank. And, in the end, a lot of these guys who are making these threats really don't want to be in a position of leadership. They feel more empowered when they are blocking things and throwing sand in the gears of government versus having to be in those leadership positions themselves.So, I think this is just -- probably just a preview of what Kevin McCarthy's life is going to be like over the next two years versus knocking him off of his throne.
