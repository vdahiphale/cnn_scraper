The only 20 have come out publicly to call for him to step aside, that's a small fraction of the overall House and Senate Democratic Caucus.And the Biden team will say, look, we have all these other members who haven't call for him to step aside. But they didn't want to say that publicly, even though many of them agree with Adam Schiff. They're seeing polling in their districts, we're seeing what's happening in the swing states, and they believe the Biden himself just simply doesn't get how serious of trouble that he is in, now he could take down the whole party with them. So which makes the next two weeks incredibly critical here before the DNC officially makes Biden the nominee and what the leaders do. They have to make some sort of public statement.

As President Biden continues to bleed support, the Trump campaign is piling on saying they can't commit to the VP debate because the actual proposed debate from \"CBS\" would be quote unfair to Kamala Harris to whoever Kamala Harris picks us her running mate, because it would be before the convention.Joining me now Democratic Senator Cory Booker. So, you know, Senator for a -- for a few days, this quieted down after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. And now we're starting to hear the drumbeat again, Adam Schiff today, the congressman, becoming the most high profile Democrat to call for President Biden to step aside in the election, of course, he's a close confidant of Nancy Pelosi. So do you think this is building again? Do you think that this is going to change the outcome? SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): I think the President has shown extraordinary leadership over his 50-year career and he's facing a real question of what is best for the country. And I think he'll make that decision. A lot of us are doing everything we can behind the scenes to really talk openly and honestly, with the President, with his team about the best way forward. We've had private meetings in D.C. all last week. I don't want to have this conversation in public. I'm just -- I just think that that's not wise right now that the Republicans are having their convention. I want to get everybody to refocus on what we have done over the last four years, congressional Democrats have lowered the cost of insulin and health care, congressional Democrats, along with President Biden have passed extraordinary infrastructure bills, things that made a real difference in the lives of folks. So I know that Donald Trump and his team want to try to pit Democrat against Democrat. I think this is a time where we should be L telling a common story about what we have done together as a party with Joe Biden as our leader with incredible congressional Democrats.",
