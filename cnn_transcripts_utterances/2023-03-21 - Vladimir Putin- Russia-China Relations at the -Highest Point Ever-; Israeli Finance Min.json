We will explore why their talks have put NATO on edge. Then, international outrage as Israel's finance minister claims there's no such thing as a Palestinian people. We'll have more on that coming up. Plus, a new blistering report accuses London's Metropolitan police of letting predators flourish. We'll explain what it says of the forces failures. But first, tonight, China and Russia want the world to know their friendship is strong and they will support each other against pressure from the west. On their second day of talks in Moscow, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a joint declaration of partnership, promising mutual assistance and deeper economic ties. Mr. Putin says the talks were substantive, frank, as well as friendly. He toasted Mr. Xi at a state dinner, boasting that relations between the two countries are at the highest point ever. Still, according to Mr. Putin, China is taking an objective stance on Ukraine, one that world really should pay attention to. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA, (through translator):  Of course, we did not ignore the situation around Ukraine. We believe that many of the points on the peace plan put forward by China are consistent with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis of a peaceful settlement when the West and Kyiv are ready for it. But this readiness is not observed on their side. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are joining forces and the West be damned. These guys basically share the same ideology. That the U.S.-led western world order that's been in place for more than 70 years since the end of World War II needs to go away. It needs to be destabilized. They think that NATO and other groups like that have too much power. And so they're joining forces. China, for the moment, is helping to keep Russia afloat. They're preventing Putin's Russia from collapsing economically, certainly. But also adding legitimacy by Xi Jinping, you know, making this his first foreign trip since getting an unprecedented third term. You know, making him the leader of a country of 1.5 billion people with the world's largest Navy and nuclear arsenal, and a lot of weapons and ammunition that could really help Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. In exchange, of course, for Vladimir Putin's unwavering support down the road no matter what happens. For Jinping, ideology comes first. He's been that way throughout his rising through the ranks of China's communist party. And you see these two leaders there, Isa, you know, sitting in this vast, you know, very Soviet-style kind of hall, you see them in Beijing, you see them in North Korea, you see it there at the Kremlin, signing these documents, saying well, you know, when Kyiv, you know, when they decide to come around, then this is what they will want to -- this is what we will present to them. I mean, these are two guys that are living in an echo chamber of yes men, not accountable to the public in their own countries where human rights are abysmal in many cases, and imposing their will now on Ukraine and trying to impose it on the rest of the world.",

And basically stating, without giving a timeline, that at some point, this self-governed democracy, Taiwan, which the communist rulers have always claimed but never controlled since the end of China's civil war, Xi Jinping believes that this will inevitably become a part of China, and he wants it to happen on his watch. And that's pretty unlikely that the voters here, even those who tend to side with, you know, pro-Beijing in terms of business interests and communication, it's hard to imagine a Taiwan that would willingly just be reabsorbed into the mainland, especially after what they saw unfold in Hong Kong, which was promised one country, two systems.

The Dow is up 349 points at the highs of theday, so helping stabilize the market is that news, as you point to that, that we got yesterday, that First Republic may be getting some help again from JPMorgan to perhaps consider another rescue plan. So that happened on the First Republic side, that happened with the regional banks, and providing a bit of calm in the markets. Now all eyes turned to this March FOMC meeting and the announcement tomorrow in terms of what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates. You can see that traders are largely pricing in another rate hike, but this time, a quarter of a percent versus what we were expecting a few weeks ago of half a percent. So, you can see, if we can pull it up here, that markets are largely expecting -- well, this is First Republic over the last six months or so. A quick note about this, although markets are -- although those shares are higher, just take a look at how much they had fallen. But this is what traders are expecting tomorrow when we hear from Jay Powell; the Federal Reserve Chairman, 85 percent of the traders expecting a quarter of a percent, and 15 percent expecting a pause, which Goldman Sachs is actually advocating. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius saying in a research no, that it really doesn't make sense to raise rates right now with the banking instability that we are still in the midst of seeing in part. It doesn't make sense to tie a monetary policy amidst ongoing stress in the banking system. I think we can get this pulled up for you. That could present potential downside risk to the economy. And Isa, what the concern is of course, is while we are still in the thick of it with these banks, even if we don't see another bank fall, we certainly hope that we don't. Even if we don't, there will be an impact to the real economy. You think about these small and medium-sized banks who are responsible for quite a bit of consumer lending, business lending, for example, who are now in a position where they feel like maybe they should hold onto a bit more cash, maybe they should try to be a bit more nimble, a bit more liquid. Well, that is less money going out the door, in terms of lending, right? And so Goldman Sachs pointing out that, that pullback and lending could essentially be the equivalent of a rate hike of a quarter of a percent to half a percent, or considered another way, a decline in GDP growth in 2023, about quarter to half a percentage point. And you can argue, Isa, well, isn't that the point? Isn't what that the -- what the Federal Reserve is trying to do, in terms of slowing economic growth? And yes, they are. Although, I don't think they want to see it this way. I don't think they want to see it at the expense of banks and sort of, financial stability. So, a lot for the Fed to consider when they meet today and when we hear from them tomorrow. Another thing to consider, Isa, it's what they do, but it's also critically what they say. What they say about the economy, what they say about what they're willing to do, and what they say about the path forward.",

Smotrich has significant powers over the West Bank. Just weeks ago you will remember he said the Palestinian town of Huwara should be erased by the state of Israel. Condemnation of his most recent remarks is pouring in from right across the Middle East and the United States and the European Union. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, E.U.

But also on the podium was a flag that appears to show an extended map of Israel that included Gaza, the occupied West Bank and parts of Jordan. The remarks about Palestinians and that image of a senior Israeli minister, speaking alongside that extended map, drew swift combination from the Americans, the Europeans and Emirati Saudis and, of course, the Jordanians, who summoned Israel's ambassador in Amman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AYMAN SAFADI, JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  The Israeli government should say clearly that this minister's comments do not represent it.

But it can often be tense. The Jordanian kingdom is the traditional custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem, which is often the site of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. Smotrich's comments actually also came on the same day that Israelis and Palestinians were holding a summit attended alongside the Americans, Egyptians and Jordanians, Sharm El Sheikh, a meeting that was meant to try and help calm tensions ahead of the upcoming Ramadan and Passover holidays.

First of all, it is shocking that someone known for genocidal statements and someone known for the (INAUDIBLE) response to the recent violence against the (INAUDIBLE) Palestinian population is allowed to deliver such a message in France at the (INAUDIBLE) European Union basically without real consequences other than words of condemnation. European Union has a legal framework that prohibits and demands states to punish racist and xenophobic inside public incitement. And in other cases, like in the case of Russian propagandists, attacks against the identity of the Ukrainian people, political leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, have promptly warned (ph) against the risk of genocide. And without getting into the material condition of genocide, international law enshrines triggers states' responsibilities to make the best efforts to prevent the incitement to the commission of atrocity. But also the (INAUDIBLE) element that I find shocking is that this statement is not just another -- yet another slip of the tongue of an extravagant minister. This statement has been heard before, the denial of the Palestinians as a people. And respond to something that we have seen practiced happening and consolidating, meaning the occupation, is a denial of the existence of the Palestinians as a people. And therefore, that the upper time (ph) is it true (ph) to manage the problem, an unoccupied people who shouldn't be there is to be displaced and replaced.",

And it is the result of gang warfare. Gangs are completely out of control, are fighting over turf in Haiti and are not being challenged by the police or the government in many cases. So as bad as things have been over the recent months in Haiti, it does seem like it's a situation that gets more and more out of control, worse by the day. And this report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, they are calling for what they call or what they say is a specialized support force, a force from a foreign government that would come in and essentially prop up the failing national police. The national police have been outgunned by the gangs. As you know, I've discussed this police force in recent weeks; at times, things have turned onto their own government because they feel like they're essentially have been given a mission that is unwinnable to try and force the gangs to stop killing their own people. And so, if a government will step up, we've seen Canada supplying more and more assets to the national police. But of course, no government at this point is saying that they're willing to put boots on the ground, because it is such a dangerous situation, a situation that the government, that the police are unable to bring back under control. So it is unclear what will a foreign government be able to do? Of course will have more resources, properly trained police but, as we've seen in years past, when a foreign government gets involved in Haiti, they don't necessarily make things better. And this report notes that, if a foreign government goes in, they will be looking at a mission that could last not weeks or months but years.
