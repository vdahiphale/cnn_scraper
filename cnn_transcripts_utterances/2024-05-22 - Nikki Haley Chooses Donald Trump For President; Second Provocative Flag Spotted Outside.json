The Nikki Haley on the campaign trail got it right.And I think that, you know, it's not a matter of if but when any sort of attachment to Donald Trump becomes the ultimate headwind to a Republican politician. Certainly, doesn't feel like it today, but in the coming years, it will not be a tailwind to be associated with Donald Trump. It'll be a headwind. I think this hurts Nikki Haley's brand in longevity. I think she's certainly got a bright future in front of her. But we've got to turn the page on Donald Trump. And, of course, what I'm doing is a bank shot.

We haven't seen a lot of data on this. I think \"The New York Times\" did a pretty fascinating in-depth report on who those voters are. So, I'm not convinced that they would have voted for Donald Trump, regardless of what Nikki Haley would have done.I think, ultimately, this is still going to come down to turnout. I'm looking at two groups in particular. I really want to see what the Latino group will do, how they perform. We've seen some interesting, fascinating numbers there. And I'm also curious to see what some African-American men will do. I'm not convinced by the numbers of 20, 30 plus percent. I think that's a bit ludicrous. But I do think it's possible to increase the numbers from 12% to maybe 13 to 14%. And that 2% marginal increase could make an interesting difference. So, this is going to be a fascinating race, but I'm not necessarily concerned because, again, I think those voters will always be against Trump no matter what. I think the question for Republicans such as Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan and others, not necessarily Trump, but whenever he's gone, whether he wins or loses, how do you bring those voters, that third of the party, back into the fold?",

But this time, it was the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag that was flying outside his vacation home in Jersey. Now, that flag has a long history dating back to the Revolutionary War. But it has been carried by rioters who stormed the Capitol on January 6th.Now, Alito, he previously pointed fingers at his wife for raising the upside-down U.S. flag, a \"Stop the Steal\" symbol, at his Virginia home during a clash with a neighbor, notably just three days before Biden's inauguration. Now, one might wonder who was responsible this time. Well, joining us now, senior prosecutor to Robert Mueller Special Counsel Investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and also the co-author of \"The Trump Indictments,\" Andrew Weissmann. Andrew, so good to have you on. Thanks for stopping by today. You know, when you hear about the Supreme Court justices and yet another controversial issue like this, does it raise questions for you about the fact that he is sitting and overseeing important cases like, I don't know, Trump's presidential immunity claim or other January 6th cases?",

The idea that he sat on the decision to decide whether the president should be disqualified because he was an insurrectionist, should he be disqualified from being on the ballot again, that is a decision that you would think he might have to recuse himself on.But even more important is the point that you're making, which is that he has just heard in his sitting on a case deciding the issue of presidential immunity. And if you think back to what those flags mean at the time, as you reported, this is about flying that flag just shortly after the January 6th insurrection. We all can remember our reaction to what was going on, particularly if you were in Washington, D.C. But I think for the nation, it was shocking and horrifying. And not only was he flying a flag that was a symbol used during that insurrection, but his sort of claim that it was something that was okay to do because it was retaliation for a sign that was sort of against Trump that his neighbor was flying. So, his neighbor has a First Amendment right to fly that, and so a sitting Supreme Court justice has on his lawn. And I don't buy that sort of like \"my wife did it\" defense when it's on his own front lawn. To me, the issue is it's an appearance of impropriety. And there really is, unfortunately, right now, there is no system to hold him to account so that he isn't sitting on cases where there's an appearance of impropriety.",

It's worth everyone remembering that before the case was indicted, she was involved in this case, the pre-indictment phase, she issued rulings, and she was reversed not once but twice by the 11th Circuit, a very conservative court of appeals. There were conservative judges on the panels, and they said what she did was beyond the pale.And now, what we're seeing is either, in my opinion, sort of incompetence or partisanship or a combination of both. And what's really unfortunate is this is a case where basically the state is saying, we want to give the defendant his day in court. We want to carry -- be tested and carry the burden, to be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and to provide him his day in court. And she is really slow-walking the case to say that the defendant will not have his day in court, and that means the public will not have its right to a public and speedy trial vindicated before the general election.",

It's somewhat unusual that you have so many sorts of potential political ramifications based on what just 12 citizens will decide. But I think the issue of what the ramifications are for the other criminal cases, I can really only answer that as a -- as a -- in my sort of dweeby, nerdy lane as a lawyer, which is that it really shouldn't have any effect. Just because there's one case that is on topic A and it is the state's burden, and it's a heavy burden as it should be, if they haven't met that burden as found by a jury, then that's what should happen. And then other juries will have their own ability to assess other cases and other facts, and also hold the state in those other cases to that same heavy burden.
