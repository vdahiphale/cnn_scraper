And the FAA says low cloud ceilings, this big storm system that's moving through airports on the East Coast, could still have a pretty big impact. We saw a ground stop earlier today for flights going to New York's LaGuardia. There were arrival delays going into JFK. We've seen departure delays, meaning flights held on the ramp at Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and also, George Bush Intercontinental Airport just popped up on the list.
