Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translation): As far as exchanges are concerned, this topic was led by the Federal Security Bureau, the Federal Security Bureau negotiated and achieve the results that you have learned about. Contacts continue, they have never stopped through the special services. Are other swaps possible? Yes, all is possible. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH: Now, he went on, in separate comments to say that these talks had created a certain atmosphere, but it seems to be an atmosphere about further prisoner swaps, perhaps not the idea of broader diplomacy that might alter the course of the war in Ukraine. The U.S. very clear that it's up to Ukraine to engineer its own just peace. Viktor Bout, the man exchange and all of this as Griner, he's back in Moscow. He gave an interview to Russian state television, where he said that in jail he hadn't experienced the risk of phobia that Russian state media is so keen to suggest is prevalent in the United States. But did say the U.S. wants to finish the job of getting rid of the Soviet Union after the 90s. And he talked about how his return was an example of a slogan that Russia likes to use in its war in Ukraine, they don't leave anybody behind. Often that's pointed out as absurd given the number of Russian bodies strewn on the battlefield. But at this stage, it is quite clear what Russia wants next. That's bad in classic cough, a Russian held in Germany for murder. And that may be the reason why Paul Whelan wasn't part of this exchange. The next steps potentially quite clear. The point being that U.S. can't re-tell Germany who to let out of prison. Wolf?",

And each time, they found more documents, the Trump team commissioned their own search, in recent days found more documents. So there are some real questions about whether they even know what may or may not be there, and whether they're doing a sufficient enough job of going through what is in the former president's possession, and combing it truly for these documents.It's clear that the Trump team because they've -- I mean, unwilling to sign an attestation basically saying that they have handed everything over, not even the Trump team is confident enough in that to put their name on a legal document attesting that they've done their best to find all these documents. And I think the Justice Department is frustrated with that.

If there could be a contempt proceeding in the future, perhaps, those are the sort of things that could result in fines. I mean, it doesn't look like that's where things are today as they are now.But one of the things to remember whenever you're looking at all of this is that it factors in to whatever case Special Counsel Jack Smith would be building at this time, every single thing that happened around the subpoena in May trying to collect all of the classified or documents or documents with markings on them about national security. All everything that has happened becomes part of the reason that the Justice Department wanted to do that search and seizure at Mar-a-Lago in August. The reason they continued to come visit Mar-a-Lago and the continued discussions that the Justice Department prosecutors have been having with Trump, this criminal investigation continues on. We have no indication at this time that it is over. Wolf?",

One is to try to collect all of the presidential and classified documents in the former president's possession as a national security matter. And the second is this criminal investigation. So on the criminal investigation side, really on both sides, they're probably thinking about search warrants.You know, do they have enough evidence that there are classified documents or presidential documents at these other properties that they can now go in and get a search warrant for? And then, you know, as far as just trying to force the team, Trump's team, to be more diligent in terms of turning things over, providing them with more information, you know, on both of those tracks, I think they're going to want to make sure that there are no more documents out there. But also building this criminal case, because that evidence, as Katelyn was saying, is terrific evidence of consciousness of guilt. You know, it's not just about he had these things in his possession, but look how he hid them, look how he refused to talk about them and turn them over. So all of this kind of goes into the mix, both for getting them back and for ultimately for charges down the road.

They have been the target, if you like, of earlier suggestions coming out of the Kremlin or hints at potential use of a tactical nuclear weapon.And then just a few days ago, Vladimir Putin made a series of statements saying that they would never use nuclear weapons in an offensive capability. And in his words, they were not holding a knife against going around the world holding a knife against people's throats, although from the Ukrainian position, that's exactly what they've been doing with these hints of tactical nuclear weapons or first use. And now we have this sudden volt fast again, almost entirely predictable and predicted, I have to say, Wolf, in which Vladimir Putin is saying that he is considering not acting upon the looking at the doctrine of first use that he says the United States has that would allow, in a doomsday scenario for Russia to try to take out the nuclear capabilities of an enemy before it, the Russian motherland got struck. He also said that only Russia in terms of nuclear power -- the only nuclear weapons that Russia had were inside the Russian Federation's territory. And also, and this is significant, I think, said that only Russia had these hypersonic missiles. We don't know whether or not he really does have them. But these beyond supersonic missiles that they claim to have used in the early stages of their invasion of Ukraine, again, being not hinted absolutely said as a boast by Russia, that it is something that they have, that the Americans don't have. So clearly, trying to position himself there not quite as making an outright threat, but the threat of a threat, I think, Wolf.",

First of all, will the Ukrainians be able to withstand this most recent very aggressive push by Russia around Bakhmut in the East? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think they can hold it, I think they can envelop it, I think they can cut off the logistics for it. And I think they can prevail in this eastern fight. However, it's going to take more and more resources from the west. And neither the United States nor our European allies are actually doing enough right now. They need more artillery, they need better drones, they switchblade 600, they need more artillery repairs, spare barrels, ammunition, they need tanks, and one tanks need to be put in there or German Leopards. This is a make-or-break moment for Ukraine, Wolf, because we know that Russia will be back in the spring with a rebuilt force. They've got the manpower for it, they will mobilize it. They may not have the highest technology missiles, but they'll have plenty of old stuff that's very destructive. And if they come through Belarus, it's a completely new front. And that's what we have to expect. So this is the time that the allies should be really pushing the support into Ukraine to get Russia out of Ukraine. That's the best way to finish this.",
