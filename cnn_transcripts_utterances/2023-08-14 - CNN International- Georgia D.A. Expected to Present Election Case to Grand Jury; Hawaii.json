In parts of the self the heat index could reach as high as 117 degrees and the entire state Louisiana is under an excessive heat warning too. Meantime, more than 100 million people across the Eastern U.S. are under severe storm threat today. The risk stretches from eastern Tennessee and Kentucky to the southern part of the Northeast. The main threats are damaging wind gusts, isolated tornadoes and large hail.We're following developments out of Ukraine where at least three people have been injured in Russian missile and drone attacks on the southern region of Odesa. One official says multiple fires were sparked by falling missile debris. Meantime, Ukraine's foreign ministry is strongly condemning Russia's provocative actions -- that's a quote -- in the Black Sea. This after Russia defense ministry said one of its warships fired warning shots and servicemen boarded a cargo ship that it claims was headed to Ukraine. So to get into both of those stories, CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now in London with more. And Clare, what more have we heard from officials for our sources about those overnight attacks on the southern ports that's near Odesa?",

Seem to be targeting the ports. This time we're seeing that debris from missiles. The Air Force is saying that it shot down some 15 attack drones and some eight Kinzhal missiles where fired from the Black Sea.But if you look at the pictures, extraordinary to think that that is caused by debris alone. That the Air Force is describing it as an antiaircraft battle that happened in the skies over Odesa. They're not ruling out at this point that the ports could have been targeted. That this hit in the center of the city, a supermarket, a dormitory belonging to an educational institution, three people injured at this point. So it looks like they avoided the worst effect of this, but a major operation now to put out those fires. And separately we're hearing this morning of more attacks in the Zaporizhzhia region. A village near Zaporizhzhia City where a man and woman in their 70s were killed. And two more people killed in Kherson Monday morning after a very deadly Sunday which saw an entire family killed including a three-week-old baby.

Because Russia has warned ever since pulling out of that grain deal that it will consider any ship heading to Ukrainian ports -- as it says this one was -- as potentially carrying weapons.So this is according to the Russian ministry of defense. One is to carry out inspection. Apparently, the ship's captain did not respond to their request to stop and let them board. They ended up having to fire these warning shots, they say, and then put a sort of helicopter loaded servicemen onto the ship where they seems to have carry out the inspection. And then let the ship carry-on along its way. Right now, according to the marine traffic -- it's tracking data -- its on its way to Sulina, which is above a Romanian port on the mouth of the Danube on the Black Sea, on the way to Izmail, which is the Ukrainian river port in the Danube. Which Russia says the ship was heading for. Right now we really only have Russia's word for it. We're trying to get hold of the owner of the ship to get more. But it's a bit hard to track that down at the moment. So mysterious, but I think clearly Russia asserting its control over that region.",

He tells CNN that the Marion County Police Department raided both his home and his publication's office last week. He adds that police seized things like computers, cell phones, and other materials. Meyer suggesting that this was all partly triggered by a story that was published mentioning Kari Newell, the owner of a local coffee shop. Meyer explaining that he and his colleagues received a confidential tip about Newell allegedly driving without a driver's license rather than publish a story based on that tip. Meyer says that he consulted with an attorney and then notified local law enforcements that the newspaper, his newspaper, had come into the contact or at least into the possession of some possible sensitive materials. Meyer says that police then notified Newell. What followed was the issuing of a search warrant alleging violations of identity theft and authorizing the seizure of any documents pertaining to Newell. Newell, for her part, telling CNN that she was, quote, flabbergasted when she learned about the raid and denied knowing that it was even in the works. Meyer, claiming that law enforcement did not provide him with much information, only handed him a copy of that search warrant. During the search, Meyer's 98-year-old mother, who was home at the time. She was there. Meyer confirming for CNN that she died earlier this weekend, and he believes that it was from stress that was brought on by that search, though an exact cause of death has not yet been confirmed. The Marion County Police Chief says that he is confident that the judicial system that is currently being questioned will eventually be vindicated. CNN has also reached out to the Marion County magistrate, who is initially the one who signed that warrant. It is certainly a complicated story, to say the least, but albeit quite an important one to follow, as is small Kansas town is now caught in the middle of a battle over the First Amendment.
