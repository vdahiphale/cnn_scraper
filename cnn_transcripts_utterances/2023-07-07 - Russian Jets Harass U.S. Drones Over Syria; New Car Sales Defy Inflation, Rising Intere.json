On Thursday, they intercepted American drones again, forcing evasive maneuvers. That is now twice in under two days.CNN's Oren Liebermann has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  For the second time in as many days, Russian fighter jets intercepted and harassed U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones operating over Syria. This time, it occurred early Thursday morning. And the commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command, Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, says those Russian fighters got dangerously close to the U.S. drones. In this video you can see this encounter as it happened. You see as the Russian fighter jets get close and fly above and faster than the drone one of those jets begins dropping a series of flares. And it almost looks like the fighter jet is attempting to hit the drone with those flares. This is very similar to what we saw the Russians do one day earlier. That's when three Russian fighter jets approached three U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones and conducted very similar activity, which the Department of Defense called unsafe and unprofessional. In that case, one of those Russian fighter jets dropped parachute flares in front of the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone while another lit afterburner in front of the Reaper drone, which made it difficult to operate the drone in a safe manner. Crucially, it's not just the U.S. that appears to be the target of these aggressive Russian activities. The French said they were also essentially harassed by a Russian fighter jet. This time, the French, on the official Twitter account of the French Armed Forces, said they had two of their Rafale fighter jets operating near the Iraq-Syria border when a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jet came up and operated in a non-professional manner. The French, according to this tweet, essentially averted any sort of risk and flew away. We've seen this play out over several months. Back in April, a U.S. official told us it was essentially the Russians trying to operate in a new and more aggressive manner here, ignoring the deconfliction protocols that were specifically set up to avoid any sort of conflict or miscalculation between two of the most powerful militaries in the world.

New car sales in the U.S. have risen in the first half of the year at a pace that is far ahead of what was expected. Industrywide, vehicle sales totaled about $7.7 million from January to June. That's according to the research firm Ward Intelligence. So what is driving -- you got it there -- driving this trend? Let's bring in Brian Moody. He is the executive editor for Auto Trader and Kelly Blue Book. Brian, welcome -- good morning. So what is behind the trend? BRIAN MOODY, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, AUTO TRADER AND KELLY BLUE BOOK (via Skype):  Well, increased inventory is one thing that's behind that. And when we say that we just mean that there's more choices. So a lot of consumers were looking for a car about a year ago and they didn't find what they wanted or the prices were too high. So now we see more selection and more inventory, and we know that the average price is still high but they have what they want. That's one thing driving it.",

Today, people who are buying new cars -- about 20 percent of them -- it's around 18 percent are opting for a luxury car. That's higher than it has been in the past and that brings the average up. So there still are ways that you can find a car that's a decent price.But at the same time, we know that the average price or the average age of a used car on the road today is about 12 years old. So there's a little bit of pent-up demand and there are some people out there who are, like, I put off my purchase already. It's long enough. And there are some incentives.

His security then back-handed me in the face without looking back, in front of a crowd.\" Wembanyama told reporters that he didn't actually see what happened and that he was unaware that it was Britney Spears that was the one involved until hours later.

The seven-foot-four French phenom set to make his summer league debut tonight in Vegas -- but a bizarre dust-up.In baseball now, Reds outfielder Nick Senzel pretty much single- handedly stole a win from the Nationals last night. With the score tied at three in the bottom of the ninth inning, he made a spectacular leaping catch against the right field wall to keep Washington from a walk-off. That was just the beginning of the heroics. After that play right there in the top of the 10th, he blasted a two- run shot that turned out to be the game-winner. So the Reds have now hit a home run in 20 straight games. Cincinnati ended up winning 5-4 for their first series sweep in Washington since 2006. The Mets shut out the Diamondbacks 9-0 last night. It wasn't without drama. Catcher Francisco Alvarez was hit in the wrist by Jose Ruiz's pitch in the seventh inning and Alvarez stared him down before slowing walking to first base. The home plate umpire immediately got in front of him to make sure it didn't escalate, but the benches ended up clearing anyway. Cooler heads would eventually prevail. Both teams slowly went back to their dugouts. But tempers flaring elsewhere on the diamond as well. This is one of the Guardians top prospects in the minors pushing an umpire before taking a swing at a catcher in a minor league game. George Valera ejected after the punch, which triggered a bench-clearing brawl between the Columbus Clippers and the Nashville Sounds. Both players eventually kicked out of the game. The pitcher kicked out of the game as well. So some bad behavior here from everybody in the majors and the minors. And the very bizarre story -- just back to Victor Wembanyama.
