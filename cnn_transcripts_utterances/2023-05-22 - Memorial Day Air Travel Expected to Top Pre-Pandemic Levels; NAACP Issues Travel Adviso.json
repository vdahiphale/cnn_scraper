Just hours from now, he is set to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy again -- they'll meet at the White House -- as time runs out to reach a deal on preventing basically economic calamity. There are less than 10 days to go before the government potentially defaults on its debt. Before he left the G-7 summit with world leaders, Biden told reporters that many of the demands from House Republicans have been, quote, unacceptable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think there are some MAGA Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would do to the economy, and because I am president, and presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame. And that's the one way to make sure Biden is not reelected. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But President Biden as he arrived back here at the White House last night said that his conversation with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy went well. But this meeting here at the White House later this afternoon really offers an opportunity to the two men to try to reset the conversations about how to avert a default after negotiations that played out over the weekend really played out in fits and starts.Now, the president and McCarthy had that phone call yesterday, which led to negotiators, a meeting for a little over two hours, up on Capitol Hill, to try to lay the groundwork heading into this meeting today. But the two sides do still remain incredibly far apart in their approach to a budget agreement. One of the key issues, sources have said, is around the level of spending that they need to agree on. The White House has proposed freezing spending at the current year's levels, while Republicans want to see spending revert back to fiscal year 2022. One of the top negotiators for Republicans, Congressman Garret Graves, said that the numbers are the baseline, if they're able to reach an agreement on that, then everything else will cascade into place. But it still remains unclear whether the two sides can come together on that matter. The president, while in Japan, warns that he believes Republicans have adopted extreme positions and said that in order for an agreement to be bipartisan, Republicans also need to be willing to make some concessions. These are all issues that are likely to be raised during the president's high-stakes sit-down with Kevin McCarthy this afternoon. But really, this meeting comes at an urgent moment. You heard the treasury secretary over the weekend once again reaffirm that she believes that June 1st is a hard deadline for the nation to try to avoid a potential default, which would have catastrophic economic consensuses across the board. Additionally, also in play at this moment is the fact that it takes time to get legislation passed up on Capitol Hill. The House speaker would need to coral his Republican caucus. They would also need to get Democrats onboard with any type of proposal. So what is clear in this moment is that time is very quickly running out, with a default potentially occurring in as little as 10 days. So this really highlights the urgency of the president's meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy this afternoon and really raises the question whether the two of them will be able to come any type of agreement to avert a default.",

And his whole message of personal responsibility versus constant victimhood mentality is a conversation this country needs to have desperately. We need to have it in the Republican Party. We need to have it as a nation.And when you hear Tim Scott speak, and when you see him do retail politics, you can see how he could catch on. I agree that right now, Donald Trump's in a bit of a dominant position if you just look at the polling. But that's the purpose of campaigns. And I think Tim Scott is going to really stand out in this field. And the reality is, if we nominate a Tim Scott, we probably win the presidential campaign by 15 points next year. If we nominate Ron DeSantis, same thing. If we nominate Trump, it's a much dicier proposition for Republicans.

What Tim Scott's campaign will do, though, and what Nikki Haley's campaign will do is a larger conversation we're going to have in this country, a larger conversation we'll have throughout the campaign, particularly Tim's campaign, because it's going to go a long way in helping a lot of disgruntled voters absolve themselves of some type of white guilt. And we're going to have that conversation about race. It's going to be a robust conversation about race. And they're going to say, you black folk, you minorities, go look at Tim, go look at Nikki, you can be them, too. And I think that totally misses the point. We heard about individual responsibility versus victimhood. I think that even Tim Scott will tell you, and Nikki Haley will tell you that in South Carolina, where mothers -- black mothers are three to four times more likely to die during childbirth, the Orangeburg massacre, Charleston massacre. It ain't victimhood. It's actually being who you are and present in this country. And that's going to be a conversation we have. It's not going to be, look at Tim Scott, go be like him.

The saying is that Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer travel, but it is really already gotten off at this early start. Look at the numbers from TSA, 2.65 million people screened at airports nationwide yesterday. That's a 12 percent increase over the same day last year, 2.21 million people on Saturday, 2.66 million people Friday. That is a pandemic era air travel record, broke the record we set back on the Sunday after Thanksgiving when everyone came home all at once. So we've not seen a number that high since back in 2019. Airlines insist that they are right-staffed and right-sized for this huge summer travel season, but the big question now is whether or not the FAA and its air traffic control system can handle this. And we just saw over this weekend on Sunday, there were issues at an air traffic control facility in Denver, which caused the FAA to impose a ground stop for about an hour for flights inbound to Denver. This is a story we've been covering in a big way. In fact, we have new exclusive reporting that really sheds light on the meltdowns of last summer, a little known FAA facility known as Jacksonville Center handles pretty much every commercial flight coming in and out of Florida were short staffed for 200 shifts over a seven-week period, CNN Documents found out and that caused 4,622 delays. This is why the airlines are really warning you to show up two hours before a domestic flight, three hours before an international flight, especially now, it is going to be huge at airports. And we're seeing this problem is not just limited to Florida, not just limited to Denver, even in New York, they're short staffed by about half at a key facility there.",
