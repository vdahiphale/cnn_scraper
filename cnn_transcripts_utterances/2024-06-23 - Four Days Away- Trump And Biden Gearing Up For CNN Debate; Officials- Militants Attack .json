      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thanks for joining me.I'm Alisyn Camerota in for Fredricka Whitfield. Debate week starts today. We are four days away from the CNN presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump. Thursday night's showdown is the first of the 2024 race. It has the potential to shake up a race that has been deadlocked in the polls for months. And the two candidates are preparing for this high-stakes event in very different ways. President Biden hunkering down at Camp David all weekend, reportedly holding intensive prep work and mock debates with a team of advisors. Donald Trump has spent the weekend on the campaign trail speaking to a Christian group in D.C. and holding a rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania where he told reporters he expects his upcoming vice- presidential pick to join him at Thursday's debate. But let's begin with President Biden's debate prep. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins us now. Kevin, how is he getting ready?",

      "sentences": "YES, he is now on day three of debate camp out in western Maryland at Camp David.He does have quite a large group of advisors with him as he prepares for this debate going through policy contrasts with President Trump coming up with zingers, with retorts, with responses. Basically trying to be ready for anything that Trump throws at him there on the debate stage. And it was interesting, we're getting some new insight into the strategy from the Biden campaign in this memo that they released this its morning, heading into this critical week ahead of the debate. They say they're holding more than 1,000 different events leading into this event. They're going to hold more than 100 watch parties on the night of the debate. I think it's interesting if you were to boil down the strategy as laid out in this memo, it's essentially trying to put this contrast on display with President Trump. You know, that is their overarching goal. They really do feel that so many Americans just haven't tuned in to this election yet. This will be the moment for them to realize that they have a choice this November, it's between Biden and Trump. And they do really hope, as they say in this memo to put a magnifying glass on that choice. And just in reading it, you do get a sense of the three top issues that President Biden is going to try and underscore during this event. One is the potential threat from President Trump to democracy. His, you know, threats of political violence really trying to underscore that to the television audience. They're also going to underscore President Trump's economic plans, which they say would benefit the wealthy. And they'll also discuss President Trumps record on abortion, his you know, taking credit for the overturning of Roe versus Wade. And to that point the Biden campaign plans to emphasize tomorrow the anniversary of the Dobbs decision at the Supreme Court that overturned the nationwide right to an abortion. Now, the real question I think for the Biden folks is what candidate Trump shows up on the debate stage. Is it the ferocious Trump that we saw in 2020 who interrupts, who is kind of bombastic in his appearance and his language, or is it a more restraint Trump, a more presidential Trump? And we did hear from a key surrogate for the Biden campaign this morning, Mitch Landrieu, who's the co-chair of the campaign, who is talking about what Trump -- which version of Trump might show up. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH LANDRIEU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: it really doesn't matter how Donald Trump shows up. if he comes in unhinged like he is most of the time, or he sits there and he's quiet, people are going to know that he's a twice-impeached, convicted felon, who has been found to have defamed somebody sexually abused somebody, and going bankrupt six times. They will always know that and that is something that the American people have to think about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think one of your commentators or maybe it was on another network said well, is he going to show up as the ferocious Donald Trump in that second debate -- in the first debate back in 2020? Or is he going to appear presidential? Hey, if he wasn't presidential while he was president how is he going to be presidential after all this water has gone under the Trump bridge?

But that's not true. Everybody evolves and particularly people in positions like theirs. Both have evolved. Biden because he's been president for nearly four years. And Trump because he's been well -- indicted multiple times and convicted on 34 felony counts, among other things. They're different people than they were in 2020 or before. So tuning in will eventually communicate to people that, well, they're -- they're different than I thought. They've learned this or they haven't learned that. And pieces of this debate are going to be aired all the way to the election, but particularly between now June 27th for the debate and September 10th, which is the second debate on ABC. That's a lot of ground to cover. A lot of re-airings of at least pieces of it during the two conventions plus Trump's sentencing right before the conventions. Lots of things are going to happen.

Police say, armed gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on these houses of worship. This happened a short time ago in the city of Derbent. Police say two militants were killed.

You have to remember that this is also the region that the Tsarnaev brothers, of the -- of the Boston Marathon bombings spent some formative years in. So it's a difficult area. It is interesting that the -- that the -- that the actual targets of the attack appear to be a synagogue. There's also some reporting that there might be a Catholic church and a priest involved. So it doesn't sound something like -- something like -- something against the Russian state.

Again, as they're just aggravated with so much rain. Some spots got up to 10 to 15 inches of rain just in the last three days. And you could see that pocket there in northwest Iowa, just south of Sioux Falls, north of Sioux City. But look how widespread some of these four-to-six-inch totals were.

So just incredible rain that just came down in such a short amount of time, which is why these rivers are still at major and moderate flood stage.

We heard from Gallant in a statement on Sunday, he said that the U.S. is a very important ally. He was highlighting the importance of that relationship, saying it is very important, maybe more so now than ever. So, he certainly trying to if not repair damage, show that he fully appreciates how important that ally is for Israel. He was also saying that he's going to talk to U.S. officials, obviously, about what's happening in Gaza, what is happening potentially on the northern front with Hezbollah and Lebanon, and said that he will talk about this phase C transition. Now, we've asked the IDF for more details about what this phase C is, but he said it may enable them to be able to make moves elsewhere.

There's no theory or motive that authorities have disclosed just yet, at least publicly. Last night, Arkansas authorities revealed that a fourth victim in the shooting has died among the four people killed is Shirley Taylor. She would have turned 63 on July 1st. Her daughter, Angela Atchley, actually confirmed her identity to CNN and said that her mother who loved her, her family and children was the hardest working woman. She knew and a great person, adding that her family is now completely lost. The Arkansas Department of Public Safety also publish the names of the other three people who died.

But authorities say that this all happened back on May 19. They were called to a pool at an apartment complex in Euless, Texas, and they say they were called about a disturbance, a woman who was intoxicated and an attempted drowning.So when authorities got to the pool, they arrested 42-year-old Elizabeth Wolf for public intoxication. And so after all of this happened, they say that they were able to investigate further and talk to the mother of the victim. And this mother told police that Wolf had asked her where she was from, had asked her if these were her children in the pool and that once she answered, that, yes, these were her children. She grabbed her six-year-old son. Take a listen to how the executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the council described what happened next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Her bail for that was set at $25,000 and then she was also charged with injury to a child and bail for that was $15,000. Now, she posted bail, which is why the council is now asking for higher bails. They're asking for this to be investigated as a hate crime. And they're asking for the safety and just in general protection of the Muslim community. And that's why they're so concerned and its part of the reason why they're coming out and speaking out and saying that this was racially motivated and feeling like they absolutely need authorities to do more about this because they believe that this all happened because his family was Muslim and they say from Palestine, Elizabeth.",
