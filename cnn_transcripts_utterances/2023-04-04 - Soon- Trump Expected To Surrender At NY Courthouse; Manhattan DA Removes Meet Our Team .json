This is the scene of the Manhattan criminal courts complex where Mr. Trump will surrender we're told, and then where prosecutors will drop an indictment, spelling out multiple charges against him at this very moment.We still do not know exactly what those charges are, and how many there are connected to Mr. Trump's alleged scheme to buy the silence of adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels at a pivotal 2016 campaign moment. As we come on air, we are told that the former president remains inside Trump Tower in Manhattan. We're told that he will soon leave his namesake New York high rise for a trek to the 15th floor courtroom, a journey that required days of negotiation and planning with officials. Every single police officer in New York City, some 35,000 has been told to be ready for well, for anything. Our reporting team will be inside the courtroom to bring you all the information about the arraignment. We'll see photographs of the former president in court but the actual court proceedings will not be on camera. CNN's team of reporters is embedded at every step of this unprecedented moment in U.S. history. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is outside court right now. And Kaitlan, you're getting word that Mr. Trump plans to speak briefly before going into the building.",

That is what he is expected to do just shortly and he's wanting to talk publicly about this.He has not done so yet. But he will soon. And one thing that his own team is worried about is what he will say because they are hoping he does not come before cameras before he enters that courtroom and says something that could further inflame the situation, or potentially hurt his case, which as of right now, even though they have yet to see the indictment either Jake, they do believe is one that will ultimately benefit them and fall in their favor in the end. Of course, that is far from certain at this point. And at this stage of where we are at as he is about to turn himself into the authorities. But Trump has been wanting to speak publicly. He did not want to wait until he returned to Mar-a-Lago tonight where he is still scheduled to give an address or on 8:15pm in front of surrogates and supporters. He wanted to talk about it here in New York. Initially, they had planned for maybe him to deliver a speech outside of the courthouse after he left. Now he's expected to do so when there is a camera outside of the courtroom before he goes before the judge. And he has been trashing, of course, the district attorney that he has also been criticizing. So his own team isn't quite sure what he's going to say. They're hoping that he will stick to their talking points about how they believe this is a political prosecution, Jake.

So there may be some consideration about whether he should be permitted to speak about it before the judge is speaks about it to him.ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: And Anderson, to me, the biggest moment of today will be when we see that indictment, that will be our first meaningful, substantive look at the prosecution's case here. And there's a couple of things I'm looking for. First of all, how much detail do they put in the indictment? As Karen knows, prosecutors have completely waived. Indictments are written by prosecutors, some indictments are very bare bones could be that's - if it's 34 accounts, there's a chance this could be 12 pages. However, sometimes, especially in high profile occasions, prosecutors put much more detail in there. So that's number one. And the second big question is, What are the charges, dividing into sort of two lanes here? Is it all based on the Stormy Daniels hush money payments? Or is there something else?

We expect that to be expedited. And then he'll go into the courtroom, enter his not guilty plea and then exit. But one other thing that we've noticed today is that on the Manhattan District Attorney's website, they have a section that says meet your team where it identifies the top prosecutors in the office. That appears to be taken down. It says the page is not working. And you know, this comes as the former president has called for protests. We've seen some flags here.

He has said it's almost a campaign slogan at this point. They are trying to get to you and I am standing in their way. That's - that's what he tells his supporters at rallies.
