And so this is a bedfellow for him. This is someone in his camp. And so he knows exactly who this -- who this person is. He knows that the message that he sent to these groups, which is also something that really bothers me from a national security perspective, is the fact that by meeting with him, he's legitimizing. He's legitimizing people like Nick Fuentes. He's legitimizing everything that they stand for, including a meeting with Kanye West, who's been, you know -- has espoused anti-Semitism before.

I mean, bottom line is you want someone who's going to go down and secure the border, deal with our energy independence, a deal with obviously what's happening overseas. You don't want to have somebody who is not doing what, respectfully, Senator Warnock is doing which is basically rubberstamping everything that President Biden's doing and it's not going in the right direction. So to have that balance, have Kamala come down. Every time there's a vote is part of the process. Republicans have the House and I'm presuming that McCarthy will finally do his job and put bills in front of President Biden to deal with energy independence and deal with the border, instead of just focusing on the Biden laptop and encourage people and tell people why we put them in charge of the House and move forward and actually come up with solutions because this country is hurting right now.

So we are really excited to get all of the data that's going to be generated by this event and to inform our understanding of how volcanoes work.But also really exciting for us is right now this eruption is very low risk to anybody because it's not in areas that are populated. So we're looking at really oozy runny lava flows and not very high likelihood of anything explosive. Hawaiian volcanoes usually erupt in a more oozy runny fashion, so the major hazards are volcanic smog, fog, which can cause respiratory issues in local folks, and minor, minor ashfall.

So, you know, somewhere in the mid-20s and kilometers per hour.And they can get faster, but that's usually when the flow hits a channel. So if you imagine like a drainage system for water, it's the same sort of thing. If you channelize a liquid or something moving like a liquid like lava, it'll go faster. But that's not common. We've seen it with Hawaiian eruptions, including Kilauea just a few years ago. But really, the biggest threat is to property, things that we can't move.
