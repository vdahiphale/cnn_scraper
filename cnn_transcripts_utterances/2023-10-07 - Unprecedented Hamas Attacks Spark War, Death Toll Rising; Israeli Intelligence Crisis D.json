It is now 4 a.m. in Gaza, where Israel is striking back at Hamas targets after these attacks we saw play out over the last 24 hours. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at war. The militant group launched an unprecedented early-morning attack, series of attacks on Israel, firing at least 5,000 rockets.Israel says at least 300 Israelis are dead, more than 1,500 wounded. This was not just rocket attacks, though. The terror group overran border crossings, invaded by sea, by air and by land, taking over entire Israeli communities in the south, taking hostages as well. We must warn you, many of these images are graphic and frightening. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) Video obtained by CNN shows what appear to be dead civilians, gunned down in their cars and outside their cars, on a road near the border with Gaza. Hamas is claiming to have taken Israeli soldiers and civilians hostage. You see a video of one there, a woman forced into a car at gunpoint in Gaza, frightened, as you'd expect her to be. As we mentioned, Israel is now retaliating with airstrikes on Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 232 people have been killed there. (END VIDEO TAPE) The Israeli Prime Minister is vowing to find Hamas militants wherever they are hiding in Gaza. He is warning the people of Gaza to leave places known to be Hamas strongholds now, in advance of further Israeli military strikes. He also says Hamas is responsible now for the well-being of captives it has taken, and that Israel will settle the score, as he says, with anyone who harms those hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israel Defense Forces say they are prisoners of war, and this soldier was captured alive after his tank was destroyed at the Gaza border.His fate is now unknown. The Al-Qassim Brigade released a heavily edited propaganda video that purports to show militants overrunning Israel's Erez crossing, the most heavily fortified location on the Gaza fence. The video shows dead Israelis and prisoners. Their fate is also unknown. These scenes are intended to galvanize widespread attacks against Israel. Amid this, Hamas called to arms. If you have a gun, get it out, he said. This is the time to use it. Get out with trucks, cars, axes. Today is the most glorious and a most honorable history begins. So far, that call has not been answered. But the Hamas operation involved unprecedented firefights inside Israeli territory, in which civilian cars were targeted in Sderot. And civilians gunned down on roads, where what are reported to be militants were also killed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel represents the gold standard, not only in terms of border defense, but also in terms of intelligence. And we cannot, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the last few months before today's unprecedented attacks by Hamas were unprecedented for the state of Israel. Massive demonstrations, unprecedented instability among and social uprisings inside Israel, including large numbers of defense forces themselves, many of whom said that they would not take up their arms if the judicial reforms went through.

I also think that the pending Saudi-Israel breakthrough deal, which was becoming close, not quite imminent, but close, certainly within a matter of months, and both sides were quite positive about it, that would have been a very serious stroke against Hamas.It would have really isolated them. And we have to remember that over the past 20 years, the Palestinian-Israel issue has become marginalized in the broader Middle East. Israel was in a much stronger geopolitical position. They were engaging diplomatically directly with breakthroughs with the UAE, with Morocco, with Bahrain. And meanwhile, Hamas was, they were still acting as if nothing had changed. They were still calling for the destruction of Israel. They were still, you know, making it seem as if the world was going to turn on the basis of Palestinian rights. That just wasn't the case. And so clearly, they felt that the time was running out for their message, for their extremist ideology, and that clearly has to have also played into their decision-making, which is suicidal for the leadership, let's be clear.

Having said that, let's watch Hezbollah and Lebanon very clearly. If this was Iranian involvement, I would expect that Hezbollah would be actively on the side of Hamas and joining in some of these attacks going forward.So far, we haven't yet seen that. The Iranian statements have been incredibly incendiary, actively supporting this terrorism on social media. We saw that from the supreme leader just a few hours ago.

I think airstrikes will be inadequate for that purpose. I think that they will need to not only remove Hamas leadership, but they will need to disarm Hamas militants. They'll need to ensure that those cells no longer operate. I don't think this is a matter of weeks. I think this will go on for months, if not longer. It is going to be incredibly bloody.

Today, we had several rounds of air raid sirens, but still, rockets continue to be fired into southern Israel.We know of a direct hit on a hospital in Ashkelon just in the last hour or so, and we have also heard from Benjamin Netanyahu, who says that right now, they are embarking on what he calls a long and difficult war. He says that the first phase is going to be ending now, these hours, with the destruction of what he called the majority of the enemy forces that penetrated the territory, because as you noted, there are still ongoing gun battles in some of these towns and villages in southern Israel with militants who are still there. We're now approaching almost 24 hours of this conflict. What's also been interesting in what he says is he says, among the decisions made by the cabinet are the stopping of the supply of electricity, fuel, and goods to the Gaza Strip, because Israel controls, of course, most of the electricity that's provided to Gaza. They have decided to cut that off. What does that mean for the fighters there? Of course, that can affect the militants, the Hamas organization, how they operate, but also for the civilians there. That obviously affects the civilians and how they will be able to endure what is coming. We also know the Israeli military has given directives to civilians in Gaza, telling them to move away from certain areas. That's an indication that Israel plans to strike certain areas quite heavily. We have already seen the destruction of several high-rise towers in Gaza, and what we know that the Israeli military tends to do with these sort of airstrikes, they drop these sort of knocker bombs, or they even call residents of these buildings ahead of time, telling them to get out of these buildings before they destroy them. But Jim, this is going to be a very complicated situation, because as we've noted, there are likely dozens of prisoners of war, hostages, who have been taken by Hamas. Many of these are likely to be Israeli civilians, and as we've noted, Hamas has claimed that they've taken them to strategic places throughout the Gaza Strip.

Note that this would be the level at which their most rudimentary rockets would hit, about six miles or so. Then you reach out to maybe 25 miles, and their most advanced rockets, the ones that would most seem to rely probably on some technology beyond them, Iran, as many intelligence people would say, would reach up here to Tel Aviv. That's about 45 miles from here. Whatever the placement of them was, though, there were an awful lot of them.We don't have an exact count, but it appears to be in the thousands. That would matter because that would make it easier to overwhelm Israel's missile defense system, the Iron Dome system, and make sure that some got through, even if many were stopped. More importantly, by doing this, all indications are that laid the groundwork for what came next. At 7.40, an hour and 10 minutes later, that's when armed soldiers, fighters, started coming out of Gaza into Israel, some by knocking down walls and barriers here, some coming in by air with powered parachutes, some by boats going around here. This was something, again, that indicated it was a very planned attack, and soon you saw people with rocket launchers and rifles running in the streets. They even went and engaged military bases where you would think they would expect the most opposition, gives an idea of their degree of planning and competence as they went in to attack the Israelis. And of course, we've seen those videos of the towns that had been raided near that area where we've had reports of people being taken hostage and other people being killed. All of it speaks to this very notion we've been hearing about from the beginning, that this represents a level of planning and execution that is far deeper than what has typically been seen before. SCIUTTO; No question about that. Thanks so much to our Tom Foreman joining me now, former CIA operative, Bob Baer. Bob, good to have you on tonight.",

Crossing borders by paragliders, keeping secrecy till the very last minute. And there's a close coordination between Hezbollah and Hamas. How that exactly worked in this case, I don't know, but I would imagine that a lot had to do with it. But more than anything, it's Hamas, it's communications discipline. If they're using push-to-talk radios, they weren't on them. If they were using apps, they weren't on those. They just completely went radio silence before this attack.And they've gotten better over the years because they know that the Israelis listen to all their phone calls, all of them. I've been in the Israeli listening sites and the exchanges on the border. And every single call they listen into, the Palestinians know that and accounted for that. And their fighting forces are just getting better over the years. But more than anything is Israel lacks sources inside the military command of Hamas. And that is a great failure. I know they try to get them, but they can't do it. Look at it -- Gaza is like a prison with, you know, Israelis can't get in and they can't recruit people. And the military command doesn't leave. It's a very, very hard target. And that's why they got away with this attack.",
