It's the final sprint of the presidential campaign and it's still anybody's race. Yesterday Donald, Trump offered Wisconsin voters a -- quote -- \"dark vision\" of the future, warning, in apocalyptic terms, about what his loss would mean and making the rather absurd claim that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is mentally disabled, after Vice President Harris gave a tough speech at the southern border in a remarkable policy and focus turnaround by the Democratic nominee. But, this week, outside events overshadowed the presidential campaign. The Southeastern United States is still struggling from the -- quote -- \"biblical devastation\" wrought by Hurricane Helene, with dozens killed in six states and many lives still at risk because of rising floodwaters in North Carolina, and profoundly destabilizing news from the Middle East, where the Lebanese have just recovered the body of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which the U.S. government considers a terrorist group, who was killed by an Israeli strike on Friday. President Biden said the killing gave Nasrallah's victims and their families a -- quote -- \"measure of justice.\" But as Israel struck more Hezbollah targets overnight, President Biden also called for a cease- fire in the region, as U.S. officials watch carefully for Iran's threatened retaliation for Nasrallah's death and the possibility that Israel could move ground forces into Lebanon. Joining me now to discuss, White House national security communications adviser Admiral John Kirby. Admiral, thanks for joining us. So, first of all, is President Biden glad that Israel took this action?",

How bad is the devastation there, and is South Carolina getting everything from the federal government that it needs? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  We had a conference call yesterday. I appreciate what the federal government is doing. I think maybe DOD may weigh in a little bit more. Massive record- breaking, whatever adjective you can think of, 23 people dead.

The Radwan elite brigade of Hezbollah, they need to be pushed back across that river. It's not going to be 2006, but how do you hold it? When you stop military operations in Gaza, who takes over? Without a normalization deal, the Arabs don't come in to reform the West Bank and take over Gaza.

That is quite a reversal from her position in 2019, when she was running for president, when she supported decriminalizing illegal border crossings entirely.

Forty years, we have tried to get some comprehensive immigration reform. It needs to be bipartisan because we haven't had a Senate that's had more than 60 members, which is the filibuster limit of either party. And the result is that we have had no bipartisan effort on immigration. We finally, under Joe Biden, got Senator Lankford and a total of 75 senators behind a border security bill.

That is a problem, because the president does not have the power to shut down the border. That could have been something in the border security bill that became law, but a president doesn't have that. So you can only do it with a combination of policies and working with those countries. That is not an easy thing to do. You can't just overnight announce that you're going to do it. You have got to actually get those countries to agree.

We call it an opportunity economy because, once again, we're trying to help people, everyday Americans, working families who just need a little hand up, a little help to get by. And the Trump administration while they were in office did absolutely nothing except give a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz plan to put dollars into the pockets of everyday folks, people who are hardworking Americans, and to help the most vulnerable. I think the policies that they have put forward -- and, again, she's only been the candidate for, well, frankly, four or five weeks since the Democratic Convention, but if you take it all the way, maybe 10 weeks total since the beginning.

Vance needs to be on his game.He is -- the reason he was selected was to be the MAGA heir apparent. He was the one who was going to continue on the MAGA. So, of course, he's combative, he's aggressive. That's the style. He is reflective of the top of the ticket. And I think that's true for both of these. You see that Tim Walz is a little more soft-spoken, and you see that J.D. Vance -- but the big thing here is going to be the policy conversation, because there is still a large set of voters who want more from Kamala Harris. They aren't hearing it. Can Walz be able to deliver that?",

By now, almost everyone who could be persuaded by the case against him has heard it. Second, trade the massive rallies for a series of smaller town-hall style events in battleground states. Third, she should launch the party's first large- scale paid social media influencer campaign. \"And, finally Ms. Harris needs to do more interviews. I rarely agree with Republicans, but this is essential to close voters' knowledge gap about her.\" That's actually not the final op-ed. (CROSSTALK)",

One, let me just start by saying I just humblyoffer these suggestions. She's been doing really a remarkable job. I mean, it's unprecedented the impact that she's had in such a short period of time, $500-plus million. She's closed the gap with Trump in six weeks and in some polls is outpacing him. But here's the thing I think the question that the vice president has to answer, which is, why? Why her? Why now? Why is she the leader for this moment? And I'd like to hear her do it without even mentioning Donald Trump. The reason why I suggest to not mention him, he's like a fire. How do you put out a fire? You suffocate it. Don't give it any oxygen. The second point is, she needs to be put into more intimate settings. I was in those rooms with her in the White House.",
