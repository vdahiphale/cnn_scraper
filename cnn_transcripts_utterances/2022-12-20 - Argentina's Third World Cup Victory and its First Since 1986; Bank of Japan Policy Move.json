      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", fantastic to have you with us. We begin today's show with a jolt fromJapan, the Japanese Central Bank surprising investors by loosening the tight hold, it keeps. On longer term borrowing costs, allowing them to raise a touch now it was a tweak. And I emphasize that but the broader belief is that it could single a decision to start reducing base rates, which of course have been negative for years. Especially, of course as other Central Banks around the world continue to hike interest rates and the policy gap between them and Japan continues to widen. The big question, of course is, is the era of cheap money in Japan finally over not according to the Bank of Japan at Chief today. It is significant though. The Chief Kuroda is stepping down in the spring. And again this is the talk today is that today's move could allow the new Bank of Japan had to come in with a clean slate and performs some kind of policy pivot early on next year. For now, though the Yen is surging against major currencies currently up more than 3.5 percent as you can see, there just under now against the U.S. dollar. Context of course, is key; the Yen is rising from ultra-low levels, and is still down some 16 percent against the U.S. dollar this year. Now as you would expect with moves like this in the currency. Japanese stocks also under pressure, the NIKKEI tumbling some 2 percent as you can see around 2.5 percent. They're banking, one of the few sectors actually moving higher in Tokyo though. Rising yields will ultimately help their profitability. Global bond yields including the U.S. dollar moving higher as well that the impact on U.S. and European equity markets far less severe. U.S. futures a bit softer, Europe pulling back during the session too, but this has been an extremely challenging month for global equities bucking the usual holiday trend. The S&amp;P 500 in particular has fallen for four straight days losing more than 6 percent so far this month lots of sad centers perhaps in roaming around trading floors except perhaps in Buenos Aires where nothing will stem. The joy today is the World Cup winning footy team, the white and blue sky is given a hero's welcome in just under an hour. A victory parade will begin in the Argentine Capitol tens of thousands. Wow! I mean it looks like more than that and fans have been gathering through the night after the squad arrived in the early hours of the morning too. What could only be called a rock star reception? We just hope the team has been able to get some sleep. They have if this post by Lionel Messi is anything to go by. Take a look at that he's even sleeping with that World Cup trophy. Stefano Pozzebon is in Buenos Aires where the excitement is reaching fever pitch. No pun intended. Stefano, I'm sure you could barely even hear me with the noise that we can hear behind.

Let's move on for now and the crypto court chaos isn't over for Sam Bankman-Fried just yet. The Former FTX, CEO is expected back in court in the Bahamas today at a hearing on Monday. We're told that Bankman-Fried agreed to be extradited to the United States, but proceedings did descend into confusion as prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's Bahamian lawyer argued in court. CNN's Patrick Oppmann joins us now from the Bahamas. What on earth happened yesterday, Patrick, because I do believe we were thinking it would all be signed and sealed and the extradition process would crack on and today we've got another court hearing and no real clarity I think on when actually his journey to the United States will take place? What happened and what can you tell us?",

They have no information to give us at this point, though. We don't see a heavy Police presence like we saw yesterday when they brought in as SPF as he's known Sam Bankman-Fried. So we're all waiting to see what's happening. There is a huge disconnect, obviously between his U.S. legal team, which is running the show, but there's Bahamian legal team, which is the only attorneys that have any say when it comes to the Bahamas. So there is obviously been some egos bruised. There is a tremendous amount of pressure from the U.S. government on the Bahamian government to get this done as soon as possible. But his Bahamian attorney yesterday, dug in and said that until he's ready to lease. He had the opportunity to advise his client leasing all the paper that he needs to see. He's not going to permit this extradition to go forward. Yesterday afternoon, there seemed to be some relenting from his Bahamian defense team saying that, yes, having talked to Sam Bankman-Fried that he had agreed to be extradited. So you would think that there would be some movement at the courthouse or where the hearing would take place that would allow his extradition to move forward. That could happen as soon as today we were told late last night, but at this point, there's just very little movement here. Obviously, a lot of pieces still being worked on behind the scene, but it really are surprisingly chaotic. And of course, for the many, many people who invested in FES who lost their life savings, lost money that they need for car payments or rent, you know, those people want answers. They want to know where their money is, and we are no closer to those answers as of right now.",

What they got, though, was a pretty sizable wakeup call that could reverberate through global markets for years and pave the way for the First Bank of Japan rate hike in well over a decade. Paul La Monica joins us now. Steady on, I think with that first rate hike in over a decade. I think you have to explain what's going on because traditionally the Bank of Japan have kept an incredibly tight control over where borrowing costs particularly longer term borrowing costs have held. They ease that slightly but they also announced more bonds buying too so easing one thing trying to control something else. They have a job, Paul.",

And it's had a material impact on the relative strength of the Yen. I mean, they're still down what 16 percent relative to the U.S. dollar, the Japanese currency, Yen.

And many people here have been caught off guard by thissudden shift from harsh lockdowns over a few COVID cases to now letting the virus rapidly spread in the major City of Shenzhen, which was under mass COVID locked down last month. Well that city is now telling people that even if they have COVID and are sick, as long as they're only mildly sick. Well, they can go back to work as normal. This is a dramatic unexpected U- turn that health experts say the health system is not prepared for after three years of harsh lockdowns and mass testing. And we're already seeing hospitals under strain in major cities. Hospitals have said they're dealing with outbreaks amongst staff. Long lines like these are forming outside of hospitals in big cities like these videos from Hangzhou and Wuhan. Now China has only announced a few COVID deaths since reopening, but what we see on the ground points to a different story. I went to a major crematorium in Beijing and you can see the long lines of cars waiting to get to that cremation area. The parking lot was full as well and several people there told me their loved ones had died from COVID and it employee said they're swamped with dead bodies. The stores nearby selling funerary items said they're much busier than normal. Now a new study from Hong Kong researchers says that China's set an exit from zero COVID policy could lead to nearly 1 million deaths. But the report does say that 1 million people dying of COVID in China is a worst case scenario if China doesn't take extra precautions. It says that China can successfully boost the vaccination rate, use antiviral treatments and take other public health measures. It could reduce the deaths by hundreds of thousands. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the toll of COVID-19 in China is of concern to the rest of the world given the size of China's GDP and its economy. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.",

The European Union has decided to impose a cap if the priceof gas one month in the future exceeds around $190 per megawatt hour for three consecutive working days. Prices must also be at least $37 higher than the global prices for LNG or better known as Liquefied Natural Gas. And once triggered, it will remain active for at least 20 days Moscow calling the deal unacceptable. Clare Sebastian joins us now. Wow, Clare, our poor viewers today between the moves in Japan and now our gas price caps for the EU. Just talk us through the details of this.

Over the summer, I think this cap at thislevel, which is much lower than EU members had previously be considering would have been triggered the way it works. They're calling it a market correction mechanism. So if the prices go over the 180 Euro, $190 per megawatt hour level and the month ahead futures market, then the cap is triggered. So essentially, transactions over that level will not be allowed. This is really the first time that we've seen a mechanism like this even be attempted, though, as you say it's not going to come into force until February 15. But in the meantime, regulators in Europe have to start to study the impact of this because this is extremely controversial. There are major questions around what the impact of this could be? What could it do to market stability Goldman Sachs out in a note this week, Julia? Just that it wouldn't even have to be triggered for it to have an impact. Take a look at this. They say even if trigger conditions are not met, market tightening events that lift prices anywhere near the proposed cap are likely to cause preemptive action by market participants, potentially leading to all of the negative cap effects. Then suggesting, for example, that traders could liquidate short positions or even stopped selling all together this could really affect the market and there are also concerns around supply will descend suppliers elsewhere where they can get a price higher than the cap. This is something that Germany has been concerned about all along, and will capping the price actually incentivize demand at a time when you're supposed to be doing the opposite. Clearly, it was a big achievement to get a political agreement on this after months of talks. But there are concerns that it does not fix the core issues at stake in the European energy crisis, which is that as of the spring.

There is a deal at the EU level, it will enter into force in mid-February. It is obviously, much higher than the prices are now. But why are the prices now lower than they were a few months ago? I think that this is not something coming from; I don't know where it is coming also from the decisions that are taken until now. First on storage, we have an extraordinarily high level of storage now in Europe and second on savings. So I think that this measure is a proportionate measure. It is not a silver bullet.

I think for most people, and obviously all the Americans, for the most part are on boardwith the artificial tree is that they are far more expensive, at least upfront than an ordinary tree. What's the appeal and what keeps people coming back? MAC HARMAN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, BALSAM HILL: Well, good morning, I think really what brings people artificial trees. For most people, it's just the convenience, I grew up with real trees, I love the scent and the experience of a real tree, but it's kind of got a lot of work to it, you've got to bring it in, cut the trunk off, it's got sap the needles fall off, you need to water it. And then you have to string the lights on yourself with an artificial tree of that stone for you. The lights are pre lit on the tree are Balsam Hill trees, we very carefully do that tedious work of wiring the lights on, and then you don't have that maintenance. The other thing that's really driving it is that at least in the U.S. and it's different internationally, but in America, we like to put our trees up early, maybe Thanksgiving weekend or even before and take them down after New Year's. And a fresh grown tree really should only stay in your house for about four weeks before it can dry out and become a fire hazard. And so that trend of decorating for longer has led into artificial trees in the North American market.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that actually that makes sense. It's the length of time isn't it in particular? I have to be in full disclosure, I'm 10 years and Ibought one of your trees 10 years in. I took custody of it once in a breakup and it's still going 10 years later, which is great for me. And it's a pre-lit one, less bad for you. How long do you expect them to live for and don't you want people to be sort of buying them, perhaps more often than once every 10 years, I'm still going.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, it's funny. This is our 17th season at Balsam Hill. And so we still have lots of trees from our very first season 17 years agothat are out in circulation. And it is a concern for us about you knows how long they last; we expect them to last 20 plus years. What we're seeing, though, is that more and more people are decorated with multiple trees. And so it's interesting because I actually started this business as a side project I didn't intend to be here 17 years later. I would have thought, jeez, this is you know these, how many people more than one tree and they need last such a long time. But we do see people come back and buying new trees, but it's often adding a tree having a second one having one in their foyer. So it's still been a good market for us. And we'll do our best to keep the growth going.",

      "sentences": "I've seen, I also read as well when I was researching for this that the carbon footprint, apparently of a plastic tree is around 10 timesgreater than that of a real tree. And you can correct me if I'm wrong. But once you've gone beyond the 10 year point, then I think on that point, you're winning as well. Where are the growth opportunities for you? Is it internationally given? As we said Americans are clearly on board and if people are buying more than one tree that helps too but what about internationally? Because it's tougher to get one internationally though, I admit I have done that too.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think for Balsam Hill, international markets have been a great source of growth for us over the last five years. We have locallanguage websites in France and Germany in the UK and Australia. And those have all been really strong markets up until this year. So that's where we've seen more aggressive growth. But we're still growing well in North America. And some of that I think is growing share away from other retailers. We're kind of the main specialty player for artificial trees. But I do think this trend; it's not so much people giving up real trees. It's people celebrating Christmas with more trees. And actually we're also seeing I think 6 percent of U.S. households now have both artificial and farm grown trees in their home. And so people are putting up that artificial tree to kind of have the holiday cheer longer and then they're bringing in the real tree maybe in their family room or something like that. And to put it up for a shorter period of time but people are right now decorating with more trees more reads more Garland's and that's been a good trend for Balsam Hill.",

I can't even tell you even guesstimate how many people there have already lined the street and that avenue there to celebrate their returning players. If we can get a close up on the Boston you'll see it in a second, there are five players I think Messi is sitting in the middle. One of those next to him is actually holding the World Cup Trophy, but you need really good eyesight to see that right now. Let's return to Stefano Pozzebon who's in the Argentine capital for us. We said it was going to be tough to get through those crowds. This is going to be a slow parade; I can see people surging now towards the bus. Wow.",
