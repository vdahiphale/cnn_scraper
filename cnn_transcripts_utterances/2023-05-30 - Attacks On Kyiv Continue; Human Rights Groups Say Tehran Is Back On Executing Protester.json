Now, the Ukrainians are denying that they had any, and I quote the presidential adviser saying, direct responsibility for this, leaving opportunities for them in the future, perhaps to claim indirect responsibility. Nobody in Moscow killed by these attacks, but immediately, both the defense minister and then Vladimir Putin himself saying that these were provocative in the words of Shoigu, the defense minister, acts of terror, Vladimir Putin said that he feared that there could be -- this was a provocation from Ukraine intended to create some kind of escalation and counterattack, which is an extraordinary statement given the daily attack against Ukraine from the air by Russia against civilian targets. And also, we have to bear in mind that this is an advance, Zain, of an anticipated ground offensive on scale by the Ukrainians and should be seen, I think, if they were indeed behind these drone attacks inside Russia. We've seen them backing a cross-border raid by Russian dissidents, part of the Ukrainian army attacking territory inside Russia. And we've seen increasing attacks by Ukraine behind Russian lines inside Ukrainian territory against towns like Mariupol and Berdyansk, particularly the logistics hubs there that support the Russian war effort here in Ukraine. So, in all of that context, this escalation using drones in Moscow will inevitably be seen in Moscow at the very least as part of the shaping operations intended to destabilize and rattle the Russian leadership ahead of a summer campaign by the Ukrainians.",

The first one is that Lula wantsto send a big message, not just to the rest of South America, but to the rest of the world, that he is back in the international stage. When he used to be the president of Brazil between 2002 and 2010, he was the de facto leader of South America. He -- many countries -- he knew that he could speak on behalf of many of his regional neighbors. And this meeting is in a sense, it's a way to restart that process. Brazil is by far the largest economy, the largest country in South America. It's natural that Brazil seeks a leadership role and Lula is trying to show the sign that he's back. But it's also another leader who is back and it's the Venezuelan authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, who is participating for the first time to a regional summit since 2019, since the big constitutional crisis of 2019 and the cycle of deadly protests in Caracas and the rest of the country. And Lula not only invited Maduro as a sign of pragmatism, but he really had some words that raised some scrutiny around the rest of the region, but of course we're very pleasant to hear for Maduro. Take a listen to what Lula said yesterday as he welcomed Maduro to Brasilia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZIIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is unexplainable to have a country with 900 sanctions because another country doesn't like it. It is unexplainable. I think it is in our hands to build your narrative and to change the game so we can definitively win and so Venezuela can go back to being a sovereign country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here -- some data, justaccording to the International Criminal Court, which is investigating the government of Nicolas Maduro. They received views from over 8,900 victims, 630 families, two human rights organizations. Maduro himself is being questioned for his human rights record, according to the United Nations as of January this year, over 7 million Venezuelans are in deep need of humanitarian assistance inside the country. And about the same amount of people, a similar figure is that of Venezuelans who fled the country since much before, much earlier than the sanctions were imposed. So, seeing Lula laying down, literally laying down the red carpet for Nicolas Maduro and welcoming him, not just to the summit but on a state visit to Brasilia, has drawn a lot of questions in the region, and also draws questions around the world that because Lula is seeking to present himself as a neutral, wise leader on the world stage and that these type of comments maybe don't help.
