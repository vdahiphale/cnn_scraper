There just 41 days until voters head to the polls and new CNN polling shows the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is a dead heat. CNN's latest poll of likely voters showing Harris at 48 percent, Trump at 47, this very slight lead for Harris, of course, within the m margin of error. And we have this just in to CNN this morning, new data showing Harris is pulling ahead of Trump with younger voters. The same CNN poll has Harris leading by 12 points among likely voters under the age of 35, 52 percent to 40 percent. But even with that double-digit lead among younger voters, it's still closer than it was four years ago. Exit polls from 2020 show the Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 21 points with that same age group. In the meantime, Trump has an edge over Harris when likely -- with likely -- when likely voters were asked who they trust more to handle on the economy, Trump polling at 50 percent with Harris at 39 percent. Trump campaigning in the battleground state of Georgia yesterday, offered this grave warning to voters about the future of manufacturing jobs should Harris win in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Lets start with these new numbers just in to CNN on younger voters because this is a place where she clearly has made a big difference from where Joe Biden '24 was, right? He was not doing as well this time around, but it's not quite rare he was back in 2020. What does she need to do to continue to appeal to these voters?",

This is part of why we've been hearing Donald Trump talk a lot about the tariffs he wants to put into place. We're also trying to understand where she would differ from President Biden on some of these things. There are some policies where are she has made a clear distinction between herself and the sitting president, but they seem to be smaller, specific issues as opposed to difference in broader philosophy.

You saw her over the weekend reach out to crypto and AI industries, but also say, look, I'm still here for the working people and more, and more moderate economic approach, which is the kind of thing that, that appeals to voters. You, when you polling, for example, on tariffs, which is really the centerpiece of Trump's economic vision, does not poll particularly well.

We can put that up. You can see that Harris sits at 79 percent of Black voters, Donald Trump has 16 percent of Black voters.Now, noteworthy because that is a little bit more than Republicans traditionally get. But I will well, so say my Republican sources look at the number and if they think about it in terms of over-under 20 percent, right? If Trump is at 20 percent or more with Black voters than that is significant, significant problem for the Democrat. He's under it there. It's at 16 percent. Still. It shows you that there's some work to do and if we were to dig into those, I'm not sure the slide, but obviously Black men in particular, we know that Harris does much better with women, but Trump does better with men. What do you make of that number? And how the campaign can going to look at it?",

That would be historically, very high in the past. Its been, you know, maybe around five to 10 percent of what Republicans have been able to capture of the Black vote.But you see in the campaign ads that they're putting out, no, they're really trying to appeal to men, specifically Black men. You know, a lot of the messaging is about pizza and video games. And some of the ads coming out from the super PAC is clearly targeted at young men to try to get them out for Donald Trump.",

So those ground troops, no matter how many go in, if they go in, they just change the -- you know, what's happening here, how it's seen, and it ramps up the tension massively. And both sides will be seemed to respond or will feel the need to respond as they would in a war situation as opposed to what we've got currently, which looks like a war, but its being described as a conflict and ongoing conflict, which is escalating all the time. And as Israel is described, there will be, you know, there'll be amping it up every day. We will have to wait to see whether or not ground troops getting bold.

The messages that come out from there do resonate and people have differing views on how Israel is handling this.So when he does go to the United Nations and it takes it seriously enough to do that. Then it's all about getting support for his effort to battle both Hezbollah and Hamas. So it's important to get that support and most notably course for the United States, because neither of these wars would be able to take place without support from the U.S. and whilst its supported Israel's war against Hamas, war with Hezbollah is exactly what America has been warning against, saying what it doesn't want is certainly a big question for America about whether or not it supports Israel in that war, because Israel wouldn't be able to win it without American support, particularly when you consider that Hezbollah also has allies in Iran, for example, in other proxy groups, most notably the nation of Iran, which supplies Hezbollah.",
