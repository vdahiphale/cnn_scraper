The app, which has a reported 150 million users in the U.S. alone is facing a potential U.S. ban over national security concerns.This stems from the fact that it's parent company ByteDance is based in China. The CEO you see right there testifying live, Shou Chew, is pushing back hard against this criticism, telling them and fears really telling them that the app is not a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy or spread propaganda in the United States. But some lawmakers are not buying it. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CATHY RODGERS (R-WA):  We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights and innovation. TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is not a partisan issue, it seems, especially on this committee.

But as he just said in that clip TikTok is working, he says to complete that transition under a project known as project Texas to alleviate some of these national security concerns that lawmakers and the American public writ large might have about the platform. Essentially his argument is that as soon as all of that user data is stored on U.S. soil, China ByteDance, they will not have access to any of this user data. That has been at the core of concerns by U.S. lawmakers, that China can collect this data and potentially use it for nefarious reasons.

But TikTok portrays a unique concern and that is that they ultimately are tied to the Chinese Communist Party. They are at the control of that party now. Maybe the Chinese Communist Party right now is not intervening but they could choose to intervene at any moment. And I don't think they may necessarily be totally sinister where they take all the data. But what if they subtly try to have videos on TikTok that are mitigating the human rights concerns with the Uyghurs?

And here is the final point, Kate, on this issue, China has simply not played fair since they've been in the WTO. Our trade deficit with them have exploded. They don't allow American companies access. They don't allow American tech companies access into their markets. Ask Google, ask a lot of the social media companies and tech companies and they have taken a lot of manufacturing jobs. So why should we not have equal reciprocity and fairness?

Turning now to the investigations into Donald Trump. CNN has learned that the grand jury investigating Trump's alleged role in a hush money scheme will not hear anything to do with this case today when it meets. That likely pushes the Manhattan DA's investigation into another week. Separately and also significant, Trump's own defense attorney has been ordered to testify tomorrow before another grand jury. This one convened by the special counsel looking into his possible mishandling of classified documents. Paula Reid has this for us. She's tracking all of it for us. Paula, let's start with the Manhattan DA.  We're hearing that the grand jury is not going to be hearing details on Trump's case. If we want to call it that. So what is happening?",

But what we know from our reporting, Kate, is behind the scenes, they are taking a moment to regroup. They are reflecting on the historic nature of potentially indicting a former U.S. president for the first time. But they're also reconsidering how to proceed after, on Monday, a defense witness went before the grand jury to attack the credibility of the witness, Michael Cohen. So we've learned they're considering bringing Cohen back to rebut that testimony or potentially another witness. And we know that prosecutors have had conversations with attorneys for other witnesses. Nothing specific about testimony but we know they've been in touch and that door for potential testimony is still open. Then the question is, do they move on to vote on a possible indictment ?

This was a rocket docket. This all happened very quickly. It really gives momentum to the special counsel to get evidence that can really make or break this case. Now Corcoran is expected to testify before the grand jury tomorrow. Surprisingly the Trump team isn't going to take this to the Supreme Court to see if they could win. There so he is expected to testify tomorrow. We don't know exactly what he's going to say. He's been before the grand jury before but invoked attorney-client privilege and it is remarkable that they have been able to get around that, arguing what is called the crime fraud exception. He's also going to hand over documents that include handwritten notes. A big win for the special counsel. What it means for their investigation. We'll find out.

So maybe they're keying it to that so that he could be arraigned on Tuesday. The bigger question to me -- and of course, this is all speculation.

But he also acknowledged that there is this risk of a credit crunch where it gets harder for all of us to borrow and that slows the economy. So there's so many moving pieces here. I think one of the big takeaways for everyone at home is that the Fed really means business when it when it comes to like trying to fight inflation because they had every excuse not to raise rates but they did anyway. The good news is for savers right? Because money in the bank is finally going to earn something depending on where you put it. Not so much of the big banks but if you hunt around, especially online, you can see online savings rates as high as 5 percent. Same thing with one year CDs. If you look around, you could go above 5 percent. So that is encouraging. The bad news, of course, is for borrowers. Mortgage rates, they're above 6.5 percent; auto loan rates are at 12 year highs. And credit card rates are at record highs. And let me show you what that last point means. So say you have a $2000 credit card balance. If you're making minimum payments, it would take you more than 15 years to pay that off at current rates. And during that time frame, you would rack up over $2,700 in interest now.

And one of the moments that I think was really key to note on today was a woman in the audience, who the chairman actually pointed out. She started crying. She is the mother in law of a woman, a service member, who died during this evacuation. And she was standing there and Chairman McCaul was talking about how she still has questions. How the committee still has questions about how this evacuation happened, how these service members died. How so many Afghans got caught up in this.
