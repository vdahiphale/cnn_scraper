      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the situation has significantly improved here in Eagle Pass, Texas. If you look behind me, you'll see an empty field. Last week when we talked, there were thousands of migrants who were there waiting to be transported for immigration processing. Now, according to a senior CBP official, don't be fooled by this. This agency is still not out of the woods yet because illicit organizations, smugglers continue to push migrants to cross all along the U.S. southern border illegally into the United States.Now, we have video from just moments ago. There's very small groups of migrants who are crossing into the United States right now here in Eagle Pass, Texas. Those are the scenes here. But this illicit activity continues, and that is what has this agency worried about. Figuring out where the next large group of migrants is going to be crossing to. Now, the federal government has been grappling with an increasing number of migrants crossing in -- illegally into the United States. And the federal government has surged resources all along the U.S. southern border. They have also suspended operations at several ports of entry in several states to reassign those agents to process migrants. And they are also using something called decompression, that's when they move migrants from an area that's overcapacity to an area that has space. Now, from talking to nonprofit organizations all along the U.S. Southern border, I can tell you that here from Eagle Pass, some of the migrants are being taken to the Rio Grande Valley, to Laredo, to Del Rio to be processed. And a lot of them are being released into American communities. Now, I want to take you to Del Rio. We have some video of this. A group of migrants celebrating Christmas mass yesterday. This is an open-air mass underneath the awning of a respite center. And the priest there tells us that on Friday, there were about 200 migrants. When we were there yesterday, there was about two dozen. And he celebrated mass with them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FATHER MICHAEL CORONADO, ST. JOSEPH AND OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE CATHOLIC CHURCHES:  We had a few people come to our church to celebrate with us there, and we knew that there was a lot more here. So, we thought it would be best for them to have a moment to have mass here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that just gives you an idea of just the number of migrants who are being sent to other areas to make sure that they can be processed quickly. Kate.",

Apple said that, we strongly disagree with this decision and they're taking all measures to return the items back to store shelves. That statement came after the U.S. Trade rep put out a statement essentially saying, yes, we decided not to intervene and we can put this statement up for you.
