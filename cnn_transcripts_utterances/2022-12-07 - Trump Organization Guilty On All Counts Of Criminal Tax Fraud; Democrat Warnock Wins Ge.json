We heard a lot of testimony.And the key testimony came from the chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, who really walked a tight rope when he gave his testimony because he's still a paid employee of the company but he pleaded guilty and got this deal with prosecutors where he had to show up and tell the truth. So he explained to the jury how this scheme worked. As prosecutors said, this was a win-win. The company paid less in taxes. These executives got all these perks and they paid less in their personal taxes for this. Now, prosecutors, during the trial, brought up the former president multiple times. And in the end, in their closing statement, they said that Trump had sanctioned some of this tax fraud though, of course, he wasn't charged in this case. But this is a very significant win for the Manhattan district attorney's office. It's also a significant loss for the former president. He's facing multiple criminal investigations and he's going to be embarking on this run for 2024. This certainly gives his rivals some ammunition. But the jury -- eight men, four women -- returned these verdicts in two days -- across the board guilty. And I think we have some sound of the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.

He gave the jury what's known as limiting instructions, saying don't put so much weight on what they said about Trump. Just use it to evaluate the credibility of some of these other witnesses, like in Allen Weisselberg.And the -- and the defense, the entire time -- they used this mantra. They said repeatedly Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg. They wanted to make this point that he was a rogue employee that no one else in the company knew about. And prosecutors said, of course, other people knew about this and that is why they were bringing up Trump here. Now, Trump's -- a lawyer for the Trump Corporation, after the verdict -- Susan Necheles -- she said, \"Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg's personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg's personal conduct for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect. We will appeal this verdict.\" And that -- you know, there are grounds here that they're going to bring this appeal.

Look, it's one vote and yet, it is so consequential.And the first way it's consequential is dealing with how these committees have been structured for the last two years. They've been evenly divided, which means every time they wanted to advance a nominee that was controversial with Republicans, Democrats had to use this very long floor process to get nominees through the Senate. Now they're going to be able to move more quickly in committee. They also had to get sign-off from Republicans to issue a subpoena. Now they're going to be able to pursue investigations that they want to pursue without getting that sign-off. So that's significant. It's also significant for how the majority leader Chuck Schumer can operate in the Senate. Remember, the whole world has revolved around Manchin and Sinema the last two years, and making sure that anytime he wanted to move forward with legislation that only had Democratic votes, he had every single member on board. Now, he could lose one of them and still advance legislation. And that's important because obviously, there were so many heartburns and so many heartaches when it came to things like Build Back Better over the last two years, Kaitlan.",

It's slim but they still have that majority come January. So what does that look like now, in addition to what's happening on the Senate side, with this big victory for Warnock last night?",

So what this means is that if Kevin McCarthy becomes the speaker -- and we should note he's still fighting for the votes -- he's going to have to contend with the right flank of his conference, and that's just going to make it more of a headache in Congress overall. A divided Congress is always more difficult for Democrats even if they had that majority in the Senate.So, yes, he gets an extra vote in the Senate. He could move forward maybe more quickly there. And for nominations, it's very significant where you don't have to get those nominations approved in the House. But it is a huge, huge headwind going into the next year, Kaitlan.",
