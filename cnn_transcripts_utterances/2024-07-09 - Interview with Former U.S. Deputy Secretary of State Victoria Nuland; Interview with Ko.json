But this family gathering is a pretty tense one because at the moment, the alliance faces the threats from foreign antagonists and from within, and the stakes could not be higher. As if these leaders needed reminding, the gruesome images keep coming of Russia's latest missile barrage against Ukraine, including a children's hospital. A clear message from Vladimir Putin. Hundreds killed and wounded there. Narendra Modi, the newly re-elected Indian Prime Minister, hugging his host in Moscow, deeply disturbed the west, but he seems to have denounced that Putin missile attack.

And when Candidate Trump opposed the $60 billion, the Republicans in the House and Senate prevailed on him to change his view, because that's where the American people are. They understand the stakes. So, we need to stay in this fight. Ukraine is fighting for its life and its survival, but it's also standing up for the for the principles of freedom and an open world order and that you can't just have a tyrannical neighbor bite off a piece of your country or your whole country and get away with it if we want to live in this peaceful open world.",

First of all, we have intentionally been careful not to give Putin his own desire,which is to make this not his invasion of Ukraine, but a larger war with NATO or with us. And not to give him reasons to escalate. He has escalated anyway. And therefore, we've had to allow the Ukrainians to do more. That is why the president agreed to allow the Ukrainians to use American weapons beyond the lines into Russia to stop Putin's vicious attacks on Kharkiv, the second largest city, which wasn't even on the front lines. That attack on Kharkiv has been stopped. The other thing is that the Ukrainians are actually now making some serious strategic advances that are lost in this fog of worry about the nibbling that the Russians are doing on the front lines. And by that, I mean, the longer-range weapons are allowing the Ukrainians to degrade the back office of Russia's war effort to hit their logistics bases in Russia. They recently hit the two of the ferries that resupply Crimea, they've done serious damage to the big weapons dump that Putin turned Crimea into, and they've pushed the Black Sea fleet off of its main base in Sevastopol further out. So, yes, the Russians are nibbling at the edges, and yes, they are losing up to a thousand guys a day because Putin doesn't care about the human life of his citizens. But he is reduced to finding allies in criminal places like North Korea, Iran, and using the Chinese as his Lego kit back office while we are gathering 32 nations plus the Asian allies who will give a big brand-new package to Ukraine in the next couple of days, including some of the desperately needed air defenses that will further roll Putin back. So, I believe that the Ukraine will hold. And I believe as we start to rebuild our own weapons systems and weapons bases that we will wear him out in Ukraine. We'll convince him that it's either going to be his job or his war, and he'll have to make a hard choice.",

On the Modi side, you know, the Indians, as you know, I have a 30-year relationship with Russia. It's about their concern about China, or has been. Modi believes that he can be a broker. So, I think that's why he went to Moscow to try to broker. But the fact that Putin stepped on his own tail during the Modi's visit with this egregious, horrific attack in Ukraine, including on the children's hospital caused even Modi, one of his bigger supporters, to have to criticize him just speaks to the fact that Putin has completely lost his way and is losing friends around the world.",

The first thing is that Ukraine is likely to get a designated mission from NATO, that includes NATO taking over the logistics for coordinating all of the weapons supplies that go to Ukraine. This is also part of the future proofing, if you will. Ukraine is going to get a long-term monetary commitment from allies. Ukraine is also going to get significant air defenses, including more Patriot missile batteries. Each missile battery protects the city, like Kharkiv, and some lower-level air defenses that can address these Russian glide bombs. But it is also going to see 2025 allies sign 10-year memoranda of understanding to help Ukraine build its military of the future, the most highly deterrent military in Europe, potentially the strongest military in Europe. So, it knows that that will be built even as it fights.

He's basically saying, this election is doing more to discredit American democracy than Putin or Xi could ever hope to do. I am worried, he says, about the image projected to the outside world.

Whatever happens on the U.S. side I am confident that there will be a strong choice for the American people in favor of freedom and standing up for Putin. So, I don't see decline. On the contrary, we've got the strongest economy on the planet at a time that everybody else is struggling. That is one of the things that I think we have to address with NATO allies and other democratic allies. We've all got to start growing again. And Putin is destroying Russia and the Russian economy to feed his imperial ambition. And he cannot do it forever, which is why we have to make this long-term commitment. And the Russian people have to see what complete folly this adventure of his is, not only in terms of achieving his Ukraine goals or his global goals, but in terms of the future for them that he is mortgaging and sacrificing for this Peter, the Great fantasy.",

Beforehand, there has been dozens of massacres against civilian population in Kosovo, where women, children, and elderly have been killed. Women have been raped. Houses, villages -- entire villages have been burned down. And all of this was within the genocidal project of a regime of Milosevic to have Kosovo without its people, without Albania.

And nearby, having Russian equipment, ammunition, and military armament, but also Chinese one, namely the FK 3-system. So, politically speaking, Serbia is very similar with Russian Federation. They don't really recognize properly de facto and de jure (ph) their neighbors. They cause problems to their neighbors because they want expansion. And on the other hand, I must say that perhaps Russian Federation also imitates Serbia during the regime of Milosevic. And nowadays, we can see how despotic President Putin wants to turn Ukraine into a similar Bosnian scenario country where it will be divided territorially within in order to render its dysfunctional and create opportunity for further conquering of territories. So, Kremlin and Belgrade historically, culturally, politically, but also operationally historically have been imitating each other.

I was in labor looking at my phone, and it would just be one tweet after another with yet another man being exposed as a sexual predator or a school shooter or something terrible. So, I wanted to dig into that, like, where are we going wrong on a cultural and systemic level? And meanwhile, I was very invested in this from a personal point of view, because my own boys were going completely crazy. And, you know, I was parenting these wild rambunctious boys in the shadow of this whole conversation about toxic masculinity. So, it's really easy to think, you know, if they want a nerf gun, does that mean that they're going to be on track to be a school shooter, or if they love to wrestle all the time, does that mean that, you know, there's something toxic or wrong going on, or I'm doing something wrong?

Some of them were, you know, these popular cool kids. But what was really interesting was more of the similarities in what they were saying than the differences. I think they all felt quite hemmed in and quite oppressed by these ideas of masculinity that were being forced on them. So, they all felt that it was very hard for them to like express their emotions and even for them to kind of name their own emotions to themselves. So, it wasn't even -- they found it really hard even to get to the point where they could figure out what they were feeling, let alone tell their friends about it. So, that was one thing. They felt kind of isolated. They felt like they couldn't talk to their friends. A lot of them used the same expression. You know, kids from very different backgrounds used the same expression with me, which is, you can never let your guard down.

And that sort of micro generation is now of voting age, they are of college age, you know. So, if you were 11 when MeToo took off, you're now 18. And I think that generation, we're showing that they're moving to the right politically. They're becoming isolated. They're becoming resentful. I think they don't know their place in the world. They're dropping out of college or not going to college in the same way that girls are. There's this whole problem with failure to launch, that this is becoming increasingly serious, you know, that while kind of young women are doing things like finding partners and going to college and leaving their parents houses, young men are increasingly being left behind.

But they are children, you know, they're not actually responsible for those things that happened. They didn't do this stuff. And so, I think, you know, when they look at their female peers, the concept of privilege doesn't really mean so much to them. They're sort of like, where is all this power that we're supposed to have? You know, this idea that you need to be quiet because you're so privileged. And they're looking at themselves, they're high school kids, they have no economic capital. It doesn't really mean so much to them that somebody on Wall Street, he's male will get a better job or a better salary than somebody who's female on Wall Street.

So, there's this idea that boy -- you know, boys will be boys. So, boys are rambunctious, they're tough, they're sturdy, they're angry, they're badly behaved. But actually, when you look at the research, a baby boy is born about a month to six weeks behind a baby girl in terms of right brain development. So, that's the part that governs emotions and attachment and emotional regulation. So, because their brains are more immature, they're actually more emotionally vulnerable and sensitive. So, all of the kind of stereotypes, you know, really go against what a baby boy actually is. And a baby girl is born more resilient, more independent, more able to regulate her emotions. So, because of that brain fragility, it means that any kind of adverse circumstances. So, you know, poverty or neglect or poor circumstances has been shown to have a greater impact at a population level on boys than it does on girls. But because of our ideas of masculinity, you know, what we think a baby boy is, we tend to treat them with less kind of nurture and less of that intense emotional caregiving than we do with girls. So, it becomes this double whammy. They need more care, but they end up getting less in a sense, you know, we masculinize them. There's all this research that shows that parents use a different vocabulary when they talk with girls, that they use more emotional language, they listen to their feelings more. Whereas with boys, it's more of this like physical roughhousing and wrestling type play. And so, baby boys and boys all the way through childhood really kind of miss out on that emotional engagement.

Men always had to kind of man up and be tough and not be vulnerable, but I think that now there's just so many different kinds of cultural forces. I think there's this idea that it's time for them to be quiet from the left. They're feeling like people are talking about them as if they're toxic and harmful. I think since MeToo -- you know, quite rightly, there's this whole conversation about consent, which is great. But I think it means that they've also feel, at the same time, that they have to be extremely cautious, that they can never overstep. So, at the same time, they're kind of expected to be dominant and aggressive and to kind of make the first move and be, you know, the sort of masculine appearing one with girls. But at the same time, they also have to be extremely cautious and to never overstep. And otherwise, they'll be seen as creepy.

And I think we need to recognize male interiority and male emotions and to listen to them. And I think similarly, in the wider culture, when we talk about boys and men, rather than having this conversation, which is like, it's a gender war, time to men to shut up, you know, I think we need to start listening to men's feelings as well and making space for that.
