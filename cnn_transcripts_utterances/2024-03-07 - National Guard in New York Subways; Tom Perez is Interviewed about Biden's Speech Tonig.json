You know, Israel will say, look, we'll have a cease before Ramadan if you release the hostages. From what I understand, they're not willing to do that. And so now Israel is saying, well, OK, fine, we're going to continue with eradicating Hamas through the Ramadan season. And so it's really up to Hamas. It's in their court.
