That's an upscale neighborhood where many embassies are located. Now what we've seen on state media and on social media, there was a huge explosion. Massive column of smoke apparently brought down a three-story building.Now, Syrian state media is saying that it was an Israeli airstrike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military, they have yet to comment on that. But we understand from the Tasnim News Agency, that's an semi-official Iranian news agency. They are quoting, the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran, saying that four members, four advisors of the IRGC were killed in that strike, as well as several members of the Syrian military. Now, according to the Tasnim News Agency, that is a building that was a residence for a several Iranian military advisors in the Syrian capital. Now, this is the first Israeli airstrike on Damascus, since the beginning of the year. Now, Israeli strikes on Damascus and in Syria, in general, are not uncommon. But keep in mind that just a few weeks ago, on the second of January, here in Beirut, there was an Israeli airstrike that killed one of the senior members of the military wing of Hamas. And therefore, it does appear that this might be along the same lines, sort of a targeted strike on a senior member of the alliance, the so- called Axis of Resistance that is arrayed against Israel that includes Syria, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and in addition to other militant factions in Iraq as well. So not an -- the first time that Damascus has been hit by the Israelis. But certainly, this does represent a significant targeted strike on Iranian personnel in the Syrian capital. Victor, Amara?",

Willis is trying to stop the questioning saying it's being used to harass and damage her professional reputation and is obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution. This exploded in the public eye earlier this month when one of the defendants in the Georgia election subversion case, Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official moved to disqualify Willis, alleging she had an improper relationship with Wade. Roman alleges Wade was paid more than others in Willis's office, and used money he billed for his work so far adding up to more than $650,000 to take Willis on romantic and lavish vacations.

Here is CNN's space and defense correspondent, Kristin Fisher with a look at what's going on with the lander's battery power.KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Victor and Amara. Well, Japan's Moon Sniper lunar lander has touched down on the surface of the moon, but there is a bit of a problem. Right now, it is operating on really limited battery power because there's an issue with the solar cells. So it's not generating its own solar power, which is a big problem for this little lunar lander. And so, Japan is troubleshooting. There's a chance that they will still be able to get this spacecraft developing its own power. But as of now, it remains to be seen if this spacecraft will be able to fulfill its ultimate goal of really starting to do some scientific studies and testing out some of these rocks on the surface of the moon. But if you take a step back here, simply landing on the moon is a tremendous feat in and of itself. I mean, only four other countries have been able to do it, only two other countries in this century alone, China and India. I mean, keep in mind, the United States hasn't landed a crude or un-crude rover on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo Program way back in 1972. Russia tried to do it last year, they weren't successful. A private Japanese space company tried to do it, they weren't successful. Even just last week, a private U.S.-based company Astrobotic tried to do it, and it, too, failed. So simply landing on the surface of the moon is a feat in and of itself, but now, it remains to be seen exactly how well this spacecraft held up, did it tip over? Did it stay upright? And are they able to really communicate with it and get those solar cells up and running. They are able, Japan space agency is able to talk to the lunar lander, but it remains to be seen if it will be able to fully complete its mission. So stay tuned, Victor and Amara.",

It is as pointed out, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to soft-land a spacecraft on the moon, and only five countries have done it so far, now Japan has joined the club. So far, none of the commercial entities that have tried have succeeded, most don't even get into space.You know, there was the big X -- Google X Prize, Lunar X Prize that ended in 2018 after ten or so years, trying to stimulate commercial companies to be able to get to the moon, that didn't work out.

It was lost for a moment, and then they aborted the mission to the moon, tried to use it as a satellite for testing, then burned up on the way back into the earth's atmosphere.Is there anything that can be salvaged from this, the data maybe that was sent back before it burned up, or is this a total loss?",

Then there was a little communication glitch, but then as soon as they re-established communication, they unfortunately discovered that after it got into space, it had suffered a major anomaly, the -- basically there's a valve -- looks like there was a valving problem where the high pressure helium may have burst, exploded one of the propellant tanks.And so, they didn't have enough fuel to go to the moon and land. And so, unfortunately, they were able to stay in communication with the spacecraft, tried to salvage some kind of -- you know, maybe some measurements, and then be able to direct it to a -- you know, a safe entry where back into the earth's atmosphere where it burned up, which was, you know, just kind of a disposal maneuver. So I'm sure the team learned a lot just by getting the vehicle into space. They learned a lot during their flight control operations, and they vowed to continue to try. And so, I'm hopeful that Astrobotic, I was rooting for those guys, I am hopeful that they are successful on their next attempt.",
