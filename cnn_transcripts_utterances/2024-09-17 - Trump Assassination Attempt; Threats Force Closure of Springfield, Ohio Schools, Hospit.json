The assumption is that even after meeting with Egyptian officials, key mediators in this hostage ceasefire deal, he's not potentially assuming there will be something to take back to the Israelis to be able to push the deal forward.And we've also seen in recent visits, just in the hours or days after Blinken has been on the ground in Israel, the Israeli prime minister has thrown doubt on the hostage deal. Just earlier this month, he said there's not a deal in the making. So what we're seeing is a lot less optimism when it comes to this hostage deal. We've heard from two Biden administration officials saying that the national security chiefs have no imminent plans to put forward a hostage deal and a final bridging proposal to the U.S. President Donald Trump in the near future. Now, that's very different to what we had heard earlier this month when officials said that they believed that a deal could be very close. We're also hearing that they don't want to put this final bridging proposal to the president until they have some idea that Hamas would say yes to it eventually. And according to these officials, they're not there at this point. We understand from the officials that Hamas is now pushing for some of the Palestinian prisoners that would be released within this deal that are serving life sentences to be in return for civilian hostages. Now, in the previous deal, that had been just for the soldier hostages. But then even on the Israeli side, there is growing skepticism in Washington that the Israeli prime minister does want a deal, as he is still pushing to have Israeli troops on the border between Egypt and Gaza, the Philadelphi corridor, something which Hamas will not accept and something which appears to be stalling a deal. So all of this tells us that the talks appear to be far more stalled than previously believed. Secretary of State Blinken will be in Egypt and they will be talking about the hostage deal and the ceasefire deal itself. But there doesn't appear to be any optimism of an imminent breakthrough -- Max, Christina.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christina, it would be remarkable, given the fact that Israel is in the middle of a war, to replace the defense minister. But we have seen this increasing disagreement and becoming ever more public between Gallant and Netanyahu. We have been hearing, really, from many Israeli media reports as well, that the defense minister does not support the prime minister's push to have these Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor, saying that Hamas would not agree to it, so there won't be a deal and that means that the hostages will not be coming home.So what we've heard from the prime minister's office at this point is that there were reports he was talking to Gideon Saar, who is another former ally of Netanyahu, now a rival, that he had been in talks with him to replace Gallant. The prime minister's office said that's not true, the talks haven't taken place, but have not mentioned Gallant himself. So we really are hearing this ever more public disagreement between what the prime minister thinks should happen and what the defense minister thinks should happen. So really quite unusual public disagreement at a time of Israel fighting on a number of fronts.",
