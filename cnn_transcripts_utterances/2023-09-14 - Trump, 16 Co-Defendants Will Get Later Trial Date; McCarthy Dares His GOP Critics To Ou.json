Kenneth Chesbro and Sidney Powell. The Fulton County District Attorney was pushing for all 19 co-defendants to be tried at the same time. That is not happening. CNN National security reporter Zachary Cohen is covering the story. So now the question is, well, then, when is the former president going to face trial? And it's looking like next year maybe.",

But the judge did sort of initiate the legal process for Donald Trump and the sixteen others were not named, Sidney Powell and Ken Chesbro, in this case, they're going to have a much more expedited timeline. Their trial is going to start or set to start on October 23rd.But the former president, you know, they are going to start doing these pretrial sort of steps. The judge wants to get that resolved by the end of the year based on the schedule that he laid out today. So you know, remains to be seen when a trial for Donald Trump could come but it won't be happening before December. Meanwhile, Ken Chesbro and Sidney Powell, I mean five weeks or so before we could see them start their trial process. The prosecutors and the judge said he wants to have jury selection done by November 5th. So two different timelines but you know, both things are moving forward.",

But the judge said, look, we can work out maybe some circumstance or some ways that, you know, it's maybe supervised. So they're going to come back with some options on that.

This is what Donald Trump actually is pretty masterful at. So while he can be facing very serious charges, both federally and in Georgia, the Republicans are like no, don't, you know, look over here, where there's, you know, this Hunter Biden activity. He might have put Joe Biden on the speakerphone once. And so we're going to open an impeachment inquiry into that.And they're really good at spending that by saying, well, no, we need an impeachment inquiry so that we can have the tools we need to -- in order to find this answer. But this will be the first time in history that without direct evidence or a serious accusation of impropriety, you're opening an impeachment inquiry simply because you want to get to an answer that you don't -- you can get to any other way.

But on the question of delivering something, there's obviously government funding that dries up at the end of the month.

And so I think it's an attempt to appease.But here's the thing. My good friend Charlie Sykes always uses the term. If you feed the alligator in the bathtub, eventually it's going to get out of the bathtub and eat you. And that's what he's done right now. You keep feeding the Freedom Club and you make him powerful and you keep giving them power to shut things down, eventually they're going to outgrow you, and that's where he's at right now.

So as leaders of the Republican Party, when you see the way that they're communicating with members of the base, as we get closer to primaries in 2024, is it a mistake to conflate these things and to lead voters in a direction where they're anticipating a result of a potential impeachment inquiry where they might -- where there might not be one.",

And this is what they're going to have to face is, you know, the moderates, the so-called moderates left in the Republican Party are frustrated. I was one of them. I went through fights like this that weren't quite even as intense as this, and I can tell you how angry they are. They have to start playing hardball in some of this too.You know, people have to say, look, I'm not willing to lose my race. Let's take even the moral side out of it and just go with the cold, hard politics for a second. I'm not willing to lose my race because people like Matt Gaetz, who just loves being on TV, is going to destroy my chance at winning my district. The moderates have got to quit saying, we're going to play with the team. And they've got to start playing hardball of their own.

The Union wants cost of living increases, pension plans for all workers, health care coverage beyond retirement, big pay raises as well, pay hikes, an immediate 20 percent raise with additional increases that add up to a 40 percent raise over four years.One former head of Ford has a stark warning for the Union. That is, try not to go too far here. CNN business reporter Matt Egan has been tracking that part of the story. So, Matt, listen, you're going to hear arguments like this from both sides, right. Of course, the UAW is saying we took big cuts in 2008, 2009 during the financial crisis, just trying to get back to where we were and then some.

He said that the industry can't, quote, plead poverty because they have been profitable. But his warning is to the UAW saying basically, don't ask for the moon, because if you get it, it could end up making these companies uncompetitive, right? He says that the auto CEO, they're going to look at this very soberly and rationally. If their costs go up too much in the US, they're going to move factories and jobs overseas. And so that's why he said, quote, you don't want the UAW to win the battle but lose the war. And of course the Union would argue these companies can afford to paytheir workers a lot more, in part because they have paid their CEO's millions of dollars. Now for workers, the stakes here are massive. Let me run you through some of the numbers. Under the existing contracts, the top hourly rate is about $32 an hour. That works out to around $67,000 a year before overtime. If the UAW gets what they're asking for, that pay would go well above $80,000 a year by the end of this contract. That is big, especially given just how much the cost of living has gone up for all of us.",
