      "sentences": "Tonight, patience running out as more reports emerge of these mysterious drones in New Jersey. The feds, they're brushing off concerns as lawmakers insist something is not right. Plus, the new search warrants tied to the second CEO killer and the one theory that's now been ruled out. And a new report debunks a popular January 6th conspiracy theory while also giving the FBI a little bit of a scolding. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"You know, you would think that after weeks of drones flying above New Jersey, we'd have some answers about where they're coming from, who's controlling them. Yeah, no, we don't have much of any of that, but we do have residents and politicians increasingly asking this question, what the heck is going on? Buzzing lights are flying overhead. Mysterious drones, if that's what they really are, they're often appearing in clusters. And we're told they even avoid detection by turning off their lights and fleeing when anything gets close. And get this. It has been going on since mid-November. Almost a month, really? And you know, you're guarding variety recreational drones. These are actually big boy drones, talking the size of bikes or even small cars. Some of them are even six feet in length. They've been spotted near a military research facility. They've been seen over Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. Even the Coast Guard has encountered these drones. Just a moment, I'll speak with someone who has seen these drones firsthand and launched his own drone to try to investigate, only to suddenly have it malfunctioned when he tried. Now the FBI and Homeland Security say there is no evidence that they posed any national security threat. That's not good enough for officials who are asking, well then what are they? It's not quite quieting those who are in New Jersey or in Washington D.C., be the Democrat or Republican. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  They should be shot down if necessary because they're flying over sensitive areas.",

You take it to a place like Nevada or someplace where there's little interference and you can figure out, you know, whether or not the drone is functioning properly according to the parameters that you've set for it. So that's one of the big issues. If it's a foreign entity that's doing this, then, of course, we have a whole other set of questions to ask. And one of the things that interests me about this is the size of the drone. The reported size, like Michael was talking about, the size of a car approximately. That is pretty close to something that at least one Chinese company is putting out there.

But are there manned aircrafts that can evade traditional detection methods like radar or radio frequencies in helicopters?ROB D'AMICO, FORMER COUNTER DRONE UNIT CHIEF, FBI:  They're not evading it. If you look at the sky at night through an app say like Flightradar24, you will see there's hundreds of planes over New Jersey within an hour. Some of them are 10,000 feet, some of them are 20,000, some are 30,000. They're all separated by altitude, but they look close together. He says that it looks like a car. Well, a plane at 9,000 feet has a different appearance than at 20,000 feet. It's hard to see at night. When I used to go to the World Series or Super Bowl, anytime we announced that the FBI's counter drone unit was there, everyone would start looking up in the sky and see planets that they've never seen before, lights that they've never seen before, and say there are drones.

But the gun remaining is one of those things.I think the other issue about UnitedHealthcare is, it may not have been from a motive standpoint that he had any particular beef with them because of some encounter in the business of healthcare. More than it was his general animus towards corporate America and healthcare insurers in particular and that United was the biggest. Listen to this from the note that was found on his person claiming responsibility for these crimes. United is the fifth largest company in the United States by market cap, followed only by Apple, Google, and Walmart. And it keeps growing and growing.

Need to get in that phone. Number two, that computer, when he's arrested at McDonald's, he's in a laptop. Police say, his head was buried in the laptop when we came in the restaurant. What page was he on? Was he on the page of what countries do not have extradition treaties with the United States? Was he on the page of the profile of another potential victim? Was he on the page simply, and I wouldn't rule this out at all because it's common among these kinds of offenders, of reading his own press?

They were waiting on a request from Capitol Police for more intelligence. That's a crying damn shame. And we've spent four years off now just covering dust on what happened other than those that have been prosecuted. The FBI and DOJ did a great job of this.
