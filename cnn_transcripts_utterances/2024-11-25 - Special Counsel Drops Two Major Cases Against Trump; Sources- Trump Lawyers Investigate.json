And then just moments later, Smith said he is also dropping the federal classified document case against Trump. Also breaking this afternoon, a CNN exclusive one of Trump's closest advisers now under investigation by Trump's own attorneys. Sources tell CNN the top aide is facing allegations of using his ties to Trump for financial gain. Let's get right to that CNN exclusive with CNN's Sara Murray and Kristen Holmes joining us now. So, Sara, in terms of what we're looking at here, first of all, who is the Trump aide? What is he accused of doing?",

And one of them was that Epshteyn tried to ask Scott Bessent, Donald Trump's pick to be the treasury secretary, for payment in addition, in exchange, essentially for Epshteyn promoting Bessent's name around Mar-a-Lago as well as with Trump. There was another instance when Epshteyn asked for payment allegedly from someone and said he would connect him with people relevant to his industry in the incoming administration. Now, half a dozen sources confirmed this internal investigation to me. Kristen Holmes, our colleague Kate Sullivan. It's not a criminal investigation. This is an internal investigation that attorneys for Donald Trump have been running. But they were concerned enough about their findings to recommend that Epshteyn should be removed from Trump's orbit. Now, here is what Epshteyn had to say about all of this. He said in a statement to CNN, I am honored to work for President Trump and with his team. These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from making America great again.",

And it was -- I mean, excuse me, Bessent and Boris Epshteyn, with Epshteyn shouting at Bessent, essentially saying he was going to sue him at some point.

Smith acknowledges that this is an unprecedented situation that he found himself in saying, quote, the Department of Justice and the country have never faced the circumstance here when a defendant is elected president.And they had asked for more time to reflect on what exactly the next move would be here. CNN has reported that smith had been talking to top leaders at the Justice Department to discuss how exactly they should proceed with winding down their cases. There's internal guidance in the Justice Department that says you cannot indict or prosecute a sitting president, but it wasn't clear if that applied to a president-elect. But after weeks of discussions, they have concluded that in fact, it does apply to a president elect, and, quote, this prosecution must be dismissed before the dependant is inaugurated. But Smith is quick to point out that this does not reflect the merit of their work, and the prosecutions that against Trump saying that this decision does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged. The strength of the governments proof or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind. Now, that was all related to the D.C. case. They are also moving to dismiss the classified documents case against Trump, but they will continue to prosecute his two co-defendants because, of course, they are not presidents-elect. And it will be fascinating, Erica, to see what the Trump justice department does with this case, because a Trump appointed judge Aileen Cannon, had tossed the classified documents case, saying the special counsel, Jack Smith, was not properly appointed. So when the Trump justice department comes in, if they want to appoint their own special counsel to look into politically sensitive topics, they're going to have to contend with the fact that you do have this outstanding decision. So we'll be watching closely to see if Trump pardons his co-defendants. If they try to dismiss that case, or if they continue to fight this issue and protect their right to appoint special counsels. So, this is going to be a key issue to watch for the incoming attorney general.",

There is a belief that that pardon power is absolute and that a president could preemptively pardon themselves. So, yes, there's always a possibility, but I would certainly expect that his lawyers would advise him for a number of reasons, to preemptively pardon himself to prevent any of these federal cases from coming back.And, of course, there's no pardon he can give himself that will protect him from any state cases that are still lingering once he's out of office.",

I mean, I guess, you know, as a member of the January 6th Committee, we can take pride in the fact that we are the only basically historic record. And I guarantee you that in ten years, America is going to learn the truth about January 6th, and nobody's going to think Donald Trump was in the right.So I take pride in that. But look, the Supreme Court made it very clear. It was very clear that if Donald Trump won again, that these cases would be dropped. In fact, that's why the Trump campaign or Donald Trump as a defendant was stalling as long as he was by the chance that he would win again. So America made this decision. They made the decision that Donald Trump shouldn't be held accountable. In essence, they made a decision they want a king, and that's Americas decision to make now, I would just encourage everybody to remember if the shoe ever gets on the other foot in the next 10 or 15 or 20 years, and it's the Democrats doing this, this is a decision that was made by Republicans. And so that's interesting. By the way, you know, Bill Clinton's indiscretion was not a personal indiscretion. There was a 19-year-old intern in the Oval Office. And I think its important that we remind people that that presidents aren't above the law, even if this case is dismissed. But unfortunately, it seems right now that they are. You know, to your point on how this was handled during the campaign, the delays that happened, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance posting on X, quote, if Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison. These prosecutions were always political. Now its time to ensure what happened to president Trump never happens in this country again. Look, he's calling it political. That is clearly a political statement there. You know, never went to trial, didn't go before a jury of his peers. How does that age in terms of a post, do you think?",

So, yeah, I don't think it necessarily ages well. But again, I mean, you know, the vice president-elect is right to the extent that you know, now its time to move on because Donald Trump was elected. And again, in the process of that campaign, it was made very clear that if he is elected again, these cases will be dropped and America made the decision to reelect him.

And I think that this decision by Mr. Smith I think he had to do it. But I think it's -- it's the right thing to do.

So that case seems to be, if not on life support, that case seems to have some issues.And Judge Merchan has several times continued issuing a ruling and the sentencing date. So I think with the New York case, it's very likely that based on the decision in the spring by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding presidential immunity and the testimony that came in during that trial from Ms. Hicks that talked about things that happened while President Trump was, in fact president. It's going to be near impossible for Judge Merchan to determine what if any, prejudice that tainted testimony had on this defendant and this conviction.

So, David Sanger on this news broke, right, as people were getting last list of names for Trump's cabinet. You took a look over the weekend at the picks and really divided them into three groups. One of them was the revenge team, which would include, under your classification, nominees for the Justice Department. So, it seems like this is a good place for me to begin with you today. How do you see that coming into play based on what we just saw from Jack Smith a short time ago? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, what we saw come from Jack Smith was that the Donald Trump play here to get out of these indictments worked. I mean, he basically said during the campaign that the real verdict on him is going to come from the voters. And it turned out it did, because once he got elected, Jack Smith said he could not under Justice Department rules proceed with an indictment and trial of a sitting president. So he asked for this to be placed in abeyance. I mean, I think it probably kills the case. That's the revenge team. There are two others. There's one to calm the markets led by Scott Bessent, the new treasury secretary nominee but others as well, who are there to do the opposite of the revenge team, the revenge team is there to basically roil things up change everything in the Justice Department, the calm, the markets team is let's keep the economy growing and the stock market rising during all of that, and then there's a team to go shrink the government. That's, of course, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy and it's going to be really interesting to see whether or not these teams come into -- into clashes with each other, because it's very hard on the one hand, to be a massive disrupter of the justice system.

I think the congressman is saying that he's going to continue to live his life and not kneel to Donald Trump and succumb to any of the pressures that may come to him, which is an important thing to do to push back on someone who might seek revenge, which is not part of democracy, but I think that we all have to remain vigilant. We have to -- that's why we want to have congressional hearings or the Senate hearings for the confirmations. That's why we want background checks so that we can keep this democracy alive and thriving.

Or will they just take President-elect Trump's word that they're using some kind of private group and that that should be fine. Since we've already seen big issues over Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence, or the nominee for the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, I think there's reason to wonder whether or not going back to regular background checks would make a big difference.

That's not open to question. The question is why prosecutors at the time said the boys wanted the inheritance. The boys said they were living in fear for their lives after years of emotional and physical and sexual abuse from their father and that is why they killed their parents. Now, we were expecting today to have the first appearance in public in 28 years of Erik and Lyle Menendez. They were supposed to appear via video link from where they're being held down in San Diego.

That's the sound that says that I now have to make the walk of shame back with my group to board with them. Instead of trying to rush the line and board ahead of time. American says, so far, the response has been relatively positive. They're rolling this out at 120 airports nationwide. The technology is in place now. We saw it in use here at Reagan National Airport in D.C. It worked ahead of what's going to be a huge Thanksgiving travel rush. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What do you think this public shaming -- Pete saw it working there at Reagan. Do you think this is the answer to line cutters at the gate? BRIAN KELLY, FOUNDER, THEPOINTSGUY.COM:  Well, I think we need a bunch of different solutions, but I think it's a step in the right direction. You know, for far too long, it's been a chaotic when boarding flights. And it really was always left up to the gate agent who are stressed out overworked to do the policing. So I think this will help. But also, it'll still require the gate agent to force people to turn around. So but overall, I think frequent fliers can attest this is probably a good thing.",

When you finally get to your destination, if you miss your connecting flight, your bag could get lost. So I think people might start saying, you know what, I think I mightjust pay for the normal fare instead of trying to go cheap because as my dad always said, cheap is expensive.

Macy's announcing today a single employee was able to hide more than $150 million in delivery expenses over the last few years, forcing the department store to delay its third quarter earnings report which was supposed to come out tomorrow.Vanessa Yurkevich joins me now. I have to say, I'm obsessed with this story. So I don't understand how this happened. How did Macy's discover it? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  I think Macy's is trying to figure out just how this happened, but basically they were trying to put together their third quarters earnings report, and they realized that the numbers simply were not adding up. So they launched this independent investigation and found that this single employee was fudging the accounting numbers on their small package delivery fees and expenses, and essentially they decided that they need to keep this investigation going to try to figure out exactly what happened. So they pushed their earnings call, which was scheduled to happen tomorrow. They pushed it to December 11th. Now we do not know how or why this individual was able to hide $154 million over the course of three years. But Macy's saying that it did not impact their cash management or payments to vendors. That same three-year period, all delivery expenses totaled $4.3 billion. So $154 million is a small fraction. Still, it's millions of dollars. Now the CEO of Macy's, Tony Spring, earlier today said, quote: At Macy's Inc., we promote a culture of ethical conduct, while we work diligently to compete -- complete the investigation as soon as practicable, and ensure this matter is handled appropriately. Our colleagues across the company are focused on serving our customers and executing our strategy for a successful holiday season. But, of course, Erica, this raises a lot of questions why did it take so long to figure this out? And where was that $154 million ultimately hiding?",
