Debby made landfall at 7:00 this morning Eastern time as a category one hurricane near Steinhatchee and Florida's Big Bend area.

The Dow, NASDAQ and S&amp;P all deep in the red. The Dow started the day down more than 1,000 points before clawing back some earlier losses. Let's talk about all of this with Catherine Rampell, CNN economics and political commentator and columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" I mean, I just want to start with your initial read on what we're seeing here. CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is all a reaction to what happened on Friday, when we got a jobs report that was worse than expected. Not abysmal. I think that there has been a little bit of catastrophizing of this report. But it was worse than expected. And in some sense, there are a lot of investors who maybe thought that stock values were too good to be true and they we're waiting for their cue for the party to end. And that report was it, that a lot of traders looked at it and said, OK, maybe this is a sign that the U.S. economy is actually in trouble. We should dump our stocks.",

How much are those factors playing into what we're seeing here?",

And the Federal Reserve met last week a few days before this jobs report and looked at the data and said, you know, the economy is slowing but doesn't yet warrant a rate cut.In fact, Chair Jay Powell said that he wanted more data to justify a rate cut. Seems like he got it on Friday. And I think that a lot of investors, market traders, et cetera, are saying, you know, maybe the Fed waited too long, maybe they are behind the curve and they should have gotten ahead of this report, which, of course, they didn't know about, and started stimulating the economy earlier. I want to caution, I want to emphasize that this is one report. There may have been some weirdnesses in it related to Hurricane Beryl temporarily putting people out work. It's one report. A lot of the other data are actually much stronger. And the GDP numbers that came out not that long ago were better than expected. So I don't want everyone to freak out. I know markets look pretty -- pretty murderous right now. But I don't think that we should read too much into this one report, especially since we'll get another jobs report in a few weeks and plenty of other data between now and then.",

It was hit and killed on the road. He picked it up. He planned to take it home and skin it and, I guess, eat it, but he didn't have time, it turned out, after going to Peter Lugers where he ate when the bear was still in his car. So he decided to dump it in Central Park. That's the story as told to Roseanne Barr in this video posted last night, which he posted because \"The New Yorker\" was onto the story and \"The New Yorker\" apparently was going to report it today.
