We are just getting some excerpts of what he is going to say in this crucial speech in moment in his career. This as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump ramp up attacks its against each other wasting no time. Plus, a path to victory that the Harris campaign sees, signaling that they are stronger than Biden and several key states. It's a different map. What is their road to 270? Potential VP pick Pete Buttigieg weighs in OUTFRONT. And Kamala Harris's modern family. After relentless personal attacks from the right, the surprising voice coming to Kamala Harris's defense. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: I'm not going to be nice. Those are the exact words, a quote from the former President Trump unleashing attack after attack on Vice President Kamala Harris. He is campaigning in what could be the battleground state of North Carolina. This is his first rally since President Biden withdrew from the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultraliberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I expect that he'll get a better hearing because of it.It's always been my belief that if he's stepped away, that people would be as accomplishments more clearly than if he was trying to sell them and the idea that he should serve another four years because that was so associated with age.

One of the real deficiencies of this administration has been its fear of taken credit for the three years of extraordinary economic growth and Americans enjoyed since 2021, since the end of the pandemic. I know why they're afraid because of aggressive groups will say no one is happy until everybody is happy, and if there are any sad people in America left and there are always sad people, if there's one person has got some rare disease out there, you cannot take credit. But I pointed out to them that Democrats who get second terms and they're asking for a second term, take credit for the first term. In 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for reelection, he gave us State of the Union in January, and the economy in 1996 was still pretty shaky.

I have a world of respect for David Frum, who I think is so talented and so insightful, but he kind of skipped over the 2012 race. I lived through a period where a president was running for reelection in the economy was doing better, but people didn't feel it. It's not a good strategy actually. You can acknowledge all the progress as long as the end of that acknowledgement is, but people experience the economy through the prices they're paying. That has been punishing. I'm going to work on that more. That's where our attention has to be. So it can't just be open-ended bragging about stuff when people, 65 percent of the people, not just a few people, who are gripers, it's like 65 percent of the public has a negative view of the economy.",

Look at this, 21 percent, compare that to the nation as a whole, 12 percent. Look at Georgia as well, look at that, 34 percent of voters in Georgia are Black according to recent polling.

So the Harris campaign came out with a very optimistic memo this morning, including North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, right? As Harris was just laying out all as potential paths that they see the 270, different than the Biden map and I just want to point out 2008, the only time since 1980 that North Carolina went blue, that's why we had it read on our maps. So do you truly believe that it's in play this year now? PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do. I was there not long ago. There is terrific energy there. I think it's telling that Donald Trump feels the need to defend North Carolina right now and it's part of expanding that map, you know, in addition to competing in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, there is huge opportunity in places like North Carolina. You look at the changes, of course, as we went through the last election in places like Georgia, we are back in a conversation about an expanding map for Democrats and certainly for the Harris campaign. And it makes it one more reason why this is just a very exciting moment for this campaign for our party and really for the country because I think it opens up new possibilities in terms of a forward- looking politics as well.",

And remember, the Democratic Party is not exactly known for falling in line. We are known for being a big tent, fractious, lot of different voices.
