This comes as the defamation damages trial against Donald Trump is now in the hands of the jury. Seven men, two women tasked with deciding how much Donald Trump should have to pay E. Jean Carroll for denying when he was president that he sexually assaulted her and then lambasting her character. A jury in another trial already found him liable for sexually assaulting Ms. Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million for defaming her in 2022. Today, moments before closing arguments began, the judge admonished Trump's attorney for interrupting, threatening her, quote, you are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup, now sit down, unquote. Then just minutes after Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, began her closing arguments, Donald Trump stormed out of the courtroom. The judge instructing the court record to reflect that Trump had walked out. Kaplan and her statement tried to persuade the jury to hit Trump where it hurts, his wallet, saying Donald Trump is a wealthy man and the only way to get him to stop telling lies is to force him to pay unusually high punitive damages. Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, fired back, arguing that Carroll only brought this case to get back her lavish lifestyle. Donald Trump himself set the tone for this dramatic day in court with a fiery statement in the middle of the night posted on Truth Social (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's really magnified here. It's kind of, you know, trial by Ouija board. They figure out what they want to do and they do it. I think the wrong thing to pay attention to is how much is compensatory and how much is punitive. If they have a very high punitive amount, that's basically saying they're not thrilled with the conduct of President Trump, that they're not thrilled with his outburst in court perhaps. But if they -- if they go real lean on the compensatory, then that would also tell you something about their view of E. Jean Carroll. But again, this is a wide-open world.

It was a hot bench for President Trump's lawyer, did not sound particularly promising that he was going to win on the notion of blanket immunity for president while in office. You know, it's the artifact of the king can do no wrong.But I do think when it gets to the Supreme Court, and I believe very firmly it'll get there, that the Supreme Court could carve out a much more nuanced approach that's more like qualified immunity or executive privilege, where they saved president is doing something within his core responsibilities as chief executive, we're going to protect them. We're going to immunize him. So a phone call to a foreign dignitary that somebody doesn't like or thinks is an FCPA violation, a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violation, we're going to immunize him there. But if he goes off the rails and commit some crime completely unrelated to his duties, then he has no immunity. I think that's a reasonable and kin of a long-term outcome that could make sense for the office, the institution of the presidency. But we have to wait and see. You know, I think that's -- it's going to get to the Supreme Court. It's going to be a profound moment because we've never had this kind of circumstance.",

In December, the Israel Defense Forces said that it found dozens of missiles hidden under UNWRA equipment. Meanwhile, in the most intensive effort and weeks, the top intelligence chiefs from the United States and Israel and Egypt, as well as Qatar's prime minister, are all meeting and putting their heads together this weekend to try to reach some sort of hostage deal. Whether they actually strike a deal remains to be seen, but outlines of possible agreements including a prolonged stop and fighting in return for the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages are notably starting to take shape. We will keep you updated on that story. Now to a binding and, quote, watershed ruling by the United Nations top court. The International Court of Justice said today that Israel must, quote, take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Today's ruling was a first step, while the final ruling on the genocide case brought by South Africa, could theoretically take years.

We do want to warn our viewers some images in this report will be difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are the last moments of Hala Khreis' life. You can see her here leading a group of 30-odd people, they wave white flags, a plea for safe passage out of their neighborhood, now surrounded by Israeli forces. She holds the hand of her five-year-old grandson Taim tightly, and then suddenly -- little Taim quickly runs away. Her son, Mohammed, rushes towards her. If you slow the video down, you can see Hala start to turn just before she is shot, as if f she had caught sight of something. From the angle of her fall and the movement of the fleeing group, it is clear that the bullet came from the west or the south. CNN has geo-located the intersection. Mohammed told us, when he reached his mother, he looked up and saw two Israeli tanks ahead of him to the south, and just 200 meters to the West, we know Israeli troops were stationed at the new Gaza prep school for boys. As captured here in satellite images and a photograph published on November 12th, the day Hala was killed.

You know, as I said, Trump's lawyers aren't in the room. This usually takes a few moments to assemble everyone, bring them in the room, then bring the jury out, and then the judge will ask the foreperson of the jury to hand up the envelope with the verdict and then read it in this case. And this verdict is, you know, as we've talked about, this is not about finding whether Trump heads sexually assaulted Carroll or defamed her. Another jury already did that. The question here is damages. How much money Trump would have to pay Carroll in this case, both emotional, compensatory damages, damages to repair her reputation and potential punitive damages. Now, Carroll's team asked the jury today to return at least 24 million to her. We're waiting to see exactly what they will come down to. So, you know, were waiting again for everyone to assemble into the room. They're saying now that the verdict, according to my colleague we learned the value will be read at 4:35.

He has become almost fixated on the fact that he continues to say privately that he needed to defend himself. So, we're likely to see a Trump who is going to be very angry once this verdict is read. Obviously, we do not know the amount in damages, but if he is to pay damages to E. Jean Carroll, we can expect a very angry Donald Trump. Now, as we know, he has used all of these cases. It really is part of his campaign process. He did not have to be in court. However, I was told that particularly with E. Jean Carroll, he has become more and more fixated with this idea of having to defend himself. That's why you saw him testify. Lawyers obviously had prepped him. He could not speak for a lengthy amount of time and he obviously did not go off message, something that we see usually from Donald Trump. The other person who was invested in this case, I was told, was his wife, Melania Trump, who said that he needed to go out and defend his family's name. Interestingly, we heard Donald Trumps say he felt like he needed to defend his name, his family's name, so similar messaging there. Now, Donald Trump has a campaign event tomorrow in Nevada. We know they're going to head there tonight. Likely when this verdict is read, they will already be at the airport leaving to go to his next campaign event, which is how he is really balanced all of this. But I think that we can expect Donald Trump to be very angry once this comes down. And I know we talk about this about his money, and him having to pay damages for something that he believes is unfair or paints as unfair or was painting himself as the victim, as always been part of his strategy, that is going to be something that angers him deeply.",

The foreperson will have an envelope, will hand it up, and then the judge it will receive it and read the verdicts. So, we expect that to unfold and just over the next few minutes. You know, that means that this jury has deliberated for just under three hours. The question for them, how much money Donald Trump should pay E. Jean Carroll for damages. Her lawyers are asking for at least $24 million in compensatory damages and they want, they said, a substantial amount of money for punitive damages. So, that's the amount of money they're asking to punish Donald Trump for repeating the statements that another jury has already found to be a defamatory, repeating them just 24 hours after the verdict at the CNN town hall. That was the centerpiece of their closing arguments today. And that was the moment that Donald Trump stood up and left the courtroom. Now, he did eventually returned to hear his lawyers closing arguments and the rest of the proceedings, but he left the courthouse just around 4:00. His motorcade we saw it departing where he's out of the building. So when this verdict is read, moments from now, he will not be in the courtroom. The jury will not see him when they delivered this verdict. And he has been in this courtroom for most of this trial. So really significant moment in this case that he has spent so much time through, but he is not actually going to be in the courtroom when this verdict is read. So we won't see an initial reaction from him. We may hear from his lawyers afterwards and we may even hear from Carroll afterwards that she has already received an award from the previous jury of $5 million, but now, they're asking for a significantly more money they say Donald Trump will not stop making these defamatory statements.

And as the name suggests, punitive damages are intended to punish, to deter, to send a message to somebody who's done wrong. And to me, I'm really looking at that one because what matters here to Donald Trump, of course, is the amount of money he doesn't like to part with money. Nobody does. But the punitive damages is where we really look and see is there a message sent? Is this jury saying we reject your conduct? We find it reprehensible. What perhaps not.

This has been their standard practice and something that he has done repeatedly and he has continued to post about her even after he is in a trial for defamation. He -- it's almost as though he can't help himself. He feels very fixated on it, which is part of why you saw him take the stand. Part of his defense and what his lawyer said was that he felt like he was defending himself. That is also something that he said to a lot of his allies that he needed to defend himself in this case and part of those also spin on the fact that he has continued to lash out at her on social media, despite the fact he has been warned not to.

The first one you might -- you might remember, a jury found that Donald Trump did sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll at a Bergdorf Goodman's dressing room in the 1990s. They did find that previously and ordered him to pay $5 million for defaming her post-presidency. This trial was about defaming -- his defaming of her while he was president in 2019. And the jury he has just awarded E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million.So Donald Trump is now pending an appeal ordered to pay her, I guess at $88.3 million if you add the $5 million that I assume he hasn't paid her yet. Let's bring in CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, before this trial I am one of the lucky few that actually has Truth Social, Donald Trumps social media website that he founded back before Elon Musk took over Twitter and if you've just scroll through his feed, it is just its a direct tap into his brain, his id, and its just post after post after post attacking E. Jean Carroll, attacking the judge, attacking the case. This is before the verdict. So how is he going to react now? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST, \"THE SOURCE\":  Jake, I'm told by a person familiar that Trump just boarded his plane here in New York, he had actually left the courtroom before this verdict came down. He is not in the room -- was not in the room. His attorneys were, but he was not in the room, as this was being read. And I will tell you I would not want to be on that plane with him right now as he is finding out that this jury has decided he owes E. Jean Carroll, in addition to the $5 million that you already mentioned, another $83 million in damages here, Jake, because one sore point for him throughout this entire trial that you could see play out in something that the judge was pushing back against a lot was the fact that he didn't show up to the initial trial, which he says he did on the advice of a previous attorney, one who's no longer on his team anymore. I should note and that was something they kept trying to bring up here. And the judge was saying, were not deciding here if you if you sexually abused her. That is something that a jury already found you liable for. This is just about how much you owe. And obviously, there were questions of what they're not the tactics that they were using inside the courtroom. Were going to reduce what he would owe and what he would have to pay in the end. The argument that E. Jean Carroll's attorney was making was that this is a really wealthy person in that way too kind of send a message to him is to choose really high damages, which of course the jury has delivered on here. But, Jake, after covering Trump for as long as I have, what I think of when I look at that $83,000,000 number, is this is a man who does have a lot of money. He does not like to part ways with that money and he doesn't do so very easily. So the idea that E. Jean Carroll, something that has gotten under his skin, ever since he was in office until his post-presidency throughout these many trials that he is going to owe her $83 is not going to go over well with him.",

That's what these damages are coming from.Obviously, as they played E. Jean Carroll's attorneys played in the courtroom as this trial was going on, the moment from the CNN town hall just back in May, where they were arguing that he defamed her again, where he continued to lash out and speak out against her.

Does this $83 million number mean that to him? I don't know. I mean, it's -- I think it's hard for people to imagine. He'll stop talking about this and stop with the denials.

That is a message. That's a message to a person who essentially the jury say, we don't think you can be deterred for anything less than this massive amount of money. Now, yes, Donald Trump absolutely has the right to appeal both this verdict and the prior verdict. He will appeal them. I do think one potential complication is how do we reconcile these verdicts? Because the verdict and the first case which covered the actual sexual assault itself, plus defamation made after Donald Trump was president, that was for $5 million. And now, we have a verdict for only defamation that's many, many times that. So I think when Donald Trump goes up on appeal, he will say you can't reconcile these. The more serious conduct had a far lower verdict. But I think the response that you'll hear from E. Jean Carroll's team is yes, but so much of the second verdict is punitive damages. It's intended to deter him and all of his bad conduct up to and through and during the trial is what played into that figure.",
