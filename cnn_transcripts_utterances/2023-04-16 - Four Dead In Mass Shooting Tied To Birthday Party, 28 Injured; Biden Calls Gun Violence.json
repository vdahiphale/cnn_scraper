A news briefing last hour provided us with some new information. Four people are confirmed dead. Law enforcement caution, though, that's 28 people were injured, some critically. At least 15 teenagers were shot, we're told, and several, as I just said a few moments ago, they are in critical condition. The attack took place at a 16th birthday party in this community of 3,000 people. The heartbreak of this small town on full display this evening at a vigil that just got underway within the last hour. You're looking at some pictures that have just recently come into us here at CNN, and we now know one of the people killed, the older brother of the girl celebrating her birthday, Philstavious Dowdell. There he is right there, smiling. He was days away from graduating and going to Jacksonville State University on a football scholarship. CNN's Isabel Rosales joins us now from Dadeville. Isabel, let's start with the suspect. Is there one? I know that police just had that press conference about an hour ago. It sounds as though they're just not saying a whole lot about a suspect at this point.",

So now access is being allowed back onto this road. We're seeing people curious about the situation going up to that dance studio where this shooting happened at a Sweet 16th birthday party.We did here in the last hour from Sergeant Jeremy Burkett of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. And yes, we frankly did not hear any details about the shooter. They have been claiming, ALEA, these law enforcement officers, they've been claiming that there is no public safety concern, but they have not answered any questions regarding the status of the shooter. What we did find out in this press conference is that the death toll remains at four people killed and for the first time they have put a number to the amount of people that have been injured, and that is 28 people, 15 of which we know from our reporting earlier in the day are teenagers, five of which at least are critical. Right now we know from law enforcement that they are busy at work trying to piece this together. They're speaking with witnesses. They're trying to gather those details, calling this a fluid situation, but saying that they are not in a rush, that this is a methodical process to ensuring justice. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SGT. JEREMY BURKETT, ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY: We've got to have information from the community. So if you are at home right now or you know somebody that has any information about what occurred last night, I cannot stress this enough, every how mad you think it is, we absolutely need you to share it.

Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising, not declining.\" He added, \"This is outrageous and unacceptable. Americans agree and want lawmakers to act on commonsense gun safety reforms.\" The president urged lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to come together to pass things like an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. But the political reality up on Capitol Hill is that the votes just simply are not there to get that passed and there hasn't been much talk about gun reform measures to be enacted in the wake of those wave of mass shootings that we've seen over the past few weeks.",

Instead it's an issue that pertains to mental health.But the president did go on to praise in this statement at least one Republican and that is the governor of Tennessee, Bill Lee, who recently signed an executive order strengthening background checks in the state in the wake of that devastating shooting at the Covenant School just a few weeks ago, but the president and many Republicans still appear to be on completely different ends of the spectrum when it comes to gun reform.

And it's important for Republicans who support the Second Amendment to go to this venue and have these conversations. And look, they're not only talking about Second Amendment rights. They're talking about ways that they can prevent gun violence as well. They're talking about -- many of them, many of these candidates would support red flag laws, which would go a long way to preventing violence.

On top of that, too, there are criminals that prey upon these migrantgroups and that can lead to murder, allegations even of sexual assault, robbery, extortion, as well as a lot of hazards there that we heard from migrants that they encountered very regularly indeed, and witnessed at times, ourselves as well coming across a site where certainly three bodies appear to be the victims of violent death in the past months or so, and other bodies being left along one of the older routes as well, possibly dying from the sheer exertion of being on the trek itself. It's exceptionally hard, Jim, to undertake this over the five days in which thousands of people appear to every day begin this particular route. If we did the basic math of this sort of 800 or so who left with our group, the hundreds of others who joined from other routes along the way, there can be as many as 6,000 people in the jungle at a time on every given day.

Now, US Customs and Border Protection says that that CBP One App is working as intended, and despite the complaints from migrants, that it has been used by tens of thousands of migrants to get appointments to come into the United States. Now, Jim, I have to point out, from reporting from both sides of the border, what is very clear is that the net effect of these policies, what they look like on the ground is a valve. In essence, it's a valve that allows the Federal government to regulate the flow of migration.

Last year, Jim, the Biden administration asked for historic sums of money for more personnel and for more support for communities like mine. Republicans in the Senate negotiated those numbers down. And in the House, many of our Republican colleagues voted against that funding.
