I think in the speech next week what the president needs to do is, this is the perfect opportunity to remind us what this is all about. I think you can, you know, use this as a teaching moment. What's happening in the conflict? What is he doing actually to try to resolve the conflict and to bring hostages home? What is he also doing to try to have peace in the Middle East, to have a two-state solution, but also to remind us, the Holocaust is a remembrance of what happens when hate and violence go too  -- far too far, and that that is a broader goal of the United States and, frankly, you know, the human condition that we can never let that happen again. And that's, you know, as he said, racism is not an American value. It's un-American.",

The problem is, that's been going on for months. He's now trying to clean it up because politically it's looking bad for him and Americans are saying enough is enough. So, he has a moment on Tuesday, but he's going to - it's going to be difficult to erase what he's been doing and what his administration's been doing for the last several months.",

Now, this is about a payment to 1998 Playboy Playmate of the Year Karen McDougal. Cohen also recorded a discussion with Keith Davidson, who represented Stormy Daniels in 2016.

Again, those were done by Michael Cohen sometimes in secret and many of them were played for jurors, not only on the prosecution's side, but the defense was also playing some for their benefit as well.But let's start with the one that you just mentioned there. The one between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. Remember, prosecutors are trying to explain to jurors how Trump knew about these payments that were being made to these woman on his behalf.

And also, remember, Donald Trump, just last week, was saying, I want to testify, and he knew he had a gag order then. And so I think what's going on here is more of, it's a good messaging tactic for Donald Trump. We've clearly seen him use the gag order to energize his supporters, rally his base and attack the judge in this case overall for what he's saying is violating his First Amendment right.Of course, the gag order is actually pretty limited when you talk to legal experts, when I've spoken with lawyers, they say, look, he's actually allowed to talk about a lot. He can go after the judge, which he's been doing. He did that on Wednesday when he was traveling to Michigan and Wisconsin. He can go after DA Alvin Bragg. He can talk about the case more generally. He just cannot talk about witnesses and jurors. And I'm told, I know from Donald Trump's point of view, the thing that's really upsetting him about the gag order is that he can't attack people like Michael Cohen. And that's really where a lot of this comes down to as well. Now, I do also just want to give you a preview of what Donald Trump is going to be doing when he leaves the courtroom today and where he's going this weekend. He's going to be trading the courtroom in New York for banquet halls in south Florida. He's going to be headlining and be the main attraction at the RNC's retreat in Florida this weekend, in Palm Beach. And I think very notable there's going to be a lot of potential vice presidential contenders who are attending as well. People like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Elise Stefanik, the House conference chair, the House Republican conference chair, I should say, Byron Donalds, a lot of these people who - Doug Burgum, North Dakota governor, a lot of these people who Donald Trump has been saying privately that he might want to choose for his potential vice presidential pick. Of course, he doesn't have any plans to announce that until later this year, closer to summer I'm told. But there's going to be a lot of interesting people in the room. I think we'll be getting a lot of reporting out of it. And Donald Trump, I think, very much wants to be surrounded by his supporters, the people who will be boosting him, boosting his ego. We know that he has really been unhappy attending this trial. I think the novelty of it wore off for him very early on. And so he'll be getting some of that praise and be surrounded by his supporters this weekend in Florida. John.",
