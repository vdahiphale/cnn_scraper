Women to put out the bare minimum statement and acknowledging, acknowledging that there are these allegations and condemningHamas speaks volumes to the silence that Israeli women, that Israeli investigators, that experts in women's rights that have been affiliated with women's groups at the U.N. feel that they've been silenced and that they have been ignored. And this speaks to the larger issue of why. And the use of rape as a weapon of war and all of the evidence leading up to this suggesting that it wasn't a one-off by a terrorist here or there. The evidence that they have gathered, this expert told me, suggests that this was premeditated. And that is a crime against humanity. And so that is what they are trying to pursue. It is difficult to listen to these testimonies. It is heartbreaking. But now, as we've seen in Jake's piece, as we've seen in a lot of other reporting, thanks to the launch of Jake's piece here at CNN, how much more do we need to listen to? I'm sorry that these victims are no longer, many of them, alive because they were murdered by terrorists. But there is a lengthy list of evidence now that's been accumulated, that's been documented around the world. And the question is, will these communities who say that our purpose is to defend women's rights no matter where they are, no matter who they are, no matter what religion they are, will they step up now? Because this is not only a shame for Israeli women, it really represents women around the world. And it could set a dangerous precedent.",

It's not just condemning sexual violence against women and in any war in general. It's specifically what occurred on October 7th perpetrated by Hamas.SARAH HENDRIKS, DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, U.N.

This is the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, him hosting this event with Hillary Clinton, Senator Gillibrand and Sheryl Sandberg and others. So, we shouldn't give the U.N. credit here. You know, they were the site of this event, but they did not host the event.Second of all, it was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that first got rape as a weapon of war recognized. And this is -- had to do with the conflict in Yugoslavia, the conflict in the - in Congo, the conflict in Rwanda. And nobody had to take a position on the politics of those conflicts. Nobody had to side with the Kroats (ph) or the Serbs or the Houthis or the - I mean nobody had -- you didn't have to take a position and to the conflict to condemn rape as a weapon of war. And I think one of the things going on here, and there are certainly other things going on here, but one of the things going on here is I think that there are people who feel that to condemn what Hamas did is to side with Benjamin Netanyahu, and it's not. It is to side with humanity. You don't have to agree with what the IDF is doing in Gaza to condemn Hamas raping women and girls on October 7th.
