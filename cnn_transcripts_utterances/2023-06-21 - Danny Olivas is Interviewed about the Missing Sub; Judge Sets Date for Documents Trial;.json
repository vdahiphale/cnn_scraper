      "sentences": "After an internal government memo said that banging noises were heard at 30 minute intervals on Tuesday. And as search crews continue their work, we're getting a better understanding of the expedition that was supposed to take place.According to those who have done this exact dive before, the Titan normally descends for about two hours before it reaches the Titanic shipwreck. Now, that's a depth of 12,672 feet, or about two and a half miles down. The vessel then stays there for about four hours to give those onboard time to survey the shipwreck. Then it's another two hours back up to the surface to complete the trip, but clearly something went wrong on this most recent expedition. According to the Coast Guard, the Titan dove, as it normally would, but one hour forty-five minutes in contact was lost. We don't know exactly how far down or what happened after that moment. Let's bring in now Danny Olivas. He's a retired astronaut and expert accident investigator who has done two stays on NASA's Aquarius Underwater Habitat and trained on underwater spacewalks. Danny, thank you for being with us. Let me start with, of course, the biggest news of the morning, the banging that's been heard. It's been picked up by Canadian planes. Happening every 30 minutes. What's your take on that? JOHN \"DANNY\" OLIVAS, RETIRED ASTRONAUT: Well, it's, obviously - it's a very optimistic sign. You take every little bit that you can at this stage of the game with the oxygen supply running low and the fact that the vessels has been down for as long as it's been. Certainly any - any signs of hope are - are very positive signs right now. But I think we also have to be very realistic with the - the seriousness of the situation.",

So, if they've lost the ability to generate their own light in the vessel, it would be very dark. If they lost the ability to generate light, it's possible because they've had some power issues and their inability to communicate. It would also mean that they might have an inability to generate the necessary heat. It's going to be very cold at those depths as well. There's not a lot of ambient heat coming from the surrounding environment.The air circulating inside the cabin would be probably still -- there probably wouldn't be any cabin air circulation, which could also pose a lot of, you know, potential hazards with just breathing the air. The oxygen is important, but also CO2 generation by five people in a small, confined vessel is going to be very challenging and potentially creating a poisonous environment for the crewmembers.",

So, there is this date on the calendar now set by Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida for essentially the back half of August. That is when the trial is set now. And now there will be some discussions about that. That is very likely. It's very expected and it's what typically happens in this part of the federal court in the southern district of Florida. Both sides get to go to her and potentially ask to delay things if they need to. And she even said that in her order yesterday. If there are complicated issues that arise in this case, or if there are issues - if there are issues around the classified material being used in the case, there's 31 documents, many of them have some sort of classification markings on them that are charged as part of this case. And so there may be very complicated discussions that have to be had before trial about how much classified information can be used at that trial, how that will be handled.So, that could derail things. And it's very likely that that trial date will change. But, of course, the Justice Department wants this to move fast. The special counsel said that the day of the indictment that they wanted to speedy trial. And it is a defendant's rights to have a trial that happens fast so that they can clear their name without being under a cloud of scrutiny for too long. And so we will just have to wait and see exactly how this plays out, Victor. There is no predicting court, especially when it comes to timelines.",

This report goes on to write, quote, the group flew on one of the lodge's bush planes to a waterfall in Katmai National Park, which bears - where bears snatch salmon from the water with heir teeth. At night, the lodge's chefs served multicourse meals of Alaskan king crab legs or Kobe filet. On the last evening, a member of Alito's group bragged that the wine they were drinking cost $1,000 a bottle, one of the lodge's fishing guides told \"ProPublica.\"Hours before that piece was published, Alito wrote a prebuttal in \"The Wall Street Journal\" saying the charges against him don't hold water. Joining us now one of the reporters who broke this story, \"ProPublica\" journalist Justin Elliott. Good morning, Justin. Thank you very much for being with us. There's a lot to get to. An di just want to understand from you first if you can explain if it's believable that Justice Alito and his clerks didn't know the singer connection to some of these big cases. I mean one of them is a 2014 case. One of Singer's funds, NML Capital versus Argentina. This had to do with sovereign wealth, et cetera, and sovereign debt that ultimately, you know, granted Singer over $2 billion. Is it believable that he really didn't know -- that Alito and his clerks didn't know Singer's connection to these cases? JUSTIN ELLIOTT, REPORTER, \"PROPUBLICA\": Yes, I mean, you know, it's hard to say what's in the justice' head, but what I can tell you is that Paul Singer's connection, you know, to this case was widely reported in mainstream media outlets. You know, you might remember, his hedge fund actually at one point tried to seize an Argentine navy ship. And this was an incident back in 2012 that, you know, was covered in \"The New York Times,\" \"The Wall Street Journal.\" It was - it was not a secret that this was Paul Singer's fund being sued by Argentina at the Supreme Court.",

He talked about why he had no obligation to recuse. But some of the things that he points out here, he writes that, what you describe these lavish evenings, he says that, well, these were family-style meals. They were rustic accommodations. Can you just paint a picture here of what the justice was enjoying here in Alaska?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, Singer -- Alito writes in his op-ed that his interactions with Paul Singer over the decades have been extremely limited. He describes them as no more than a handful of occasions, all of which consisted of brief and casual comments at events attended by large groups. On no occasion, writes Alito, have we discussed the activities of his business and we have never talked about any cases or issues before the court.Does that square with your reporting? ELLIOTT: Yes, you know, we talked to a series of ethics experts about when justices should recuse themselves. And what it came to -- down to in this case is the fact that Justice Alito accepted these private jet flights from Paul singer. And this is - this is not cheap. I mean a one-way private jet flight on the type of jet we're talking about here to Alaska could cost over $100,000 to charter the plane. Justice Alito did not pay for it. He did not reimburse Paul Singer. That's not in dispute. And so, you know, the experts we spoke to said that that will look - that's an expensive gift. And, you know, if -- if you were - if you were going up against somebody in court and you found out that the person on the other side had been flying around the judge on a private jet, the basic question is, can that judge be fair? That's the situation.",

Justice Alito is maintaining that the filing instructions did not require him to disclose it. But, you know, I'll note that as we say in the peace, we found examples of multiple other federal judges disclosing gifts of private jet flights at the time.",

But it does raise the question of whether these comments from President Biden will complicate and potentially upend some of the efforts that were made over the weekend to try to ease tensions with China.Now, it's worth noting that President Biden, as recently as Saturday, had actually talked about the Chinese spy balloon incident in similar terms, saying it was an embarrassment for China's leadership. But he went one step further last night when he compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictators. Now, this came in an off-camera fundraiser which tends to be a venue where we see the president speak a little bit more freely and candidly about various matters. So that is something that we had clearly seen take place in relation to his comments about China and this spy balloon incident. Now, China has already slammed the White House this morning, calling those comments absurd and irresponsible and accusing President Biden of engaging in political provocation. So, we will see whether over the course of the day, if the White House decides to issue any type of verification, any type of walk back.
