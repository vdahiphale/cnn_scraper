      "sentences": "Today on INSIDE POLITICS, switching it up. President-elect Trump has a new pick for attorney general, but his plan to overhaul the Justice Department remains the same. We've got all the latest news from Mar-a-Lago.Plus, on a knife's edge. With three House races still uncalled, the Republican majority could be one of the smallest ever, maybe just two seats. We'll look at the challenges ahead for House Speaker Mike Johnson and what it means for the Trump agenda. And I'll speak with Democratic governor, one of them who is praising Donald Trump's choice of Robert Kennedy Jr. to run Health and Human Services. Colorado's Jared Polis is here to explain what he sees in one of Trump's most controversial picks. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. Two weeks since winning back the White House, we learned something very important about Donald Trump yesterday. He does respond to political pressure and understands how to count votes. So instead of threatening senators who opposed Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Trump cast him aside and replaced him with someone no less loyal, but a bit less political. And when it comes to baggage, a lot less personal baggage, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, she's a long time Trump ally who was part of his legal team and his first impeachment and then helped spread his election fraud lies when he lost in 2020. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now, once again from Palm Beach. Kristen, what are you hearing from your sources?",

She represented him during that first impeachment. She also took over his Super PAC when there were issues there, so she has always stepped in at this moment. But again, I've heard from a number of Republicans who believe, while she might have some of the same beliefs as Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump, she's much more confirmable, because as you said, she doesn't have that baggage.",

I found myself having to do two jobs at one time, Charlie, and you got a front row seat to this. I had a fulltime job, explaining to senators that maybe a tweet I said about them was rash and not reflective of how I would serve as attorney general. And at the same time, I was having to build out the Department of Justice with the right human talent, the right policy infrastructure, and Pam Bondi's confirmation won't have some of the sharp edges that Manu would have.

Happy Friday to all who celebrate.Lauren, I want to start with you, because that Matt Gaetz clip is so telling the fact that he just openly admitted that in these meetings that you were following him around -- going to over the past few days.

They were trying to educate him about what this process was going to look like, all of the baggage that was going to come out.You heard John Cornyn say very publicly, there will be no secrets here. You also -- I had some reporting yesterday that in one of the meetings that a source was in, that a senator actually wanted to know, what do you think your whip count is? The team did not have an answer. Then the senator wanted to go member by member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to walk through what Matt Gaetz had been told by each of them. And at the end, the source told me there were at least five people who had given him some -- we believe in you. We're with you. Answer, but not a confirmed yes. We will vote for you.

It's interesting that that Matt Gaetz sort of went back to that the establishment is against me.When he had just laid out in the previous clip how -- there were all it was like a death of thousand cuts. He had said something or done something to anger, just about everybody who could be a potential ally in a tough fight. So, were the Ethics committee allegations, the things that were going to come out in this report a real problem for him, yes, but I agree. I think the reporting is very solid all around that was a lot more than just a handful of senators, just the -- you know, the four that would have blocked him from getting confirmed. There was a lot of senators, including, I hear senators who publicly were saying maybe nice things about Matt Gaetz, and a way to sort of say, we like the pick from Donald Trump. We have some questions. Those people were even some heart now. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is why I find it, like in this moment, can we really say that now the Senate is going to be a guardrail against the president-elect, right? Because we're talking about in Matt Gaetz, somebody who was one of the -- if not the most unpopular Republicans in Congress amongst his own party. So, the fact that this was blocked, it's tough to say at this point whether or not -- you know, whether the Senate now will actually, you know, establish sort of a check on the president.",

Everything is going to happen under oath.Are you and your family ready to do this? And I think that that is sort of a very clever way for Republican senators to thread that needle.

Look, this is -- this is Florida's time as I quote, Brian Ballard, who is -- was sort of a super lobbyist in the first Trump administration.I think he's going to be -- he's from Tallahassee. He's going to be a force to reckon with. You've got all the way from Susie Wiles, the incoming chief of staff. A lot of the senior staff in the White House, also from Susie Wiles' orbit in Florida, Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz in the national security advisory position, and Trump himself is a Florida man now, and it's through and through. You can see it from the way the transition is coming out of Mar-a- Lago. People talk about why-- we got to hear what Palm Beach has to say. I mean, this is a Florida administration.

If they make it that far, Matt Gaetz obviously didn't. We'll see if the others do. KANNO-YOUNGS: The fact that you only needed to just insert Pam Bondi.
