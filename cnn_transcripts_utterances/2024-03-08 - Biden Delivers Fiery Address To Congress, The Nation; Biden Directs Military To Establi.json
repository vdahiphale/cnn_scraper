They wanted to see him energetic and we got all of those things.Last night, we saw a repeat from last year where he kind of engaged with hecklers throughout the evening and that was really something Democrats wanted to see. This was a speech that really was geared toward motivating the Democratic base, reminding people that Biden is the best option for them as we move towards November and drawing that comparison with Trump. Of course, Republicans are always going to find something, something to criticize.

There has been blowback to that phrase.But his willingness to engage with Marjorie Taylor Greene, in some sense, Green actually handed him one of his most iconic moments of the night. It's something we're talking about now and people will be talking about moving forward. And again on this issue that has been so tricky for Democrats to navigate and to see the president not shy away from the issue of immigration and the border, not just let former President Trump take that issue as his marquee issue, but a see him actually go on offense and punt this back to Congress and say, look, we came up with a bipartisan border deal.

He quoted Trump on multiple occasions.You know, this was certainly -- this was a speech that was all about 2024 November election. And he even referenced specifically the 2024 November election in the context of reproductive rights. So there's certainly a political undertone here. And -- but Romney had a good point.

I felt it was really interesting that the very first thing the President Biden talked about was that freedom was at stake at home and abroad.

This is something that is really, really difficult for the president. And, of course, there is this interaction with Netanyahu that is on the American political clock right? I mean, if this war is still going, when we get to November 5th, here in the United States, there is a very real chance that that could very negatively impact President Biden's chances.

And that's what many on the left would like to see an America just stopped sending money to Israel whilst its carrying out the war in this way. So, you know, they would point to Biden saying actually he is fully these are just words really actually America is massively supporting this campaign and you wouldn't have, you know, this war in Gaza and the poverty and the famine there if America wasn't sending the money over to support the war because Israel would struggle to do on this level with that American support",
