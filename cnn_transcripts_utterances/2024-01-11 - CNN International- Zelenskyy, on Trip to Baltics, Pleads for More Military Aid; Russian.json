This was the second time we've seen him in the space of a week.But unlike yesterday, where we saw him protesting the conditions of his own detention, this was a case before the Supreme Court against the Russian Justice Ministry trying to overturn rules that affect all prisoners about the limits on religious text. So, he spoke for a significant amount of time. He's protesting that they -- he's complaining, essentially, that they're not adhering to existing rules, that he's been limited to one book where he should be allowed two. It actually turns out that he should potentially be allowed ten during the day. I think that's sort of relatively semantic. He's also saying that they discriminate against Muslims. So, anyone who wants the Koran is, you know, cracked down on harder than others. This is something that the representative for the Justice Ministry has denied, calling it political statements. And he's also, as you say, using this platform to really shed light on the conditions. Take a listen to one section where he talks about the reasons behind some of the choices of literature that the inmates face. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXEY NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): The punishment cell is often a very cold place. Do you know why people choose a newspaper there? To cover themselves. Because with a newspaper, I can tell you judges, it is a much warmer place to sleep, for example, than without one. And so, you need a newspaper so as to not freeze. So, you take a newspaper. Now you can't have your Koran. You are all clever, intelligent people on the Supreme Court. You understand that these measures are absurd. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is the point that he's been making, frankly, all along, but is really trying to step up now as we see that support has been wavering, fatigue setting in. That if Ukraine isn't able to defend itself, that he really believes that Putin won't stop there.And of course, this comes, obviously, after the massive increase in aerial attacks that we've seen over the turn of the year. You saw with Kharkiv, they're continuing these missile attacks. Kharkiv has been hit multiple times this week that air defenses are crucial. And this is something where Zelenskyy has admitted that he knows that there are perhaps not even enough available, even if there's the political will to provide them.
