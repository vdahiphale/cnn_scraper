That's the message this morning from President Biden, his first reaction to the tentative deal struck after the longest actors strike ever against Hollywood studios.The walkout lasted 118 days. It cost the economy thousands of jobs, billions of dollars, with 160,000 actors essentially forced to hit the pause button on their work on current projects. Here's more of the statement from President Biden just this morning. He also says: \"When both sides come to the table to negotiate in earnest, they can make businesses stronger.\" Here's what we know about the deal. Actors have locked in wage increases that have -- haven't been seen in 40 years, streaming compensation to a new level. A.I. is included in this deal, which has never been mentioned before in an actors deal. Let's talk much more about this. We're joined now by the president of SAG-AFTRA, Fran Drescher, who I'm sure you have slept none because of these long, hard-fought negotiations that have lasted so long. Thank you for joining us. How are -- how do you feel this morning? And, most importantly, what's the message that you have to your members? FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA:  Well, how I feel is great relief and happiness that we stood firm, we held our ground, and we got a historic and seminal contract at a point in history where it was necessary.

But the White House's National Security Council spokesman John Kirby saying moments ago that Israel will agree to implement four-hour pauses, humanitarian pauses, each day to ensure that humanitarian aid gets through. And this also seems to be linked to the effort to get civilians from Northern Gaza to be able to head to the south. We have watched, of course, over the last several days as Israel has established these four, sometimes five-hour corridors for civilians to head from Northern Gaza down to the south and not carrying out military activities in that area during that time span. What isn't clear to me yet, based off of what John Kirby is saying, is whether these four-hour pauses are -- extend to the entirety of the Gaza Strip, if they extend to certain specific areas. That, to me, is not quite clear at this moment, as I'm reading some of this information. But what is clear is that this is part of a broader effort by the United States to get Israel to pay closer attention to the humanitarian disaster that is unfolding inside of Gaza, to get Israel to pay closer attention to minimizing civilian casualties. And this is all a part of the kind of drumbeat of international pressure that has certainly been mounting on Israel to heed those warnings more seriously and, of course, pressure that the White House and that the president is facing from some in his own party to pay closer attention to the plight of civilians inside of Gaza. We have watched, of course, in recent days as the civilian -- as the death toll in Gaza of Palestinians has risen to over 10,000 people, of which 40 percent are children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health. And so we are watching as Israel is now being pressured to implement these humanitarian pauses. We will see also a question, John, of whether or not this is related to those negotiations that are unfolding in Qatar, because we know that there has been a push to have some of these humanitarian pauses in order to allow some of those mediations over the release of hostages to play out in a more significant way. So, whether all of these things are linked, whether this extends to the entirety of the Gaza Strip, to, me those remains questions here. And we will wait to see what the response is directly from the Israelis and if they confirm these pauses later today.",
