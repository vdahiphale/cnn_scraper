Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy will share center stage tomorrow night in Milwaukee. On either side of them, Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and Tim Scott will stand in the number five and six positions. And on the wings, Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum. Eight candidates total. Donald Trump, of course, is not among them. Instead, the GOP frontrunner pre-taped an interview with fired Fox News Anchor Tucker Carlson, which is expected to be released somewhere as Trump's Republican rivals spar for the spotlight on the conservative network. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is already in Milwaukee. Jeff, what are you seeing and hearing there?",

And you said right in center stage, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Can he prove that he is the true sort of heir apparent, if you will, or the second leading candidate? We will see tomorrow night that he is deep in debate preparation sessions, as are all of the other candidates. But when we talk to voters -- and we've been spending some time here in the suburbs of Milwaukee, of course, a key swing state -- they are interested in hearing from all of the candidates, and that underscores the fact that this is a new moment in this campaign. This is the opening bell, if you will, for the summer primary. So every candidate has an opportunity, and some have more risks than others. Dana?",

We've been losing a lot of winnable races because we're not attracting people beyond some of our own party members, and that's not good enough. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is really interesting because I think for much of DeSantis' campaign, thus far, he's actually been playing to the right of Trump. And I've heard some Republicans in Congress and others that have actually privately wished that he would kind of stay away from the culture wars and actually focus criticism on the Biden administration or the economy, maybe earlier to win over some of those independents. You talked to many people following this race, and they would actually say that DeSantis has seemed to keep the focus on trying to galvanize Trump voters in Trump space rather than just independents and maybe voters in the suburbs.",

Well, I'll tell you something. If you want to know what a failure that strategy is, talk to me or Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR: He's not wrong that most of these candidates are waiting for Donald Trump to falter and for something to happen where he is not in the race. They are hoping that they can slide by and be next in line to be that heir apparent to him. But every single Republican I have spoken to says that the stakes are highest for Ron DeSantis. He has had a floundering campaign, a very tough summer. He's had a reset. Donors have fled his campaign. His poll numbers have sagged. And so out of all the candidates, most of them, Tim Scott, Asa Hutchinson, others are trying to introduce themselves to voters to get more voters to know them.

And then I also want to bring in some reporting from Alayna Treene talking about the fact that members of the Trump team and surrogates, they're planning on traveling to Milwaukee and working on a resolution with the network as well as the RNC. This is according to two Trump advisers. They believe they're going to get credentials after Fox kicked them out of the spin room, saying if you're not going to have your candidate here, you have no reason to be inside the spin room at the debate.",

And I think on the Ron DeSantis point, the other question is which Ron DeSantis are we going to get? Because we've seen him take so many different strategies in the course of his campaign so far.

Republican strategist and pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson moderated that panel and she joins our conversation. Wow.

Do you realize if Biden had died in office because he's older and ailing, do you know who would be our president? Kamala Harris. I just realized that. And I was like, oh, my God.\"KANNO-YOUNGS: This is -- this comment reflects actually something that I would hear when I was reporting on Harris earlier this year. And we went around trying to assess if she would be involved in the strategy among Republicans trying to criticize the Biden administration. And they were saying that feeling right there is what factors into some of the criticism you're hearing now of a vote for Biden is a vote for Harris. You're hearing that message more and more from critics of the White House and critics of the Biden administration here. It's fascinating, and it seems like one factor in for this base here is also a little bit of if not Trump, then who and also, looking at the alternative. It actually reminds me of some of the comments that you've heard from Republicans who have wanted the former president to focus more on this administration rather than talking about or attacking judicial systems or talking about the previous election here. This also reminds us that there's some subtext, and maybe this is a reason why Republican candidates are not talking about the indictments too much because of these voters here. I think that's --",
