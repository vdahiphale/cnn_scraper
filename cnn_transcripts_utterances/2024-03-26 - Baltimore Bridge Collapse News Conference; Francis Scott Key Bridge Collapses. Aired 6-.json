      "sentences": "Twelve hours. You can expect to continue to see our air and maritime assets functioning out on the water and in the air above. We need to do damage assessment of - of the ship itself before we can board that ship. And we need to continue our subsurface search, which is including different types of sonar. We have side scan sonar. We have other sonar capabilities here. We have underwater UAVs that we're working with, and throughout the night we've also been working with infrared technology, both from the air and on the water surface.So, I'm going to wrap up here with just saying, this continues to be a search and rescue operation. It continues to be a very dynamic operation with multiple local state and federal resources involved. With that, I'm going to turn it over to our mayor, Mayor Brandon Scott. MAYOR BRANDON M. SCOTT (D), BALTIMORE: Thank you. Thank you, Chief. Everyone, this is an unthinkable tragedy. We have to, first and foremost, pray for all of those who are impacted, those families. Pray for our first responders and thank them, all of them, working together, city, state, local, to make sure that we are working through this tragedy. This is an ongoing, active research that we're having right now. We're going to continue, as you heard from Chief Wallace to - throughout as long as we have to be doing that, we will do it. But we have to be thinking about the families and people impacted. Folks who we have to try to find and save. This is what our focus should be on right now. We're going to continue to work in partnership with every part of government to do everything that we can to get us through the other side of this tragedy. And with that, I'll turn it over to County Executive Olsewski. JONNY OLSEWSKI JR., BALTIMORE COUNTY EXECUTIVE: Thank you, Mayor Scott. I think we all awoke this morning to an unspeakable tragedy. As the mayor indicated, we know that there will be families and individuals impacted by this, regardless of what happens the rest of the way out. So, I would just echo the mayor in lifting up prayers for those who are impacted, but also ask that our residents pay - pray for our first responders. You know, they have been on-scene since very early in the morning, not only conducting initial search and rescue operations, but planning for additional ones as the sun comes up. And, you know, the work that they do cannot be understated. And we - I want to just thank them for all that they are doing and - and will do in the hours and days ahead. We know that we have a long road ahead, not just in the search and rescue, but in the fallout following this. I think we appropriately have our attention on the search and rescue efforts currently. And just here, alongside our partners in the city, to say that they have our full support. Just as we want to thank our state partners for the resources they've offered up, as well as the federal partners who have already reached out. The mayor and I have talked to the governor. We've heard from the secretary of transportation. So, collectively, we thank everyone for their thoughts, their well-wishes. But again, this is a very active situation and we want to just thank the chief and our teams for all the great work they're doing. And with that I'll turn things back over to the chief.",

Those lights that we were showing you over the past couple hours, it does look like they are police boats, first responder boats that are in the water on this rescue operation trying to find those people. As you mentioned, sonar has picked up that there are cars in the water and they're trying to rescue people who could still be inside. And as we zoom in on the ship, take a look, Kasie, you can see chunks of the bridge, the Key Bridge that tumbled down toward the water, still on the deck of that shipping container. Pieces of the bridge mangled on top of the boat itself, on top of the ship itself. As they mentioned during the press conference, first responders, authorities have been in touch and the Coast Guard have been in touch, it sounds like, with the crew of the ship. We don't know the latest of everyone who was onboard. But, look, you may look at a river like this and say, OK, how significant is the rescue operation? As we pan to the right, this gives you a sense of how much of the bridge was lost. It was a huge chunk of it. From our vantage point it looks like the majority of the bridge is gone down into the water here. And so first responders, these rescuers, really have a lot of ground to cover. And as you can see there, that appears to be a Coast Guard helicopter also flying just over the water, perhaps looking for anyone who might be down in these intense waves. If you can't get a sense, it is not gentle conditions on the water this morning. It is freezing out here. The wind has been whipping all morning. So, certainly rescuers have their hands full and they're particularly concerned for the condition of anyone who could be in the water now hours into this operation. But, Kasie, you can see, I can count from my view maybe eight, ten boats that are part of this rescue operation. And that's just from what I can see, you know, at least a half-mile from the bridge. Look, they have both sides of the bridge locked down. The area shutdown to anyone who is not part of this rescue operation because you heard - you heard the urgency from both the mayor, as well as those agencies, that this is still very much an active scene and a rescue operation. That is the focus, trying to save people's lives. And that's what we're watching from this vantage point. But - but again, Kasie, as we're finally getting daylight, it is shocking to see these pieces of the Key Bridge broken apart and either in the water or sitting broken on top of that shipping container - or, yes, the vessel there.",

Underscoring again, official tells us, there's no indication of terrorism. Chief Wallace of the Baltimore City Police Department and not - not Baltimore County. I misspoke earlier. The Baltimore City Police Department telling us the efforts right now are on the search and rescue as they really are racing against time to try to get anyone impacted by this out of water that is so cold. Our Derek Van Dam told us that, you know, human survivability is only around three hours or so in water that is the temperature, the 48 degree temperature that we understand that water to be. Again, this unfolding at 1:27 a.m. We've been showing you the moment of impact. Now we're able to show you the - I mean the Baltimore mayor is absolutely right, this is - this is out of an action movie. Twisted metal on top of that ship as we see those - those rescue boats there. You know, I just - as someone who - with a lot of personal ties to Baltimore as well, I mean it's - it's just - my heart goes out to all of the families that are impacted and affected here. Let's get to our Kevin Liptak, who's at the White House, who I understand that the president of the United States actively monitoring this situation. Kevin, what can you tell us?",

What do you make of official being able to make that claim at this point, also knowing, of course, the FBI is on the scene and involved in this investigation?",

I mean they're basing that no doubt on the fact that there's a dearth of or an absence of intelligence or information that would point in that direction.Now, you know, you have to, of course, always caveat that with, we're at the very beginning stages of this effort as the officials there in the press conference indicated. You know, 99 percent of their focus right now, if not 100 percent, is on rescue and recovery, like identifying victims and pulling as many of those folks out of the water as quickly as they possibly can. So, you don't really know where things are going to go after - after we get through this phase and they make more substantial contact with the individuals on the vessel and they're actually able to sit down and start asking some questions about how this whole thing happened. You know, as we've said - as we've discussed earlier this morning, Kasie, it's, you know, entirely more likely that there are mechanical failures or mistakes, incompetence, failure of training, things like that, human error, that were behind this. Those - those chances are all far more likely than intentionality, some sort of sabotage or terrorism. And I think it's good that we're hearing from officials that they're considering that, but at this point they have no indication that that's the case here. I'm sure if we asked them the follow-up question, they would probably also say they have a - they have a long way to go before they have a solid understanding of exactly what led to this horrible event.",

You want someone to be able to navigate and help these ships that are coming from around the world through tighter areas, under bridges. So, I'm waiting - so, in the press conference they said that - that there - that there was such an individual on board. Not at all surprising that no one from the ship has been interviewed or contact yet. Even though we don't think anything nefarious was done, there's going to be an investigation, even a civil one, just given the damage that was done, so everyone is being cautious about what they say without lawyers.
