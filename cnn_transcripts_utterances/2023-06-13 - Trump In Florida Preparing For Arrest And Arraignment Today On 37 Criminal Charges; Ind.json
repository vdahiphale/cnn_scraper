      "sentences": "But now, we'll have a process that tests those charges. That answers those questions. Myself, as a longtime defense lawyer, I would demand discovery now. I know they'll do that. They're going to be looking for anything that's wrong.There's an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct that a prosecutor raised a possible judgeship for a lawyer, for a witness. That is under review in the District of Columbia federal court. That is going to be an issue here. We will see the search warrant attacked, was this an overbroad search? Can the key evidence of Trump's lawyer, Evan Corcoran still employed by Trump, devastating use of his notes over 50 pages -- dictated notes in the indictment? Can that be excluded by Judge Cannon, who will see this -- who will have this case? So, now your question is going to be tested and that is the way it should be in our rule of law system.",

You haven't seen any legal challenges to anything that appears in it.And to the point that Norm's making all of these are subject to being attacked over the course of the next several weeks. That's not saying that the whole case falls apart. But he's kind of right to the extent that yes, it is a one-sided argument because that's kind of what an indictment is.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to our special live coverage. Just hours from now, we expect former President Trump to walk into that Miami federal courthouse and enter a plea to the 37 criminal charges -- felony charges filed against him, which alleged Trump mishandled highly classified documents brought to his Mar-a-Lago resort and engaged in a conspiracy -- a conspiracy to obstruct justice. That one charge alone carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.It is the first time in U.S. history that a former president has faced federal charges. And we just got new details on the booking process that's about to take place. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is joining us from Miami. Kaitlan?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, it's going to look pretty similar to what would happen if an average person who is going through in facing federal charges, and they showed up at a courthouse like the Wilkie D. Ferguson Jr. courthouse here behind me, that is where former President Trump is going to be just in a matter of hours. We are told that he'll come in.His booking process will look pretty much like what you would expect. He'll be asked to fill out forms with his name, his address, his social security number on it, Wolf. He will be fingerprinted not with ink, but it will be a digital fingerprinting that they do nowadays. Of course, that's pretty in keeping with how they do in most courthouses, that will happen. He is not going to be handcuffed though. I think that's important to know. We talked about a lot of the logistics of what this looked like. The last time he was indicted and had that arraignment in New York, we are told he will not be restrained in any kind of way when he is in this courthouse here behind me. One question that is still up for debate, according to reporting from our colleague Hannah Rabinowitz is whether or not that booking process is going to happen before or after he's actually in the courtroom actually having that arraignment. And so that is the new detail we are learning, Wolf, that he will be filling out paperwork. He will be fingerprinted. He will not be handcuffed when he is in that courthouse behind me. And the other thing, of course that we now know, Wolf, is that the attorneys who are going to be there alongside him have now formally entered their filings that they will be the two attorneys with him today. That's Todd Blanche and Chris Kise. Those are the two attorneys as he's still trying to finalize his legal team. Wolf, one thing I will note is we have been outside this courthouse for several hours now, and I know you've been hearing from our colleague Shimon is we're seeing a bit of a growing crowd of the former president's supporters out in front of this courthouse. It's not clear that he'll actually see them as he goes in because we're not clear that we'll actually see Trump as he walks in. But obviously, they are keeping an eye on what the security outside this courthouse looks like. And, of course, still several hours to go before Trump actually shows up here to this courthouse.",

Trump is hosting what's their billing as the first major fundraising event of his presidential campaign.Our Kristen Holmes is live near Bedminster. So, Kristen, of course, the president -- the former president will you know be arrested, enter his plea, and then immediately fly back to where you are for this event where I -- what do you know? I mean, is it going to be - you know, let all the cameras in? Is he going to give a big manifesto? Is it a closed door? What are the details?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, we have two separate events tonight, but there's fundraisers -- those donors will be a part of both. You mentioned that fundraiser. There's the high dollar fundraisers.We're told it's a small, intimate event that's going to be off-camera. However, those donors will be in the room when Trump delivers his remarks, which will be on camera. And the real question here is how exactly he is going to respond. Is he going to continue with this messaging of election interference saying that this is political? And it's likely so because we got a preview of those remarks when we saw him speak in Georgia, when we saw him speak in North Carolina. We know that despite the fact that he is focusing on 2024, that these legal issues are consuming him. So, we expect to hear a lot of that. Now, again, in the room other than those donors are going to be supporters and club members. Something to watch because as you know, with all of these events that are held with these Trump properties, he ends up getting somewhat of a hero's welcome when he ends -- when he -- after with these big days where he's arraigned whether it was in Manhattan, he went back to Mar- a-Lago or in Bedminster the night after he was indicted. They were so -- he was seen out on the patio DJ. He surrounds himself by people -- with people who support him a hundred percent. That is what we're hearing from some of the donors who are going to be here. they say that they're going to support him no matter what. So, likely to see a sympathetic crowd and someone that he -- crowd that he can really work off of with that energy he has.",
