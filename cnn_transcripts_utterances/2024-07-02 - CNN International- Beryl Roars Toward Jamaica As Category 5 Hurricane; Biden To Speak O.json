      "sentences": "Welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Omar Jimenez in New York.Just ahead on CNN Newsroom, destruction in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricane Beryl, the storm intensifying and heading toward Jamaica. CNN has a team of reporters across the extreme weather lines today. Plus, fresh protests have led to new clashes in Kenya's capital. We're live in Nairobi with the latest. And reshaping U.S. President Joe Biden's image, how his team is trying to reassure Democrats, voters, donors and world leaders? We begin this hour with Hurricane Beryl. It's the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and Jamaica is bracing for impact. Beryl continues to pick up steam rapidly at this point with maximum sustained winds of 165 miles per hour. That's more than 265 kilometers per hour. And the storm has already wreaked havoc in the Windward Islands. At least three people have died with the storm leaving behind what one official described as a path of immense destruction, pain and suffering. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are likely to see heavy rainfall, storm surge, and dangerously high winds today, and Beryl is expected to hit Jamaica on Wednesday. Now, in the U.S., President Joe Biden will be briefed by federal officials today on the extreme weather forecasts and the severe impacts of climate change overall. The President is also expected to propose new standards designed to protect U.S. workers from the dangerous heat. More than 60 million people are under heat alerts across parts of the South Central U.S. and the West. Extreme heat is expected from the Florida Panhandle to Texas, and even north to Kansas. So, CNN has a team of reporters across all the latest weather and climate developments today. But first, I want to go to Patrick Oppmann, as you can see on the map, who is tracking the storm down in Havana for us. So, tell us about the damage that we've already seen from Hurricane Beryl.",

And for the people in the Windward Islands, who on Saturday were looking at a tropical storm and then on Sunday were looking at a major hurricane, a Category 4 hurricane that then developed into Category 5 hurricane, there simply wasn't enough time to prepare.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OPPMANN (voice-over): With wind speeds of 150 miles per hour, Hurricane Beryl makes landfall in the Windward Islands. The storm closed schools, businesses and airports across the islands of Grenada, Barbados and St. Lucia. As Beryl rapidly intensified, officials urged residents to seek shelter immediately. VOICE OF RALPH GONSALVES, PRIME MINISTER, ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: You have to be off the road. You must be off the road. There are instructions to the police to enforce this. You have to take care of yourself. You have to look out for your neighbors and your friends and your families. OPPMANN (voice-over): The hurricane knocked out power in about 95 percent of Grenada. In Barbados, over 400 people were evacuated and housed in hurricane shelters. The nation's chief shelter warden said some people only had hours to prepare, and lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores.",

So, of course, the potential there for even more pain and suffering, and the greater worry, of course, is there are more storms on the way. It is early in hurricane season, months more to go to hurricane season. Beryl looks like a storm that you would see sort of in August or September into the height of hurricane season, not typically what you would see this early on. And so, forecasters have said it's going to be a record hurricane season. It already has been one with the formation of this very, very powerful storm so early. JIMENEZI want to get a larger look at this, and let's bring in Meteorologist Elisa Raffa, who can talk a little bit more about the storm's path, because where is this going next? And do we expect it to stay this strong?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. We are most worried about Jamaica. That's coming up next. And we just got an 11 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center. It is maintaining its Category 5 strength for right now. It still has 160 mile per hour winds gusting up to about 200 miles per hour. And it's booking at west and northwest at 22 miles per hour. But, it has come down a little bit. The wind speeds have come down a little bit and the pressure has gone up a little bit. So, some of the first signs that some of the dust in the wind shear things are trying to eat away at the intensity.But, we've had such intense storm already because it's rapidly intensified multiple times, because these ocean temperatures in the middle and upper 80s much more likely you would see at the peak of hurricane season early September. So, it's just incredible. It's had so much food and so much fuel. But again, as I mentioned, as it goes east, starting to find a little bit of dust, maybe a little bit of wind shear that can eat away at that intensity a little bit. We're still looking at it making a pass at Jamaica as a Category 5 or Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane warnings are in effect there. We could be looking at storm surge up to eight feet in spots. Hurricane watch is in effect for the Cayman Islands, and then it continues its way towards Mexico, as we get towards the weekend. Rain totals could be upwards of a foot in some locations of Jamaica, especially in those higher elevations, flash flooding, mudslides, a problem there with some of the mountainous terrain. Tropical storm force winds will hit parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, some new alerts there, again, worried about Hurricane 4's conditions in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Where it goes from here, it depends on how strong this high pressure that's causing the heat in the U.S., because whether it's stronger or weaker, we will determine if it nudges a little bit farther north towards Texas or a little bit farther south and stays in Mexico. So, that's something that we'll have to watch very closely. And you could see, within the next seven days, that's where we get kind of a spread and uncertainty in the forecast, something we'll be watching. Omar.",

It's manifesting in so many troubling ways around the globe, to draw really the most distinctive difference between him and his rival in this upcoming election. Biden and Trump differ on a lot of policies, but the chasm may be widest around climate in which Donald Trump really doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that the planet is overheating with disastrous results. The President will talk about creating -- also draw a distinction between Republican governments in Florida and Texas, which has actively stopped mandatory heat breaks for outdoor workers to get shade and water when the temperature reaches a certain point.Maybe there could be a new federal OSHA law (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) that would supersede any of that. And the state levels would say, there is already OSHA laws in place. Maybe this would beef them up. He is going to call for a White House Summit on extreme heat later this summer with leaders from Western and southwestern states, tribes as well, people who really suffer the heat most acutely this year, and also talk about adaptation, tree cover, millions of dollars for tree cover in urban heat islands or flood mitigation in places that are now suffering from water whiplash.

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, it is one bright spot that the Biden campaign is trying to point to, as they continue to grapple with the fallout from President Biden's debate performance last week. The campaign today announced that they raised $127 million in June, a big portion of that came around the debate and the four days after the debate. The campaign says they brought in $38 million and are ending the month with $240 million cash on hand. That cash on hand is important because it gives the campaign more money to buy advertisements, hire organizers and open offices.But, it does come at a time when there are questions about not just what President Biden's reelection bid will look like in the coming weeks, but also what that fundraising might look like. The Biden campaign, over the past few days, has been working the phones with anxious donors, trying to ease some of their concerns. Last night, the top campaign officials, including the campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, held a phone call with about 500 donors to hear out some of their concerns. They defended the President's health and said that his candidacy does remain on track. But, you are starting to hear not just from donors who are grumbling about what could happen if Biden remains in the race, but also there are Democrats up on Capitol Hill who have concerns today. Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois said that it's up to the President to decide whether he remains in this race. But, he raised the focus that some people have on the fact that it's not just going to impact Biden's reelection bid to stay in the race but also could impact those Democrats running in competitive House and Senate races. Now, this is something that Democrats are waiting to see polling on to see what the broader impact of this debate performance will be on Democrats across the tickets. But certainly, there are many questions for the Biden campaign going forward about what that path for President Biden looks like if he will remain at the top of the ticket. So far, advisors insist he has no plans to step down. And instead, what he is trying to do is point to things like the Trump immunity ruling to further his cause and making that argument that's been central to his campaign, that Trump presents a real threat to American democracy.",

The question is, whether he can effectively make the case against President -- former President Trump and have a reasonable chance of winning in November? Don't forget, the only reason this debate existed in June was because -- why would we debate in June? The reason is, because the Biden campaign recognized, as do many Democrats, that he is not on a trajectory that in all likelihood will put him back in the White House in four years.I mean, the Sunbelt swing states, the southeast, North Carolina and Georgia are virtually gone. Arizona and Nevada and the Southwest are not as gone, but are very uphill. And what he has got is essentially a 50:50 chance to pull an inside straight in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where he is probably trailing at least somewhat in all three. He was the one, Omar, who needed to shake up the trajectory and improve his position in the debate. Even if nothing deteriorated from the debate, which is hard to believe over time, that would still leave him with a losing hand. And so, like Democrats aren't saying, Joe, you did a bad job. They're saying, can he articulate the case against President Trump and give us our best chance of avoiding a second term for all of these groups, would be existential and catastrophic for all the values they hold?

They leave an area and then ultimately they return to it, many times with ground forces because Hamas re-emerges in those areas.And that, of course, points to the overall questions about Israel's long-term strategy in Gaza, particularly at a time when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been signaling that the current phase of fighting in Gaza is coming to an end, that the ground operation in Rafah is coming to an end, and that what will come next will be a more sustained kind of counterterrorism operations taking place in Gaza, but not the kind of all-out ground operations, all-out war that we have been witnessing for much of the last nine months. But again, without an alternative to Hamas in Gaza governing that space, many military analysts say that this game of Whack-A-Mole is going to continue on, of course, the suffering of civilians in Gaza will also continue along with it.

But, with every public appearance of President Biden in increased microscope, given the past debate, and now we're learning that some Democratic governors are seeking a meeting with the White House to discuss their concerns about President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the debate performance, sources tell CNN. How significant is that, especially within the realm of the fallout we have seen since the debate?",

      "sentences": "I think it's significant because it shows, and this is something I've been picking up in conversations with Democrats over the last few days, that there is a strong feeling that the White House and the Biden campaign specifically doesn't do enough listening to Democrats in some of these key swing states that Biden needs to win, if he is going to return to the White House. There is a feeling that the campaign is rather insular and that is not taking into account concerns that have been raised for a long time about the President standing in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Those three states, by the way, are absolutely vital for him to win, if he is going to win reelection.I don't think at this stage it's a sign that the governors want to speak to the President or the Vice President or people in the campaign, that there is necessarily an organized movement against the President in the wake of the debate. But, it is a clear sign that below a lot of these officials coming on TV over the weekend and defending the President and saying, OK, it was just one bad debate, there is a great deal of concern, not just about the debate, but now about the trajectory of the reelection campaign.",

And we've seen some Democratic congressmen tow that line, saying, Mike Quigley, for example, out of Illinois, saying I think Biden is a great President, but he needs to be honest with himself. And look, this is going to be his second time in less than 48 hours we've seen the President. How have the stakes of each public appearance now changed from maybe what they were a week ago?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. It's a good question. I think now, there is absolutely no room for any more slip-up from the President between now and the election. Every single public appearance will be scrutinized. The problem is this appearance, which is a scripted appearance. He'll read prepared remarks in a fairly controlled environment. The speech last night, the four-minute address to the nation about the Supreme Court's big judgment on Trump's immunity claims that was also a scripted piece of White House Theater.That's not going to assuage many of the doubts that a lot of Democrats have about the performance that the President put on that CNN debate in Atlanta, which is a much more spontaneous open event when he has to stand up to Trump who is fearful in his identification of an opponent's witnesses. So, it's going to need a lot more than White House events.",

The Trump Organization is working with a Saudi mega developer to build a luxury Trump Tower in Jeddah. Now, the announcement came just days after the Trump Organization unveiled a $500 million hotel property in Oman, set to open in 2028. Now, these new projects in the Middle East are raising concerns about a possible conflict of interest if Donald Trump is reelected as U.S. President.So, let's get more on this from CNN business Reporter Matt Egan in New York. So, Matt, what more do we know about this deal between the Trump Organization and the Saudis?",

[11The plan is to build this luxury Trump Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and the company is partnering with Dar Global, which is a London- listed subsidiary of a luxury Saudi developer. Now, terms of the project have not been disclosed. We don't know the price tag here, how many floors, exactly when construction is slated to begin or end. The two companies say that this would be aimed at international investors as well as the luxury Saudi market. Now, Eric Trump, one of the former President's sons, he praised this deal in a statement, saying that we're thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of living to the region. And as you noted, this comes just days after another deal in the Middle East by the Trump Organization. That's the plan for the Trump International Oman. This is a $500 million 5-star hotel complex. It will include a nightclub, a golf club, and it's set to open in late 2028. And Omar, as you mentioned, all of this comes just months before voters here in the United States are set to head to the polls to decide whether or not to return Donald Trump to the White House.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. That's right, Omar. I think at a minimum, we can say the optics here are not great. Remember, former President Trump, when he was in the White House, he had pretty cozy relations with the Saudis, certainly relative to President Biden. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has an investment firm that reportedly landed a $2 billion investment from the Saudi royal fund. And this has all raised some questions about conflicts of interest.I talked to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and they told me in a statement that the Trump Organization's continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns. Now, I reached out to the Trump campaign. They did not respond to a request for comment. Worth noting that Donald Trump does not run the day-to- day operations anymore of the Trump Organization. It's run by his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Jr. But, the Trump Organization is owned by a private trust and the ultimate beneficiary of that trust is Donald Trump. So, listen, I think, Omar, at the end of the day, all of this is another reminder of some of the awkward appearances that we could see if Trump is back in the White House, where he could be, on the one hand, negotiating deals in the Middle East, and on the other hand, building a Trump Tower in Saudi Arabia.",
