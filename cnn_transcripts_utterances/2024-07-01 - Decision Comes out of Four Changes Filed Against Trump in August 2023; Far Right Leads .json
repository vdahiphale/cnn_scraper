Next hour theSupreme Court is set to rule on a case that will not only have major consequences for Donald Trump's legal fate, but also for the future of the Office of the U.S. Presidency. At the same time, the man currently holding that office is under immense pressure. His family reportedly urging Joe Biden to stay the course in his reelection bid despite new polling.

And if the futures markets are any indication, things are looking better on the opening all arrows pointing higher on the futures markets. Right well, let's begin with what is an immense day in the United States. We are waiting for that huge Supreme Court ruling due next hour that could redefine the parameters and the power of the U.S. Presidency. The court is expected to resolve the question of whether Former President Donald Trump can claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. Now the stakes for that looming decision seemingly rose after President Joe Biden's debate performance on Thursday, which has a good number of political pundits calling for him to exit the presidential race though he still has the backing of party leaders it has to be said. We are going to talk about the debate fallout in a few minutes. First, I want to take a deep dive into what we may hear next hour from the U.S. Supreme Court with CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz and CNN Politics Senior Reporter Stephen Collinson.

Clearly, some of those arguments that were made by Trump's team, were a little bit absurd and go against everything that the Office of the Presidency has been understood to stand for in a country, which was born on the idea of resisting tyranny and unchecked executive power. I think this case is very interesting for a number of reasons. First, as Katelyn was saying, it gets directly to the issue of whether Trump will go on trial now or in the future for what happened in 2020. It is also the justices are drawing the parameters of a potential second Trump presidency. This is a potential president who believes that he has unlimited executive power, that kind of drawing the lines here about what Trump would understand about the office going forward. And I think that's very important. And it's an aspect of this case that hasn't had a lot of attention. And then we're talking about ages to come can a future president decide that he won an election that he clearly lost, and then seek to interfere in -- interfere in the process, and then escape any accountability?

The problem is Chris Coons and all these Democratic leaders are coming on television doing what they have to do because to do anything else would be seen as treachery. You cannot spin away what people saw with their own eyes. The idea that the president was just dumbfounded with shock about what Trump is saying, doesn't hold a lot of water. Considering he already stood on a debate stage with Donald Trump has been warning for four years that everything that Trump says is untrue, that is a massive threat to democracy. That image, I think is said on the minds of many American voters who were already by super majorities in polls, saying that they thought Trump -- thought Biden was too old to run for a second term against Donald Trump or anybody else. That is the real issue. So while there are talks going on behind the scenes among Democrats, I think at this level from what I'm hearing is its more bemoaning the plight of their party rather than thinking that anything serious is going to happen to change the equation.",

Voters turned out in huge numbers to participate in the high stakes election. Uncertainty has loomed ever since President Emmanuel Macron suddenly dissolved parliament and called for snap elections earlier this month, sending shockwaves across the country. Now his gamble appears to have backfired as the alliance of centrist parties faltered in the vote, finished in third place with just under 21 percent. In a statement, the president called for the formation of a broad alliance to block the National Rally from coming to power. Faced for the National Rally, the time has come for a broad clearly Democratic and Republican Rally for the second round. The coalition of left wing parties also had a strong showing coming in a close second at 28 percent.

Some of the higher elevations of some of these mountainous areas could see up to 10 inches of rain. So just incredible! It maintains the strength as it goes through some of the Caribbean Sea here. You've got hurricane warnings in effect. It will bring some impacts. You can see the tropical storm watch from Southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It continues its trek towards Mexico by the end of the week as it tracks across the Caribbean Sea. We're talking about ocean temperatures in the middle and upper 80s.

So there is a loss of popularity in the conservative camp. The reformist ended up leading, but although they brought out all the big guns and all the key characters in the reformers then, and pragmatics camp, they still couldn't get through the first round didn't have sufficient votes to get through the 50 percent threshold.",

And we know the ultra-right candidate Mr. Jalili has an ideological view about the world and was under his tenure that in the mid-2000s, Iran became a threat to international peace and security under U.N. Charter's chapter VII whereas Mr. Pezeshkian is surrounded by really the top -- of Iranian diplomats and very competent managers. So it will be very different. But what I argue is that it's a mistake to just count on the fear factor that a great silent majority in Iran will come to the polls out of fear of a Jalili presidency in the same way that we saw the far right and the French elections come to power despite the fear factor.

There have long been serious arguments about whether or not sitting presidents have immunity from prosecution. And the argument has always been pragmatic that a sitting president is so busy, so important, that indictment or trial would just be too distracting. But no one really disputed when this argument came up during the Nixon era that after somebody was President that they would be subject to prosecution. What you heard was just extremely worrying that a former president would never be prosecuted for assassination. So yes, I'm very worried about this. I think there really are no good arguments for former presidents having criminal immunity.",
