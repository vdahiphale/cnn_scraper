It's not the best equipment, often, not even second-best. KILEY (on camera): The Ukrainian military are keen to stress that they're really, really grateful for all and any help that they're given. These armored personnel carriers, from America, are better than some of what they started the war with. And they're an important part of the battlefield replacement. They've been here since the summer. This one already needs a new engine. KILEY (voice-over): Ukraine captures a lot of what it needs, from Russia. It's desperately cannibalizing ancient equipment, for parts, like a 20th-Century nation under siege, not a nation that's backed by America, and by NATO allies. Making do is what Ukraine has done. Privately, though, commanders here make it clear that it's going to take more than an iron will and hand- me-down weapons for them to win this war. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But they've been very anxious about it, worried about a nuclear threat, coming from Russia.

It had shut down - the heart was starting to shut down because it was being stressed by the lungs filling up. So, as far as the stroke symptoms that anyone would normally see, which is that the FAST, you see the acronym FAST, for face drooping, arm weakness, speech slurred, and then of course time being the most critical issue. But we didn't experience that because he was in a coma, at the time of his stroke, probably created from when he flat- lined. And they resuscitated him, and they believe that's when the clot was down that created the stroke. So, ours was the viral cardiomyopathy that started the walls start to tumble down.
