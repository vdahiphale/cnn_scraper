      "sentences": "Well, guys, the protests that we've just been showing pictures of have been going on now for the fourth night in a row, and they show no signs of calming down at the moment. Those pictures are quite dramatic when we've seen protesters firing fireworks at the police, but equally we've also seen the police acting in a very heavy-handed measure to try and quell any forms of dissent. There are videos circulating on social media of the police beating protesters. There are reports of opposition politicians being arrested as well. Now I've seen one video of a police officer kicking a protester in thehead. So the protests themselves and the standoff between the protesters and the police look set to continue. But as you were saying, Christina, the issue that kicked off these protests is the decision by the Georgian Dream, the government of Georgia, to suspend talks with the EU on Georgia's ascension to becoming a member of the bloc. Now, that is a very, very controversial decision for Georgians, because for a long time, Georgia and its Georgian people have maintained that they want to become a member, a fully integrated member of those Western institutions, including the EU, but also NATO as well. This will mark a major departure in that policy for Georgia, and what many people are saying in the U.S. and the EU is that this will take Russia -- will take Georgia down into a path more akin to its northern neighbor of Russia. So we've seen the protests continue out onto the streets and clashes with the police, but there is also now discussions and heated debate ongoing within the political realm as well. The president of Georgia is due to step down from her position, a ceremonial one, at the end of the year, but she has said she's not going anywhere now. She views these elections which took place in October as illegitimate, and the EU has called for fresh elections to be held within a year because they also saw them as being unfair. But the prime minister of Georgia, who does hold the power of the governing party together, has said she's got to go. There is no democratic way in which she is able to stay. So we will see how these protests unfold, but it's not something that is new to Georgia. Over the last few months, we've seen protests like this and clashes on the streets outside parliament over a variety of different laws that the Georgian Dream Party has tried to pass in Georgia, which included a foreign agents bill and a more restricted bill on LGBTQ+ rights as well. Both of those, Georgians say, look like they're coming less in line with the EU and more in line with a Kremlin-style authoritarian regime.",

The fact that the government has said openly now that they don't want to pursue that, or at least they want to pause it, is a big deal for Georgians. And they are manifesting their hate on the streets. I mean, it's somewhat symbolic, isn't it, Max, that these protests are taking place largely outside the seat of government as it's really becoming a clash now of an authoritarian regime against the democratic will of its people -- Max.",

Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A new dawn for Notre Dame Cathedral. More than five and a half years after a fire tore through parts of the Gothic structure in the heart of Paris. Sparkling stonework highlighting the stunning results of the estimated $737 million restoration as it was unveiled to France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. After the 2019 blaze, the president had vowed to rebuild Notre Dame even more beautiful than it was. Entering the cathedral with his wife, Brigitte, on Friday, it was clear that France had achieved just that. It was at the same time repaired, restored and re-baptized, Macron said. Millions had watched in shock and horror as Notre Dame's 96-meter spire tumbled into the church during the 2019 blaze. Now its renaissance is complete. Touring the epicenter of the blaze, the medieval roof structure known as the forest, Macron saw the beams rebuilt by hand from 1,200 oak trees from across France. Among the highlights of Macron's tour, a mural in the north enclosure of the choir that was badly damaged in the fire and the Virgin of Paris, a 14th-century statue that became a symbol of resistance when it was found standing resolute, surrounded by burnt wood and collapsed stone. And the beautiful Saint-Marcel's Chapel, one of 29 chapels that have been lovingly restored. Viewing the 12-meter-wide grand organ, Macron described it as sublime. More than 1,300 people involved in the restoration were invited inside as the French president wrapped up his final visit to the site before its formal reopening. You have transformed ashes into art, he told them. The whole planet was upset that day in April. The shock of the reopening will be as big as that of the fire, he said, thanking the crowds.",

Many centuries of crowds and worship and candles and smoke had meant that it was fairly dark inside, no longer. Now there is really a sense of light and an ability, therefore, to appreciate the majesty of Notre-Dame in a way that really wasn't possible before. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
