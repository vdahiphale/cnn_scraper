It shows the Buddhist monk kissing the boy on the lips and then asking the child to, quote, \"suck\" his tongue.Now this happened back in February at an event in India. And CNN's Vedika Sud is in New Delhi for us. What is the latest on this very disturbing incident?",

      "sentences": "Indeed, a disturbing incident, Abby. And there's been complete outrage in social media over the behavior and the interaction that the 14th Dalai Lama had with that minor boy in February.Now it's taken six weeks for the Dalai Lama to issue an apology, which came earlier today local time India, where he said he regretted the incident. I want to read a bit from that a statement where he's apologized because a few bits of it really stand out to me, and I'll tell you why. Firstly, he goes on to say that he \"wishes to apologize to the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused.\" The statement also reads, \"His holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras. He regrets the incident.\" Now if you go through that video, which I have already said has been extremely disturbing for people to watch, this is a young boy who goes up to the Dalai Lama and says, can I get a hug? But the Dalai Lama calls him onstage, invites him on stage and says, give me a hug and a kiss, and he takes a kiss from the boy on the cheek and a hug. Moments later, he asks for the boy to kiss him on the mouth, and the boy obliges, though reluctantly if you actually gauge his body language. And then seconds later, the Dalai Lama asks him to suck his tongue. Now if you again go back to the apology issued by the Dalai Lama, the two phrases, like I said, stand out for me. One is, \"for the hurt his words may have caused.\" Clearly more than the words, Abby. It's the action of the Dalai Lama that needs to be questioned. And it has been by critics across India. And secondly, where they talk about him, often teasing people he meets in an innocent and playful way. Clearly, it was more than that. And that's why people are so upset with the Tibetans spiritual leader, who has millions of followers from which there's so many who are currently upset with his behavior -- Abby?",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:42:44] PHILLIP: Last week, Republicans kicked two black Democrats out of the Tennessee state legislature. But those -- the targets of that historic political playback may have the last word. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were both stripped of their seats for taking part in the gun reform protest on the House floor. But the process to get them back in those seats is already underway. And for Jones, it could even happen as early as today. CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Nashville. So, Isabel, walk us through what could happen tonight for Justin Jones.",

We just got a hold of the agenda right here for the special meeting and you can see it's a single item right here, so it should be short and sweet. I do want to introduce Freddie O'Connell, a council member, District 19. He's going to walk us through a little bit of this procedure. Let's start with just the length of this meeting. FREDDIE O'CONNELL (D), TENNESSEE COUNCIL MEMBER: We are hoping it is extremely brief. There's really one thing to do here, that is to get Representative Jones nominated as an interim appointment now that he has been officially expelled. And then we have to certify the minutes of having done that. But there are some procedural steps we've got to take to get there.",

And we'd love to have him back there to be able to participate in the roll call and be seated again. One of the reasons that matters is they're still considering legislation.

My hope is that they will look at the will of voters, both in District 52 but also across the city and county, due the right thing.
