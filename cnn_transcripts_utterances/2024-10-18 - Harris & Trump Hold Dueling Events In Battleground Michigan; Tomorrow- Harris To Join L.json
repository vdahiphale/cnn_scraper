This hour, brand new details about the death of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader behind the horrific attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023 but what happens now? And what role will the United States play, if any?Plus, a group with links to Elon Musk is spending hundreds of 1000s of dollars on a divisive ad campaign trying to damage Vice President Kamala Harris with key groups of voters, but they're completely contradictory messages. Still, will they be effective? We're going to start this hour, however, in battleground Michigan, a state that could decide who wins the White House. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are campaigning in the Great Lakes State this hour, where voting already is underway. Data from the Michigan Secretary of State shows that more than 944,000, almost a million, mail-in ballots have already been cast in Michigan. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Waterford Township, covering the Harris campaign. Alayna Treene is in Detroit covering the Trump campaign. Priscilla, you're learning more about the Harris campaign's plans for more outreach to Republican voters in Michigan.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jake. I'm told by a source that the Harris campaign is planning for another joint event between Vice President Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney in the days to come. That could come in the form of, for example, a fireside chat or a town hall.Again, part of this broader strategy to try to peel off Republican voters from former President Donald Trump. That is some of what the campaign is also trying to achieve here in Michigan. The counties that the vice president is visiting today are all notable, for example, one of which voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, Biden won in 2020, the other two, Biden won by wider margins in 2020. Now the Harris campaign is trying to emulate that and build on it. Campaign officials tell me that where they see opportunity is white, college educated voters in the suburbs. So the vice president turning those voters today. But also importantly, union voters, and talking about manufacturing and labor and trying to draw the contrast there with former President Donald Trump. Earlier today she -- her message was essentially that the former president did not deliver on his promises when it comes to labor, and that the vice president would do so in pointing out the investments of the Biden administration. So certainly we're going to hear more of that here today. But another important part of this, Jake, as you were just mentioning is early voting. Michigan will have early voting in person for the first time in this presidential election starting tomorrow, and the vice president will be joined by some star power, including Lizzo, to do a get out the vote event. Now again, the campaign hoping that they can peel off those Republican voters also lock down the coalition and do all of that by capitalizing on the early voting in the state, try to get those folks to the polls earlier. So certainly, the campaign really doubling down on Michigan to fortify that blue wall looking ahead to Election Day. Jake.",

And it's a bit reminiscent, actually, of when he said that Milwaukee was a horrible city despite the Republican Party holding their convention in Milwaukee. He later came out and said, I love Milwaukee, so we'll see if he tries to do a similar type of cleanup here in Detroit this evening.But look, I cannot overstate enough how important Michigan is. The Trump campaign very much acknowledges that not only does it have 15 electoral votes, but when I talk to Donald Trump's senior advisers, they tell me that of all -- out of all the three blue wall states, of course, in addition to Michigan, that's Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they're the most confident about their chances in Michigan. That's why you've seen him aggressively campaign here in recent weeks. I'm told he'll be back to the state multiple times before November 5. Now, part of the reason that he's actually in Oakland County he's going to be in, obviously, it's a suburb of Detroit, is he's really trying to make inroads with key voters, and suburban voters, particularly suburban women, is one of those core demographics. So I think you'll see some of that messaging. And then when he's here later tonight, you hear a lot of him talking about the economy, talking about wanting to reinvigorate the U.S. auto industry. But I also think you can anticipate some of that dark rhetoric and more of his personal attacks on Harris that we've really heard him escalate in recent weeks. Jake.",

Ordinarily, by now with the black community, it's literally just a turnout operation, and in some ways it still can be, because black folks are going to outvote for Kamala Harris,you know, more than anybody else. Black people are going to be voting in our big majority. But there is still a persuasion operation for black voters. As you guys know, in campaigns, you have persuasion and you have turnout. Right now you should be in turnout mode for the black community and turnout mode for the Muslim community.You're still in persuasion mode for a lot of places. So, that is a struggle. At the same time, it's that connect, we know for sure Arab Muslim and black voters are going to vote in their big majority for Kamala Harris, but the number matters, and we're still trying to get to the right number in both Michigan and Pennsylvania.",

They've seen these numbers be very, very tight. But what they say that they're not seeing, which is giving some folks hope, is that they're not seeing Donald Trump move away from her. They're seeing them kind of stay neck and neck, and so that's giving folks on the campaign home. But they recognize that they really have to do more in these last week weeks, and maybe they've even done before that.I think what's really interesting, Jake, is that they're kind of attacking this on multiple fronts. First of all, they were really criticized in the first few months of her campaign, even though, of course, only been 100 days or so by the fact that they were being kind of mediaverse. Now you're seeing them adopt a kind of more Donald Trump throw anything at the wall and see what sticks, risky kind of media strategy that I think is leading a lot of the messaging with the campaign. You're also seeing her kind of tick up the campaign events. Obviously we're going to see her really focus on the blue wall in the next few weeks. But we're also seeing her try to do different things, not just make this a base election, which we all believed it to be, but also expand the base, some of what Priscilla was talking about talking to Republican voters, not necessarily that were Trump voters, or maybe they were Trump voters in 2016 and 2020 but also voted for Nikki Haley in the primary. So they kind of have a multi pronged strategy here. Yes, as Van Jones saying, still focusing on perspiration, particularly on their people of color, voters, what, they're seeing some softer numbers maybe than what Biden had before, but also with what would originally be thought to be kind of hard to get voters for a Democrat.",

I think the Trump campaign feels that they're doing plenty. They're doing, as Jasmine said, non-traditional. The Harris campaign is doing non- traditional outlets or trying to get to people and voters where they are.I think the Trump campaign is trying to do the same kind of thing. They did David Ben Patrick (ph), I believe, is how -- I was getting his initials wrong, but they're doing, you know, podcasts and things like that where, you know, they feel like they're reaching voters where they are, and they're getting to them. You know, is Van and Jasmine both point out correctly, this is a very, very tight race in Michigan and Pennsylvania. But you know what I don't hear, these are blue wall states where Democrats must win. These are the states that Democrats should be ahead in comfortably at this point in the game. As Van said they should be focusing on their turnout efforts at this point, and they're still in persuasion. And that just not a good thing, can't be a good thing. I know, and Jake, in our home state in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I would say that Donald Trump's probably up by, you know, percentage point right now, and that, you know, he's going to the Steelers game this weekend. Going to be spending a lot of time there doing kind of non-traditional things. Trying to motivate folks who might not be, you know, reachable otherwise in showing. You know, Elon Musk is in Pennsylvania. So, lots of things going on in the blue wall states. And at least in Pennsylvania, I think Trump is up now by a bit.",

I think we had a discussion about persuasion and get out the vote. Bringing Lizzo in, bringing Usher in, these are really get out the vote tactics. I know that the campaign wants Usher to focus on having people go to the polls and go to the polls early, so that they have that really hard data in lieu of maybe kind of the statistical polls being all over the place.They have that hard data of where to know where to surge money in the last week or two. And so, I think that these are the tactics that Democrats lean on when they get to that final stretch hoping that it breaks that kind of third wall and gets people to go turn in their ballots, to go to the polls in a more efficient way than maybe Kamala Harris or some other older Democrats, even though she's a younger Democrat, comparison to President Biden can do themselves.",

Our reporting is that there had been real leads in the past. There were moments when they thought that they had actually gotten quite close. So it's really remarkable that these were the circumstances under which he ultimately ended up dying. He was hiding in this vast network of tunnels that made intelligence gathering really, really tricky.It's really clear that the Biden administration would like to seize this moment as an opportunity to turn the page on the ceasefire and hostages negotiations, which obviously have been stalled for months and months. And most recently, the administration had largely blamed Sinwar, essentially saying, look, until this guy gives a green light, nothing can move. Essentially, everything had been really stuck. But I do want to make clear, I think celebrating his death is not the same as having delusions about this war is suddenly going to come to an end. They know that this is very difficult, and I think there are a few things that are basically outstanding. I mean, Hamas and the question of what is next? Who ends up succeeding Sinwar? What does the new leadership ultimately want for this next stage of the conflict, that is entirely unknown. We also have Israel's retaliation against Iran. We expect that that's coming in a matter of days. We don't know the scope, we don't know the timing. We don't know how Iran is going to respond. So that's a big area to watch. And then, of course, the biggest question mark is over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, does he actually see this as an opportunity to end this war? Can he sort of hold up Sinwar's head and claim victory and say, you know, we've done everything we wanted to do, and we can now move on. I don't think that U.S. officials have a clear read on that. I was told that his conversation with President Biden just yesterday was brief. And he made clear, I will end the war, but only under parameters that are acceptable to me.",
