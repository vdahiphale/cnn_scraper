You probably know by now that the 14th Amendment says that anyone who is engaged in insurrection cannot hold office. And that Colorado has disqualified Donald Trump from its ballot under that provision. Now, here`s what the Supreme Court will be asking about. Donald Trump`s team will argue that while the 14th Amendment does specify certain offices, senators, representatives, and others, it actually says nothing specifically about the president. Colorado is going to counter that. Yes, but the 14th Amendment actually does say it applies to officers of the United States. This will be a close call. It`ll come down to how the justices choose to interpret those words in the constitution. Watch for Trump`s team to argue that it`s up to Congress and not the individual states to decide whether and how to apply the 14th Amendment. Colorado will argue that the states have the power to enforce the 14th Amendment. The problem here is if the Supreme Court allows the states to make these decisions on their own, we could end up in a situation where major party candidates are kicked off the ballot in some states, but not others. So how about the big question? Did Donald Trump engage in insurrection? Of course, Colorado claims he did. And Donald Trump says he did not. But don`t expect the justices to go too deep into this question. First, that`s just not what the Supreme Court does. They don`t hold trials and they don`t find facts. Second, they don`t need to decide this question. The Supreme Court always likes to rule as narrowly as possible. And the Supreme Court tries to base its rulings on procedural and constitutional issues like the ones we just talked about. However, this case comes out, we will see history in the making. Now, I got to go. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The idea is not only to one day show how the environment changed over time, but also to inspire discussions now about actions that can be taken to shape its future.
