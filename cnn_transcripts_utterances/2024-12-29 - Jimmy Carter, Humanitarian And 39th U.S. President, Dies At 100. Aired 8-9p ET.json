(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): Peace in the Middle East. The impossible dream. But President Jimmy Carter wasn't afraid to take it on, inviting two of the world's fiercest enemies to the White House retreat at Camp David in 1978. Jimmy Carter had been derided for his administration's foreign policy failures, partly because he's considered to have lost a U.S. friendly Iran to the ayatollahs. But the Camp David accords were his geopolitical triumph. He managed to strike a deal between Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat.

I mean, he had a tremendous intellect, a kind of an engineer's desire and determination to take apart problems and reassemble them.And he had, you know, a pretty good personal touch behind closed doors. Fast forward one year later and he spends another 10 days at Camp David, leading to the speech in 1979, the crisis of confidence speech that is often called the malaise speech, which was kind of a low point of his presidency. And it really kind of shows you the kind of the poles of the Carter experience. He had some important accomplishments, but ultimately he lost the confidence of the country and lost that second term in a resounding vote. And he was an important figure in the Democratic Party. He was an important figure in kind of knitting together American society again after all the tumult and turmoil of the '60s.

I mean, you know, when he was elected governor in 1971 and he took over in 1971, in Georgia, he succeeded Lester Maddox as governor of Georgia, who was, you know, a virulent racist and ardent segregationist. And Carter, in many ways, was the embodiment of the hope of a new south in the post-civil rights era. And I thought, like, you know, looking back on Carter, he was the first president I covered at all.He was a figure of -- he was an important figure of cultural reconciliation in a lot of ways after the 1960s. He was an ardent, you know, he was a devout Christian, evangelical protestant to embrace rock and roll. He was a southerner who embraced civil rights. He was a, as you point out, a Navy veteran who pardoned the Vietnam draft resisters. And, you know, he was someone in a marriage that to all the world looked like a very traditional union, but accepted and celebrated a more assertive role for women. And in all these ways, I thought he sort of cemented a lot of the cultural change that came through in the '60s. But if he was a figure of cultural integration, as I said, in some ways he was a figure of political disintegration, you know, he was presiding over the Democratic coalition that was really starting to come apart at the seams. And the best kind of, kind of model of how that, you know, upended his presidency was that many of his legislative achievements were attempts, were blocked in Congress by conservative southern Democrats. And then in 1980, he got a challenge in the primary from the left, from Teddy Kennedy, who thought that he moved too far to the center. He pioneered some of the, I think, reforms in the Democratic Party that Bill Clinton completed, 15, 20 -- you know, 15 a dozen years later. But in some ways, he was a man ahead of his time in recognizing the Democratic Party had to change. He just couldn't bring enough of his party along with him, either on the right or the left.",

But I think if we asked him, he would look at the last 43 years of his life, what he did at the Carter Center, what he did for Habitat for Humanity, what he did for ensuring democracy all over the world, by monitoring elections, by eradicating diseases in Africa.That's what his legacy was. I think a lot of people would say more so than even being president of United States because after he became president, after he left the White House, after he left the Oval Office, he set out to make the world better.

I mean, the thing I love about them is their honesty about how difficult marriage could be at times.They wrote a book together, and she said it was the closest they ever came to getting a divorce because there was so much stress and it got so tense. She would write a few pages and they would pass them back and forth to their editor with just R and J on them, and wouldn't even pass them to each other. They wrote the book up that way. So they were just real, humble, down-to-earth people, grew up in a small, you know, Georgia town. And I think it's remarkable that they went back there, too, and were really devoted to keeping Plains thriving. And that's something that I know that President Carter was really, you know, invested in and wants to make sure that the town still, you know, survives.
