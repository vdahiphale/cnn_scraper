The proposals will be a topic of conversation when she sits down for an interview with Spanish language network Telemundo. That's going to air on Wednesday. She is also sitting down for an interview with NBC News. That will also air later. Now, Harris will not be on the campaign trail today, but key players like former President Barack Obama and her running mate, Tim Walz, well, they will be out stumping for her. Obama joins Minnesota's governor for a campaign rally in the critical state of Wisconsin. He then heads to Detroit, where he will be speaking at a solo rally on behalf of the ticket.Now, in these closing days of the race, Kamala Harris is trying to convince Republicans, especially women, to support her. She made stops in the suburbs of three different blue wall states on Monday, campaigning with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: That cruelty is the same cruelty that we see when he lies about the federal government's disaster response, when he puts people's lives at risk, because he won't tell the truth.

EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So, Rahel, as you noted, she is going to be off the campaign trail today, doing those interviews with NBC and Telemundo. But, core to her campaign argument in these closing weeks is that the former President is fundamentally unfit for the job, unfit to lead the country, and unhinged, and what we see her doing is using his own words and actions against him, and this seems to be a play for voters that may not necessarily agree with her on every policy issue, but really voters who are worried about these broader concerns like the health of our democracy and fidelity to the Constitution. And so, she is doing these country over party events with Liz Cheney in an attempt to reach battle ground voters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You just have two weeks left to make your case. The most precious commodity a candidate has is their time, and there are some that believe that she should be spending all of her time with the base of the party, ensuring turnout, so, black voters, for instance, making sure that they turn out for her in a big way, and not so much investing in these -- the elusive middle of the country. But, listen, if you speak to the campaign, they say that both are necessary and that every election requires sort of this complex mix of voters in order to pull off success in the states that are just split down the middle, in Wisconsin, for instance, that is so evenly divided.",

Lizzo was out on the campaign trail as well as Usher this weekend in Atlanta.And listen, you have Republicans that sort of poke fun at this, saying, the Democrats, they love to embrace celebrities. But, I would argue, if Republicans had this same A-list roster, they would be leaning on that bench as well, because there are so many people that are not tuned in, like us, to all of the twists and turns in politics.

This is a state that Republicans generally, in the last few election cycles, have spent a fair amount of time, feeling is a safe state for them, one that they have increasingly had comfortable wins in. But now, at this point in the campaign, it's telling that Trump and his team are devoting time there. It tells us that under these circumstances, a new candidate, the aftermath of a hurricane, and the changing demographics of the state, it's possibly a competitive state for Republicans now, which is not ideal, but still a fact of life.At the same time, if you talk to any Democrats, they will say that this is a state that is not entirely a reach state, but definitely not one that they would bank (ph) the election on. So, we're seeing a shift in really a late emergence of a battleground state. For Trump himself, he wants to argue, as we saw in the clip earlier, that he wants to rally core base groups to get out to vote, voters who feel that Kamala Harris won't protect their Christian values, voters who are incredibly pro-life. These are the groups that Trump is trying to energize and really rally in the final days of this campaign.",

Now, this is something that Democrats often quibble with, and his record as President during his first administration doesn't always adhere to that, but this is the argument he is trying to make, in contrast with Harris, as someone he says is too risky and too inexperienced to do the job.",

Maura is also the founder of Bluestack Strategies. Great to see you both ladies.Maura, I actually want to pick up on something that Daniel said there, I'm not sure if you could hear our correspondent there, but he just sort of talked about how it's potentially telling that Trump feels the need, or the campaign at least, feels the need two weeks out to be in North Carolina, which would have normally been a safe state. What does that mean to you, if anything? MAURA GILLESPIE, FMR. ADVISOR TO JOHN BOEHNER: I think what it is showing is that obviously, Mark Robinson is hurting him, and he is worried about voter turnout for him. I think in North Carolina, the fact that, again, they have this gubernatorial candidate that has obviously embarrassed the Republican Party there in North Carolina, but largely the Republican Party as a whole, because Trump did endorse him, he is worried about that, but he is also worried, I think personally, about the implications that if he were to lose North Carolina, what that would mean, because it would be historic for Kamala Harris to win it. And so, I think that just personally, with his kind of his ego, he doesn't like that idea. And so, he is doubling down his efforts there to secure that that vote, because I think he realizes the implications that (inaudible) win in North Carolina could mean for him.",

Is North Carolina within reach for the Dems, or is that a stretch?KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; SENIOR ADVISOR, HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, actually, I think it is. I worked in 2022 on the Senate campaign, and as Daniel mentioned, the demographic shifts in the state, particularly during COVID, where you had people from Northeastern cities moving to North Carolina, looking for more space, if you will. So, that's one of the factors to consider. But, there is a little bit, I think, of chaos on both sides. I think state election officials are doing a valiant job, trying to make sure that anyone who has been impacted by the storms actually, not only, by the way, are getting the FEMA assistance they need, but also are able to vote. And so -- but that does make it a little bit trickier. So -- but, yeah. If you look at the demographics of his state, it is within reach for the Vice President. And as Maura said, I mean, we've seen over the last several months, Trump has put a lot of time and effort into Pennsylvania and North Carolina specifically, and knowing that in those two states, obviously now going to Michigan a bit more, but those two states in particular seem to have been very key to his strategy. So, at a minimum, it is incumbent on the Vice President's strategy to both make Trump have to work for it, while also doing the outreach and keeping the state competitive.",

They are just trying to keep body and soul together, get their kids off to school, and they are -- for some of them, it is going to be a last-minute decision, and it's going to be a decision that they make on their gut feeling about who do they trust their future with.And people still have questions. So, some of what they might hear is information perhaps they hadn't heard before about her that kind of tips them a little bit more towards her. I think for other -- given that it's a national town hall, there are other votes likely throughout the country who likewise may hear something that they hadn't heard before. It will also give her an opportunity to talk both about -- she'll have several things to talk about, but specifically the agenda she is putting out today targeting Latino men. We've got a high Puerto Rican population that we've got to really try to turn out, obviously black men and women voters.

The concerns and they want to have early voting is because people are working, and we want to give every citizen an opportunity to go out and vote, and this is a way to do that. So, if they have concerns about it, they should come up with a plan or something that is actually tangible, as opposed to trying to shut down efforts for early voting fraudulently.They claim fraud with (ph) very many sites to say, like, here is why, here is how. They don't have much proof there. And so, I think in that ways, it's really important to come up with a plan.

I mean, he is Michigan royalty, his dedication to the state and to a lot of celebrities, they leave where they come from he is.So, for him to come out, particularly in Detroit, where Trump has been there and really consistently dumped on the city, he tried to make up for it a little bit earlier this week. I think that is going to -- if you didn't hear what Trump said about your city, you're going to hear it tonight when Eminem talks, steps to the mic and talks about it. And so, it is about getting people to pay attention, stop the doom scrolling on their phone for a minute and pay attention for -- even if you get their attention for 30 seconds, they might hear something that makes them focus on the election, and that's part of the strategy of tonight.

It could be Washington's last big push before the U.S. election to try to get a ceasefire in the Middle East. U.S. officials tell CNN that expectations for a ceasefire are not high. They believe that Blinken's best chance to make any progress is to convince Israel to improve the dreadful humanitarian situation in Gaza. Now, despite U.S. efforts, Israel is keeping up attacks in Gaza. UN aid workers in the north report that the, quote, \"smell of death\" is everywhere. A senior UN official says that people cannot get food or water or medical care amid relentless bombardment. He says that, quote, \"People are just waiting to die\".Residents in northern Gaza's Beit Lahiya say that the Israeli military has told them to evacuate because their lives are in danger. One video message set to be from the IDF warns the Israeli forces will, quote, \"explode the whole area\". And we're also seeing devastating scenes in Beirut. This is the aftermath of a strike that damaged Lebanon's largest public hospital. The Health Ministry says at least 18 people were killed, including four children. The IDF says that it was targeting a Hezbollah terrorist site nearby. Now, across the border, the IDF says that 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel today. It says that some were intercepted. Others came down in open areas. We have team coverage for you. Let's get more now from Kylie Atwood in Washington. We also have Jeremy Diamond standing by in Tel Aviv. But, Kylie, let me start with you. I mean, as we said, expectations seem pretty low for this Blinken trip. What can his trip deescalate at this point, if anything? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, that's right. Expectations are not incredibly high heading into this trip. A senior State Department official on the plane with the Secretary spoke with reporters on the way over and said that the United States really doesn't know what the next few weeks are going to look like, when it comes to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, despite the fact that U.S. officials very publicly, from the top levels, including President Biden, said that there was an opportunity following the death of Yahya Sinwar to bring about an end to the conflict. They also recognized that without Yahya Sinwar, there are more complications. There are new complications. U.S. officials don't know who is going to become the decision maker for Hamas inside of Gaza, and that's a challenge when it comes to their desire to push forth an end to this conflict. Now, the Secretary of State landed in Israel. His first meeting was with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has signaled that the fighting in Gaza will go on. So, that's significant. They had a meeting that was quite long. It lasted for two and a half hours. We just got the readout from the State Department saying that, in part, Blinken did press that the Israelis should seize this moment following the death of Yahya Sinwar, quote, \"to secure the release of all hostages and end the conflict in Gaza in a way that provides lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians alike\". It's just a question of how the Israelis and how Hamas actually capitalize on that at a moment when there aren't any ongoing negotiations. So, we'll watch and see what comes out of these meetings. But, we also know that the Secretary of State is focused on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It continues to be incredibly dire, as you were saying in your opening there. And so, the U.S. is pressing Israel to do more to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza and coming out tracking what they have done and what more they need to do.",

I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.More than a dozen world leaders are gathered in southwestern Russia right now for a summit of the group known as BRICS. Now, among those attending, China's Xi Jinping, India's Narendra Modi, and Iran's Masoud Pezeshkian. Kremlin watchers say that one of the aims of the three-day Summit is to show that Western attempts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed. It's the first meeting of the group of major emerging economies since it expanded earlier this year to include Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Iran. It's also the largest international gathering that Mr. Putin has hosted since the start of the war in Ukraine. Let's bring in Clare Sebastian, who has been keeping a close watch on events, and joins us now from London. So, Clare, what's on the agenda, and what have we seen so far?",

This will be the second time he has met with Putin in just a couple of weeks. Iran, of course, a burgeoning defense partnership for Russia. They have been providing weapons for the war in Ukraine.So, I think all of these alliances, seeing them on display, will certainly be adding to Ukraine's sense of unease, Rahel. SOLOMON: Yeah. And as you point out, Clare, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, 17 bilateral meetings. I mean, what message do you think Putin is hoping to send to the West?",

I think that will be on display in a very stark way when we see the sort of the group photo tomorrow. The welcome ceremony for the BRICS happening later today. These are optics that mean a lot to Russia, as it tries to get that message across.And not only that, but also the idea that this is an alternative world order, a bigger, better, faster growing grouping than the U.S. and Western-led alliances like NATO. That is the kind of rhetoric that we're hearing from Putin, that these countries are growing much faster and the West is in decline. I think, of course, underpinning all of this is the fact, and you won't hear this spoken about, is that Russia really needs these alliances in the face of Western sanctions. It really needs to have China and India as markets for its oil. It needs the technology, micro chips and things like that that it's getting from China. And of course, it really needs this defense partnership that it has with Iran, as it continues with its war in Ukraine. Rahel.",

The last time Congress voted to increase the federal minimum wage, current NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes was just 11-years- old. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they were still around. And Kamala Harris was the DA in San Francisco. So, that was back in 2007. Congress lifted the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour, eventually up to $7.25 an hour in 2009, and that's where it is today. That equates to about $15,000 per year.Now, some states, of course, have increased their minimum wage, but a lot of other states, they still only require $7.25 an hour. Now, some of that -- those states are some of the more rural ones you might expect, like Idaho and Wyoming and Utah, but also some battleground states, including Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, where former President Trump was visiting McDonald's the other day. And during that cameo at McDonald's, he was asked directly, whether or not he supports increasing the federal minimum wage. Take a listen to his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

MIT has a calculator where they try to figure out what a living wage is around the country, and they define a living wage as what a person would need to make a full-time worker to cover their family's basic needs while being self- sufficient. And they found that even in Alabama, which is a relatively low cost state that does not have a minimum wage for that state, even there, one adult with no children would have to make $20 an hour to be considered a living wage. So, that is almost triple the federal minimum.And because of the high cost of child care, if you're talking about one adult with one child, then the living wage would actually spike to over $33 an hour. So, that means, if you talking about a single mom in Alabama making the minimum wage, she'd be making less than a quarter of what it would actually take to get by. Now, we should note that some states, they have increased their minimum wage, some of them obvious progressive states like New York, New Jersey, California, but also some more purple states like Arizona and purple -- and Florida, as well as some red states like Arkansas, Ohio and West Virginia. And so, now we're going to have to see whether or not Congress will act in the next President's term to increase the federal minimum wage, which, as we said, has not gone up since 2009, Rahel.",

And so, that's an interesting case study, as Congress deliberates what they should do, and that same Berkeley professor, he told me that he thinks that the federal minimum wage could actually go up to $17 an hour without having any of those negative economic repercussions.
