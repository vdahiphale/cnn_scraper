      "sentences": "A top Trump lieutenant is putting media giants on notice. Brendan Carr, Trump's pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a scathing letter to Disney CEO Bob Iger over the weekend, warning Iger that he would, quote, \"be monitoring ABC's ongoing negotiations with its local affiliate stations.\"Carr, in the letter, says, quote, \"Americans no longer trust the national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.\" It goes on to cite ABC's $16 million settlement of a defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump. CNN's Brian Stelter scooped this letter. He joins me now. Brian, let's start with, look, people in our world saw this and I think alarm bells went off a little bit, but what's the backstory here to the letter?",

      "sentences": "Well, the FCC is normally a relatively sleepy agency overseeing wireless broadband things like that. Brendan Carr, who has been a commissioner since 2017, appointed by Trump back then, now he's set to become the chairman. He will be the leader of the agency, and he is signaling he's going to use a much heavier hand. Even if he doesn't always have legal power, regulatory power, he's at least going to use his bully pulpit, and he wants to do so.I think we should consider this story on two levels, Phil. First there's the policy level. Carr is expressing concern about ABC's negotiations with its affiliated stations. You know, most stations across the country that have ABC shows are not actually owned by Disney, they're owned by companies like Nexstar and Sinclair. And there's a balance of power between the national and the local that Carr thinks is out of whack. He's concerned that local programming is getting squeezed out, while Disney spends gobs of money on its global streaming service. So, he says he's monitoring that issue. And frankly, that's an interesting policy issue. But then there's the politics here. Trump views ABC as an enemy. He didn't like how ABC moderated the debate last September. He didn't like being fact checked about Springfield, Ohio and the migrants. So, he said ABC ought to lose its license as a result. Now, national networks are not licensed, only local stations are. But that's beside the point. The point is that Trump wants his government agencies to be doing battle with media companies. And it seems Carr's letter comes amid that Trumpian backdrop of threats and pressure against big networks.",

We're going to see this in the coming weeks as Trump's appointees take charge, and they're trying to do it differently than they did the first time around. My impression from my reporting is that Carr is more than happy to take the criticism. People might say, you know, why is a government official getting involved, maybe bullying these companies? He's going to welcome that and he's going to use his pulpit of X, thanks to his friend Elon Musk, he's going to use the power of X to get these messages acrossNow, ABC doesn't have any comment on the letter to Iger, but it is notable that ABC paid $15 million to Trump's future library, tried to make that ugly case go away, and yet, you still do see Trump's FCC chairman going after Disney anyway. I think that's notable. Going forward, you know, I think we're going to see Carr push these culture war issues, censorship, the claims against censorship by big tech. We're going to see those keep coming up in the months and years to come.",

The billionaire has a mounting and unprecedented myriad of wealth, influence, power, and proximity to the president-elect. So, is he untouchable?Let's discuss with bestselling author and founding partner of Puck, Bill Cohan. Bill, I really appreciate you being here. I was chuckling this morning. I was looking at my bookshelf, three of my most dog- eared books are books you wrote that I read religiously as a young financial reporter. \"Last Tycoons,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Money and Power,\" all of those were firms where powerful people often went in and out of government on some level. And yet, I haven't been able to figure out an analog to Elon Musk in this moment. Is there one that occurs to you? WILLIAM COHAN, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF PUCK: Well, thank you, Phil, for having me, and happy holidays to everyone. I appreciate those kind words. Look, I mean, it's a complicated situation because, you know, a president is allowed to have his advisers anybody, you know, the people he wants around him. We hope that he will choose wisely. We hope that he will surround himself with the best and the brightest. I mean, John F. Kennedy invited into his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, who was president of Ford Motor Company. So, of course, there's plenty of examples. And, you know, CEOs of Goldman Sachs have gone to become treasury secretaries. So, you know, Elon isn't in the cabinet. He hasn't been really appointed to anything except for this DOGE Committee, which is, you know, sort of a new-fangled thing that doesn't really have all that much authority. And he's got a lot of conflicts. And of course, you know, between SpaceX and Starlink and Tesla and other things that he does, he's got a lot of conflicts. He's got an incredible amount of wealth. I don't think we've ever seen someone with this kind of wealth or nearly his kind of wealth be in and around the president of the United States. So, there's a lot to unpack here. And, you know, he tried his hand at the legislative process last week, sort of got his head handed to him a little bit, but, you know, it's still early days in all of this.",

But Musk is different. To your point, there don't seem to be any guardrails with him. He's rich enough. He's connected enough. He has enough big businesses. He has an entire social media platform. The risk reward for Trump in this case seems to be pretty dramatic on the risk side if they split.",

And, you know, he could say, and as I've speculated from time to time, if he arranged for a merger between X and Truth Social, Trump's publicly traded social media company. He could vastly increase Trump's wealth on that merger alone, given that it's basically a meme stock at this point.So, if he wanted to, he could gift Trump billions of more net income net worth, and that gives him even more power over Trump. To say nothing of the army he controls, you know, look what he was able to do when he started tweeting about the continuing resolution bill. He got Republican congressmen to back away from it. It didn't work out in the end, really, but, you know, he's got that army and he's obviously not afraid to use it. He's kind of an untouchable guy.

And for Trump, I mean, he can just gift this platform of X to Trump, take them both public, at the same -- you know, take X public at the same time, it become this crazy meme stock for a while anyway, and it would bail out Elon's investors and make Trump a hell of a lot of money.
