I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Sudan is living through a nightmare and the world needs to wake up and help. Those words from the head of the World Health Organization who visited the country in the grips of a raging humanitarian crisis, one of the world's worst. Around 25 million people are in dire need of aid, but the WHO says it has less than a quarter of the funding they need to provide it. The true number is hard to pin down, but anywhere between 15,000 to 150,000 people have been killed since the war broke out between rival generals in early 2023. Now, over 10 million people are displaced, famine is stalking parts of North Darfur, millions are without safe drinking water, and 19 million children are out of school. Well, Kholood Khair is a Sudanese researcher and political analyst, and joins the program live for us. Kholood, thank you so much for taking the time. As we note, this is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises 25 million people, as we note, are in dire need of aid. 10 million people have been displaced. A wide range in numbers and figures as to what the actual death toll is. You describe it as a crisis with no off switch. Give us a sense of what you are hearing from people on the ground, what they are telling you now over a year into this horrific war.",

People all recognize that regardless of the politics of this, of what happens between the different armed groups, particularly the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF, it is they who are feeling the brunt of this. They've lost their homes, they've lost their possessions, they've lost their livelihoods, they've lost their dignity, and there's a very real sense that things will get infinitely worse as starvation sets in very many areas across the country.",

So, the question here isn't what can the U.S. do alone, in fact, the very kernel of that question is wrong. The U.S. cannot do this alone. It has to work with its allies to mitigate the impact of their allies on this region. You have Egypt, a very key strategic ally for the U.S. supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces and another key strategic ally, the United Arab Emirates, supporting the RSF. Neither of these have significantly committed to any kind of peace process because they are too busy effectively looting in the case of the UAE and in the case of Egypt, trying to control and manage the conflict rather than resolve it. We're seeing this also with the Saudi Arabia, and Israel, though it is otherwise engaged, is also implicated in this, as are non-U.S. allies like Iran and Russia. The fear here is that as this war moves increasingly into the proxy like characteristics, it will be very difficult to move towards a peaceful resolution anytime soon.

And what seems to be a bit puzzling is that among the two, both warring factions have committed numerous war crimes that have been documented. But specifically, the RSF is not popular at all among the Sudanese.

And this actually makes them winning hearts and minds, and this actually makes them very, very dangerous. It means that they will pursue a sort of position within a ruling system at any cost, mostly to avoid any kind of accountability and transitional justice measures. So, what we have to do here, really, is instead of seeking a ceasefire, which is where all of the international communities' energies have gone, we need to figure out how to make the revolutions call -- come to -- come into, you know, manifest, which is that the Sudanese Armed Forces should be reformed and the RSF should be disbanded. Now, how we do that becomes the question. I think trying to find peace between them is not going to happen. The conditions for it are not right, that both sides are signaling very strongly that they have no interest in a ceasefire that they both see as a military solution. And so, we should be investing in protection of civilians, we should be investing in humanitarian aid to make sure people are alive long enough to see the Sudan that we want to see. And at the same time, make sure that we invest in figuring out how to reform the Sudanese Armed Forces and make sure that we get to a stage where we can disband the RSF so they don't continue to wreak havoc in the country.",

I think the African Union has done very,very little in trying to mitigate any of the sort of the fallouts of the war, but also in trying to find a resolution. Initially, it was caught up in this tug of war, if you will, between with the IGAD regional group. And so, now, it needs to really very quickly that now after it has appointed a panel, move very quickly on the protection agenda. I think that is where the African Union can provide the most value right now. If they're able to push forward a protection agenda and look at options of deploying protection of civilian's troops that would actually allow it to play a much more impactful role than trying to figure out some kind of ceasefire between the generals. So, far, many African countries are also implicated in supporting either one side or the other, most of them favoring the Rapid Support Forces, not out of any love for the RSF necessarily, but because they have a very long history with the Sudanese Armed Forces, and they have a lot of baggage that has gone unresolved. So, the African Union has to move beyond these regional issues and it has to be able to move towards a strategy that actually puts the people of Sudan first and not the generals. So, far, we haven't seen any institution, regional or international, that has done that.",

It wants some kind of presence on the Red Sea. Right now, it has some presence with the Houthis in the southern eastern part of the Red Sea, and it would like very much a place more northwards on the western bank of the Red Sea. And because of that they very and they're very much want to engage with the Sudanese Armed Forces, a group that they have had a long history with since at least the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And so, they're very much backing the Sudanese Armed Forces. Now, they, the Sudanese Armed Forces, say that they're not engaging with Iran. They know that this puts off the Americans. They know that this puts off the Israelis. But they are in a position with so few friends in the region, so few friends they can rely on to really engage with whomever they can, Iran, Russia, et cetera. And the -- you know, the Iranians recently have been found by a report from Human Rights Watch to be supplying Mohajer-6 drones, quite sophisticated drones to the Sudanese Armed Forces as early as sort of earlier this year. This support looks likely to continue even if the Sudanese Armed Forces aren't able to grant Iran a port or some kind of military base on the Red Sea.

The one bright spot has been the way that communities have grouped together to provide support for each other, to provide sort of humanitarian corridors for each other, to provide food. Food kitchens have been set up all across the country, particularly in urban areas, and they have been a lifeline for people. And so, these people have basically, because as you say, this war has been forgotten by many people around the world, have relied on themselves. Now, I don't think that should continue. As much as possible the world needs to know that it is concerned with the future of Sudanese people. But in many ways, it is the Sudanese people that are doing this themselves. And by providing for each other in the vacuum of humanitarian support, they are weaving together the social fabric that is being ripped apart by this war, especially along ethnic lines, especially along regional lines, and really recreating those community ties that would have otherwise really made this a much more difficult war to go through for those on the ground.",

Americans move a lot. I mean, you know, one study showed that Americans move on average 12 times -- over 12 times over the course of their life. We move when we're kids to different school districts to get a better education. We move to go to, you know, college, some of us. We move for different jobs. We move when we get married. We move in with different partners. There's lots of times where we have expectations that in order to make our lives work, there will be housing that we can afford and fits with what we need.

But at some point, you know, you kind of build out the suburbs that are available. And what people want is they want more housing closer to the urban core because they want to be able to commute to work. And so, what we see happening is instead of accommodating that new growth, instead of building more densely, instead of building these smaller starter homes and single-family homes -- smaller starter homes and multifamily homes that can accommodate lower-income and middle-income Americans, we've stopped allowing that sort of building to happen. And so, it's really a very simple Economics 101 problem where we need more housing. We're creating a lot of good jobs in America. We have them in a bunch of our urban centers, places like San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Boston, Nashville, Austin, Miami, these cities are producing jobs at really, really high rates.

And to give you an example, you know, starter homes are often thought to be around 1,500 square feet. You know, that's the size of a starter home that, you know, baby boomers were used to buying into for their first house. Now, that kind of house is illegal to build in the vast majority of residential land in this country. You cannot just go as a builder buy some property, some land and decide you're going to build a bunch of small starter homes. It's illegal. Many places you'll have to build something that's at least 5,000 square feet, maybe even 10,000 square feet. In some parts of this country, houses are not allowed to be built on smaller than one acre of land. When you create those kinds of regulations at the local level that make it impossible to build smaller houses, you're basically outlawing affordable housing that can be bought by people who are making a middle-income salary, even if they're working two jobs, and that's why we see, you know, home prices going from an average of, you know, $300,000 dollars across the country to $700,000 in some places, and even a million in other places.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a really good question. So, zoning regulations -- and that's kind of the class of regulations I've been talking about. So, theseare regulations that determine what sorts of things you're allowed to do with land, how big you can build a house, how much you can cut it down, whether you can have a two-story house, all of these things are under the banner of zoning regulations. So, these regulations are created in the 1910s after the Supreme Court rules that it is illegal to explicitly zone areas based on race. So, you can no longer just say, here's the area for the black people. Here's the area for Chinese people. Here's the area for white people. You're not allowed to do that. And so, cities are very innovative. Racists are very innovative. And so, what they do is they decide they're just going to create a facially racially neutral policy, which is to say, well, we're not going to say no black people can live here, we're just going to say the only types of houses that can exist here are ones that are affordable to millionaires. And what that does in a country that has created a bunch of set class segregation is, of course, de facto means that it becomes racially segregated. Over the course of the 20th century, we see a bunch of different developments that make it possible for people of color to also achieve wealth. So, you do see, of course, black, Asian American, Latino American people able to buy into these neighborhoods, but they don't actually break down the class barriers. So, right now, middle-income, people who are just starting out in life, people who were used to being serviced by the private market and not needing government assistance in order to afford housing, no longer can do so in our most productive cities and suburbs in America.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, I think there are a few different reasons for this. I think the first reason is that there's often a disconnect to people betweennew buildings that are being constructed and the impact they have on the broader housing market. So, it can be hard to tell from your own personal perspective. Why is it that if a developer can't build, you know, a few more houses on small lots of land, how does that affect my life? But what we know from economic research is that it's really clear that when new homes are constrained, then rich people begin to occupy cheaper homes. I think the clearest place where this is most evident to people is places like New York City, where you see people who are making well into the six figures. Living in houses that are tiny, dilapidated, often they're living in places that are, you know, fire unsafe. They don't actually not up to code in a lot of places in the country would expect to have up to code. And the reason for that is because when you stop building enough, rich people still get the housing that they want, they just -- or which people still get housing, but everyone else is then pushed into worse and worse units. But the other reason, I think, is the democratic problem. So, what we have in this country is the fact that most of the power around housing, around land, is at the local level, but Americans as democratic and by that, I mean, small democratic animals are not local political thinkers anymore. We don't engage in local politics. We don't vote there. But even if we did, it's a real problem because how would you even, as an expert in this field really know who to blame? Do you blame your local city council member? Do you blame your mayor, your zoning commissioner, your historic preservation board? Do you blame the county? It's actually becomes a situation where there's so many different layers of government all responsible for different overlapping issues that it becomes difficult to have any kind of democratic accountability. And I think that really ties into why you see so much energy at the national level, finally, on trying to solve this issue, because this is a place where Americans pay attention.",

At the state and local level, usually partisanissues are actually the easiest things to get done because you often see partisan control of these state houses and of these governor mansions. But because this issue really breaks up the coalition, there are Republicans in favor and opposed. There are Democrats in favor and opposed. Essentially, no major bill on pro-housing issues has been passed without bipartisan support because you simply need to get all the support you can muster. The difficult politics of this are often because we've only just now recently begun addressing the role of these regulations to these elected officials. But we are seeing increased attention, states like Montana, like Oregon, like Washington, California, Arizona, Texas, Florida, this is a very wide range of political ideologies. All of these states have begun passing pro-housing legislation. Colorado where Jared Polis is the governor has been a leader on this. It's a purple state there too. So, seeing that kind of coalition building in a bunch of different state houses, a bunch of different ideologies, shows the promise of this sort of approach. But, you know, it's a big hurdle. When you're 4 million homes behind, you can make a lot of progress without actually getting all the benefits you need to really reduce the pain.",

And so, this has been a conversation, this conversation about these regulations, about local governments and their, you know, responsibility for the housing crisis has been something that academics and experts have known for a long time. And so, I'm not surprised personally, that Barack Obama knows this, but what I am surprised about and was excited and invigorated about is that now, finally, people at the national level are willing to take on the difficult politics of this issue in order to try and help solve this crisis. If you talk to political scientists or law professors from a decade ago, they would just tell you that this is an intractable problem, that Americans are just going to continue to have higher and higher home prices, higher and higher rents and all the problems that come downstream of that, because it's too difficult to handle the political you know, breakdown at the local level. I mean, this is like one of the third rails of state and local politics alongside things like property tax reform. And so, because of that, seeing Barack Obama and also Democratic nominee for president Kamala Harris, both in her own speech at the DNC, and then in ensuing ads and at -- you know, in the debate that we just watched with Former President Donald Trump, seeing that be foregrounded and the willingness to take on this thorny issue really showcases how far we've come and showcases how acute the pain has gotten for the American people that there's no choice but to take on the difficult politics here.",
