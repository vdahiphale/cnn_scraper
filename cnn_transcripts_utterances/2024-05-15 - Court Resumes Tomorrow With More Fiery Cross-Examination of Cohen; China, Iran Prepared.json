Words from CNN's brilliant Political Analyst Stephen Collinson this morning as Donald Trump's historic criminal trial takes a scheduled break today after one of the most dramatic days of testimony so far. The only day that could prove more dramatic might be tomorrow when Michael Cohen gets back on the stand and faces more heated cross- examination.Until then, Trump's lawyers will likely spend today sharpening their next questions for Cohen. Trump will spend his day still under that gag order, but on the campaign trail. And the jury weighing 34 criminal charges against Donald Trump will spend the next 24 hours waiting to hear more testimony from the witness who said Trump directed him to pay off a porn star before the 2016 election and then crafted a scheme to cover it all up. CNN's Brynn Gingras is leading our coverage off this morning. Brynn, the defense waited a couple of days to finally get its chance.

In both of these states, these are closed primaries, meaning only Republicans can vote, and Trump dropping nearly 20 percent in each state.CNN's Alayna Treene is with us now with today's plans, Alayna.",

      "sentences": "That's right. It's all about money today, and we saw that last night as well. Donald Trump is focused heavily on fundraising. He'll attend two fundraisers today, first, a lunch fundraiser in Cincinnati, Ohio. He'll be joined by J.D. Vance, a senator of Ohio, and someone who is very high on money on Donald Trump's V.P. list. And then later today, he'll be in Lexington, Kentucky, for a fundraiser with donors Barbara Banke and oil tycoon Jim Kraft, as well as former ambassador Kelly Craft.But, look, this is a huge focus of Donald Trump's campaign right now. It's all about raising money. They are trying very aggressively to catch up to Joe Biden's ever growing war chest, a kind of a far off thing that they know that is ahead of them, and they're trying to raise as much money as they can. And we saw them do this last night as well in Manhattan after court wrapped for the day. Donald Trump joined by a series of senators, congressmen, governors. He went to a fundraiser. I was told it was roughly 75 people in Manhattan last night. And, look, this is all, I think, a sign of how many people are showing up around him right now. We saw in court over the last several days really an uptick in congressmen, senators, again, people who are also high on his list for V.P. coming up to New York and showing that they're standing in solidarity with him. We saw people like Rick Scott, Doug Burgum, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, several others appeared with Donald Trump outside of court. And I think, again, this is really how we're seeing the veep stakes kind of pop up in the next few weeks. We know that Donald Trump is still far away from making his decision. He says that and his team says that he's not expected to decide who his running mate will be until closer to the Republican National Convention in July. However, we're seeing a lot of these people really try to tout their bona fides to Donald Trump, help him fundraise, and we're all seeing that come together now. And I also just want to give you a little tidbit of what I heard from yesterday with Donald Trump remarking on all of the surrogates appearing with him while he was riding to the courthouse yesterday. He was riding in a car with Vivek Ramaswamy and Speaker Mike Johnson. I'm told that Donald Trump remarked in the car that he's getting more press attention from this trial than he would be if he was on the campaign trail and touting all of the people who are showing up with him. So, clearly something Donald Trump is feeling buoyed by this week. John?",

The National Security Agency found both governments prepared A.I.-generated deepfakes four years ago, though they never made them public. So, with A.I. easier to use than ever in the 2024 election, just months away, there is growing concern about similar foreign efforts.CNN's Zach Cohen is here with this CNN exclusive.

      "sentences": "Yes, John. The intelligence that was described to us by our sources really does demonstrate concerns U.S. officials had even four years ago about foreign adversaries, in this case, specifically Iran and China, their willingness to use A.I., fake A.I.-generated content, audio or video, to try to target American voters during an election cycle.And while this content we're told was never actually disseminated by the operatives working for the Chinese and Iranian governments, it does underscore why U.S. officials are sounding the alarm about the use of A.I. and deepfakes potentially by foreign adversaries to influence the 2024 presidential election. There's actually a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing today where Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines will testify about efforts, foreign efforts to interfere in the upcoming presidential election, and we could hear more about this effort to use deepfakes. And, look, the reason there's so much concern now versus sort of tepid response to the intelligence in 2020 is because the technology around A.I. has advanced so much. It's so much easier to produce these fake A.I.-generated videos and audio. We saw an example of that in February with the Joe Biden robocall that mimicked Joe Biden's voice that was sent out to voters in New Hampshire. And, look, the intelligence does sort of create a timeline about how these adversaries are focused on creating chaos around Election Day, and U.S. officials are already preparing for different scenarios. Our colleague, Sean Lyngaas reported recently that there was a Situation Room tabletop exercise where officials were tasked with responding to Chinese -- a scenario where Chinese operatives essentially created a fake a I video and the federal government is a little bit hesitant about how much they should be involved in responding to the same time being able to respond quickly once a fake video or a fake audio or like a robocall like what we heard from in New Hampshire. Once that's identified, how do you inform people that it is, in fact, fake? That's the challenge going forward.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, there's been this long running debate over how much to blame greedflation, right, which is this notion that companies are taking advantage and their price-gouging something that progressives point to frequently.Now, new research from the San Francisco Fed finds that, yes, there is evidence that some companies did jack up prices above their production costs. The so-called markups, we saw this in 2021 and 2022, especially in cars, gasoline, car repair and laundry. But we know that inflation is a broader problem than just gas and laundry, right? This is economy-wide. And so the researchers found that when you zoom out and you really look at pricing patterns at the economy as a whole, there is no evidence that price gouging was a leading cause of inflation. They wrote, quote, rising markups have not been a major driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery. In fact, they found that the pattern of markups was really not unusual when you compare it with prior recoveries. So, in some, they're saying, yes, there's some evidence of price gouging. But, no, that probably was not the main issue. Now, I don't think this is going to settle the debate. A progressive group, accountable.us, they responded to this research by saying, listen, it doesn't add up that companies can't just keep prices stable when they're paying their CEOs fat bonuses and they're sitting on record profits. And we know President Biden himself. He's pointed to corporate greed is a reason why inflation hasn't come down more. Listen to what he told Erin Burnett last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  No, it really is. And it's real. But the fact is that if you take a look at what the people have, they have the money to spend. This angers them and angers me that you have to spend more. For example, the whole idea of this notion that Senator Casey talked about, shrinkflation, I think, you know, it's on your program.",

Look at this. This is consumer price index. The higher this chart goes, the more painful it is, of course, to consumers. And we can see that, listen, prices are no longer skyrocketing like two years ago, but some of this progress has really leveled out. And this is a major frustration for consumers. It's a political liability for the White House. New numbers out next hour, Sara, are expected to show that inflation did take down just a bit in April, but probably not by enough to let the Fed to start cutting interest rates anytime soon,",
