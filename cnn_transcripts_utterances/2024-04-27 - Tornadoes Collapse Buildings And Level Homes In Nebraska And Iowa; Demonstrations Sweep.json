We had almost 80 total tornado reports, 33 wind reports, and nearly 60 hail reports.And you can see a lot of the areas here, it looks like it's pretty spread out, but that's because it was a very widespread area that was impacted yesterday, and it's going to be very similar area today. Right now, we don't have too much in the way of active storms. We've got a couple here in Northern Arkansas, a few up around Michigan, and a couple over in Colorado. But the potential here for development across the southern and central plains does exist as early as this morning that will really start to see the biggest potential for those strong to severe thunderstorms this afternoon and especially into the evening. And that ranges anywhere from Southern Texas all the way up through Michigan. The same potential threats, strong tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail. But tornadoes are going to be an especially large concern, not just in general across this area, but you see this red area here with what kind of like the hash marks through it, this area is a particular concern for tornadoes that would be EF-3 strength or stronger. Those are pretty significant tornadoes. You're talking winds about 136 to 165 miles per hour. Again, here you can see the afternoon. They really start getting to going, but some could occur even as early as this morning, then again through the overnight hours tonight. So, again, we mentioned last hour, I will mention it again today. Make sure before you go to bed tonight, you set those alerts on your phone or you have some other way like a weather radio to get those alerts before you go to bed.",

REID (voice over): Former President Donald Trump still not warming up to the reality of being on trial in the New York hush money case. In court, David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, was back on the witness stand tying Pecker's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors to an agreement he made to sell the National Enquirer, a deal contingent on the investigation into his company being resolved. From a timing standpoint, it would have added onto the stress of the transaction, Pecker testified. They also tried to show how Pecker had other reasons beyond just helping Trump win the White House for running negative stories about Trump's opponents. Pecker testified that his magazine ran stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton prior to the 2015 Trump Tower meeting where an agreement to help Trump was allegedly breached. Running those stories was beneficial to AMI, Pecker testified. After his testimony wrapped up prosecutors used the last few hours of the day to call two additional witnesses.

Nevertheless, what we're also hearing and seeing on the ground is some pretty tough rhetoric coming from the Iranian government, the Iranian leadership, and also conservatives here in Iran as well. Here's what we witnessed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (voice over): Iran's hardliners flexing their muscles, screaming death to America and death to Israel at Tehran's main Friday prayers. The staunchly conservative prayer leader saying the Islamic Republic will not back down. Iran has warned it will take an even harder line towards the U.S. and towards Israel in the future, saying that if Israel attacks Iran or its assets one more time, the Iranians will strike back to their own territory. Tensions in the Middle East remain at a boiling point, after Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack against Israel in retaliation for the bombing of its embassy compound in Syria, killing several top Revolutionary Guard commanders. Israel, the U.S. and other allies managed to take down most of the Iranian drones and missiles, but Israel then hitting back with a limited strike against an airfield in central Iran. The hardliners flying massive Palestinian flags, ripping into Israel's operation in Gaza and the U.S.'s support for Israel. The message here, Iran is ready for a confrontation. \"In fact, we are even happy about this,\" this man says. \"We are praying day and night for a second and third attack.\" And he says, \"We've had these threats for a long time, but the difference is now the people are strong, the IRGC is strong, and the army is strong, and we have strong tools.\" And this cleric says, \"If the Islamic Republic of Iran will have more conflicts in the future, it doesn't mean we are war mongering, we're just reacting to the bullies.\" But on the streets of Tehran concern, the current tensions could escalate and even turn into war. \"I believe the situation will get worse,\" this man says, \"as both sides are more combative and in my opinion it will lead to war and to calamity for people.\" This woman says, \"We are definitely concerned, worried, but what can we ordinary people do about it?\" Iran's leadership says its military is ready for combat, even as they say war is not in their interest. (END VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (on camera): So, as you can see there, it's a pretty tough talk that we're hearing and seeing on the streets of Tehran, especially coming, of course, from the conservatives, from the hardliners, but also from the Iranian leadership as well. And they have said that, quite frankly, for them, what's going on now is really a strategic shift where they say that if Iran is attacked, that then Iran will respond in a very harsh way, of course, not putting on any details on what exactly that could mean and when exactly that could happen, guys.",

But the legal standards are a bit different in California. And there is a rule that's a bit more broad as to what evidence can come into the courtroom. But in New York, prosecutors are going to have to really look at this case, and think, if all of this other evidence is not going to come into the courtroom, would it -- is it likely that Harvey Weinstein would be convicted? And there is so many other aspects to this, Victor. The prosecutors need to grapple with, for instance? Are they going to re-traumatize the victims in this case, who would have to testify, again, the two complainants that are at the core of this prosecution? So, there is a whole analysis as to whether or not this case would actually be retried. And I think a lot of it will hinge on whether or not the California verdict stance.",

The reason that it directly impacts Trump is on two fronts. Number one, uncharged crimes, uncharged acts, uncharged information coming into the courtroom. Will the judges make decisions where uncharged information and prior bad acts is actually going to come into the Trump courtroom? The other aspect of this is this idea of whether or not the defendant is basically left with the option of only staying silent. They cannot testify. At this week, the Sandoval hearing. Sandoval hearings in New York State procedure where prosecutors are told by the judge what evidence can come in on cross examination. This is directly impacted by the appellate decision in the Trump case, because the judges decided that the E. Jean Carroll case can come in and cross. That the New York State attorney general civil fraud finding can come in on cross examination if Trump were to testify. I would expect Trump's arguments to be exactly the same.

Let's start in overtime. A lot to this game. Bucks and Pacers tied at 150 with 20 seconds to go and Aaron Nesmith, hitting his only three quarter of the night, putting the Pacers ahead. But the Bucs would answer. And Khris Middleton who made a three in the final seconds of the fourth to force overtime, hitting another one to tie it that gap. Middleton had 42 points. Indie calls a timeout in the huddle. You can see Tyrese Halliburton, telling his team, we are winning the game right now. And he was absolutely right. Halliburton driving, draining the game winner. He finished with 18 points and his first career playoff triple double as the Pacers outlast the Bucs to take a 2-1 series lead. Elsewhere, things getting chippy. Late in game three between the Mavs and the Clippers, Russell Westbrook doing the twist and shout to Luca Doncic, grabbing, spinning the Dallas superstar. Give him a little bit of push when Doncic says something. And then, P.J. Washington and Westbrook exchanging shoves. And before you know it, Russ actually shoved one of the officials. So, both he and Washington get ejected from this one. The Mavs would go on to win by 11 to go up to one. Meantime, the New York Rangers are a game away from sweeping the Capitals out of the NHL playoffs. Chris Kreider, with a goal in the first moving him into a tie for third on the Rangers all time playoffs points list. While New York's Igor Shesterkin, the netminder, just absolutely stellar, finishing with 28 saves in the three one win. So, only four teams have gone up, three nothing and gone on to lose a playoff series in NHL history. So good news there for New York. Eight more playoff games across the NBA and NHL today, including seven on our family of networks. TNT and TBS, beginning at 1:00 Eastern. So, make sure you're on the couch for that. And lastly, for you this morning, if you need any evidence that Chicago Bears fans are pinning their hopes on Caleb Williams as their team's savior under center. Here it is less than 24 hours after taking him with the first pick of the NFL draft. The quarterbacks' gear has already almost sold out, according to fanatics. The only jerseys left are the orange adult, double XL, and the U.S. navy blue. Now, this record was set just 10 days ago, guys by Caitlin Clark of the Indiana fever.
