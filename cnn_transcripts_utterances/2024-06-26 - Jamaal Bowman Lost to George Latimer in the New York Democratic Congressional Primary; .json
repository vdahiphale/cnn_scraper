CNN will host the face-off between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Thursday, right here in our Atlanta studio.Mr. Biden and his team are busy preparing at Camp David. A source tells CNN they're holding mock debates of varying lengths and focusing on both the substance and stamina he will need for the rematch against Trump. The president is also focusing on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage. A campaign official says President Biden stands up to dictators and defends freedom. Trump is a loser who's too dangerous and reckless to ever be anywhere close to the Oval Office again. Well meantime, a lot has changed for Trump since he ran for president in 2020. He's now a four-time indicted, twice impeached convicted felon. In a recent interview, Trump says he has been preparing his whole life for the debate. And he also said, quote, \"it's very hard to prepare. You've got to know this stuff from years of doing it.\" He also added that he thinks debating is an attitude more than anything else. The last time Biden and Trump met on a debate stage was during the 2020 election campaign. And many crucial things have of course changed since then. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The pressure on each man to perform Thursday is evident. But it's the profound changes in America's political climate from 2020 which could be a deciding factor in the Trump-Biden debate. JOSH DAWSEY, POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": 2020, Biden successfully and effectively made the election a referendum on Trump's leadership. Instead, he's trying to make it a referendum on Trump again. Do you really want this guy back in office? And Trump is trying to make it a referendum on Biden's record. TODD (voice-over): Two seismic events since the 2020 debates. The January 6th insurrection, which Donald Trump is accused of inciting and which he denies. And Trump is now a convicted felon found guilty of falsifying business records in his hush money trial. Something President Biden might be under pressure to highlight more at the debate. AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Thus far, the issue of his felony conviction doesn't seem to have moved voters in one direction or the other. TODD (voice-over): In 2020, analysts say American voters were looking for a leader who could manage them out of crises, including one the likes of which they'd never seen before.",

It's on Thursday, June 27th at 9 p.m. Eastern in the U.S. That's 9 a.m. Friday in Hong Kong and 2 a.m. in London.Democratic voters in New York have made their decision in the most expensive House primary on record. CNN projects George Latimer will defeat incumbent Jamaal Bowman in the 16th congressional district. The 70-year-old Westchester County executive entered the race at the urging of pro-Israel groups. Bowman, a member of the progressive squad, has been a vocal opponent of Israel's war in Gaza. He says his opponent may have won this round, but his battle for justice and humanity will continue. The trial of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich is underway in Russia. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter is accused of espionage, a charge he denies, and the U.S. government says he's wrongfully detained. No media, family or U.S. embassy personnel are being allowed in the court for the closed-door proceedings. Let's turn to CNN's Clare Sebastian, who's reported extensively on Russia and joins me now live from London. Good morning again, Clare. So, what's expected to happen behind closed doors with Evan Gershkovich's espionage trial? Of course, how much information will we likely receive on this?",

That may be the last we see of him for a while. So we have to sort of read the tea leaves here. And look, he looked calm. He looked composed. He had his head shaved, which is different from when we last saw him in March, when the court last extended his pretrial detention.And look, I think after 15 months of pretrial detention in conditions that we know have been very difficult in Moscow's notoriously fortified prison, he may be somewhat relieved to get to this point because Russia seems to be making it clear that they want this legal process to play out before anything can shift to real concrete diplomatic discussions around a potential prisoner swap. The charges are very serious. Espionage. The Russian prosecutors about 10 days ago had the charges approved by a judge. They say that the FSB has proof that he was acting on instructions from the CIA, attempting to obtain secrets about a Russian tank factory. His employer, The \"Wall Street Journal,\" continues to strenuously deny any wrongdoing. Take a look at a part of a piece this week by \"The Wall Street Journal's\" editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker. She says the trial, it will be held in secret. No evidence has been unveiled. And we already know the conclusion. This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for doing his job. Less than 1 percent of criminal cases, I should note in Russia, end in acquittal. So as I say, we will have to read the tea leaves here. How long will the trial be in the case of Paul Whelan, another American also charged and now convicted of espionage? It took almost three months. But Brittany Greiner's trial several years ago on drug charges lasted just over a month. We make it a sense of how urgent this is for the Russian government. Equally, the sentencing will be very important. The maximum is 20 years. So we'll have to see how close to that they get, given that an acquittal is not expected. But this is the first time, Rosemary, in almost 40 years that an American journalist has been charged with espionage in Russia. The last time in the Cold War, didn't even make it to trial. So a big moment for Evan Gershkovich, but also really a touchstone moment as we watch this precipitous decline of the media environment in Russia.",

So, you know, we are holding our breath. You know, it could take, we're not holding our breath. It could take weeks or months. And we don't have much trust in the Russian justice system. Realistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they, you know, they arrested him in the end because he's a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just hours ago, a U.S. judge in the Northern Mariana Islands accepted his guilty plea to a single espionage-related charge. His sentence, 62 months, time already served in London's Belmarsh prison. The WikiLeaks founder is now on his way to his native Australia without ever setting foot in an American jail. The U.S. had charged Assange with 18 felony counts for publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010, revealing sensitive data on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So let's bring in journalist Alex Thomas. He's following developments for us live from Canberra, Australia.

There's no flocking of crowds to the airport to cheer Julian Assange back onto Australian soil for the first time in well over a decade as a free man.But certainly there have been very positive noises out from the seat of government. Of course, Canberra is the capital. It's where all the politics in this country happens. And it's where Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said a little bit earlier on that he thinks the vast majority of Australians will be pleased that this saga for Assange is over. Certainly since Albanese's government came to power a few years ago, there has been a change in the diplomatic discourse. He himself brought up Assange's case with U.S. President Joe Biden on a visit to Washington last year. And Australia's Attorney General Mark Dreyfuss also raised the issue with his counterpart earlier this year. So although the news of Assange's plea bargain came as a surprise earlier this week, it comes at the end of months and years of campaigning from the current government, from Assange's supporters across the world, and also, of course, all those that believe in the freedom of press, which has been the big talking point around this.

But again, this has been heavily refuted by the international medical NGO Doctors Without Borders, which says that Fadi Al-Wadiya had worked with the organization since 2018.The organization has issued a statement, I can read you a bit from that statement, saying, we are outraged and strongly condemn the killing of our colleague Fadi Al-Wadiya. The attack killed Fadi, along with five other people, including three children, while he was cycling to work near the MSF clinic, where he was providing care. Fadi was a 33-year-old physiotherapist and father of three. And we've also heard from Doctors Without Borders' operational manager for the Palestinian territories, who went on to describe the targeting of Fadi Al-Wadiya as cynical and abhorrent, as he was on his way to work to provide care for those wounded in Gaza. The organization also went on to note that this is the sixth member of the organization to have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. And what we have seen over the last eight months is a rising number of medical professionals, as well as humanitarian workers, both from Palestinian organizations and international organizations, coming under attack by the Israeli military.

If he's asked specific questions about policies that his former administration officials and other conservatives say he's going to adopt, like enforcing this 19th century zombie law called the Comstock Act as a de facto national ban on abortion, I would expect him to dodge the question. That's been what he's doing to date because I think answering the question could either get him in trouble with his base if he moves to the center to appeal to most American voters, or with most American voters if he tries to rev up his base.

Donald Trump placed these people on the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade. The overturn of Roe v. Wade ushered in these bans that have been having serious negative effects not only on people seeking abortion, but on people with wanted pregnancies who have been unable to care for miscarriage and stillbirth, on even people seeking IVF who found new challenges because of this push for fetal personhood.So I think you're likely to see Biden hammer that message that this is Donald Trump's fault. I think one of the challenges for Biden, and something that he hasn't done as much of and really should do more of, is to emphasize with voters what would change with Donald Trump in office. So in other words, it's not just that bad things that already happened are Donald Trump's responsibility. It's that new things could get worse with Donald Trump in the White House again. So I think picking up on these points that Trump's allies and proxies have been making about what a Trump White House would mean for reproductive rights would be helpful for the Biden campaign to say, look, this isn't just about punishing Donald Trump for the past. This is about things that could change in your life going forward.",

The abortion issue seems to matter more obviously for Democrats than it has historically for women than it does for men. So I think, again, it's going to depend on what happens come November. Polls at the moment seem to suggest that a lot of voters are more focused on the economy and on inflation than they are on abortion. But whether that lasts or not, I think, will depend in part on whathappens in the world that these two campaigns don't control. We're expecting another decision from the U.S. Supreme Court in a matter of days on abortion. We know that there are still cases unfolding in lower courts that could have serious effects across the country. So there may be kind of unplanned surprises that shape the campaign and the influence of abortion that neither Biden nor Trump can control.",

Those comments coming in an advisory on Tuesday, marking the first time a publication from the Surgeon General's office has focused on firearm violence and its consequences.The advisory made clear just how devastating gun violence has been in the United States. In 2022 alone, provisional data shows more than 48,000 people in the U.S. died from firearm-related injuries. The number includes homicides, suicides and unintentional deaths. Studies also show the profound impact on children and teens in the U.S. who are dying from guns more than anything else. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Gun violence is a public health crisis in America, and I've seen this for years as a doctor who's cared for patients who have struggled with the mental and physical impacts of gun violence. People have seen this in their communities. We've seen it in mass shootings as well. But in recent years, over the last decade or two, this problem has been worsening, and we have now reached the point where gun violence is the leading cause of death among kids and teens, the leading cause of death. That is something that we should never take as the new normal. We've experienced so many mass shootings, so many incidents of gun violence in our neighborhoods and communities that it has really pervaded the psyche of our country. It has induced fear in people about regular day-to-day activities, like going to the grocery store, going to school, going to work. The strategies that I lay out for Congress to consider are ones that I think can help us ultimately address the deaths and the mental health toll of gun violence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What is the news peg here is that for years, people in South Korea and, you know, we actually had a chance to go to the workshop of this activist who is making these new smart balloons. And they're different in this way. For years, activists in South Korea have been sending balloons north filled with flash drives, K-pop albums, scenes of freedom in the South. But what you see happening right here on the right-hand side of your screen, these are smart balloons being manufactured to control their altitude, to be tracked with GPS, to send out fires like these every couple hundred meters or every couple dozen kilometers or so.
