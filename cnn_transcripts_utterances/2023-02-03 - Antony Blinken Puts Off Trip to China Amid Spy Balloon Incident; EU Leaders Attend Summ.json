      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkenputs off his trip to Beijing after a Chinese spy balloon is spotted flying over the United States. Then the EU promises more aid to Ukraine but stopped short of fast-tracking membership to the bloc. I'll speak with one of the EU officials who was at those meetings in Kyiv. Plus, an Italian mafia boss disguised as a pizza chef is arrested in France. We'll have all the details on his double life. But first, this evening, we start in the United States because the U.S. Secretary of State's visit to China is now postponed due to a strange development in the skies. The trip was meant to smooth over tense relations between Washington and Beijing. But a mysterious Chinese balloon that's floating over the U.S. is having the opposite effect. Now, that is not the moon. That is a balloon. The Pentagon says it's actually a surveillance balloon able to maneuver and it's currently heading east. People in Montana shot the video you are seeing here. The state is home to an air force base where about 100 Intercontinental ballistic missiles are located. I want to bring in CNN's Marc Stewart in Hong Kong and White House reporter Kevin Liptak. And Kevin, first to you, what are you learning about Secretary Blinken's decision to postpone this trip? And is it a postponement, Kevin, or a cancellation here?",

But what they haven't said is what would constitute the right conditions, given what this has done to U.S.-China relations. And really, they announced this postponement only hours before Secretary Blinken was set to get on his plane and fly to Beijing. He made that decision in conjunction, of course, with President Biden, who agreed that now is just not the right time for Secretary Blinken to go to China for these high stakes talks. And what U.S. officials said is that they fear that this balloon would come to dominate the conversations there, essentially, that it would be the only thing for Blinken to talk about with his Chinese counterparts. Now, this morning, Secretary Blinken did speak with his counterpart in China to inform him of his decision that he would be postponing this trip. And they haven't necessarily set a new date for when he will go. U.S. officials had been viewing this trip as kind of the culmination of what had been increased discussions between American and Chinese officials. Now that is off, it sort of remains to be seen when those discussions will resume again. Isa.",

But what I can tell you is that in the hours leading up to that decision, we heard very guarded statements from Beijing, very diplomatic statements from Beijing as to what happened. And then, in an acknowledgment, a statement saying something to the effect that what happened was a mistake. This was a balloon, a weather balloon on a fact-finding mission, and somehow it veered off course because of circumstances out of China's control. What is very telling though in the statement, and I'm going to point to a specific line, Isa, \"the Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace.\" The use of the word \"regret\". The acknowledgment that a mistake was made. Some contrition. That is very unusual to hear from the Chinese government, especially in a diplomatic discussion. I'm pointing that out because It's perhaps a signal that China realized that there is a lot of fragility involved, and that perhaps, it could impact this upcoming visit.

And so, you have these two sides. But certainly, President Biden is sensitive to that sort of criticism that he is potentially weak on China. What the U.S. and China have been doing over the last several months is trying to resume these channels of communication that had broken down following this trip over the Summer by the American House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. That had really ruptured relations, and after President Biden met with Xi Jinping in Bali in November, the two sides had really come back to the table and started talking. That had been a good sign to White House officials that this relationship, the most important bilateral relationship in the entire world was on the right track at least, at this moment of tension.

And so, what it can do is, it can potentially take some very good images of particular areas, say for example, the Chinese are interested in Malmstrom Air Force Base. Which was one of the bases that they are reportedly -- they've reportedly overflown in Montana. They could take some really good pictures of the runway from a balloon at 60,000 feet, especially given high resolution cameras. The other thing that this balloon could potentially have on board is a singles intelligence collection capability. That could include the ability to collect cellphones, conversations on cellphones, data being transmitted on cellphones. It could also indicate the ability of the -- of a particular sensor suite, it could have the ability to collect data in the UHF-VHF frequency ranges. Which would mean radio transmissions, such as the types of radio transmissions that would occur on a military base, with the transmissions that would occur for police vehicles. Those kinds of things. So it could be a very robust intelligence collecting source.

Where when a satellite, a Soviet satellite would cross a particular area, there were instructions that went out, that tooled the military in the path of that satellite to conceal certain activities.

Well, the European Unionis promising nearly $500 billion in new aid to Ukraine and pushing -- and punishing new sanctions on Russia. But it is not offering a fast-track for Ukraine's EU membership. Hours ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hosted a summit with EU leaders, as you can see there in Kyiv. The European Commission president praised Mr. Zelenskyy's efforts to root out corruption as well as root out corruption as well as implement reforms. She says Ukraine still has to reach certain goals before it can join the bloc. The EU promised unity and resolve with Kyiv, with air-raid sirens blaring in the background with fierce fighting as well underway in Bakhmut. And with stepped up Russian missile attacks on cities right across Ukraine, we'll have more on the developments on the ground a bit later.

The summit itself came with new commitments from Europe, around a half a billion dollars in new assistance, new money to help de-mine recaptured areas. Promises to train thousands more Ukrainian troops and even millions of energy-saving light bulbs to cut down on energy use amid Russian attacks on the grid. What Ukraine was hoping for though, was some kind of a signal though, that their EU membership bid might be fast-tracked. President Zelenskyy says that his country deserves to start negotiations on that this year. But Ukraine's potential membership comes with conditions. One of the biggest is cracking down on corruption. The weeks leading up to the summit were filled with anti-corruption raids and investigations. And today, police announced charges against the heads of two companies accused of defrauding the Defense Ministry out of more than $3 million. Scott McLean, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But what you have to admire is this calm resilience, determination and courage of the Ukrainian people and the government, who are trying every day just to make sure that they would go about their lives as much as before the war. For me, what was really impressive was the fact that you have atrocious war going all over Ukraine and especially in the eastern part.

We believe that Ukraine can become the critical minerals, critical raw materials superpower because they have everything, what we need in Europe to build our future.

Israel saysthe attempted -- he says the attempt upon me to attack soldiers at a military outpost near Nablus. The region is experiencing the worst violence between Israelis and Palestinians in years. A terror attack last week in Jerusalem killed seven people or just a day after the deadly Israeli military operation in the West Bank. Ten Palestinians in the Jenin refugee camp were killed, both gunmen and civilians. Our Nic Robertson visited Jenin and met a family who got terrifyingly close to that military operation. He joins me now from Jerusalem. And Nic, before you tell us what you saw in Jenin, just give us a sense of where we are right now in the region because 48 -- we're about 48 hours or so since Secretary Blinken's departure. Where are we on the diplomatic front to try to at least put an end to the cycle of violence?",

They say the suspects barricaded themselves in the house here. So, they fired a shoulder launch anti-tank missile at them. (voice-over): The buildings so damaged, local officials had it bulldozed. Using apartments like Muhammad's to give covering fire is standard operating procedure, an Israeli military spokesman told CNN, so that the action can be more precise. U.N. officials say the incident breaches international law. In the ground floor apartment beneath Muhammad's, Ziad (ph) says he saw the firefight. Saw an Israeli soldier hide behind his car, shoot one of the gunmen. \"This is the worst I've seen it, much worse than the 2002 raids,\" he says, \"there are lots more gunmen on the streets now.\" It's a younger generation. They were born into it. Upstairs, Muhammad's is close to tears when I ask him how safe he feels. \"We're not safe.

The Russians seem to be bringing the cities of this region into their war regardless of the consequences. And Russian President Vladimir Putin is saying there is worse to come. Putin spoke Thursday at events commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad where Soviet forces defeated Nazi, Germany, 80 years ago, openly threatening the U.S. and other countries supporting Ukraine. \"Clearly, they don't understand that modern war with Russia will be quite different for them,\" he said. \"We won't send our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond, and it won't be with the use of armored vehicles.\" Cities like Kramatorsk already know that the Kremlin is ready to escalate its war on Ukraine.

There's no question about that. But no one doubts his supreme talent as well on the court of tennis. But what went down on Friday in Australia's capital city is highly significant indeed. The 27-year-old Kyrgios appearing on crutches. He recently had knee surgery, this at the magistrate's court in Canberra, the city, Australia's capital city, the city which he was born in fact, having admitted to shoving his ex girlfriend, Chiara Passar. Now, this followed an argument, the court heard, outside her apartment just over two years ago on January the 10th, 2021 to be exact per reports from CNN affiliate 9News. Now, as you mentioned, Kyrgios's lawyers failing to get the charge dismissed on mental health grounds. What the magistrate Beth Campbell said was significant. Beth Campbell hearing his guilty plea then dismissing the charge, accepting the seriousness of the matter was, \"low level,\" meaning a conviction was not recorded. She would add Kyrgios acting in what she called the heat of the moment, calling the incident a single act of stupidity. Now in an Instagram story, Kyrgios is ranked 20 in the world apologizing for the hurt he had caused and saying he was focusing on recovering from that recent knee injury that forced him to pull out of last month's Aussie Open. So let's look at what exactly last year's Wimbledon finalist has been saying, \"I respect today's ruling, and I'm grateful to the court for dismissing the charges without conviction. I was not in a good place when this took place and I reacted to a difficult situation. In a way, I deeply regret.\" Kyrgios adding, \"mental health is tough. Life can seem overwhelming, but I've found that getting help and working on myself has helped me to feel better and to be better.\" The words of Nick Kyrgios there, Isa.",
