The House will vote this hour on a stop yet spending bill to try to keep the government running. But also Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the longest serving female senator in U.S. history, has died at the age of 90. A somber scene you see there in the halls of the Senate this morning. You see her desk there covered with draped with black with those beautiful flowers sitting on top. Senator Feinstein passed away last night at her Washington, D.C. home. She was 90 years old.",

Some of the firsts for the senator include first woman elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the first woman to serve as the mayor of San Francisco, first woman to serve as a U.S. Senator for California, first woman to chair both the Senate rules and Intelligence Committees, and first woman member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.On the Senate floor, several of her colleagues talked about their friendships, her long career, and her legacy, and also her reputation behind closed doors. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER: Those of us who were fortunate to call Dianne, our colleague, can say we served alongside the longest serving female senator in American history. Dianne was a trailblazer, and her beloved home state of California and our entire nation are better for her dogged advocacy and diligent service. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): To her constituents, you need to know we depended on her, just as you did. And she was here every day to fight for you, no matter what. She fought for women. She fought for those who are victims of gun violence. She fought foreign policy that was remote to most people, but she knew every detail. And when Dianne spoke, the rest of us stopped and we listened. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (D-ME): Dianne was such a strong presence in the Senate. She was a determined and tenacious advocate. Many of us worked closely with her on the Intelligence Committee, where she was such an excellent chairman. She was always fair, respectful, informed, and strong. The Senate and the country has lost a model senator, elegant, graceful, kind, compassionate, strong, informed, intelligent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to begin now, though, with Manu Raju. You heard all of those accolades. You heard all of -- they were actually quite emotional hearing from people today. Schumer in particular was extremely emotional, something you don't see from him very often. Give us some sense of what things are like there, and noted that her last vote had to do with the government shutdown and trying to avoid it.",

He has already indicated that he would appoint someone, he said he would appoint a black woman to the seat. There is not the black woman who is now currently serving in the United States Senate. So that was something that he plans to do. But he also indicated it would be someone who essentially would only serve out through the rest of this Congress, the rest of her Feinstein's current term, in other words, someone who would not be running for the Senate right now.There's already a race to succeed Dianne Feinstein happening in the primary in California that has been pretty intensely fought at the moment. So that is -- those are the political dynamics. But today, most people remembering her time in office, her service, and a long legacy as a trailblazer on Capitol Hill. Sara?",

What a special moment to have, not only for someone who's a friend of yours, but for a legend, I mean, a trailblazer. You when -- I've had the pleasure of covering you for a long time, and you have always made a point to talk about women lifting up women and in all of our conversations.And in hearing Chuck Schumer say, all of these women in the Senate stand on the shoulders, on Dianne's shoulders, I'm sure you feel very much the same way right now.",

And I look back on my career there, and I look forward to a world which she helped prepare, where women leaders hopefully can continue to stand on her shoulders and learn the legend of Dianne Feinstein. And there's someone in this studio who said to me as I was going on air just now, I grew up with her. I grew up with her. Well, guess what? I grew up with her, too.

You had mentioned Barbara Boxer, and we did talk to Ms. Boxer last hour, and she said something really interesting. I'm curious if you heard any of this kind of language from Dianne Feinstein yesterday.She said, I talked to Diane Feinstein when I retired, and I announced my retirement. She knew, and she was mad at her. She's like, what are you doing? These are the best years of your life. Did she still have that fighting spirit yesterday when you spoke with her?",

Of course I'm going to do that. She also said, I'm worried about the future of the country. What can we do?And that was Dianne, always bringing questions about how to make the country better, never about herself and her place and her this and her that, always. And she, I just can't think of anybody who brought all the gifts that she did to the Senate. And I hope that this young woman who just said, I grew up with her will remember that and remember this day and that we'll all not just mourn her, but celebrate an incredible legacy.",

And it's so obvious to see what service she provided and how many hearts she touched.I mean, just look at what Schumer said, but also look at what Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy said. Thank goodness Kevin McCarthy is focused on this for a few minutes today, a future for America. And I would like to think that time they spent working on the Water legislation that he mentioned will remind him about the value of bipartisanship and the importance of stewardship for the country, not just for one little part of one's political party.",

Was she working when you were talking to her?

So I just -- I can't think of enough things to say without bursting into tears that would give people who didn't know her an idea of the enormity of her contribution to our country.One more thing maybe, Fred Malek, somebody that Dianne knew and loved, too, was the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, he worked in the Nixon White House. He later chaired the board of the Wilson Center, which I headed for a decade when I left Congress. Fred Malek supported two Democrats only, and everybody knows because I outed him at his funeral, Dianne and me. And I was so honored that he did that he, you know, Dianne led the duo, you know. He recognized what she contributed. And Mitch McConnell recognized what she contributed. And hello, people in Congress, please recognize what each other contributes. Maybe make this just a moment to hug a bit, as the former members of Congress do, and salute our agreements, not our disagreements, and try to keep this government open and try to keep this country or help this country get on a stable course for the future. The threats are grave. I surely know this. I head the Commission on National Defense Strategy. And I see it. Bipartisan, four Democrats, four Republicans. I see it. And Dianne saw it. And may this just be a moment, a moment, a wake up moment in a dismal two days from now when we have to contemplate that our government could close.",

That begins -- is set to begin at noon, really minutes away now.The strike is now going to include two additional plants, Ford's assembly plant in Chicago and GM's Lansing Delta Township assembly plant, that's, of course, in Michigan. In a statement, the UAW says that not enough progress has been made in their talks with those two automakers. And right now, additional members at Stellantis, they're not being called to join the strike. We're going to have an update on that. We're going to continue to follow that.
