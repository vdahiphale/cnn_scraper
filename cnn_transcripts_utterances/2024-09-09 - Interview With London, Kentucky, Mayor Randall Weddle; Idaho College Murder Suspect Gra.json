New numbers from a \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll showing there is no clear leader in this race among likely voters. Let's kick off our coverage with CNN's Eva McKend.

Take a little bit more detail on go ahead and listen to how she's thinking about this debate.

And we should be prepared for that. And, ultimately, what I intend to point out is what we -- so many people know as -- certainly, as I'm traveling around the country in this campaign. He tends to fight for himself, not for be American people. And I think that's going to come out during the course of the debate. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Ultimately, she not only wants to forcefully go after him on that stage tomorrow night, but she also wants to make the case that it is time to move on from the politics and the era of Donald Trump.",

There is zero evidence of widespread election fraud in 2020. No evidence that it's going to happen in 2024 either. He also is calling on the FBI to investigate mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. Remember, he narrowly lost their last election.And it's the battleground which is set to host tomorrow night's debate. Let's get the latest now from Trump world with CNN Steve Contorno. Steve, what more can you tell us about these threats, first of all, and secondly, how Trump is preparing for the debate in Philadelphia? [13:05:01] STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER:  Boris, in many ways, these threats are how Donald Trump is preparing for the debate, because that is certainly what he has been fixated on in the days leading up to his showdown with Vice President Harris. Over the weekend on TRUTH Social, Trump posted that he would -- quote -- \"Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels unfortunately never seen before in our country.\" He was talking about people that he believed cheated in the -- will cheat in the upcoming election, in the case you think he's only talking about people who file fraudulent ballots, of which there is a very, very, very small number of, he specified that he's also including lawyers, political operatives, donors, and election officials, saying that they could face lengthy prison sentences. And as you said in another post on TRUTH Social, he raised concerns about mail-in voting in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, all throughout the state, even as his own campaign is encouraging people to vote by mail, vote early, vote absentee, continuing to attack the method of which people voted that he believes is the reason why he lost in 2020. And if you look at his comments over the weekend, he continued to harp on this at his rally in Wisconsin. Even as he's saying he would find new people to put in prison, he also would release people he believes are political prisoners. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The moment we win, we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime, and I will sign their pardons on day one. With your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing, and plotting will come to an end. We got to stop the cheating. If we stop that cheating, if we don't let them cheat, I don't even have to campaign anymore. We're going to win by so much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, those are big numbers there out of those battleground states, Boris.And another major topic expected in tomorrow's debate is foreign policy. Today, the House GOP unveiled a scathing report on its years long investigation into the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, accusing the Biden administration of pursuing the effort no matter the cost. The report also aims to implicate Vice President Kamala Harris for the chaotic evacuation that resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members and more than 100 Afghans In response, Democrats released a memorandum criticizing the report as politically motivated. CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the State Department for us. Kylie, does the report reveal anything?",

      "speaker": "KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Well, it doesn't reveal any major revelations about how the Afghanistan withdrawal three years ago by the Biden administration was carried out, but there are some new details, Brianna.For example, one of the things that this report does is focus in on the public comments that were made about the withdrawal at the time from the podiums here at the State Department, from the White House podium, and they juxtapose that to things that they have learned about the U.S. assessment at the time from the military perspective in their interviews with senior Pentagon officials, making the claim that the Biden administration was lying and misleading the public as this withdrawal was happening, essentially making the case that they were more worried, as the report says, about optics than about personnel security. We also learned some new details of the negotiations that were happening to try and reach a power-sharing agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government that was favoring the Taliban, according to this report. But we should also know that the person who was doing those negotiations, Zalmay Khalilzad, for the United States, that person was put into place by the Trump administration and struck an agreement between -- with the Taliban that the Democrats are saying in their memorandum put -- that was put out today effectively made the evacuation decision irreversible. So, both sides really point in fingers at one another, as we have seen them do over the last few years on this, Brianna. And when it comes to Vice President Harris, our reporting revealed she wasn't integral to the major decisions made around the Afghanistan withdrawal. But what this report from the Republicans today does is point fingers at the decision made throughout on the Biden/Harris administration, invoking her name, very clearly so, and saying that she was in lockstep with Biden as these decisions were made, though not providing any examples as to how integral her role actually was. And I think it's important to note that, over the weekend, the vice president now, her campaign, put out a statement pointing the finger at the Trump administration five years ago this week for trying to strike an agreement with the Taliban and bring the Taliban to Camp David. So, for their part, the Republicans are focusing in on this, but so are the Democrats.",

The Supreme Court will make the decision, but there was really only one other location that was argued. And that was Boise, the state capital. And if you look at Lori Vallow, Chad Daybell, two very high-profile cases from last year, one being a death penalty case, they were both moved from small towns to Boise that has a large courthouse, a very large jury pool. It is the capital. It is the largest population in Idaho, so we don't know, but quite possibly that's where it will be held. KEILAR:  All right, we will be looking to see where it ends up. Jean Casarez, thank you so much for that. We now know that the suspected gunman wanted for randomly firing at people on a Kentucky highway served six years in the Army Reserve.
