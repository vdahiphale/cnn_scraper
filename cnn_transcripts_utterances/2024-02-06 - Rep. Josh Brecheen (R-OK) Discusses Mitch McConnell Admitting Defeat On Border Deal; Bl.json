That's with the Immigration Nationality Act of Section 2:35 says. And yet, you have an administration who's claiming, well, here's a solution, but the real solution has already been on the books for decades, and they refused to enforce it. In 2017, it was being enforced. We had the lowest number of illegal immigration in our nation's history, 40 years. And yet, what's the difference between 2017 and to date?

That may be why it took nine days for Hamas to ultimately give theirresponse in this case here. But what's also clear is that Hamas has also answered. And even now that these negotiations are still ongoing, the fighting is still very intense in Gaza at this hour. We have seen earlier today that there has been intense fighting not only in southern Gaza, where the Israeli military, for nearly two weeks now, has been pressing forward with a major offensive in western Khan Yunis, where they say they've killed dozens of militants over the last 24 hours. But also heavy fighting and strikes in central and in northern Gaza, where the Israeli military had actually withdrawn thousands of troops in recent weeks. And we're also getting new images of the absolutely, you know, enormous destruction in parts of Gaza. You mentioned that video from UNRWA, the U.N. refugee agency, showing one of the health centers in northern Gaza. Just the absolute destruction all around is startling. But now negotiations will still continue. And the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, as he is set to arrive in Tel Aviv and spend tomorrow meeting with Israeli leaders, it is very clear that the ball in these negotiations is back in Israel's court. Hamas has now responded nine days after Israel, the United States, Egypt and Qatar agreed to this broad framework for a potential hostage deal, a potential weeks-long pause in the fighting. But the details will be critical to work out here. Not only the implementation, but also, it's very clear that infamous response to this initial framework, they are still talking about ending the fighting altogether, ending this war altogether. And it's been very clear from the beginning that that is not what Israel is looking for here. They are looking for a pause that can go from six weeks to months perhaps, but they are not looking for a permanent ceasefire. And it still seems like Hamas is pushing for that. So, how they can bridge that gap and then how they can work on the implementation will be critical to seeing if, indeed, this can go into effect.",

      "sentences": "This is a bombshell finding from the National Transportation Safety Board. It just released this 19-page report. It's a preliminary report about that blowout back on January 5th.And it essentially says the bolts, which would have been the focus of this investigation from the start, were not there. This is the actual type of bolt. This is an AN-6 bolt, pretty common in aviation. This is the bolt itself. There's a castle nut here. And then a cutter (ph) pin to keep this all together. At one point, there was some conjecture that maybe the cutter pin (ph) was missing that would cause this castle nut to work itself free. In actuality, the NTSB says none of these boats were in place at the time of this blowout last month. The NTSB was able to determine this, because they were able to recover the door plug that fell off Alaska flight 1282 in the Portland backyard of a physics teacher. They brought it to their lab in D.C. to do something called destructive testing. They were able to tell from the telltale signs on the door itself and also on the fittings there -- you can see those on the side of the door there -- that these bolts were simply not installed. The running theory from the NTSB now is that these bolts were taken out at some point when this plane was very new. It first flew at the end of October, but the fuselage was delivered by a subcontractor to Boeing on September 1st, of 2023. At Boeing, technicians there noticed some issues with rivets next to the door. They were able to remove parts of the door and door plug, and the NTSB was able to tell from photos taken of the work that took place on September 19th that the bolts were not installed then. This only adds further scrutiny to Boeing, which is really under a lot of pressure right now when it comes to its quality control. And the big question here is why they removed those bolts, and why they did not put them back in. That is something the NTSB is still trying to determine. They want to figure out what the instructions were specifically that were in the instruction manuals there for Boeing workers at its plant in Rendon, Washington. Right now, we just heard from the FAA administrator. There are about two dozen FAA inspectors there conducting an audit of Boeing's quality control. But this is only the beginning. This is just a preliminary report. We will see a final report probably in a year's time. No laying blame here by the NTSB on Boeing, although we could find that in the final report.",

They didn't go to the extent of doing a pressurization check on the ground, which typically isn't done. They'll do a couple of other things before they do that.
