This is a little bit of what he said to us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIAMAK NAMAZI, EVIN PRISON IRAN (via phone): The very fact that I've chosen to take this risk and appear on CNN from Evin prison, it should just tell you how dire my situation has become by this point. I've been a hostage for 7 1/2 years now. That's six times the duration of the hostage crisis. I keep getting told that I'm going to be rescued, and deals fall apart or I get left abandoned. Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out, to finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. And I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures. So, this is a desperate measure. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now he says he's in a general ward, i.e., a more communal part of the prison with others, including perhaps -- although we don't actually know -- anyway, there are two other Americans there -- Iranian Americans.And I guess, you know, I guess he's allowed to talk to his lawyer and others occasionally. Any way, that's what we think. He wanted to do this. As I said, he was out of options. There is a -- an analyst has told us, an expert, that there's some kind of process that's been underway, but in the end, it'll probably involve a deal between Iran and the United States. And for the U.S. is sometimes unpalatable. But experts believe the U.S. needs to be able to chew gum and walk at the same time. Condemn Iran for the things they disagree with on Iran, and yet work with them to get back their nationals and to get a nuclear deal to make the world a safer place. So, this, you know, is something that will fall on President Biden's desk. And that's why he's appealing directly to the president.",

We do have regular contacts. But the fact is, that White House has not had regular contacts with the family. And you know, America has been dealing with this for a long time, since 1979. Like he talked about the hostage crisis. That was in 1979 when the diplomats were held hostage at the beginning of the Iranian revolution. But he's been there six times longer, and they're desperate these people. They been, you know, taken in for no good reason at all, except as political pawns.",

He asked her to break up, and he asked her to leave the house, according to the defense.Well, she is saying no, no, no. I had an agreement that I could continue living in the home. It was an oral tendency agreement that I actually negotiated with the trust representatives because the home is in a trust. And he is saying, I invited you into the home to live there with me, but when we broke up, I uninvited you, and I asked you to leave. Now, she's going on to say, and she's asking for in excess of $30 million in all of this. She's also stating that one, she was still living in the house, that they actually took her belongings out -- she was gone. They took her belongings out. They told her that she needed to pack her bags that she had to take a trip. And so, she went to the airport. At the airport, they said you are now locked out, you are not wanted in the home anymore, you can't go back to that home. They had attorneys. And these are the trust representatives to help her negotiate a deal so that she wouldn't be left without a home. But she's saying they also misappropriated $40,000 of her cash. Now, that's the first lawsuit right there. The second one is, because the defense was saying there is a known disclosure agreement, this has to go within that. There is arbitration. It is confidential. You signed it in 2017, and she is saying nope, nope, with this second suit just filed. She is saying this should be null and void because of two statutes -- the ending forced arbitration of sexual assault and sexual harassment act of 2021, and the Federal Speak Out Act. She's not saying anything else, but federal law says if you have allegations of sexual abuse, you can't do it in this secretive, nondisclosure agreement environment. Now that's where we are at this point. But in the initial suit, she had to mark a box, is this anything to do with sexual abuse? It was \"no.\" so between October and now, that \"no\" has become a yes, and what this means we don't know.",
