As we wait to see when the grand jury's big decision charges might come down, we're learning that Trump is now expanding his legal team, quietly hiring former federal prosecutor-turned-white-collar-lawyer John Lauro. CNN has also learned that this man, Trump adviser Will Russell, will testify before the grand jury for a third time today.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, there's a lot of people over here working with this grand jury.Several prosecutors have already been seen inside the courthouse today, prosecutors from the special counsel's office who we know are working on January 6 and have been working on that case for quite some time. We also have seen the lawyer for Will Russell inside the courthouse. His name is Stanley Woodward. But Will Russell himself has not been seen. And what is -- the grand jury is doing, we do know that they have convened as of 9:00 this morning, they are meeting, and they are at work. They apparently would be having Will Russell testify to them throughout the day or at least in this morning. And we also know that they are going to be hearing from at least one other witness today in this investigation. And so the Justice Department continues to bring evidence, testimony, witnesses before the grand jury, even while Donald Trump has received that target letter and received that indication from prosecutors that there is a very likely case to be brought against him as the former president. And that case, they already appear to know what statutes they want to -- they want to bring, the charges that they would bring against him related to January 6. But exactly what emerges from the grand jury in that indictment, the pieces of it, the witnesses that are the most crucial ones to build the case against Donald Trump, that, we will not know until the grand jury finishes the work and the Justice Department brings that indictment to them for their approval. Again, it all happens in secret until the indictment is returned through the court system and we have it released to us in some way, either from the Justice Department or from the court. But now we just need to sit and watch and wait, because the grand jury could be done today. But, of course, they could always convene again. Any time there together is when they could be asked to look at an indictment.",

CNN's Kristen Holmes is tracking this for us. All right, Kristen, tell us what you're learning about this call. But, also, let's talk about the practicality of what it is that they discussed, because it's not as if McCarthy actually could just expunge these impeachments.",

      "sentences": "That's right.So let's go back in time, because this was actually back in June. McCarthy, at the time when the House speaker was really trying to placate former President Donald Trump, McCarthy had come out in an interview and essentially said that he didn't know if Donald Trump was the strongest candidate in 2024. This enraged Trump, his advisers and his allies, and prompted a call from McCarthy to Trump. Now, during this time as well, we have learned that McCarthy said he personally backed expunging Trump's impeachment, but, as you said, not promising to bring it to the floor in any way, but just saying he would gauge the committee how much actual interest there was in doing this Now, our sources on the Hill are telling Lauren Fox and Alayna Treene and our colleagues that there's no votes here in leadership, that this is not something that would actually happen. So it does sound like this is a little bit more of McCarthy placating him here, again, after this interview. And when we talk to, we get some guidance from the parliamentarian's office, it doesn't really seem like there's any actual consequence of this. They say that there's no clear procedural consequence of a resolution that portends to expunge these impeachments. Those votes still happened in 2019 and 2020 and will be on the congressional record. But this is something that his closest allies are pushing for. We know that Marjorie Taylor Greene has been pushing Kevin McCarthy to do this on the Hill and something that clearly McCarthy has kind of said that he will back in some respects, but no real consequences here and also seemingly very unlikely that it was something that would be able to get done.",

We know from our reporting that Donald Trump's legal team is trying to figure out if Jack Smith has witnesses or evidence that they are not familiar with, that they're not aware of.

I'm sure Trump's lawyers have been talking with witnesses, because it's perfectly acceptable to ask other witnesses who have testified before the grand jury what they spoke about. So, I think they have a fairly good sense of the cards the special counsel has to play. That said, I'm very confident that, if and when an indictment drops, it will contain new information we have not seen before. You will recall, in the Mar-a-Lago indictment, the special counsel filed what's known as a speaking indictment, which is rich in detail and had a lot of evidence. It had photographs that really told the story. I would expect that, if and when a January 6 indictment comes, it will look very similar in style and format and the level of detail and evidence the special counsel includes in it.",

And so, for that reason, I think the special counsel's team probably thought about it, considered it, gave it some weight.

It doesn't seem like he's going to go that route, but not a lot of people had forecast that he might bring a charge under the civil rights statute. It's one that's been on the books for a long time, but, arguably, at least in the special counsel's view, he's got the evidence that would support that charge. I think that's the only one that really caught a lot of eyes of most people. The other charges were things that people had discussed and were anticipating might be brought.",

We're told that this was an administration building. It is near the port, which we can't show you because of security reasons. You can see here that a door is still standing, but that's about it. This is a pile of smoldering rubble. Firefighters have been trying to put out those fires. And you can still see the smoke rising from them. It is not just this building that was destroyed, we believe by a Russian missile. But there's damage all around here. Windows have been blown out, trees knocked over. There's dust everywhere. From the shockwave of these missiles, you can hear this -- the car sirens that were going off during this attack that lasted around an hour-and-a-half. It started just before 2:00 a.m. We heard the air raid sirens. We saw the red tracer rounds flying into the sky to take down Russian drones. And then the missiles started. I want you to listen to a little bit of what we experienced overnight. At least one person was killed here in Odesa, a number of people injured. But Odesa was not the only city that was hit. The southern port city of Mykolaiv was also attacked by Russia. There, at least 19 people were injured. Now, Ukrainians believe that this is directly tied to the grain deal. We know that Odesa's port has been a target for the last three nights. Some 60,000 tons of grain were destroyed in the second night of these attacks. Ukraine says that this is in response to Russia pulling out of that critical grain deal earlier this week. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Odesa. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
