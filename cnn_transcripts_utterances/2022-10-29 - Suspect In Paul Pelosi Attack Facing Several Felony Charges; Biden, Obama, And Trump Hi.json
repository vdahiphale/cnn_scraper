Adding that family members of our elected leaders did not sign up for this and that we should all be disgusted.Speaker Pelosi arrived at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital behind me here by mid-afternoon on Friday. Doctors here said her husband, Paul Pelosi, underwent successful surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his arm and hands. He is expected to make a full recovery. The suspect is also still being treated at the hospital for minor injuries. The police have been able to speak with him, 42-year-old, David Wayne DePape. He is expected to be booked on suspicion of attempted murder, first-degree burglary, and assault with a deadly weapon among other charges. The San Francisco Police Chief said the assailant broke into the Pelosi residence through the back door in the early hours of Friday morning. Speaker Pelosi was in D.C. at the time. The DA said it is really thanks to Mr. Pelosi calling 9-1-1 and talking to a dispatcher in code, and the instinct of that dispatcher to realize something was wrong and making that police call a priority. [07:05:28] Chief Scott said that instinct was lifesaving. He said someone opened the door when police knocked and police saw Mr. Pelosi and the suspect through the doorway, both holding on to the same hammer. Police gave commands for both men to drop the hammer. And the police chief said that then the suspect pulled the hammer away and violently attacked Mr. Pelosi with at least one strike. A Facebook page that DePape's family members say was his, was taken down on Friday but showed posted memes and conspiracy theories about COVID vaccines, the 2020 election, and the January 6th attack. An acquaintance told CNN that he was \"out of touch with reality.\" DePape may be assigned a public defender once the arraignment is scheduled. The D.A.'s office said they expect to file formal charges on Monday with an arraignment likely on Tuesday. Back to you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's at least the way it was in 2020.And the reason all the you know, the Senate, the Senate, and for the Senate and for presidential races, voters are more and more voting the same way. You very rarely see these days, senators or voters vote differently for their statewide Senate candidates than they do for the presidential races.

And look, these debates are, are, are -- voters have come to -- we pundits and voters have come to expect debate performance to be one of the criteria that a Senator should be good at, right, if -- when we elect them, and we see these debates as such an important sort of ritual in a campaign. So, some voters might not understand that his troubles in that debate had nothing to do with his cognitive abilities, they were just this oratory processing issue, right? That's a complicated thing to get across to a lot of voters. But, I think, the campaign and the media have done a decent job explaining that.

So, it's a whole lot easier to draw those areas -- those arrows than it is to actually maneuver in those locations.But Ukraine has done a very good job. Yes, Russia is basically stacking their defenses, with a new mobilized, recruits. But again, those recruits are absolutely untrained, terrible, and adjoining units with low morale. So, what we're seeing really is Russia feeding more meat to a meat grinder, and Ukraine will have increased challenges with countering those kinds of larger units. Because after all, quantity has a quality all of its own. But I think because of the capability of the Ukraine's army, they will eventually wind those down. One of the areas is that southern area of Kherson estimates by the Ukrainian intelligence is that there are close to 40,000 Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnipro River that have no means to escape. So, that's an area that I'm -- I've been watching very closely. When you don't have the ability to resupply soldiers, have them escape or withdraw, it's going to be very difficult.

So far, they're increasing. You know, the president just gave another package of $725 million to Ukraine, just in the last few days. What we're talking about is the potential for the United States and NATO, truthfully, to be affected by inflationary prices based on what's been happening in Ukraine, but also kind of an overwhelming information flow that we see sometimes, and the public gets tired of it, and there's a fatigue. But we have to remember, Ukrainian citizens are fighting for their freedom, for their sovereignty. And we have always presented our American values to other nations, when you're doing that, in this case, going against a Russian force that actually is committing multiple war crimes and illegal activity, what you're talking about, is really having an attempt to sustain that through what's going to be a very tough winter. I'm convinced that we will do that, but it will certainly come up in a debate in Congress and in NATO as well. But the support seems to continue to flow.",

So, there's always been an emphasis on loyalty to the sitting president. But now, when you have been testifying in front of Congress, you realize that the Secret Service's role is different, and it's different in this way.

Their star right fielder Kyle Tucker coming through in his first two at bats, hitting a homerun each time helping the Astros jump out to a 5-0 lead in the third inning. But the Phillies just kept clawing back. They are down to now with two runners on in the fifth catcher J.T. Realmuto rips a double the left center. So, the lead is now gone. The game tied at five. All five of those runs coming off Astros ace Justin Verlander, ending his night with another World Series disappointment. The game was stateside until the 10th, and Realmuto would come up to the plate again, gets a hold of one, a solo shot to right just out of the reach of Tucker.
