Don't expect much, if anything, on the indictment of once and perhaps future rival Donald Trump.With me now to share his insights, our CNN Senior Political Commentator, David Axelrod, who, of course, was the architect of the two Obama winning presidential campaigns. David, thank you for your time. None of us have been here. There's nothing in your Rolodex, that's an old dinosaur term but there is no expert on, how do you deal with a campaign where the former president of the United States is facing a federal indictment and he also happens to be the front runner for the other party's nomination. If Joe Biden picked you up and said, David, how do I handle this, what would you say?",

      "sentences": "I'd say, dude, exactly what he did today. Do nothing. Say nothing. Do not answer questions about this. Do not involve yourself. That's exactly what Donald Trump and the president's opponents want. You can see on their postings on social media where they're going.I mean, the president himself is sort of describing this as a hit job directed by President Biden to take out his number one opponent. Not true, but that's their storyline and all of his supporters are following in line with that, the weaponization of government directed by the president. So don't get involved in that would be my advice. And I think that's clearly what he's thinking himself. And if that is the strategy led by the President of the United States, it would extend to all of his senior advisers in the White House. You worked as a senior adviser in the White House after that first campaign, the Justice Department has been silent. Their philosophy is we let our documents speak in court, but Trump has controlled the narrative for the first 12 hours or so of this story. If you were in the White House knowing that maybe you'd be reaching for the phone, but knowing you can't touch it, you can't call the Justice Department, would you be wincing or do you get that?",

But I would not pick up that phone. I remember when I was in the White House, so one of the first things that we were told is you do not talk to the Justice Department. You do not talk to the FBI. You know, the White House Council will be the interface with those agencies. And that was a hardened fast rule and it's particularly important in this case.",

Multiple sources tell CNN the Trump appointee is on this case that after another judge will handle Trump's initial court appearance on Tuesday. You may remember Judge Cannon from her work handling the FBI's Mar-a-Lago search. That work raised eyebrows even among conservative judges and across the legal field.Let's get more. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is live outside the courthouse in Miami. Elliot Williams, the former federal prosecutor back with us. Katelyn, tell us more about this judge and about what we expect to unfold Tuesday in that building behind you.",

      "sentences": "Well, on Tuesday, we are expecting Donald Trump to come here to this campus in downtown Miami where there is the federal courthouse, a whole complex actually. So there's the building behind me, but there are other buildings here too that would allow for Donald Trump to have quite a secure entrance to the point where we might not even see him physically walk in and out of the building like you see others throughout the day.That's because he could be brought in to another building or underground through a parking garage. And then once he's inside a federal court building, there are no pictures whatsoever, no video and no photographs at all, John. So that is something that is a little bit different than Trump's last appearance in his other criminal case in New York State where there were cameras allowed. That will not be the case here. And there will be quite a bit of eyes on the judge in that courtroom. How the judge is handling this. At first, it will be Judge Bruce Reinhart. We believe he is the magistrate judge, so a judge that handles more of the procedural steps in a case like this. He would be taking Donald Trump's not guilty plea and discussing with him the terms of his release pending trial. But then everything will go to Judge Aileen Cannon. That is because she is listed on that summons in this case that he received yesterday telling him to appear in court. She would be the federal judge that will oversee this criminal case. And much of the question there will be how long it takes? Because Judge Cannon, she will have a lot of latitude on how long it takes her to decide legal issues that arise, how long it takes her to decide evidentiary issues. And she'll get to set a trial date too. So, with that timing question, does this take so long that it would be something that could happen in the middle of the election next year? That's a huge question for the Justice Department and for Donald Trump.",

Or does the -- has the judge indicated that her objectivity is so in question as to require reassignment by the court. And that's a legal question that can be decided.And there is -- and I'll be candid, there is some authority on this in the 11th Circuit which is the appeals court down there that a judge whose objectivity is called into question can be removed from a case. So a number of things could happen. One, the court could simply remove her. Two, the judge could decide to step down and not be a part of the matter. Or three, the Justice Department could themself move to have the judge transferred or reassigned. I want to be clear though, when it's just a question of disagreement with a decision that a judge put in place, you know, look, I wrote opinions for judges that got overturned. The judges I worked for got overturned, it happens. And so the question is, was this a policy dispute or a legal dispute, or is the judge just so tainted that she can't fairly hear this case?

And I remember being at the Dana Point, California for the RNC meeting in January at CPAC. You've seen this kind of march to them being able to defend him, partially because I think there was an assumption from of the other candidates, maybe some of Republican leadership, that this Georgia indictment would come first. That was the most politically clear one to be able to make a case against Donald Trump and that then he will kind of -- voters will fall off maybe from that. But none of that has gone how they have assumed. That indictment has not come first. There's been now two others before that, and Republican voters have rallied around him. And so for me, it is an interesting to see that they're still kind of holding on to the idea that maybe the next one will be something different when there has been so many instances. Over the years that have built us to this point where they have rallied around Trump over and over again. It is not clear to me that that ground has been tiled enough that when the next thing happens, Republican voters would just fall off.
