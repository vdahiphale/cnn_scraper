Ukrainesays it shot down most of the missiles. 61 of the 71 launched at Ukraine on Friday. The strikes hit the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. Now these images show some of the damage as well as the Kharkiv region, where Ukraine says it shot down several Iranian made drones overnight. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is back in Kyiv after meeting E.U. leaders in Brussels Thursday. He made a plea for western fighter jets for Ukraine and Kyiv has now officially asked the Netherlands for F-16s. CNN's senior international correspondent David McKenzie joins us now live from the capital of Kyiv. David, I understand these talks reportedly came in waves in order to evade Ukraine's air defense systems. How much damage was caused overnight?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly not as much damage that could have occurred, Christina. There was a wave ofattacks overnight. It appears there was a dependence on at least some part on the Iranian drones perhaps to try and then bring in the more significant firepower, which was these missile systems and rocket attacks. According to the Ukrainian military, there were land, sea, and air based missiles which tried to strike across the country in the east, south, and the west of the country. It appears mostly to try and target these civilian infrastructure particularly for power generation. As you said, some 60 odd of the 70 missiles Ukraine say were shot at the territory were taken down. That's a very high success rate for the air defense system. Still, they have had to do planned outages in this country, as well as unplanned outages in parts of the east at least. It appears to be the continuing efforts by the Russians to strike at the civilian (INAUDIBLE) in part to cripple the Ukrainian government but also to strike up the morale of Ukrainians. But even today people here in the capital were in the subway system, doing their work, continuing on as normal despite the air sirens going on repeatedly through the day so far. This will be seen as a significant success, I think, in terms of the air defense system. But this comes as there is certainly an increase in activity in the east of the country by the Russians, trying to potentially soften up those defenses. And a lot of talks still by Ukrainians about a possible spring offensive by Russian forces. Christina?",

As you noted, a 6- year-old and a 20-year-old were killed. At least five others were injured, one of them is also a very young child, who is said to be in critical condition. The suspect was shot on sight by an off-duty police officer, who happened to be there. Police tell me that the suspect is a man in his early 30s from East Jerusalem. This is where most of the city's Palestinian population lives. And Benjamin Netanyahu has already called on the suspect's home to be sealed and demolished. And we've been seeing live images from Israeli media of a very large police presence at the suspect's neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Now no militant group has claimed responsibility for this attack, although Hamas militant group that runs Gaza has praised the attack. Of course, Israelis and Palestinians have been in this very deadly cycle of violence now for at least a year. But essentially since the beginning of this new year it's been a stunningly deadly month and a half or so for both Palestinians and Israelis. And actually this car ramming attack taking place almost exactly two weeks to the day from that attack on that synagogue that killed seven two weeks ago. And actually these two neighborhoods are not that far apart. They're in the same area. Now the minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir is already calling on police to put up barriers in this East Jerusalem neighborhood where the suspect is from. Calling on police to check every single person entering and leaving, and saying that he wants to undertake a big operation he says to fight and uproot terrorism, go through terrorist homes, and to stop terrorism before it comes to carry out attacks. But I can tell you, Christina, if those barriers are put up in East Jerusalem and if he undertakes his operation, this will most likely only further inflame this ongoing cycle of violence and could even potentially lead to something even worse -- Christina.",

So we are learning that this balloon was able to potentially collectinformation like communications that were happening pretty much in the vicinity of that balloon. And what we are told is that the U.S. is not extremely concerned about this because they did take steps to make sure that no unencrypted communications were happening within the vicinity of the balloon and also to make sure that any kind of sensitive areas that the balloon might have been flying over were covered up. So they believe that the balloon's ability to actually gather intelligence was quite limited even though it did have the capabilities to do so. Another interesting detail we learned from officials briefing lawmakers yesterday is that they believe that the balloon actually stopped transmitting information back to Beijing once the U.S. made clear that they had discovered that the balloon was over U.S. air space. So all in all U.S. officials are fairly confident that the intelligence gathering capability of this balloon was actually pretty minimal. But what we are also learning is that the FBI here really does not have a great sense just yet of what the payload of this balloon actually looks like. So that's all of the electronic kind of surveillance equipment that the balloon was carrying because most of that payload is actually still underwater. So they are kind of weaving through all of the components of the balloon that they were able to gather from the surface of the water after of course it was shot down last Saturday. But a lot of it remains unrecovered because it has been so difficult to kind of get all of that stuff off of the floor of the ocean. And so that is probably going to take quite a bit longer. But for now we are learning that U.S. officials do have a fairly broad understanding of what this balloon can do. And of, course the size of the fleet of these balloons which they say have crossed over roughly 40 countries across five continents over the last several years -- Christina.",

Former U.S. vice president Mike Pence could testify against his old boss Donald Trump. A source tells CNN that Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Trump's role in the January 6th, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The crowd, you'll recall, was heard chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" for his refusal to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win. Pence so far has not publicly responded to the subpoena. But there could be a lot of twists and turns before Mike Pence actually sits down to testify. Here to look at that is the CNN senior law correspondent Paula Reid joining me live now.

But when it comes to January 6th, Mike Pence is arguably one of the most valuable witnesses you could have. He could testify about conversations he had with the former president, leading up to January 6th. The broad pressure campaign that he faced from people who didn't want him to certify the election results. And what happened in the administration on the day of January 6th and the following days. Now I don't expect that he will be willing to talk about everything. There will likely be some limits. There are some legitimate executive privilege questions here. But he has made it a little more difficult to raise those challenges because he wrote about a lot of this in his memoir. And you can't write about something in a book and then you go to a grand jury and try to assert privilege. So it was very much expected that he would likely provide some testimony. The subpoena came after months of negotiations between his team and the Justice Department. And now it will be interesting to see just how much evidence he is willing to share with investigators.",

He could potentially successfully raise privilege over those because, again, when you're talking to the president the United States it's not like conversations you have with other people. There are privileged claims. Now the former president so far says he does not intend to intervene here. So far he and his attorneys have not been very successful in trying to prevent other witnesses from talking by raising privilege. But, again, the vice president is a different case. But anything that he wrote about in his memoir is likely to be fair game here. And the fact that he's getting a subpoena now that doesn't mean that there is an impasse or necessarily that this is an escalation. A lot of witnesses like to be subpoenaed because it appears last that they are voluntarily cooperating against the former president.
