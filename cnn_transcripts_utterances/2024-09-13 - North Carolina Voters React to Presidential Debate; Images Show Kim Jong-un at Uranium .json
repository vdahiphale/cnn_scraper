If you're just joining us here are today's top stories.33,000 union members at Boeing are now on strike after overwhelmingly rejecting a new contract with the troubled aircraft manufacturer. It's the first strike at the company in 16 years. Union leaders had described the deal as the best it had ever negotiated with Boeing. Vladimir Putin is warning NATO countries against letting Ukraine use their long range missiles to strike Russia. Putin told reporters it would mean NATO members, including the U.S., are quote, at war with Russia. He said Russia would then have the right to decide how to respond. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail. Harris is calling for another debate and Trump insists there won't be one. He rallied in Arizona while Harris campaigned in North Carolina. Both are swing states likely to play a major role in deciding the election. The state of North Carolina hasn't gone to a Democrat since former President Barack Obama won it in 2008. But Kamala Harris is making a big play for voters there. A recent poll shows Harris ahead by 3 percent among likely voters. That's within the margin of error. But that's putting pressure on Trump, who won the state by just over 1 percent against Joe Biden in 2020. The state's governor says he's optimistic for a Harris victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER, (D) NORTH CAROLINA: If Kamala Harris can win here, then she's the next president of the United States. So I think this is her 18th visit to North Carolina as vice president. Her presence here means a lot. So coming here as much as she can, we obviously want to see. They're not that many people who haven't made up their mind. But there are a lot of people who haven't made up their mind whether they're going to vote. If we can get those people to the polls, which I believe we can, Kamala Harris can win North Carolina.

They come back and they say, this certainly could tie directly into the U.S. presidential election, with Kim Jong-un trying to telegraph beyond his borders that both of the presidential candidates should certainly not, from his point of view, forget about him or forget about North Korea.So when we look at these images, you know, we are accustomed to seeing pictures of North Korean nuclear equipment looking like something you would see out of the old Soviet Union. But again, with these images that are new, extremely difficult to verify coming from North Korea, we see what appear to be row after row of gleaming centrifuge. Gleaming centrifuges, which are used as the primary machinery to refine and weaponize, enrich, I should say, weaponize uranium to be used in nuclear devices. So again, nuclear and North Korea experts are saying this could be Kim Jong-un trying to say North Korea is nuclear and it's not going back to a time when it wasn't. Now, earlier this week here in the Seoul region, I had the opportunity to speak to former President Trump's fourth National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien. And I asked O'Brien, would there ever be a chance of the United States agreeing to a nuclear freeze with North Korea? Saying that it has nuclear weapons, but no more nuclear weapons for the North. He said that would be extremely tough. Listen to his comments. ROBERT O'BRIEN, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: To excuse the North Koreans and say, OK, it's OK for North Korea to have a bomb. It's pretty hard then to say, well, no, Iran can't have a bomb and Saudi Arabia can't have a bomb to deter Iran. It can't just be that the bad guys can hit the bomb with impunity.",

A nuclear test from North Korea has not happened since September of 2017. And with a country as elusive as North Korea, no one can know for sure. Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
