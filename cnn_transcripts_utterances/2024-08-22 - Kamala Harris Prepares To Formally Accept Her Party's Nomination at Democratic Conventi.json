Kamala Harris prepares to formally accept her party's nomination at the Democratic Convention. We'll have a preview of her message to the American people. U.S. President calls the Israeli Prime Minister, stressing the need on getting a deal done as negotiators continue to try and   push for a ceasefire deal. We are live in Cairo with the latest. And investigators are trying to determine what went wrong as divers work to recover the missing from a luxury yacht that sunk off the coast of Sicily. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is poised to make history. Just hours from now, she'll become the first woman of color to formally accept a major party's presidential nomination. Democrats will close out their convention in Chicago with the keynote address, of course, from VP Harris. As it's been all week, the atmosphere inside the United Center is expected to be a celebratory one, a far cry from how many Democrats were feeling just a few weeks ago. Harris' running mate Tim Walz had the spotlight last night. Minnesota's governor leaned into his background as a high school football coach.

I think Walz -- what Walz is trying to do is to offer something to suburban Americans   and even conservativecultural voters in some of the swing states who might be normally voting Republicans, but have been a little bit alienated by the way Trump has behaved over the last eight years. He's offering an alternative opportunity for white male voters, middle-aged voters, for example. I mean, a lot of what he says might sound to viewers outside the United States as a little hokey and a little cheesy. The whole football coach talk. He was a high school football coach. He wasn't in the NFL, but it can sometimes work in American politics. He's not the typical Yale-educated lawyer as he pointed out, that tends to be found on a presidential ticket. And of course, he's a counterbalance to the historic potential of Kamala Harris as potentially the first black woman president. So, it looks like her decision to pick him was quite a shrewd one politically, the way it worked out last night, and we're just going to have to see how Trump responds to all this. I think that's the big question running out of this convention. Can Trump somehow get his own campaign under control and make a sharper argument on economics and immigration?",

So, when the first instance, tonight, she's got to lay out some policy, then she still has not sat down for a feature interview with some hard questions or a press conference, and then we have the debate, September 10th.

Some people have viewed her campaign and the fact that sheonly has to run for another 75 days is actually an advantage, because that allows her strategist to really pick their spots. Of course, she's going to have to end up doing some kind of interview. That forum has been a liability for her and a weakness in the past, sometimes early in her vice presidency, especially on issues like immigration, she seemed to struggle in elucidating her own policies at times. The debate clearly is very crucial. We just had a debate and it was the most consequential presidential debate in history. If Harris can get through that, the next debate without any damage, she really only have a couple of months to sustain this momentum, and she would be in a good position. So, everything she does is a test. This is a hard thing she's trying to do, to come from basically, the side-kick to President Joe Biden to suddenly be in the middle of this, you know, American and global spotlight. So, you know, no modern nominee has tried to win the nomination and to win the election. And as many Democrats see it, save democracy all in the space of three months.",

Vance, are continuing their battleground state tour this week whileVance -- pardon me, while Vance campaigns in Georgia. Trump is touring the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. He is expected to talk about security and immigration. That is in the coming hours. Meantime, a source tells CNN, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to suspend his campaign on Friday. He's reportedly in talks to endorse Trump over Harris. CNN's Kristen Holmes is tracking the Republican ticket, and she does join us now from Tucson, Arizona. Good to see you there as you are following the campaign. I do want to get to RFK. Jr. first. How close do you believe the Trump campaign is to securing his endorsement? And how much of a difference could this make? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think they're very close. I mean, look, we know that RFK Jr. is going to suspend his campaign tomorrow. He's going to be in Phoenix. We also know Donald Trump is holding a rally just outside of Phoenix in a town called Glendale. So, what I've been told is that these are ongoing conversations. They've been happening for several weeks, and they've been really led in part by Tucker Carlson and Don Jr., Donald Trump's son. Now, these conversations are not completely finalized yet, but obviously, we're inching closer to that announcement in Phoenix tomorrow. It would likely move the needle at least somewhat. Now, how much? That's the big question. Would it actually make up for any polling in which Donald Trump is lacking? That is unknown. But for example, here in Arizona, the most recent polling we've seen, RFK Jr. has about 6 percent. That is a big margin in a state like Arizona, a critical battleground state, a state that Donald Trump feels like he needs to win. Can he get any of that? Can he get a majority of that? That's the big question. So, what they're hoping for here is that he will endorse and that it could move the needle at least twice past there being any question of Donald Trump being as close to Kamala Harris. Again, we don't actually know what him dropping out would do. We don't even know what his endorsement would do as everybody who is going to vote for RFK is not going to necessarily vote for whoever he endorses. They liked things specifically about RFK. And remember, he is generally incredibly progressive, particularly on specific issues like the climate. So, those people who were maybe focusing on RFK because of that, they might not necessarily be voting for the former president, but we are going to be in an election in November that is incredibly tight. Both sides will tell you that. It's going to come down to a handful of voters. So, if this could move the needle at all, Donald Trump's team is very excited about it and they hope it will.",

They believe that this is an issue that he won, they saw, pulled ahead of President Joe Biden on, but they believe he can still pull ahead of Kamala Harris on, and it's an issue that's very important to voters. The interesting thing about this, this is called a messaging event. Meaning, there aren't really anyone else here except for the media. He is going to be touring the wall. He's doing this to send a message from the border here. One of his main arguments against Kamala Harris is the fact that she was tasked with doing some work on the border that they say wasn't successful. You've heard Donald Trump say that multiple times. He will be here hammering that same message today. Also talking about how immigration relates to crime. We know that he has been fear mongering with that, saying that immigration is leading to higher crime, especially in areas like this in Arizona.",

Espina is a 25-year-old activist and aspiring lawyer who works to uplift the immigrant community through social media. Good to have you on board. I mean, the topic that you speak of has been quite contentious. We were just listening to our correspondent who's at the border with the former president today. I want you to listen now though, to both candidates as they speak about immigration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. Comprehensive reform that includes health care, yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Most of the job creation has gone to migrants. In fact, I've heard that substantially more than -- beyond -- actually beyond the number of 100 percent, it's a much higher number than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And like youmentioned, I think my message last night is something that has kind of been lost, I would say, even by both parties over the past few years, and it's focusing back on the humane aspect on immigration, and not forgetting that throughout our history, immigration has been good. I think over the past years we've made -- we've been made to believe that immigration is bad, that, you know, immigrants are hurting the country, poisoning the blood, whatever the narrative maybe. So, I think we need to, you know, scale back a little bit, look things from a different perspective, look beyond all the rhetoric and all the hate and realize that, you know, there was a time when Republicans and Democrats both agreed on this issue, maybe not always 100 percent, but at least there was some consensus that today has been lost, and what I'm seeking is to move back in that direction.",

      "sentences": "Well, the first thing is this, there's this narrative, right, that as long as there's not zero border crossings, that there's a problem, Idon't think that's the case because what we have to accept is that there's always going to be people who want to come to the United States, as long as we're the greatest nation on Earth. Why don't people do the same, go through the same suffering and, you know, effort to migrate to China or to Russia? They want to come to the United States because it's the greatest nation on Earth. That's not necessarily a bad thing. So, we have to accept that people want to come. Now, I do agree there is an issue, a political issue, when it comes to how we handle those people who do want to come. Because there's not enough legal pathways, there's not enough ways for people to migrate legally, they are forced, essentially, to come through these illegal pathways, which I myself don't support. I think it's very dangerous. I've met many people, you know, who are here and they had to cross the desert five, six, seven days without water. No one wants to do that. They do that because there's no other choice. So, what we need to do if we want to really care about, you know, lowering the number of border crossings is create legal pathways so people don't have to take those paths and then we can find solutions. And at the same time, we do have to recognize that, yes, over the past few years, and not just under Biden, under Trump as well, there's been a few people who have come here and have done bad things. We can't ignore that reality either. And those people, there should be consequences, they should be dealt with - -",
