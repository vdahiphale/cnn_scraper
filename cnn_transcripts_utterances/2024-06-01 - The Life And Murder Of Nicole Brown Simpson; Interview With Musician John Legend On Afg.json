But finding out that all of the things that happened even after her murder and the controlling behavior of this guy, it just -- it's this -- people need to do not ask the why question, but they need to be supportive and learn everything they can because victims of domestic violence are usually ashamed of coming forward and talking about it.

The South Korean government actually outlawed it in 2020. Some people continue to do it clandestinely. And so I think this is the North Koreans saying, well two can play this game, except we're just going to send over actual garbage and have it explode and land on your streets and fields and other places. So I mean, if anything, it's a bit silly, but symbolic of what's an ongoing source of strain between the two Koreas, perhaps not a great harbinger of where we are in that cross-strait (ph), in that relationship. As for the robo dogs -- again it can be viewed amusingly, but it's something rather serious here, which is that we've seen in some recent -- in many recent wars, including in Israel, Gaza, and in Ukraine, the increased use of drones, of remote-controlled weaponry and this is another example. It's the latest generation of remote-controlled weaponry. It's a cute- looking robo-dog that has rather lethal machine gun placed on it. And so it's one more example of, if you will coming off the A.I. discussion, how technology will transform warfare and the look of warfare and some of these things that don't seem immediately as fearsome as old-fashion fighter jets or tanks really can be quite lethal as well.",

And then at 8:00, we started the morning assembly and when Major Yanai was speaking to us, giving us the cheer pep talk then suddenly I saw the bluish white flash and I still have the sensation of floating up in the air. And when I regained the consciousness I found myself in total darkness and total silence and I tied to move my body, but I couldn't so I knew I was facing death. Then I started hearing faint voices of my girlfriends around and they were asking for help from their mothers, from their God. And then somebody's strong male voice said that, don't give up, don't give up, keep pushing, keep kicking. I'm trying to free you. So with this man in the dark, I was rescued.
