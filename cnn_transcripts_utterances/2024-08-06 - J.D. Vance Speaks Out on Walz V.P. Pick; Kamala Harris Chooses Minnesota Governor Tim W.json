Kristen Holmes joins me now. She follows the Trump campaign for us. Kristen, one thing I also noted is that Trump has put out a TRUTH Social post saying simply \"Thank you!\" with an exclamation point. Normally, he has attack lines ready to go. He's come up with nicknames and so on. We haven't heard any of that yet.",

Even before we broke the story that he was going to be the pick, I was literally on the phone with someone who said to me that they hoped it was Walz because it would fit into the narrative that goes with Kamala Harris.They have said that she is a radical liberal from California and they think that he fits into that because he is a favorite among progressives. I'm going to read you one quote from a source close to the campaign, who said the choosing of Walz, in that, that Harris bent a knee to the antisemitic, anti-Israel left and chose someone as a dangerously liberal as she is. You are going to hear this over and over again, the particular part of that phrase, dangerously liberal. We have seen Republicans across the board who are working to define Tim Walz as someone who the progressive loves, as somebody who is part of a liberal agenda. And just to give you some of what that statement said -- I know you talked about part of it just now, in the... (CROSSTALK)",

Many, many people said repeatedly that the reason Kamala Harris was going away from the Josh Shapiro selection is because they were worried about antisemitism. They were worried about certain voters. They were worried about some of the leaders and the grassroots activists and their party wouldn't take a Jewish nominee. I think it's despicable, I think it's disgusting, but that is rightout of the words of many members of the Democratic leadership. And so now we have Tim Walz, but, again, most importantly, we have Kamala Harris. Her policies have been a disaster, and they will remain so if the American people give her a promotion. (CROSSTALK)",

One of the things you have got to do is, of course, get out there and speak to people and speak to reporters. A final thing you have to do, of course, is raise the resources. And I know the president is very busy doing exactly that. So he and I are taking a divide-and-conquer strategy to this campaign. Sometimes, we obviously do events together, but I think we're going to use the fact that we have two people who can both get out there and prosecute a message. We're going to hit the road. But I really want to make just one final observation. I know most of you. I like all of you as people, or at least I like the ones of you that I know. I think that you guys have got to do a better job at actually forcing Kamala Harris to answer questions. This is a person who's been the presumptive Democrat nominee for 16 days. She hasn't taken a single real question from a reporter. The American people deserve to get to know the people who want to lead them. And I think it's shameful for Kamala Harris, but increasingly for the media that she's taking a basement strategy of running from reporters, instead of getting in front of them, answering tough questions about her record and letting the American people know who she is. President Trump and I take hostile questions. We take non-hostile questions. We get out there and talk to people because we respect the American people enough to want to persuade them, and not to try to run for them. So I think you guys got to do a better job. That's my humble opinion. Take it easy, guys. Thank you.",

And, as we know, this is a pretty divided race. So the fact that J.D. Vance did reach across and reach out to Tim Walz is notable. But the other part of this, as you noted, J.D. Vance has had a rocky rollout, but part of the reason they selected him was because they believe he is a bulldog. They want him out there attacking on the front lines. He really hasn't had a full opportunity to do that because he himself has been under an enormous amount of scrutiny. That is going to change as he moves forward, as he can continue to double down on these attack lines. And what you heard from him there is what we have been hearing from Republicans across the board. Again, they want to paint this as the most liberal ticket in modern history. And while we have talked about the fact that Tim Walz is from a state where he has had to reach out to independence, it appears that the campaign actually has noted that. They have talked about his reaching out to moderates. And I know that your team is probably going to kill me here, because we went over a bunch of full screens that I was going to toss to, and what I'm about to read isn't on any of them, but I do want to pay attention to it here...",
