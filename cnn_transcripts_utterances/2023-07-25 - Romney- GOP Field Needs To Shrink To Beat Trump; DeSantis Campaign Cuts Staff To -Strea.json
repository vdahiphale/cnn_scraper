But unlike in 2016, this time, Trump is the frontrunner.So Republican Senator Mitt Romney says in a new op-ed that his party should whittle down the field no later than February so Trump can't conquer and divide all over again. The most vocal Trump critic in the race agrees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't disagree with Mitt. I think especially given the date he put on it. I think there will be a lot of narrowing even before Iowa. I think there will be narrowing created by the debates. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking donors for more money or voters for their vote if I didn't see a realistic path to victory. So, I don't disagree with Mitt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You still see, if take a look at the numbers, an overwhelming Donald Trump advantage, 46 percent among Republican voters. And 20 percent is where Ron DeSantis, the next closest competitor, is. A 26-percentage point lead is not a small one. Obviously, you've got six months or a little less to go before the Iowa caucus kicks this off. We don't just see this in national polling but we see it in the states also. We saw a FOX Business poll over the weekend. In Iowa, South Carolina, same story. A race dominated by Trump.

We'll see him in Iowa on the bus tour later this week and more in Iowa. And what we are seeing, this started out as a national campaign. They were going to be everywhere. It wasn't just the early states. And then it shrunk. And then it shrunk. And now we're seeing them with their eye so focused on Iowa. They've got to do well, of course, as those will be the first votes in all of this. But 38 members of their staff, those stories, the reset stories keep coming. Usually, the campaigns want to drop that and move on. It's not uncommon to see a summer reset like this. It happened in past presidential campaigns. The question is, can they adapt.

I also think it's interesting, Mitt Romney is saying publicly what so many are privately, especially on the Senate side. You talk to Republicans, they'll say this privately. It's not often that they'll write an op-ed in the paper about it. I want to read one quote. He said, \"Our party and our country need a nominee with character driven by something greater than revenge and ego, and preferably from the next generation.\" He's certainly trying to help guide this process. And also, he said, \"Don't rely on the party to do this like you have in the past. The party does not hold sway with these candidates and does not hold sway with these voters.\"",

As you mentioned, Qin Gang was last seen just about one month ago. He was in Beijing, meeting with officials from Vietnam, from Sri Lanka, from Russia. And then suddenly, began to disappear from the public spotlight. In fact, he missed some very crucial meetings on the global stage, including a meeting with an E.U. official. He was not seen when U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen came to China, as well as John Kerry. And that has now prompted all of this conversation as to what happened. It was on Tuesday afternoon, in fact, Jim that a government official, a spokesperson, was actually asked, where is he? What's happening here? And the official line was no information to provide. And then hours later, we saw the announcement of this departure of this demotion. As to what prompted it, again, no dominant moment or story line seems to surface.

And when the temperatures reach the temperature threshold, they release those and they cannot feed, you know, and if they don't go back to normal, they will starve to death.

That's the work that we intend to do is to keep those populations going. But with no actions, you know, didn't carry through the action, that kind of action, we are in a very difficult situation.
