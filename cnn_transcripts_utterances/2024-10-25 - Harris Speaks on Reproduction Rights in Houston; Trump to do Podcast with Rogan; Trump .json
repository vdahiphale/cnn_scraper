The new numbers, only further reinforcing how important the seven battleground states will be to the future direction of the country. And so, today, both Harris and Trump are headed to Texas. Not a battleground state. Trump will be focusing - Trump will be in Austin, Texas, focusing on immigration and border security and sitting down with podcaster Joe Rogan. Harris will be in Houston, where she's going to focus on reproductive rights with Beyonce at her side. It comes after a bunch of stars turned out last night for a rally with former President Barack Obama for Kamala Harris. CNN's Eva McKend starting us off this hour.
