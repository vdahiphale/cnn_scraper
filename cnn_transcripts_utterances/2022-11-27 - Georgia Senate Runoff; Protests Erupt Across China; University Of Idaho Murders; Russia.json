West showed up at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club with Nick Fuentes.West has been banned from most major social media platforms. Sources told our Kristen Holmes that Fuentes was a guest of West's and not invited by Trump. But they sat at Thanksgiving dinner along with others at Trump's outdoor patio table. Trump was engaged with Fuentes and found him very interesting. Fuentes said he had a good understanding of Trump's base and told him that they prefer it, when he speaks off the cuff and ad-libs during speeches, which, of course, Trump's advisers do not want him to do. And at one point during the dinner, sources told Kristen that Trump liked Fuentes. West echoed that sentiment in a video he posted on Twitter, claiming that Trump is, quote, \"really impressed with Fuentes.\" But all of this is creating considerable controversy for Trump, who just announced he's running for the White House again over a week ago. And Trump has already made attempts to explain Fuentes' appearance at his private club. I just want to read you the statement on this. He said, quote, \"This past week Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. \"We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.\" Of course, in his post he has the opportunity to condemn the ideology that Fuentes has espoused.
