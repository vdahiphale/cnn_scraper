You heard the prime minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu, there say that even if Hezbollah tries to reconstitute itself, never mind fire missiles, they will be fired at. I think the perception is in Israel that this is a political game changer in Lebanon and that Hezbollah just won't be able to get that strong again. History has shown us that's not the case. I think over the longer run, the concerns of some of Netanyahu's cabinet members, the concerns of some of the people that live along the northern border, those fears that Hezbollah will become a threatening force again from where we stand today, those fears appear real over the longer term. And I think therefore, while it gives Israel an opportunity to focus on Gaza and focus on other issues, the longer run, I really feel this has not changed the playing field, the military playing field, the political regional playing field that much in the Israel, Lebanon, Hezbollah relationship.",

He projected a vision for this permanent ceasefire. Of course, he's hoping it will be permanent. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is saying that the duration of this truce between Israel and Hezbollah depends on what happens in Lebanon. That essentially leaves open the door to more Israeli military action. How confident are you that this ceasefire can hold? SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA), INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN: Well, I'm actually very hopeful that it'll go well beyond the 60 days and I commend the Biden administration for being at this. This has been -- I've talked to some of our intelligence community leaders even since the ceasefire has been announced. This has been a long road to ho. I might, you know, candidly, a little bit disagree with some of the earlier commentators. I think it was important to get to the ceasefire for a couple reason. One, Israel has been very effective at taking out a lot of the capacity of Hezbollah. And yes, they have the ability to come back.

And that's good news for the Lebanese people who want peace. It's also obviously good news for Israelis who want to return home in the north.I also think this now undermines even further Hamas. Israel has taken out the Hamas leadership. We need to end the conflict in Gaza as well, not only for the, obviously the enormous number of Palestinian casualties, but also the fact that those families can get returned.

I also think leading up to this, the Lebanese people were frankly getting pretty darn tired of Hezbollah putting them in harm's way. And this is why I'm glad we've got a ceasefire. Because the longer the Israelis stayed in, the longer they could actually unify the Lebanese people against Israel. And I think the ability for Iran to get arms on a kind of business as usual basis in light of the conflict both in Lebanon and in Gaza over the last year plus actually has been diminished. Will they -- could they come back? Yes. Will they come back at near the same military strength in the near term? I do not think that is the expectation.

You cannot destroy every terrorist if you're continuing to kill innocent civilians. And the potential to actually have a greater support for a terrorist type organization that would go beyond the Shia base in Lebanon to include Sunni, Druze, Christians even potentially was quite great.So, I think that is diminished. But again, these next 60 days, to maintain that truce, is critically important. And I hope again this will increase the pressure on the remnants of the Hamas leadership.

I think that was a mistake. I appreciate Kamala Harris's loyalty to Joe Biden. And I think up through, say, the convention, it was important to celebrate and appreciate his achievements. But after that, it was time to draw some distinction. It reminded me, unfortunately, of what Hubert Humphrey did with LBJ in 1968, where he just wouldn't separate enough on the Vietnam War to reach a lot of people who would have been his voters. So in the end, you know, that interview on \"The View\" was particularly damning, unfortunately, where Kamala Harris couldn't name something she would do different than Biden. And the people of this country, sadly, you know, have become disenchanted with Biden no matter how many successes. So, this is going to be, I think, part of the history.

So she could not go out and distance herself and present this change message effectively, because she wasn't changed. She was a continuation of the existing administration of the past four years. And then two, Donald Trump did have a big advantage against her, especially in the battleground states. He had been out there speaking to the people for a long time, and she was having to introduce herself at the same time that she was trying to run against him. So there was a delay there.I think the Democratic Party might have figured this out a little bit sooner, though, as part of the failed candidate discussion.

There's a whole host of things that you talk to 100 Democrats and you get 100 different answers of what went wrong in this election. This was a really stinging election for Democrats.

So one, I think there's a kind of roll up your sleeves, we got work to do reality that a lot of people are feeling, that's a good thing.But second, let's be honest. We've got to be more honest. Part of what happened here is American people were pissed off that they felt the Democratic Party was covering for Joe Biden. They were already upset with Joe Biden on a substantive level, not always fairly, but they were on things like inflation and people are hurting. And, you know, look, I'll take my share to blame. I mean, I wanted to believe Joe Biden could make it through. He was a great president in many ways. I wanted to believe he could hang on. But it stood to reason that he should not continue as our candidate. It stood to reason that one term was right. And a lot of Democrats kind of kept their mouth shut. And I think people felt out in the country a little betrayed by that. So this time, why don't we be the party of bluntness and authenticity? Why don't we take a, ironically, a page from Donald Trump's book and be a little blunter and a little less worried about diplomatic language.
