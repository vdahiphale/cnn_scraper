If you look at this water all the way up to here right now, this is supposed to be a driveway.And if you see that sign in the distance that says \"No Lifeguard on Duty,\" there's supposed to be a walkway for another 20 feet after that before the beach. A local resident told me there's a whole parking lot beyond that sign before the beach typically begins. So, we've seen a lot of people coming to the water's edge to take pictures here. Someone who said that she's lived here for 30 years and is just very intrigued to see this. And we also saw someone trying to kayak in these waters. Not sure if that's entirely recommended. But we also went across the river to the other side to give you a wider look at the Russian River from where we are here in Guerneville. So, you can see that video of just how wide the river's gotten. Again, even if there's not a whole lot of rainfall this weekend compared to the previous storms, there's just been so much moisture over the last couple of weeks that there's not a whole lot of places for the water to go. And we are seeing dangerous situations like in Belmont, California, south of us right now, on the peninsula, where there was a mudslide yesterday in a residential neighborhood. They had to close off that road, and, you know, a very tricky situation there with, of course, part of a hill coming down to the back of these houses. So, a lot of warnings out there for people to still be careful as they are driving, knowing that the roadways can give way. And we are still expecting more rain tonight into the morning.

Why didn't we hear about this on November 2nd when the first batch of classified documents were discovered?

They have an amazing website over at the NIH that talks about the study. But what they're doing is studying a lot of different things and screen time is just one of those things, but they're looking at kids from around age 9 to 10 through age 19 to 20 or so and sort of seeing what happens with their brains and other things as they go through those formative years.And what we're seeing with social media in particular is that kids that are high users of social media, and we tend to think that's more than a couple hours a day, actually show what's called accelerated cortical thinning. So, what does that means for the lay person? That means that the part of the brain, the cortex that actually does the functioning that we need the brain to do, which we call executive functioning in psychiatry, is actually smaller. So, it's actually shrinking. And we see this in other things like alcoholism and some other pathologies as well. But that's very concerning for us as psychiatrists and especially as parents because as these kids grow, you know, the brain continues to grow and develop until about age 25. And so around that age, the brain pathways are somewhat set. And so, if you're thinning out your brain during those years, then when you get to adulthood, there's going to be a lot of things your brain is not able to do. We were already seeing that in a lot of ways. I have patients that come in that are extremely depressed, extremely anxious, troubles, like I said, with motivation, impulsivity, low self-esteem, all of these things. And when I ask them, you know, the average patient is on their phone eight hours a day. And the CDC says that the average teenager is on their phone nine hours a day for -- that's for entertainment. So that doesn't include stuff they do for school or, you know, research at home are so different (inaudible).",

In 1999, our country tried to get a handle on this and decided an attorney general who has been obviously approved by Congress and the Senate, meaning being legit, should be able to appoint a special counsel to look into misbehaviors of a president if warranted. And we just are in a very polarized country now, and Donald Trump is being looked at not just for the Mar-a-Lago documents but for his role in January 6th. And Joe Biden has not had the transparency he's claiming he's had. He's had cooperation with the National Archives and Justice Department, but we'll have to see how both of these goes.

It was nicknamed AMASS, and it was scrapped and now they use ASDE, Airport Surface Detection Equipment, and some -- and they are working on specialized runway lighting to give pilots and air traffic controllers clues as to when there's an intersection.But the problem is a lot of these programs have been on development a long time. Not all of the aircraft are equipped with them. Obviously, commercial carriers are equipped with the most recent, most modern equipment with general aviation or not. And the most alarming statistic is that most runway incursions, about 60 percent, occur at towered airports, airports with a tower. You would think they would happen at non-towered airports. So, there are many reasons, but this is a problem that's been on the radar screen, use a bad pun of the FAA for many years, and it's a statistic that they are worried about trying to bring down.
