We're also staying at this late hour that the Capitol Police apparently first learned of the attack via a live camera feed from the home. More on that coming up. We got a lot to talk about tonight, Alisyn. So here with me in Washington, D.C. before we turn it over to New York, is CNN political analyst, Margaret Talev, also Democratic strategist Paul Begala and Kevin Madden who was a top aide to Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign. Glad to have you all here with you. I want to take a step back for a second if we can, because you know, when the heavy hitters come out, it's normally an issue of this is the consequential time. I don't even remember at this point in time of even the presidential elections to have so many of the heavy weights coming out across the country in this way.

So, it makes sense to bring out Barack Obama and Joe Biden, it makes sense for the Republicans bring out Mike Pence. Trump almost helps and hurts about equally, maybe hurts more than he helps to tell you the truth. I'd be a little more scared, scared of him if I were Republican.

A second later, the defendant wrenched the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi immediately stepped back and lunged at Mr. Pelosi, striking Mr. Pelosi in the head at full force with the hammer, which knocked Mr. Pelosi unconscious.

Children look up to them, grown people look up to them.And so, when you have that kind of responsibility, you really, I mean, look, you shouldn't -- I don't care who you are. You shouldn't be tweeting out anti-Semitic things. But if you're somebody in a position like that where people are looking up to you as a role model and as a hero, then you have an even higher standard. And I think that what we see a lot in sports, I'm not a big sports person. I don't follow a lot of sports, but it is pretty clear to me that there has been a lack of accountability, right? Because they're heroes and because, you know, there's been a lot of excuses that have been made for athletes along the way. And I think that we've gotten to a point in culture where people are trying to say, you know, we're not going to make so many excuses for you anymore.

You need to learn from professors and people who have dedicated their lives to understanding certain philosophies and things that, I think where he was trying to get across, but it -- but it obviously, it didn't come off that way.
