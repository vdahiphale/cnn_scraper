It is a major escalation, one that is renewing fears that Iran could now be poised to step in. The Pentagon tonight is set to deploy additional U.S. troops and fighter jets all to the region in response.So far, we know that the IDF says it's targeting Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. The announcement comes just hours after Israeli raids and artillery fire was reported across the border. Airstrikes also hitting inside of Beirut City limits for the first time since October 7th. Just a short time ago, we saw a projectile over the night sky in Tel Aviv. Now, it's unclear where it came from. The ground operation follows a rapid escalation in fighting over the past couple of weeks along with massive setbacks for Iran-backed Hezbollah. The group's communication took a hit after thousands of their pagers and walkie talkies exploded. Israel has also taken out several Hezbollah leaders, including the man at the very top, Hassan Nasrallah. CNN is on the ground tonight in the region. Senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Beirut and international correspondent Jeremy Diamond is in Northern Israel. Ben, let me begin with you. This is a limited ground operation into Southern Lebanon. It's happening as we speak. What is the situation on the ground right now?",

Israel has an invasion of launching -- has a history of launching limited ground incursions that end up, for instance, in 1982, surrounding where I am, the city of Beirut, particularly the western side.But we have heard from people in the south that the Israeli incursion was preceded by intense bombardments stretching well into Lebanon. We spoke to one family near the border who said that there was shelling all around them, that they were terrified. They called the Lebanese army to extract them. But the Lebanese army had pulled their forces back from their observation posts in the border, and because of the shelling, they weren't able to. Now, we have in Lebanon at the moment more than a million people who've been displaced by Israeli bombing or threats of bombing, and the worry is that if Israeli forces enter South Lebanon in large numbers, it basically becomes an invasion, then a million could become much more. This is a country that has been going through a prolonged economic -- economic collapse. The government doesn't have the resources to house, to feed, to shelter these people and, therefore, people are just terrified that this is the beginning of yet another nightmare for Lebanon.

We saw that -- with Israel, excuse me. We saw that in the -- earlier this year when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders were killed in Damascus. Iran lobbed a bunch of missiles and drones into toward Israel. And Israel and the United States and other neighboring states were successful in interdicting those attacks.

      "sentences": "Well, it is remarkable, and there are a couple of possible explanations. One of them is that these two leaders don't have a whole lot left to say to each other. Since this all began with -- more than 10 days ago, the Pager attacks, the attack on the missile facility or manufacturing facility in Syria, and the killing of Nasrallah, there have been no conversations yet between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. The White House has said that they're looking for an opportunity to do that. Well, it wouldn't be very hard to do one.Second is, I suspect that the prime minister has determined that, first of all, the United States is certainly not going to protest the killing of a mass murderer like Nasrallah. I mean, after all, Hezbollah and Nasrallah were on the U.S. terror list. So, they were well within the bounds of the relationship for that. But I think that the prime minister has calculated rightly that he could ignore the call for a ceasefire that you just heard from president Biden. And that the administration told us last Wednesday night, they thought the Israelis had agreed to. Well, that was just before they began all of this invasion. So, it's a pretty remarkable example of defiance of an ally and, in part, it's because President Biden has declined to use his only leverage, which would be to withhold some weaponry. He doesn't want to do that and appear to be keeping Israel from defending itself.",

Actually, it was the first since the Iranian revolution, and I could imagine seeing that situation again.

But they found that although their chief of staff at the IDF convinced the prime minister that they could achieve their goals through an air assault only, it turned out they couldn't. And so, they were forced at the very end of the 2006 war to launch a ground invasion that didn't go very well.I think they've learned some of those lessons, and I think they realize if they're going to achieve their goal of creating a security environment on the border that enables 60,000 civilians to go back home, they do have to go in and mop things up. But the key question, as your correspondent in the field said, was, what really -- how do you define and how do they define limited and short-term, because that's a very subjective set of things. And if it's really quick and really short, that's fine, but there's a temptation to have the mission complete (ph). And there's nothing, by the way, that would be more welcomed by Iran and Hezbollah than have the Iranians -- have the Israelis bogged down again in the long-term occupation in Lebanon. That was guaranteed to turn the tables back again in favor of Hezbollah over time in the Lebanese environment. So, I hope the Israelis have learned that lesson. We'll do what they're announcing, which is that this will be quick and limited.",

Presidential moments are not Joe Biden hanging out on the beach or Kamala Harris, you know, hanging out with rich donors in San Francisco and L.A. Presidential leadership is going in there and getting an assessment from the people. And what he has heard from the people on the ground, whether it's Georgia or whether he was in North Carolina and more facts are going to come out, but what he heard is, initially on the ground, that people in North Carolina are feeling left behind. And so, from his experience, knowing what a FEMA response should be, he's hearing from people and it's raising concerns, and he's raising that to the attention. Sure, people want to sort of extrapolate and say he's making it up, but he did hear concerns from North Carolina, whether it's from local law enforcement, whether it's from people, supporters. There are serious problems going on there, and Joe Biden was on the beach and Harris is out at fundraiser in San Francisco. Those are not the images you want in these moments of leadership.

And I think that's going to be the key for what Tim Walz has to really articulate tomorrow, is that it's got to come down to character. Like, yeah, you lied about your constituents. They were in his state. He's elected to represent Springfield, Ohio in the most powerful deliberative body in the world. And that's what he does to him, right? He's supposed to represent women and he's saying, well, if you're in a violent marriage as a woman, you should stay in that marriage, or you shouldn't have access to healthcare if you have a complicated pregnancy.
