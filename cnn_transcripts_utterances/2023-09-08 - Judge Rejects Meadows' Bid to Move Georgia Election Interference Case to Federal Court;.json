A decision has just been reached in Mark Meadows' bid to make his case in the sprawling Georgia election interference probe moved to a federal court.A federal judge has just rejected the former Trump White House chief of staff's arguments, dealing a major setback not only to Meadows but also potentially to former President Donald Trump, who just yesterday notified the judge overseeing the case that he too may try to move his case from state to federal court. CNN's Sara Murray is following all of these important developments for us. What more can you tell us about this monumental decision?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we have been waiting for this ruling right? Because Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff was the first one out of the gate saying he wants to move the charges against him in state court to federal court. A big part of the reason that he was doing this was because he wanted to go to federal court and argue essentially that he had immunity from these charges and that they should be tossed out.And what we are now hearing from the federal judge is that Mark Meadows did not meet the threshold he needed to meet in order to move this to federal court. In fact, the judge says the court concludes that Meadows has not met even the, quote, quite low threshold for removal. Now, the judge does note this is a novel case. This is a racketeering case. But he goes on to say that the court finds that the color of the office of White House chief of staff, which is what Mark Meadows needed to prove that he was acting under the color of the office, did not include working with or working for the Trump campaign. So, essentially, these activities that Meadows engaged in after the 2020 election allegedly related to trying to overturn Georgia's election results had more to do with campaign work than had to do with his White House work. So, they don't meet the threshold. The other thing I think is important to note is that the judge goes on to say, even though he is making this decision about the Meadows case, it's not going to have any effect on the outcome of other defendants. He's essentially going to let them go forward, put their arguments forward. We know Jeffrey Clark, who's a former Justice Department official, has a hearing scheduled to do this. We know a couple of people who served as fake electors for Donald Trump in Georgia also have a hearing schedule, because they want to move to federal court. So, the judge is saying, I will hear all your arguments separately, and I will decide them. But it certainly doesn't portend well for them that Mark Meadows did not meet the bar here.",

It does set a bar.So, I think it is bad news in that the judge is saying, you know, you have exceeded your role as chief of staff. So, that kind of argument is going to stand for other people. The judge also mentioned the Hatch Act, which limits what an employee can do that is political versus federal. So, I think that this is going to be bad news for other people who want to go in this direction. One thing I think we should remember, Donald Trump wants to delay these cases. His goal is to push all these trials past the election. So, even though this ruling has come down, I don't think it means he won't try to do the same thing.",

He was actually acting as an adjunct to the Trump campaign.And when you mentioned the Hatch Act, Wolf, you're not supposed to do that. When you're working in the White House, you work for the government. You don't work for a campaign. And there's a line here that says the Constitution does not provide any basis for executive branch involvement with state election and post-election procedures, period. It is not your job.

So, he's, again, saying, this was a state job to decide how they were going to certify their elections, to decide to certify their elections.

So, it strikes me that there would be an appeal directly from this. It's interesting to hear some of the recitations as it relates to the federal government's role in state elections.There are about 12 federal agencies that participate in monitoring state elections. And you can kind of go down the list. DOJ makes sure voting rights are protected. That's something that is in the purview of the federal government. DHS, Department of Homeland Security, monitor cyber crimes as to relates to election, even though those that are held in state when they have all federal offices. So, there will be arguments to be made and there may be some room at the 11th Circuit and certainly at the Supreme Court, when we talk about what role it is. I think the question is, was there a federal involvement in certifying it? Certainly, there is not. But an inquiry into the election, I think, may be an issue that comes up on the appeal. I expect we'll hear that. I don't think this hurts Trump necessarily. I think there will be some other people who will not find necessarily a favorable ear in the court. But certainly this, as it relates to Trump, ends up delaying things. I think Jamie's correct. This case now goes to the 11th Circuit. This appeal will. It will wander its way to the Supreme Court. You heard even the trial judge earlier this week as he was suggesting that those appeals are causing him concerns. He thinks about scheduling those cases and postponing those trials.",

You know, it was interesting, the breakdown in this order. The court said, look at the heart of the matter when you consider what the act is. You can't just say that any old act is enough. You can't say that scheduling calls or setting meetings were overt act. Here, it had to go to the heart of the matter.

I think you all are right that this was, sort of, a dry run. He got to watch the judge, listen to the arguments, and now see the outcome of the game. And he can choose which arguments were persuasive and what evidence he thinks necessary, his lawyers will, what evidence necessary to try to convince the judge to remove his case.Going forward, I think that without any question, this will be appealed by the Meadows team. I think you will still see efforts by Clark and others to move forward as well, to have the case removed. If nothing else, it is a strong case for a delay. And remember that despite what I think was a clear telegraph from the judge in the superior court that he is not intending to try anybody but the two defendants, Chesebro and Powell, in October. Any effort to say, I filed to remove my case, I'm appealing, that's a delay that he will have to then calculate into whether or not he wants to try to waste court time should an appeal or an effort or a new motion to remove be successful. So, this delay plays into their hands. It's clearly not a good day for Meadows, having lost a motion that he brought, but I will suggest there's another page to be turned in this book, and the 11th Circuit will have to make a decision on whether or not the chief of staff has a right to play certain phone calls for a president. I hear all the comments from the D.A. about this is not something that's within his purview and he's acting on behalf of the campaign, but he is, and his efforts and the things that they outline, as acts, overt acts, that furthers the conspiracy, or acts typically done, like scheduling meetings, making phone calls and all. So, this question of, can he do it for the president to have a legitimate business, legitimate reason that could be articulated. Again, there are about 12 agencies, federal agencies, that the president oversees himself. And by definition, that means the chief of staff is involved in. Is there some federal interest that can at least be enunciated in state elections? Not a good day for Meadows but not the end of the road for Trump and the other defendants.",

But the reality is, he clearly, in his role as chief of staff for a president of the United States, should not have been engaged in what his campaign activity. And there's no question about the fact the call to Raffensperger was campaign-related and he was not in his authority as chief of staff to do so.

I just want people at home to know, anybody in Washington, D.C., anybody who's ever worked in the White House, knows it is ludicrous for a chief of staff to behave the way he behaved. For him to pretend that was under the color of his job, if that's true, then everybody in that building should be able to do whatever you want to do during the campaign and afterwards, but it's not true. It's a white glove test. You do not want to get anywhere near the election if you are playing that role. He knows it. Everybody in D.C. knows it. It's a charade, it's a sham, it's a scam.

I mean this was a report that was under wraps essentially until we could get through the Fulton County district attorney actually unveiling her indictments against Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants. This is the sum of what was months and months of work behind closed doors, hearing from 75 witnesses from a special grand jury that can investigate but cannot issue indictments.They can, though, recommend indictments. And as you said, they recommended a lot of indictments. They recommended 39 people should face charges, including 21 people who Fani Willis ultimately decided not to charge. And those include some big names. That includes South Carolina Senator Lindsey Grahams. And that includes two former senators from the state of Georgia, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who both lost in their runoff races. It also includes a number of advisers to former President Donald Trump, Boris Epshteyn, who's an adviser and attorney to the former president, Michael Flynn, who is Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Burt Jones, who served as a fake elector for Donald Trump in Georgia and is the current lieutenant governor in the state of Georgia. So, this is really interesting because it gives you an idea of sort of the scope of wrong doing that this special grand jury saw and also the limitations that prosecutors saw. You know, I know that they went through name by name on this list that they got from the special grand jury and looked through the facts and said, do we have enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these people committed crimes. Because that's the bar you want to go with if we're actually going to bring charges, if we're actually going to try to bring something like this to trial. And we've seen a lot of outrage, I think, today, from Graham, from Loeffler, from others, essentially saying, you know, this is criminalizing people doing their jobs, or, you know, this is a witch hunt or whatever.

Is it more likely than not that someone has committed a crime? When you try a case to a trial jury, the standard becomes beyond a reasonable doubt. She clearly wanted to focus her case on the people that she thought she had enough evidence against to meet that much higher standard and that could account for it. I think some of the interesting things, Wolf, were in the footnotes. There are two grand jurors that said they weren't comfortable with indicting any of these fake electors because they seemed to be doing their civic duty and then there were several grand jurors too who noted they didn't want to indict the senators because they thought they were just blustering, that they were pandering to their base, basically.",

But we don't know.And we don't know, as well, what Raffensperger may have testified to the special purpose grand jury. And that is whether or not he felt like he was being directed to do something. Was there some intimidation to do it? Did he feel like he was pressured to do it? I think those questions sort of remain unknown to us. So, that could have easily played into a decision on whether or not to move forward as well. Likewise, it's not like we have the Trump confession tape. I mean, we have that tape from the call that was made to Raffensperger, and Raffensperger has been very clear that he felt like he was being pressured by the former president and even the former president made some reference that there could be some criminal problems to Raffensperger if he didn't do these things. So, when you have those kinds of contrast presented to a body of citizens that are just trying to make a decision, one can clearly seem so much worse that they then decide, you know, should we move forward with another one? So, you have some dissention in the votes, as we see on the special purpose grand jury report. They didn't all vote the same. I do want to point out, when we look at those votes, one thing that was particularly interesting to me is that they have, in fact, not a unanimous decision as it relates to the former president. Now, that's -- it's a very small margin, there's one vote. But, remember, this is a body that works only with the prosecution. And they hear no defense evidence. They hear no closing arguments. They hear no cross- examination. But there was this one person who felt like they could not indict the former president. That's the thing to watch for in a trial.

But there is something that gives you an idea of how exactly Trump's team is going to spin this narrative. As we discussed time and time again, this is something they like to do. They want to play it out on in the court of public opinion.So, this is what Trump posted on Truth Social today and I'm just going to read you a part of it. He says, essentially, they wanted to indict anybody who happened to be breathing at the time. It totally undermines the credibility of the findings. And then, of course, he adds, election interference here. I was told my advisers before he even issued this statement that this idea that this report undermined any kind of action that they took was something that they were going to really be doubling down on, the reason being twofold. One, they believe that because this report showed so many people that the grand jury wanted to indict particularly a sitting U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, that this, in some way, undermines the report in general. Again, they did not end up indicting these people. They did not end up indicting a sitting U.S. senator, but because that group was so large. The other thing they point to was the interviews that the forewoman of the grand jury gave. Essentially, what they want to do is paint this as somebody who -- and we saw those interviews, she was smiling in some of them when she was talking about these indictments on our air as well -- paints this as a larger picture of a group of people who wanted to indict, as Trump says here, anybody who is breathing at the time. That is the narrative you are going to start hearing from Trump and his team. That is what I was told before this tweet or this post even went out. And that's what we're going to continue hearing. And, again, Wolf, we're waiting to hear from Trump tonight. It will be the first time we'll actually see him since he was arrested in Georgia. And one thing to point out, and I know we've said this time and time again, of all of his legal hurdles, Trump has really been the most angry and the most agitated for months, before he was even indicted in Georgia, about this Georgia case. He continues to maintain that he did nothing wrong. He continues to say, not only was this phone call a perfect, beautiful phone call, but he also says that lawyers were on the phone call. That was part of his new defense that we've been hearing really since January, that because these lawyers were on the call, someone at some point should have raised to him that what he was doing was illegal if they had a problem with it. Again, these are there arguments. I am telling you what their arguments are, what his arguments are and where his mentality is on this, because this is a case that really does angers him more than many of his other legal entanglements.",

She threw the book, the library, and half of amazon.com at everybody that Donald Trump knows. And one of them tried to squiggle and run away today, Mark Meadows, and the judge said, nope, you've got to go back down there and face the music.And that should send a message to anybody who gets pulled into some of this Trump foolishness. There's going to be more Trump foolishness, that there is a law in this country. There's a Constitution. There's a system here. And the fact we have to -- you know, the problem with wrestling with a pig, is you get a lot of slop on you and the pig likes it. So, Donald Trump is having a good time. The system is getting a little bit banged up. But we're not going to put up with this. We're not going to put up with this. And I think that's the message from this judge. And the reason you've got a 40-plus-page explanation is because if anybody does want to read it the way Alice points out, there are people paying attention, there's an education process here. The whole country has got to go back to civic class. We have rule of law in this country. We have division of power, separation of powers, and you can't sit up there as chief of staff and whatever you want, you pretend like you did know better. Mark Meadows knew better and most of these people knew better.

It gives you an indication of how desperate they were, I think, to move this case to federal court, the fact that Meadows and his attorneys decided to take this risk. I've heard from a lot of defense attorneys who thought it was not necessary for Meadows to do that, that they could have made their case or tried to make their case in other ways. And it begs the question of what's going to happen to these other folks who want to try to move their case to federal court, if they are going to put their clients under oath to take the stand to try to make this case. I don't think that Donald Trump and his attorneys are going to do this. I don't think they're going to take the risk. Even if they really want to see Donald Trump move ahead in this case in federal court, I don't think that they're going to have him swear an oath and answer questions when he is a criminal defendant.",
