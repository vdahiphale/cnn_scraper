But in states like Wisconsin, for example, and Michigan, where these margins were so razor thin in both 2020 and 2016, this type of rhetoric could turn off enough Republican voters, enough independent voters, such that it could make a difference.And I think it's really fascinating that you're seeing Republicans and Trump in particular pivot back to this immigration-related rhetoric in the wake of the \"Newsweek\" got a couple of days ago on the abortion issue, for example, in the state of Florida. Democrats feel like they can really capitalize on this issue. Republicans are trying to find an issue that they feel like they can capitalize on once again. Immigration and border security is something that they feel like is a winning issue for them. Of course, that's made more complicated by the fact that Republicans in Congress killed the bipartisan border security agreement that was reached between a group of senators and the White House earlier this year. So I think this is really an attempt by Republicans to shift the narrative back to an issue, immigration and border security, that they think is beneficial to them at the same time that Democrats are set to benefit from the abortion issue.",

Smith pushing back hard on this, writing this in part in the filing, \"The court should be aware at the outset that Trump's entire effort to rely on the PRA,\" Presidential Records Act, \"is not based on any facts. It is a post hoc justification that was concocted more than a year after he left the White House.\"Also this, saying, \"There is no basis in law or fact for that legal presumption. The court should reject Trumps effort to invent one as a vehicle to inject the Presidential Records Act into this case.\" Let's get over to CNN's Zach Cohen for much more on this. Zach, there was a lot to read as this came in while everyone was sleeping. What else did the special counsel say in here?",

They are taking issue with this odd order from Aileen Cannon that came in about, or last month. And it asked both sides to submit briefs for these jury instructions, outlining two different scenarios. One, outlining jury instructions that assumes that the president has the authority under the Presidential Records Act to take these classified records home. And the second one is a scenario where it assumed that Donald Trump had broad authority as president to declassify different documents, both of which Jack Smith argues could, quote, distort the trial if the jury is sort of read in on these two scenarios as if they are fact. As you read in the intro, too, he takes serious issue with Aileen Cannon's assumption that both of these scenarios should be in the jury's minds as they hear testimony if and when this case goes to trial.",

But although there is a trial date set for May, there is no scenario in which this trial will go in May because there are so many rulings that this judge still has not ruled on, including the Classified Information Procedures Act and other rulings that just are our foundational and need to be ruled upon.So this is -- this case is not going anytime in the near future anyway, although Judge Cannon has not said that nor has she put of more a future trial date on the calendar. So I think Jack Smith is not worried, I would assume, about the fact that his appeal will delay things. And also, look, he has no choice at this point, because once a juror, a jury is sworn, something called jeopardy attaches, which means that if she does give these erroneous instructions and they acquit, he can't appeal that. Double jeopardy will apply, and the case is over forever. So this is the kind of issue that you can't appeal later. So it has to happen now. And these instructions are tailored so much in favor of Trump and for an acquittal that Jack Smith would have no choice but to appeal this now.",

He just, he comes in he does his job, and he does it in a kind of understated way, yet he also keeps very tight control of his courtroom.

Now, we also know that of the nine who were killed, all of them were found dead in Hualien County, which is like you mentioned on the eastern side of Taiwan, and it was very close to the epicenter. It is also where were seeing most of the significant damage take place in Taiwan. Now for some context, Hualien County is a really popular tourist destination. It is a rural area and it is also coincidentally where most of Taiwan's earthquakes actually take place. Now, in Hualien County, authorities are telling us that 137 people are still trapped. We knew that some people were trapped in tunnels, those people were safely rescued, but now we are hearing that 137 people, a majority of them in a mining area are still trapped. Now, authorities are trying to rescue them by deploying military troops who are working with local government in trying to evacuate these people, try to get them to safety. Now, Taiwanese authorities are also warning people in Taiwan about aftershocks. They are saying, in the next several days, we could see aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 7.0, which are really actually quite astounding. And let me tell you, as someone who lives in a really seismically active country, Japan, these aftershocks are no joke. I mean, you never know when they're going to start. You never know when they're going to stop and it almost feels like the shaking just never, ever stops, Kate. Now, also because of these aftershocks, we are seeing plans disrupted for Tomb Sweeping Day. Tomb Sweeping Day in the Chinese-speaking world is when people visit their ancestors' tombs and pay them respects, say hello to their loved ones. But again, because of these aftershocks and the damage that we are seeing just across Taiwan, many people are just having to put an end to their plans -- Kate.",

We still have a tornado watch in effect for Southern Georgia, the Florida Panhandle through one o'clock this afternoon because were still finding tornadoes spinning up along this line. Right now, we have a severe storm warning for parts of Southern Georgia. The storm now stretches all the way up into New England and the Great Lakes. I mean, look at this. Heavy rain coming into New York and Philly, snow in Chicago, just wide-ranging problems. Flood watches in effect, for most of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, because we could get one to three inches of rain to come down pretty quickly. And this storm has so much spin to it. We've got wind alerts on either side of the storm and with all of that spin, that is where were getting the severe weather risk. So it continues today from DC down through Charleston, down to Orlando and Tampa for damaging winds, primarily today, large hail, still can't rule out an isolated tornado. The storm system continues to spin through today. You could see the heavy rain slinging through some big cities along the East Coast from New York up to Boston. But that cold air starts to sandwich in from behind, so we start to get the mixing of the ice and the snow as we go through the next day or two. And yes, it is April.

There has been no concrete steps, but keep in mind, we are very concerned about the people that are over in the Gaza Strip that are in Palestine right now, who are not just starving, but are facing the threat of a looming Rafah invasion.

He said: \"This conflict has been one of the worst in recent memories in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians.\" Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen. The president also picked up the phone to talk with Chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen to express his condolences for the lives lost, including one dual US-Canadian citizen. But this moment really highlights some of the tension that we've seen between the US and Israel. The president has increasingly called for Israel to take greater care when it comes to protecting civilians and also urging them to get more humanitarian aid into the country. Of course, the president is also facing pressure here at home from a Arab, Muslim, and young voters frustrated with his handling of this crisis, but one of the big questions going forward is whether the deaths of these aid workers will alter the president's strategy in any way when it comes to approach to dealing with Israel and Netanyahu.",
