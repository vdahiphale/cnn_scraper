We begin with breaking news in Manhattan, some 60 blocks from the scene of the gruesome murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the man charged in his killing, Luigi Mangione, is right now in a federal court, his first appearance on four new federal charges, including murder. He walked into the courtroom. The proceeding began just moments ago. Mangione is on New York soil. That he is there at all is a win for prosecutors. He waived extradition this morning, kicking off a long perp walk, helicopter transfer from Pennsylvania, the state where he was first spotted and apprehended after a six day manhunt. You see him there as he was escorted by police. He is now facing federal charges in Pennsylvania and charges in Pennsylvania and New York and federally. CNN Brynn -- CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan. She joins me now. So, explain what's going to happen inside that courthouse today.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim. So we're hearing from our reporter inside the courtroom, Kara Scannell, that the judge has also just taken the bench and that Mangione is there with his defense attorney -- attorneys. So court is really just about to begin. It's unclear quite yet if he needs to enter a plea to these charges that he now faces federally. So we will find out.But you just mentioned that there's four new charges that were unsealed today in a complaint by the federal government, those being the murder through the use of a firearm, two stalking charges and firearm offenses. These are obviously very hefty charges. And they come just after two days ago when the states said that they unsealed their indictment of 11 criminal charges, including murder one and murder two, against Mangione. It's unclear exactly what happens next with the state charges. The federal charges right now where he is in court, facing those -- those take precedent at this point. But in the unsealing of that complaint, Jim, we did learn a little bit more about Mangione's and the evidence -- about Mangione and the evidence that they found on him, including some excerpts -- excerpts that were in, a notebook that we have talked about before that was found on him in that complaint. We heard or learned that some things were written like it contained several handwritten pages that expressed hostility towards the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular. Also, that it had an entry that stated that the target is insurance because it, quote, checks every box. So obviously this is more evidence on top of all of the evidence that we have learned about this case just within the last two weeks. Now, you talked about that extradition happened just from this morning in Pennsylvania and how he was flown to New York and then by helicopter to Manhattan and then that long, what we call perp walk, where federal and state and local officials brought him off that helicopter to the custody of federal officials. And right now, he is going right before a judge, federal judge on those four charges, and we're waiting to see what happens next in this case.",

Whether or not he was charged federally or, you know, even with the state charges, I think jury nullification is always an issue.And backing up as to that, that, of course, as we know, is when a jury knows that a defendant has committed a crime, but they decide, for whatever reason, to excuse it. Why is that a concern? Certainly, it's a concern because of what we've seen on social media. People saying that, wow, he's a hero, calling him Saint Luigi, printing shirts and t-shirts and sweaters and, you know, sweatshirts that have his picture and an angel on them, people waxing poetic on social media about the corruption of the health care system, the corruption of government. You know, this should have happened way before. You know it should happen again. It's unbelievable the level of support you look at the emails he's gotten while he was in, you know, prison in Pennsylvania. You look at the other correspondence people have really given him commissary money, even. And so why is that relevant that I talk about public opinion? Guess where jurors come from? A public. And so the public -- people who are on that jury are going to have their different perceptions. Now last point to this question, and that is yes, it's true that what happens is, is jurors are questioned in state court. The lawyers question the jurors in federal court. The judge does. Either way, though, you get to excuse jurors for cause. I hate the health care system. You're excused. I hate the government. You're excused. I dislike everybody, you're excused. But ultimately, there's going to be an impaneled jury. Are those jurors honest about their perceptions of life, love, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Are they not? And do you get a panel of jurors who are going to say, you know what, maybe this should have happened? Horrible to say, but it's not so horrible in light of what we're hearing on social media. So yes, I'm concerned about jury nullification.",

She's the reason that case was able to go forward. The trial court looked at her relationship with Nathan Wade and some other things she was doing while the top prosecutor on that case and said it was a significant appearance of impropriety, but he wasn't going to remove her. What the Georgia court of appeals did today was, they said the trial judge got it wrong. And so she must be disqualified from this case. She can appeal to try and be reinstated there.

That allowed a number of things to happen.First of all, the accusers and right to anonymity to be waived, and then the videos to be shown in court. All of that has meant that the impact of this has really gone far beyond the borders of France. As to what actually happened here in court today, there were large crowds outside, as there have been almost every day for the nearly four months of this trial. Men and women who come to support Gisele Pelicot again as she arrived shouting \"merci, Madame\" to her arrival, and again as she left, thanking her for what she's done by achieving this, whatever the sentence is handed down today, the fact that the trial was made public has led to this sort of societal reckoning. The question of how this number of men could have come into someone's home, found an unconscious woman, and not thought to raise the alarm or alert anyone or turn away themselves is remarkable. And it's a very uncomfortable question that's really been placed before wider society. We heard those sentences handed down. The only man who did receive the maximum sentence being sought was Dominique Pelicot himself. All of the others received lesser sentences, as you mentioned, and that's led to a great deal of outrage outside the court here today. There were shouts of \"rapists, we see you\" as proceedings got underway, and when at least one of the men who walked free today because of a suspended sentence walked out, he was jeered fairly violently by the crowd, even as he tried to hide his face. We also heard beyond the strong words of Gisele Pelicot herself, that you played there a moment ago. We also heard from a lawyer representing Dominique Pelicot, the husband.

Congressional Republicans now have just 33 hours to avert a government shutdown right before the holidays, because Donald Trump and Elon Musk decided last minute to decimate what was a bipartisan proposal.House Democrats made clear they are not willing to bend to Republican demands or bail them out. The current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday morning. Joining me now is Representative Brad Sherman from California, a member on the House Foreign Affairs and Financial Services Committees. I've got some overseas news to ask you about. But before we get to that, I do want to ask you about where the negotiations stand. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the house, has said Democrats will not bail out Republicans on this. Does he aim to stand by that, in your view? Should he stand by that? REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA):  Look, we entered into a 1,500-page agreement. We agreed on every semicolon and every comma. We were ready to pass it on Tuesday, and then out of nowhere comes Elon Musk, threatening every Republican with a primary challenge, a well-funded primary challenge if they vote for it. This is not bargaining in good faith. We bargained with Republicans. We made a deal. And that's the deal that we should pass. And if the Republicans put that deal on the floor right now, it will pass. But they're using their power by being a majority of the House to not even allow us to vote on the compromise legislation. Democrats have negotiated with Republicans before, as you know, and gotten burned. I'm thinking of the bipartisan border security deal also sunk by Donald Trump, under the impression that, hey, just wait until I'm in office, and I'll get a better deal.

It's in writing. It's on Twitter, both President Musk and Vice President Trump -- I may have that reversed, or I may have it correct, have made their positions quite clear. So, yeah, we have a deal.

You know, we're partners on national security when it comes to South Korea. We've got 30,000 troops there. We've got a hell of an intel system, watching what North Korea does every day.

It's still unclear exactly what this means, I guess, because the judge didn't really give any response before leaving the bench.

So now he goes to the Metropolitan Detention Center.And like I said, there has been notorious people who have been housed at that center right now, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. We know that at one point, Jeffrey Epstein, was there. There has been obviously widely reported about this federal facility. So that is where he will currently be held. While this federal case plays out, there's still no clarity exactly what is going to happen on the state level. Does he have to go before a judge on the state charges? It's really, truly unclear. And it seems like it's still unclear to even his defense attorneys. So maybe at some point he comes into the courthouse here in Manhattan. It doesn't appear that's going to happen, definitely not today, probably not even tomorrow. But we're certainly trying to get some clarity on exactly what is happening, even though the -- you know, the southern district of New York said these two cases will run parallel to each other. It doesn't exactly seem clear that that's happening right at this moment. It does seem like the federal case is taking precedence. And right now, he is federally charged officially, and he will be heading to the federal prison for the night.",

Thanks to both of you for joining. Jill, I wonder you've -- you've been a close observer of Vladimir Putin for many years. You watched this 4.5 hour press conference for which I give you great credit from start to finish. Listen, Russia lost in Syria. They lost their client state there, the state of their bases there. The air and navy bases are in question, although Putin said that he has established contact with HTS. On Ukraine, he was projecting more strength and he's right. They are making -- making ground there. Did you see a Putin who seemed strong or had apologies to make -- questions to answer?",

And, you know, he is never going to admit defeat, right? So the question now as we go into Ukraine and movement toward negotiations, he has to find a way to somehow spin it that he won. And granted, he's doing better, and the general obviously knows more about that than I do. But I thought it was a very interesting moment.",

And frankly, if you look at it historically, Russia and Syria have always been close, going back to after the Second World War.But that's a loss of not only a relationship but the ability of Russia at the present point in time to influence the course of actions in Syria. Now, I have to caveat that by saying that Russia is now engaged in conversations with Jolani, and others within the emerging government. And I think that that's directly related -- it's almost possessive to retain Russian control over the naval base and the air base, which are absolutely critical in that part of the world.",

And I think its a way of wearing, wearing away at the Ukrainians and make them feel that, you know, perhaps it's kind of hopeless and wearing away at the unity of NATO by saying, you know what, I'm going to win one way or the other.
