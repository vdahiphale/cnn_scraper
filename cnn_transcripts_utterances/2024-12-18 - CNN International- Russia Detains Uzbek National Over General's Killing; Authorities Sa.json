I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, Russia arrests a man suspected of planting the bomb that killed a senior general in Moscow. This as European leaders prepared to meet the Ukrainian president in Brussels. And we have the latest from Madison, Wisconsin as a community mourns Monday's fatal school shooting. And Israel and Hamas inch closer towards a possible ceasefire deal. Will it finally get over the line? We begin with an arrest in the killing of a top Russian general and his aide in Moscow. Russian officials say they are holding a 29-year- old Uzbek citizen seen here, and they say he was recruited by Ukraine's Security Service. The suspect allegedly planted the bomb that killed Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and an aide on Tuesday. They died outside this apartment building when the bomb was remotely detonated. Kirillov ran Russia's radiological, chemical and biological protection forces. Let's bring in CNN's Clare Sebastian for more. So, Clare, what are we learning about this arrest?",

And they're saying that he was, this is according to the investigative committee, that he was recruited by the Ukrainian Security Services that, of course, not a surprise. A source told CNN on Tuesday that the Ukrainian Security Services were behind this.But there's more details that are revealed. The investigative committee saying that the man was, as I said, acting on orders from the Ukrainian Security Services. And there's a confession as well that state media have published a video and photos, which we are showing from the FSB, but we're not showing the confession because of real concerns that he was speaking under duress. And in it, he claims that he came to Russia, bought this scooter, which we know has been connected by Russian state media to the crime, the assassination itself, and says that he was offered $100,000 and a European passport to do this. Now, of course, none of these claims can be independently verified. And as I said, we are not showing that video, but you can see that the Russians are trying to get right out in front of this. The Kremlin also coming out today and saying that this shows that the key regime, as they call, President Zelenskyy's government is willing to use terrorist methods and this according to the Kremlin spokesman, just confirms the correctness of the special military operation. So trying to sort of rebrand the security failing as further justification for the war in Ukraine. Amara?",

That's definitely an acceleration of this tactic. And I think it comes -- we're just over a month out now from when Donald Trump takes office again in the U.S.The Ukrainians are anticipating what could be a potentially significant change in policy at that point from the U.S. We heard President-elect Trump this week saying he thought, for example, that it was a mistake to provide Ukraine with what -- with the permission to use Western long-range missiles on Russian soil. So there's a possibility, of course, he could reverse course on that. So I think this is part of the broader context of Ukraine trying to do really everything it can to wrestle back, if not the initiative in this war, then at least some leverage. I don't think there's any sense at all that this assassination would change the course of events on the battlefield, will stop Russia from advancing in the east, or trying to push Ukraine out of Kursk. But I think it does send a signal at least that the Ukrainians have more cards to play here, even without the help of the West.",

DA Alvin Bragg saying clearly, \"This was a killing intended to invoke terror.\"Now this is interesting, Amara. We're also learning more information about Mangione's interactions with the outside world since he's been in prison, or better said, the outside world's attempts to interact with him since he's been behind bars. Per a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, we learned as of yesterday, Luigi Mangione has received 157 deposits into his prison commissary account. Also, as of yesterday morning, he'd received 33 emails and six pieces of hard mail that was up from just the two pieces of mail he received we reported back on Monday evening. And still though, the only visitors he's had to him while he's been behind bars here in Pennsylvania has been his attorneys.

It will be the last time the Fed will meet before Donald Trump's inauguration, and investors are watching closely to see if the bank follows through on expectations of an interest rate cut. CNN's Julia Chatterley reports. JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR OF \"FIRST MOVE\":  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent in their final meeting of the year, making it a nice round one percentage point of cuts to borrow costs for the year. But then comes the tougher part, which involves communicating some kind of plan for 2025, and that includes what's widely expected to be a pause in the cutting cycle in January. Why? Well, it's a few things, and actually a lot of it is good news, including solid growth, tracking up more than 3 percent annualized. We can then add in a stronger than expected labor market plus a U.S. consumer that's actually increased spending into the holiday season. Then there's rising prices that actually have called a lot, but not enough. And then comes the bad news, plenty of geopolitical risk, whether that's the Middle East, Ukraine, or the potential impact of tariff policy from President-elect Donald Trump. Now, the decision to pause rate cuts though would be far more, I think about the relative economic strength, at least in my mind, than future policy decisions like tariffs that may not in fact materialize. So first comes their updated economic projections and the so-called dot plot of where they think cuts in rates can come next year. Now, if you remember back in September, they were thinking four rate cuts next year. That could very likely be reduced to just three cuts based on what they see today, though, let's be clear, as we've seen this year, nothing is set in stone and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be keen to emphasize a degree of flexibility when he speaks on Wednesday. And that leaves the Fed with a core message that they've cut rates a full percentage point, that the economy is doing pretty well, and that they do remain data dependent and that they can't react to things like tariffs until they get them. And then they'll see how things progress between now and the January meeting. Julia Chatterley, CNN, New York.",

Palestinian officials say at least 10 people were killed in the attack near Kamal Adwan Hospital, seen here last week following a bombardment, the director described as catastrophic. But even as the violence continues, there is new hope that a ceasefire and hostage deal may be nearing.CIA Director, Bill Burns is expected to travel to Doha as early as today to continue these negotiations. Top officials from the U.S., Israel, Qatar, and Egypt are all claiming progress in the talks. And now, Hamas is also signaling cautious optimism. Let's go now to CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who's joining me now live from Jerusalem. Jeremy, so look, we've been here before only to see talks fall apart. What are you hearing about this cautious optimism? DIAMOND:  Well, it really does appear that every single party to these negotiations believes that we are closer to a deal than we ever have been. But we have, of course, heard language exactly like that before, particularly over the summer, amid those negotiations that followed that July framework that became the basis for negotiations. But those negotiations ultimately collapsed in August. Now though, U.S. and Israeli officials in particular are pointing to a new set of conditions on -- in terms of the negotiating environment that could be pushing Hamas to make more concessions and move towards a deal, and also conditions such as the killing of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, other Israeli military accomplishments that could make a deal more palatable to Israel's political leadership. On the Hamas side, the sense is that Hamas is increasingly isolated following the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, that it has not been able to bring about this kind of all-out regional war that it perhaps wanted to see in order to try and bring about Israel's defeat. And instead, Iran has been significantly weakened in terms of its influence and its proxies in the region. And that all of this may be contributing to some of the concessions that we've been told that Hamas appears to be making at the negotiating table, including the fact that Hamas seems more open to allowing Israel to maintain a troop presence along the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase of an agreement. That was, of course, one of the key sticking points that the Israeli prime minister refused to budge on in August that ultimately led to the collapse of that round of negotiations. But the optimism that we are hearing, including from Hamas, which said yesterday that they believe a deal is possible, another Hamas source saying that the atmosphere was positive and optimistic. They are also expressing caution, caution about the potential for additional Israeli demands slowing down the process and caution of course, simply about the fact that until a deal is actually agreed to, nothing is agreed to. As we have seen so often in these negotiations, it is that last yard that is most difficult to actually get across and bridge the gap there. And there's no question that a deal is needed now more than ever. We have seen dozens of people killed in Gaza over the course of just the last 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

But, I think the one missing ingredient that has prevented a deal over the last year since the last hostage exchange for a temporary week-long ceasefire last November is urgency. I think Hamas needs a deal, and I think Benjamin Netanyahu, and he is the principal decision maker for sure, is more willing to accept a deal.Hamas is under pressure. There's no cavalry that's going to rescue them. The Iranians, Hezbollahs hollowing out, has diminished their Axis of Resistance. They have nothing to show for the October 7 terror surge, only misery and death to the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. So I think Hamas is under pressure and Netanyahu, I think, is more willing than ever before to come to a limited agreement. And Amara, let's be clear, that's what we're talking about here. Limited exchange of hostages, probably the women, the elderly, the -- if there are any children left the -- and the infirm for a, what, 45 to 60-day ceasefire in anticipation that if it holds, you might be able to set the stage for the remaining 50 IDF soldiers that Hamas will not give up without a major concession. Who knows? Maybe you can extend -- you can extend the ceasefire, so better than ever. But we've talked about this before. Nobody ever lost money betting against Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.

But there's no doubt I think that an incoming Trump Administration, at least in the mind of one politician, and that is Benjamin Netanyahu, figures prominently. I think Netanyahu's calculation is that essentially, he won't -- he would like some progress on hostages in order to diffuse pressure from an incoming Trump Administration and from the hostage families.And he also wants to clear the deck, so he can focus the president- elect on what he really wants to do, and that is deal with the Iranian nuclear challenge. So I think that's all hell to pay. I mean, how much more hell to pay could there be than what Israelis and Palestinians have suffered over the course of the last year since October 7th, particularly on the Palestinian side. And I suspect that's at whom the president-elect's comments were directed. So, it may help actually, but it is not the determinative or decisive reason that we may be \"closer than ever\".",
