You may have someone who carries excess weight. They may be an ultra-marathon or they may be capable of running in a hundred-mile race and be very, very healthy, not have joint pains, may be able to carry that weight and do things that someone that`s much leaner may not be able to and have the metabolic health to fit that profile. And so I think it`s important for us to look at the weight, plus the health and put those two pieces of the puzzle together. My goal is to get you to the happiest, healthiest weight for you. And so this comes to this idea of not comparing yourself to the person next to you, the person above you, whatever that is, what is the weight that you best live at? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Dana Santas has four exercises, each of which you can do about 8 to 10 reps and three to five rounds. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA SANTAS, BREATHING, MOBILITY, AND MIND-BODY COACH:  I want to show you a surprisingly challenging workout using only a paper plate. You`ll put your paper plate on the floor and put your foot on top and then hands on your hips. Step back, tap your knee, bring it back up. Stable eye through your left leg. Your left leg is really doing all of the work here. The next exercise is a lateral lunge. So you`ll put one foot on the paper plate, hands on your hips again. And then your sliding back. Try to sit back into the hip of your standing leg and keep your chest up. You`ll notice I`m leaning a little bit to counterbalance, but I`m trying to keep my chest up. This leg is really, what`s keeping me stable in this position and from sliding completely out that way. And make sure you do both sides on all of the exercises. And remember, it`s so important to focus on the standing leg that`s stabilizing the exercise. The last two exercises involve a plank position and making circles with your arms and your legs. So we`ll start with our arms. So from your plank position, make sure you get stable. Take your feet out a little bit wider than you ordinarily would for a little extra stability, and then place your hand inside the paper plate and just start to make circles. Now make sure your low back is not arching like this because that`s not going to do you any good. You need a nice strong core. If you find that it`s too difficult, then put your knees down. Otherwise, stay here and do your eight circles, and you can switch it up. Ideally do four one direction, do four, see other direction. And then of course switch to the other side. And finally, we`ll move the plate to our foot. And from that strong stable plank position, we just start making circles in your own range of motion. If your range of motion is smaller, you can go smaller. Make sure you go for one direction, four the other direction. And then switch, and then other direction. (END VIDEO CLIP) Let`s turn now to nutrition. Have you ever heard of ultra-processed foods? Well, there`re basically any food that contains ingredients that are never, or are rarely used in kitchens. And while these additives add flavor and might keep foods lasting longer, they could be leading to a higher risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity, even death. And sometimes it`s hard to tell which foods actually contain these ingredients. We talk to dietitian nutritionist, Lorraine Kearney, who shows us how reading food labels can help us better understand how processed some foods really are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Most people think ultra-processed foods are found in the chip bottle or the cookie aisle, butit can also be found in this cereal, in the oatmeal and yogurts. And I`m going to help you today to navigate through them and what to look out for. When we get our bread at the bakery, it is most minimally processed bread. When I`m looking at the ingredient list in these two breads, I prefer this option. It has multi grain flour, water, salt in east. Compared to this other shelf stable bread that does have more additives and preservatives as well as dough conditioners to preserve shelf like. This one does have more fiber compared to the other bread. With most Americans only consuming about 5% of the fiber they need in a day. They are missing out in a lot of nutrients. So when we are looking at a minimally processed cereal, it will have that shorter ingredient list and lower amounts of sugar compared to the flavor enhancers or the added fats and oil to increase that mouth feel. With our ultra-process, it does have a higher amount of calories, but then with the fiber, when we look minimally processed has a total of 12 compared to 10. With some yogurts, there`s actually enough sugar to be enough for a dessert rather than a breakfast. So when we are choosing a yogurt, we want to make sure that we are looking at the ingredient list. This product has 18 grams of added sugar. And how we can tell if the product is high, lower, medium sugar is dividing the number of grams by four to turn it into teaspoons. Compared to zero grams of added sugar and 15 grams of protein. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
