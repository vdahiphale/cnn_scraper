At this hour, CNN teams in Damascus report hearing a series of explosions a short time ago, there are reports that Israel carried out air strikes in Damascus on Sunday. When CNN asked about those reports, the Israeli military declined to comment. Meanwhile, rebel groups in Syria are preparing to take control of the country's government after a swift and stunning march to power.The leader of the main rebel group, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met former President Bashar al- Assad's outgoing prime minister on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. But A source told CNN that a decision has not been made yet on who will be the transitional prime minister. Rebel officials plan to release a list of senior Assad officials wanted for torture. There are long documented reports of the Assad regime committing atrocities against Syrians. Rebels and civilians are tearing down symbols of the Assad regime and the rebel coalition says members of Assad's military forces must register with them. They have issued a general amnesty for soldiers conscripted into the military, but that does not apply to those who volunteered. The civilians' life in Syria is starting to return somewhat to normal. In Aleppo, people are back on the street. Some shops are open and banks are expected to reopen in the coming hours. America's top diplomat is urging the rebels who topped Assad's regime to prepare for inclusive government governance in Syria. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says senior officials are traveling to the Middle East to work with regional partners on the crisis. He did not say whether the U.S. is considering contact with the leading Syrian rebel group, which it had designated a terrorist organization but he made clear, the U.S. has enduring interests in Syria.

So, he has done that and he's put out some pretty impressive statements regarding assurances for minorities, for Christians, for Kurds, for Syria's neighbors, though, again, obviously there are a lot of cautious optimism regarding how he'll proceed whether he will indeed allow a civilian government to take over, what kind of influence he's going to want to maintain, or if he would decide that he himself would like to be the next president of Syria.",

Look, the Syrian people are in an incredible moment of joy and happiness that I think we should allow them to bask in for perhaps few more days. And are extremely entrepreneurial. They are eager to rebuild their country and they've suffered terribly under Assad. You're seeing the images in the videos from his dungeons and jails.Just very heartbreaking. What's happening perhaps as many as 100,000 who are missing and nobody can find are presumed to have died in his jails. So, it's a pretty horrific situation that they want to emerge from and rebuild their country. So that is the joy, the optimism, and yes, as President Biden said, there are concerns in terms of how this transition will proceed, who will be running Syria. But ask any Syrian and they will tell you, well, at least most Syrians that they had to get beyond the Assad family, single family rule to get to what is next. They were never going to become a more humane, democratic, safe, secure, prospered country as long as Assad and the people around the war in power. What incoming President Trump has said is also partially, I think, representative of where the American public is. They do not want to be involved in, you know, another Middle Eastern war to be sending their troops. In fact, I think the American public wants to bring the American troops who are in Syria back. But if you look at the map and where Syria is bordering Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, it becomes very obvious that the country is important and whether it is stabilizing the region. The issue of terrorism, refugees, there are six million refugees abroad who many of them are eager to come back and some have even started coming back are all consequential and directly or indirectly it does affect the United States.",

He says Israel will ensure its security by maintaining its presence in the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967.U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is expected to travel to Israel this week, marking the first trip by a U.S. official to the region since the toppling of the Syrian regime. Though Sullivan is set to discuss a range of issues the U.S. remains focused on continued efforts to secure a cease fire in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed on Monday that indirect negotiations were underway to secure the release of hostages still held by Hamas. Qatar has also applied renewed pressure on Hamas in an effort to reach a resolution ahead of a second Trump presidency. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels are continuing to attack Israel from Yemen. On Monday, the Houthi High Command confirmed they were behind a drone strike that hit an apartment Building in central Israel. While the Houthis are claiming a successful strike, no casualties were reported according to Israeli emergency services. After a five-day manhunt, there's finally a suspect behind bars for the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO in Manhattan. And not long ago, New York prosecutors charged him with murder. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested on Monday while eating at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. Police say he got nervous and started shaking when asked if he had recently been to New York. Police say Mangione was found with a gun and suppressor, \"both consistent with the weapon used in the murder,\" as well as a two-page document railing against the health care industry.

For three times per week for up to six hours per day, the Israeli Prime Minister will testify for several weeks in this trial. He will initially face questioning from his own defense attorneys who will likely give him the time and the space to lay out his views on this case, to make his statements on this. And then he will face cross-examination by the prosecutors in this case, a process that will likely take the biggest chunk of time of this testimony. We know that in this case, he is -- this is three cases all lumped together, caseC1000, Case 2000 and Case 4000. In these cases, he's facing allegations of bribery, of breach of trust, and of fraud. Effectively, these allegations center around the fact that he allegedly did favors for businessmen in exchange for gifts and favorable media coverage. The Israeli prime minister, of course, denies all of these allegations. Tonight, he held a news conference, taking questions from reporters for the first time in nearly a hundred days in which he lambasted the case that has been standing against him for over four years at this point, insisting that he did nothing wrong, calling this a brutal witch hunt, and saying that the accusations against him are absurd and baseless.",
