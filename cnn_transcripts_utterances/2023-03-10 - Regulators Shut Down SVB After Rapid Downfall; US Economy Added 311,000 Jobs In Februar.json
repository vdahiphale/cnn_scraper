Those are the markets and these are the main events. A major lender to Silicon Valley collapses. The first US bank failure since the global financial crisis. Ursula von der Leyen is in DC as Europe and the US try to work out their differences on green subsidies. And three years on, a look at how the early days of the COVID pandemic really tested the world's top CEOs. Live from New York. It is Friday, March 10th. I'm Rahel Solomon in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, it is the second largest bank failure in US history. Regulators have shut down Silicon Valley Bank and taking control of its deposits. It is really a stunning and sudden downfall for a key player in the tech world. SVB spooking investors on Wednesday with its need to raise more than $2 billion. You can see here how the share price dropped 60 percent the following day. Shares were down another 62 percent in premarket trade this morning before being halted. Its problems shook other banks on Thursday. The four biggest US banks lost more than $50 billion in market value. JPM though faring a bit better today, but you can see smaller and regional banks like PacWest, First Republican, Signature Bank all getting crunched while JPMorgan Chase is up about 2.2 percent. Now Silicon Valley Bank plays a huge role for companies backed by venture capital, partners with nearly half of all tech and healthcare startups in the US. Now as VC funding dries up, these high risk companies have been burning through cash and drawing down deposits and that put the squeeze on SVB's balance sheet. Catherine Rampell is a \"Washington Post\" columnist and also a CNN economics and political commentator. She joins me now from Ithaca, New York. Catherine, great to have you on the program today.

Some of them are reflective ofbroader problems in the tech sector, some of them are kind of idiosyncratic to this one particular bank. So this bank, Silicon Valley Bank, did a few things that in retrospect, look not so wise, including that they invested in these long-dated mortgage backed securities, which seems safe, perhaps, you know, they're not inherently risky. I think the layperson, when they hear mortgage-backed securities, they think that that means something like inherently very risky, that's going to blow up. That's not the case here. What happened was that as interest rates went up, the value of those underlying securities went down. And so as a result, there was a lot of fear about the solvency of the bank, and you had kind of a bank run that a lot of the customers started pulling their money out of the bank. And, you know, more broadly within the tech community, obviously, the era of rising interest rates has been very painful for a lot of those customers that were banking with this institution, so that fed on itself as well.",

I mean, the goal of raising interest rates is to pull back on lending, and that will, unfortunately have the effect of causing some stresses at these institutions. Now, that doesn't mean you want big banks to go under, that doesn't mean you want all of these knock-on effects for the depositors, amongst others. So I think that this is something they're going to have to consider. But obviously, they have -- the Fed has a number of objectives here. It has a dual mandate, which is maximum employment and stable prices, and they are laser focused on getting price growth down, inflation down. And that means raising interest rates now, maybe they'll you know, act a little bit less aggressively if they're really worried about financial market problems. But if you look at the totality of today's Jobs Report, which was very strong, whatever we see in the inflation numbers next week, I suspect that those kinds of macroeconomic numbers are going to be weighing much more heavily on how the Fed thinks about what its next steps should be and what's appropriate.",

And for the banks that do survive, which is going to be the vast majority of them, this is a buying opportunity., So I would suggest to investors that are looking to put some money to work, is in a diversified portfolio of banks, because there could be a couple that end up, you know, having a panic and having a fear, but the majority of them are going to get through this just fine and I think the bank ETF is a good way to gain exposure.",

This isa seven-year diplomatic rift, and we're talking about two of the most significant and politically influential players in the region, and this is going to take form on various fronts. We are expecting to see further diplomatic cooperation between the two parties, the reopening of their respective embassies, but, as you mentioned, a crucial element of all of this will be the activation of a Security Cooperation Deal, which was essentially drawn up back in 2001. This includes a framework for cooperating when it comes to terrorism, when it comes to conflicts, when it comes to drug trafficking, for example, a whole range of areas. So this will be a significant development in a region where those tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have long threatened security across the entire Middle East region have certainly been a concern further afield, internationally. And then, of course, there is question of Trade and Technology Corporation, that framework drawn up back in 1998. And there is significant scope there for that sort of relationship to develop between Saudi Arabia, and Iran. But of course, the seven-year riff that has been in place between the two parties has had a significant impact regionally. We are talking about tensions rising in the Gulf, we've seen oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, even being attacked by groups and actors that have been backed by Iran, namely, the Houthi rebels in Yemen. And, of course, the deepening of conflicts in Syria and in Yemen in turn, since 2015. We've seen Iran and Saudi Arabia throwing their support and backing between opposing actors. And while there does appear to be some sort of ceasefire, some sort of lasting peace holding at the moment in Yemen, this will certainly go some ways into the calls that we've heard repeatedly now from Saudi Arabia for a more long-term, permanent ceasefire to be established in Yemen. But of course, we have to consider the international stage here, and of course, the situation and the context in which this is happening. Iran is finding itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, both in response to the Human Rights abuses we've seen off the back of the anti- regime protests that have taken place, but also, of course, crucially, Iran's failure to adhere to its commitments to the international community when it comes to its nuclear activity. Those talks, those efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal have stalled, they are frozen at the moment. And so Iran is finding itself increasingly looking to its regional allies, its regional partners for backing there, and that's the message we've heard from the Foreign Minister today saying that Iran will continue to actively seek further diplomatic relations with its regional neighbors.",

It's a reminder that he has got an iron grip over the country. It solidifies his control and makes him the longest serving Head of State of Communist China since its founding in 1949. Now back in 2018, Xi scrapped the two-term limit on the presidency meaning he could stay on as Head of State for life, but his true power comes from being the head of party and military. These are rules he was already reappointed to at the Communist Party Congress back in October. So what we saw today was political theater. He got more than 2,900 unanimous votes from China's rubber stamp legislature, then they all stood up for a standing ovation. At this ongoing big political event, we will also see reshuffles in leadership roles and state organizations, changes that will all further increase Xi's power. On Saturday, Li Qiang who's one of Xi's most trusted protegees, he is expected to be chosen as China's Premier. He was the former Party Secretary of Shanghai and oversaw the brutal two-month COVID lockdown last spring. And the team of officials that run China's economy is also getting a big shake up. The four main men, unlike their predecessors, have not been educated in the West or are seen as having little experience dealing with international financial organizations, but what they do have in common is that they're close allies of Xi. So what should we expect to see in this coming term? We should expect to see increasing Communist Party control at home and this continued assertive more aggressive foreign policy abroad. Beijing views its actions as trying to restore China's rightful standing in the world as a great power, and it is clear there is not going to be an easy off ramp to US-China tensions. Xi Jinping's view of the bilateral relationship is turning more pessimistic. Earlier this week, he made the rare move in directly accusing the US of leading a campaign to contain and suppress China. It is rare for him to directly call out the US. Then the following day, China's new Foreign Minister warned that conflict with the US is inevitable if the US does not change course. To the people here in China, the message from Beijing is that the US is trying to choke the country off. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Both the U.S. and European Space Agency say there's actually a very small chance that it will actually strike our planet but never too soon to start preparing, huh. And a federal judge says that he is prepared to further tighten. Sam Bankman-Fried's bail conditions. Judge Lewis Kaplan says that the founder of FTX is \"savvy enough to get access to technology.\" He agree that the existing restrictions should be strengthened. He added that Bankman-Fried bank been freed has strong reasons to be suspicious.

A Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But look, this comes at a time when the U.S. and the E.U. are trying to show this united front when it comes to Russia's war against Ukraine. But behind the scenes, there's also that tension that has been playing out over these clean energy tax credits that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Officials said heading into this meeting that that would be a key issue of discussion for President Biden and President von der Leyen. And one thing that hasn't been of great concern is the fact that these tax credits are currently being distributed through the Inflation Reduction Act to countries that are sourcing, or it's tax credits for batteries and materials, a percentage of which is being sourced from countries in North America or those countries with free trade agreements which right now, the European Union is not a part of. There are many countries who have said that they feel penalized by this provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. So, this meeting between President Biden and the E.U. president offers an opportunity to try to address some of those tension points. One thing that officials said going into this was that there -- were hoping that it would start a discussion and start negotiations, that it would allow some European countries to benefit from this proposal. So, we will see if after the meeting, if there is any type of announcement from the two leaders. They simply said there, as you heard that they had plenty of issues to discuss between the two of them. But this is certainly a tension point that is underlying so much of the relations right now between the U.S. and many countries in Europe at a time when the U.S. still needs Europe, and its allies to be on board in standing up to Russia's aggression against Ukraine, including at a moment when China, a U.S. official said may be considering providing aid to Russia as they continue to carry out this war. So, this is certainly a very important meeting for President Biden that he is having today as he's trying to smooth over some of this tension that currently exist or these clean energy tax credits.",

And this all centers around the hush money payments, just as you would describe. Now, there are a finite number of people who were involved in those conversations and a number of them -- all of them, frankly, have been brought before the grand jury or met with federal -- with the Manhattan prosecutors investigating this case. So, they've gotten firsthand testimony from the people whether it was Michael Cohen, who was Trump's fixer, who was meeting with prosecutors again today, as well as Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway who were on Trump's campaign. Now, evidence in Cohen's federal case. Remember, he pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges in the federal investigation. A lot of evidence had come out in that where we saw that there were phone calls, and people were scrambling and trying to ink this deal. So, those people have all met with prosecutors or gone before the grand jury. And the other piece of this is what the charges will be or could be and what prosecutors are looking at, according to my sources, is whether Trump was involved in falsifying business records of the Trump Organization. That all relates to how Michael Cohen was reimbursed and how that reimbursement was noted in the books and records of the company. That would be a misdemeanor in New York, but it could be a felony if they're able to prove that the records were falsified to commit another crime or to conceal another crime. And that takes you back to the campaign finance. So, we've seen a number of people come in, prosecutors have been investing -- investigating this for years, Cohen is back again today. And then they've made this invitation to Trump. So, this is all beginning to come to a head, Rahel.",

They haven't come up with anything. Now they're focusing on this. They say that that is selective prosecution. Interestingly, we're also seeing maybe a signal of how they're going to play this as a defense. They're suggesting that this was an extortion attempt and that Michael Cohen, who was Trump's attorney at the time took it upon himself to make this hush money deal. Rahel?",

He was the youngest battalion commander in the Ukrainian armed forces killed this week in that grinding battle of Bakhmut that has gone on for months. Now he went under the codename Da Vinci. And Kotsiubailo was famous in Ukraine because as a teenager, he had joined the pro-democracy protests here in Kyiv's Maidan Square. A face off against the security forces in which the protesters ultimately won and a pro-Russian President fled to neighboring Russia. And he joined a militia group after that battling pro-Russian forces in the Donbas region, a group called the Right Sector whose flags had been demonstrated here and patches as well. Now, Moscow considers that organization a terrorist group and denounces them as Nazis. But last year, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave Da Vinci the award calling him a hero of Ukraine. Now, he is being laid to rest. And as you can see, he is truly regarded as a hero by many, many Ukrainians. This underscores the immense costs that the battle for Bakhmut, the cost that is incurring on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian commanders insist that this battle is bleeding the Russian military dry, but it is also causing immense sacrifice for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ivan Watson, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And, you know, coming into 2020, there was a sense that they kind of escaped that cycle. There's a quote that I opened the book with from the CEO of American Airlines, Doug Parker in 2017, where he says, I don't think we're ever going to lose money, again, just a good reminder of the hubris that had been baked into the corporate class over the course of a very benign 10 years in the 2010s. And they would not have survived but for the government. I mean, just billions of dollars payroll was covered. Ultimately, again, I think that was the right call. Think about the travel hell that we've been living in and 2021 and 2022. The holiday meltdown at Southwest would have been immeasurably worse had those people been off the payroll off of their training schedules. It's an incredibly regulated industry.
