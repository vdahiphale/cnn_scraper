It's finally caught up with him. We may be about to hear the gavel. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): -- with two recorded as present. Two thirds voting in the affirmative, the resolution is adopted, and a motion to reconsider is laid upon the table. The clerk will notify the Governor of the State of New York of the action of the House. Under Clause five D of Rule 20, the Chair announces to the House that in light of the expulsion of the gentleman from New York, Mr. Santos, the whole number of the House is now 434.

He isjust the sixth member in the history of the House of Representatives to be expelled, and he is the first who has neither committed treason nor been convicted of a crime. We had seen as this morning unfolded a late push from the Speaker who said he was going to vote against -- did vote to expel -- not to expel Santos, excuse me. It seemed as though perhaps some momentum had been moving in George Santos's direction. But, in the end, this was a pretty convincing vote against him. This is of course the third time that the House has voted to expel Santos, but it's the first in the wake of that scathing ethics report that so angered members of Santos's own party.

Certainly, they can be enjoyable to cover sometimes when what's going on is not necessarily harming other people. It is a place where oddities are kind of a feature, not a bug. But, the way that things have evolved in the Trump era just is, to me anyway, so strikingly different in the -- I mean, honestly, I keep coming back to this phrase, like lack of shame, right? Like just watching Santos on the steps yesterday was just kind of a shameless performance. And it really is kind of in the mold of Donald Trump, but it does seem to be getting -- oftentimes voters seem to be more willing to back people who act that way than not.

I think, shameless is a good word to describe what some of these members feel that they can bring. And what we saw from Santos this entire time with this very defiant posture, he had some explanations, but not a lot. And you saw when the House Ethics report released that very scathing report just a few weeks ago, a report that notably tipped many Republicans to actually have him to say we need to expel this guy. He said, I'm not going to go line by line. I'm not going to take up issue. He didn't defend himself so much as saying I'm in the right. And that was the posture he took this entire time. So, watching that defiance, purposely put in front of TV cameras, was notable, especially in his final act in Congress. And if I could just read one thing, some Annie Grayer, a reporter on Capitol Hill, caught up with Santos on his way out after the vote to expel him happened. And he said, it's over. Certainly, interesting comments there. And he said, the House has set a dangerous precedent for himself. This is an argument that he and other Republicans, of course, had been arguing. And he ended with \"To hell with this place\" when he was asked if he potentially would take advantage of any of the resources that former members of Congress potentially can on Capitol Hill, like the gym. So, certainly, leaving with some personality and certainly laced with bitterness there. It has been -- I mean, he has been the center of this massive story for months, and he has been dogged by member of the press corps, which is our job. And I want to read this to you guys, because I think you'll like this. He said, answering members, he says, I'm unofficially no longer a member of Congress. I no longer have to answer your questions.

Newsom is not running for President at least so far this year. We expect him to run in some future year or time. For DeSantis, this was a chance to try to stand out from the Republican PAC and get some airtime on Fox News. For Newsom, it was a step onto the national stage. He used it to defend his party's President, Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, he is in decline. Yes, it's a danger to the country. He has no business running for President. And Gavin Newsom agrees with that. He won't say that. That's why he is running his shadow campaign. He should not be running. He is not up to the job. And it is dangerous for this country.",
