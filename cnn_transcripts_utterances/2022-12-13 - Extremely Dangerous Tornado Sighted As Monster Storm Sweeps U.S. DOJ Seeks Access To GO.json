We're tracking the severe weather system that's threatening millions of Americans right now.Also tonight, CNN has learned that the U.S. Justice Department has tried to get access to the texts of Republican Congressman Scott Perry in its investigation of efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. This as the January 6th select committee sets a date to announce criminal referrals. I'll speak live with a key panel member, Representative Zoe Lofgren. And President Biden just signed historic same-sex marriage legislation into law. We'll break down what the new law means for the LGBTQ community and for the nation. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the breaking news right now, the confirmed tornado near Shreveport, Louisiana, part of a massive and very dangerous system that has millions in the path of severe weather right now. CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray is tracking all of this for us. So, what's the latest, Jennifer?",

That means that a tornado could be in progress in these areas. Just on the south side of Shreveport, you can see one of those tornado warnings, and that's where the most populated area is right now. In fact, we got word that the National Weather Service office there was also taking shelter. So, this is a very dangerous situation as the storms continue to march through the east through the overnight hours. We will most likely continue to see tornado warnings all across Louisiana and potentially into Arkansas. We have one right there in East Texas as well. And so as these storms continue overnight, it's going to be incredibly dangers because it will be dark, people will not be able to see them and most likely people will be asleep, Wolf. So, we have to be extra vigilant as we go through out the out the overnight hour as well as into tomorrow morning as the severe weather will be continuing. Wolf?",

He was texting with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the time. He was a person who put Donald Trump in touch with Jeffrey Clark, who was a DOJ official that Trump wanted to install at the head of the Justice Department to continue to push this sort of conspiracy claims. So, what we don't know is whether the DOJ has been able to access these text messages. But it comes as the Justice Department through, again, Special Counsel Jack Smith has taken a number of other steps, including firing off subpoenas to election officials in places like Nevada, New Mexico, Georgia, Wisconsin and a number of other states trying to get to the bottom, really, of any contacts Donald Trump, his campaign, his allies had with officials in these important battleground states from the 2020 election.",

Does that lineup, Congresswoman, with what we can expect on Monday? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, as you know, Wolf, it's been my practice not to jump ahead of the committee and make the announcement. So, we're just going to have to wait until Monday. But I will say that we've had substantial discussions among the committee and really our practice. We've never had a vote, actually, we just reach consensus. I suppose that could change. But I don't see it changing. We're coming to agreement on all -- we're also writing the report. I spent countless hours, along with the other committee members, going through the report and the appendixes, looking at the footnotes, editing, making sure that everything is right, including the recommendations as well as the referrals.

Early on, I think there was doubt about whether or not they would be able to get information, and, Dana, talked about it and the representative talked about it too, the massive information that they did get, the cooperation from Trump's inner circle. They got something like a thousand interviews, hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents, of text messages and email messages. And this was over 16 months that they conducted this investigation. And this committee was very smart, a bipartisan committee. They were very smart in terms of the sort of television aspect of it, dropping bombshells at each committee hearing they had. And so we'll see what happens not only with these criminal referrals on the 19th. They'll be voting on that. And, of course, I mean, I think everybody's question is what happens to Donald Trump, right? They could make a criminal referral. What happens to him really is up to the Justice Department and up to this special prosecutor who is moving very fast to issue subpoenas and interview people. So, it's sort of to be continued still, I think. But in terms of the work that they did, important for history, important for documenting what actually happened because there was a real attempt, I think, particularly by Republicans, to downplay it and to sort of erase it and minimize it, and here they made a very compelling argument, linking what happened on January 6th directly to the president.",

No matter who is in charge of Congress, Republicans or Democrats, they have the same number of members.And I think the most important thing I learned in this conversation was that even though a referral will happen in this Congress, Democrats are in charge, it is going to be a new Congress with Republicans in charge in January, the referral will carry forward into the next Congress. So, it will be significant. The Ethics Committee, if they do, if the January 6th committee does make ethics referrals, that committee will be looking into and perhaps they will be reprimanding in some way, shape or form these Republicans for not complying with their own branch of government's requests, or not just requests, demand, because it was a subpoena.",

At the beginning, the U.S. gave those short-range Stinger missiles, then more recently NASAMS medium range air defense system. And now, as we've learned from U.S. officials, the U.S. is preparing to send over patriot missiles, longer range, can cover a greater area and will be even more effective at helping Ukraine fight off these barrages of missiles, rockets and cruise missiles that we're seeing fired now on Ukrainian civil infrastructure and energy infrastructure. And that, it seems, is part of what tipped the administration over from not sending Patriots to sending Patriots, this constant barrage of Russian missiles attacking the civilian infrastructure, cutting off water and electricity to large parts of Ukraine. That seems to have tipped the scales in favor of sending the Patriots. The harder question, Wolf, is how long they will take to train on this complex system.",
