He's been going on for almost a half an hour so far, an opening statement at what was supposed to be a news conference. So far, he hasn't answered one question. Hasn't taken any questions. He's doing all of this at his New Jersey Golf Club. We're going to check back in once he starts taking some questions from reporters.But right now, I want to get some analysis from our political experts who are joining us right now. Kristen Holmes, you cover the campaign, the Trump campaign for us, he appears to be talking pretty much on his message so far, reading from his notes, carefully scripted as we all can see for much of his remarks, is this what his campaign actually wanted him to do today?",

      "sentences": "This is what they've been wanting him to do for the last several weeks. I mean, he's not just carefully scripted, he's literally reading almost word for word from a binder in front of him. Now he has props. They're framing this as a speech on the economy. And I continue to remind our viewers, this is one of the messages that they have tried to get Trump to hammer home.If you look at the polling pre-Kamala Harris from President Joe Biden, Donald Trump polls ahead of Joe Biden on the issue of the economy. They believe that he could poll ahead of Kamala Harris on that issue if he continues to link Harris to the Biden administration, say that any policies of Biden's were the policies of Kamala Harris. You saw that yesterday, really for the first time, him kind of trying out these new attack lines where he says Kamala Harris says on day one he's -- she's going to end inflation. Well, her day one was three and a half years ago. Allies have been trying to get him to say this for the last several weeks. They believe that Kamala Harris overall can be painted in their own -- in the way that they want her to be painted, which is negatively and as a radical liberal. However, Donald Trump has taken his own approach to this, and one that many of the people close to him, many of the people who want to see him elected in November believe is the wrong approach, focusing on personal attacks, focusing on these fringe conspiracy theories. Now, the big interesting part of all of this, how does he handle taking questions from reporters? He's obviously still talking there. We don't know how long he's going to go. This is already longer than what we saw last week when I was at his press conference at Mar-a- Lago, but when he interacts with those reporters, that's when he gets off script. That is when the door is open for him to talk about those fringe conspiracy theories, for him to go off message. And that's really why some of these allies are surprised he's doing this again. Now this again is all part of the narrative we've heard from Donald Trump and his team that he is taking questions from the press so does JD Vance, but Kamala Harris is not. But again, what we're waiting to see is what actually happens when Donald Trump puts that binder down and speaks to reporters.",

And so, understanding that Kamala Harris is going to go and put out a slice of her economic policy tomorrow in North Carolina, he's trying to pre but that and obviously draw the contrast that if indeed he does take questions, that he is willing to take questions when she wasn't.It was interesting to hear one thing he said, Wolf, when he said, you know, I've been around politicians long enough to know they always return to their original position. I don't know if that means that Donald Trump was signaling that he was going to be prochoice again at some point, that he would start donating to Democrats, that he's going to start campaigning again on the repeal of Obamacare, which he went away from. So, I'm not sure exactly what he was trying to do there other than, of course, highlight that Kamala Harris ran on super liberal positions in a Democratic primary in '19 and '20, or she didn't make it to '20, actually, she was out by the December of '19, and that we know through her aides in comments to reporters that she has tossed aside a lot of those positions. And clearly the Trump campaign wants to try and tie those more liberal perhaps less popular with the voters she needs right now in a general election context, positions around her neck. [17:05:09]",

I don't know that I would call what I just heard perfect, because he can help but include sort of side, long references that are personal in nature and so on. One thing that caught my ear was he condemned her for not wanting to extend the Trump tax cut. I think that one of the single least popular elements of his of his presidency was that tax cut, which heavily favored very wealthy people and corporations at a huge price tag, and now he wants to make them permanent. That gives her something to work with on Friday.But what this press conference does reflect is that his team is trying to drag on him into following a script. I'm not sure he completely did here, but he is moving toward that end. This is the -- this is the case they want to make that she was copilot on this journey with Biden, and therefore she should be held accountable for everything that people perceive hasn't gone well under Biden. And I mean by that token, I guess that you could blame Mike Pence for the all the policies of the Trump administration, but we'll see if it sticks. She's on a glide path right now. They're going to hit some bumps in the road. They're trying to throw some bumps in the way, but he's trying to stop her momentum, which has been substantial since the day that Joe Biden dropped out and she dropped in.",

Those -- you know, if I were them, I would want to contrast the nature of the kind of tax cuts they want to give to the kind of tax cuts Donald Trump wants to give.And, you know, I mean, look, a hero of the press conference, so far from what I heard was the mention of Elon Musk. And I think you can guess that the supporters of Kamala Harris are going to point out that he -- Elon Musk is the American who Donald Trump wants to help and people like him, they want to help working families. That's the argument that they're going to make, and that's the argument that they should make. And if they stick to that argument, I think they can continue their momentum.",

      "sentences": "There's a whole bunch of lying, Wolf. Many claims that I've debunked before, but I want to focus on two claims I haven't heard and made before, both of which are egregiously wrong. He claimed that California allows people to rob stores as long as the thieves take under $950 and he said that Vice President Harris is the one who did that. Both parts of that claim are totally false. First of all, shoplifting continues to be illegal in California at any amount.What actually happened was that in 2014 there was a referendum, a proposition on the ballot, passed by California voters that made it a misdemeanor rather than a felony to steal under $950 worth of goods. But it's still illegal. It's still punishable by up to six months in jail. Now as for the claim that Vice President Harris was the one who did that, in fact, she did not do it. She was attorney general, and as attorney general, she said it would be inappropriate for her to even take a public position on this initiative, so she stayed neutral on the matter. Now Trump also claimed that mortgage rates are now 10 percent. Well, according to our really good business reporter Bryan Mena, the standard 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.9 percent in the week ending August 15, not even close to 10 percent. There are a whole bunch of other false claims, Wolf, but I fact checked them before, including earlier this week, so I'll leave it at that for now, but just a whole bunch of nonsense from former President Trump.",

They say they have accepted President Biden's proposal, that framework agreement, but they are willing, they say, to speak with the mediators on plans for the implementation of that agreement.And our sources are saying that the Qataris and the Egyptians will be engaging with Hamas separately, as they always have in these indirect proximity talks. And that essentially is relaying whatever comes out of the talks with the Israelis back to Hamas. And we understand from our sources that the mediators are continuing to work to try and bridge the gaps that remain on key differences between both sides. Wolf, everyone went into these talks with very low expectations. No one was expecting that they are going to reach any sort of a major breakthrough or sign an agreement at the end of the day. There are some serious sticking issues that remain that they are trying to work through, but the fact that these talks have resumed, the fact that they are going to go into a second day, is seen as a positive and a step in the right direction, Wolf.",

I never looked that way. The audience was massive, and it was in front of me. I never have the -- that particular graph. That was a graph on, as you all know, now that it's very -- I think everyone knows it very well, but it showed the great numbers on illegal immigration.It was the lowest point we've ever had, and it was one that I use less than 20 percent of the time. It's always at the end of the speech, not at the beginning of the speech, and it's always on the left side, not the right side. And yet, for some reason, I called it, it's not on a teleprompter. I do things largely without a teleprompter, frankly, because it's hard to hold an audience if you're going to go for an hour and a half or two hours reading a script. And I just talked about it, and I moved to my right, turned sharply to my right, ping. And if I didn't do that, I'm not here with you. So, yes, God has something to do with it. It's a miracle, and God had something to do with it. And maybe it's -- we want to save the world. This world is going down. This world is going down. So, it could be. But I believe that. I believe that my sons are very good shooters. They're like scratch golfers better relatively speaking, with huge, great shooters. And Eric and Don both told me from 130 yards, I said, well, that's pretty far away, isn't it? They said, No, that's like a one foot putt with, you know, weapons like the one being used. Plus he was a good shooter. This guy was a good shooter. He went to the range and shot a lot, and he was supposed to be a pretty good shooter. They said a bad shooter would hit the target almost 100 percent of the time. So, something happened. And I have to say the Secret Service sniper did an amazing job. He had five seconds to find the target and hit the target, and he hit the target within, think of this, five seconds, and he was much further away, because he was over here, and this other person was over there. So you have to give credit. And I have to also say about secret service, when I was hit, I knew it, because when I touched there was blood pouring all over my hand. I said, I guess I know what that is. And I went -- I was going down for protection, and they were screaming, get down, get down, there was bullets. And those Secret Service guys were and person, Kate (ph), they were on top of me in a matter of, I think three seconds, it was time dead, and bullets were coming out. I would hear the bullet. I didn't realize you could hear it, but now I know very well those bullets were going right over my head. They were there and very brave. There was nobody that said, I'm not going to be going there. They just -- they were there very quickly. And they were very brave. They were -- and there were mistakes made, obviously, shouldn't have been up there. The roof should have been taken care of. And there were mistakes made. There's no question about it, but there was a lot of bravery also, we have to remember that. OK. Thank you.",

Kristen Holmes, a reporter who has been covering the Trump campaign for us.Kristen, when asked about the personal attacks he continues to make against vice president Kamala Harris. Trump responded that he thinks he's entitled to say those things about her, among other things, he said, I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. She's not very smart. She's a radical left socialist. Who will? She's a radical left socialist who will destroy our country. What did you make of that assessment?",

She was questioning whether or not he was going to and then he went on for roughly what seemed to be 10 to 15 minutes in an answer that one yes, he said that he felt like he was entitled to personal attacks because he was angry at her, he was angry at the state of the country.But then he went into a series of diatribes, talking about the court cases against him, talking about how everyone was out to get him. That was really just Donald Trump in his own element, going through the grievances that have fueled a lot of his campaign. He almost at one point seemed like he was on a roll as he continued to personally attack her and then continued to dive into all of the things that were out to get him play into the real victimhood there, but again, him saying that he was entitled to those personal attacks. He also actually said that she first was the one who called him and J.D. Vance weird and then defended the two of them. But it was interesting to hear him say that essentially, he's not going to stop.",

As a fact checker, he's entitled to assert his innocence, but I made a whole list here of other claims that were just flat out wrong, like this was just a whole bunch of nonsense. He claimed that nobody knows that Vice President Harris's last name is Harris.Like, what are we even doing here? That was the caliber of the claim. He said, when his crowds in 2016 chanted lock her up about Hillary Clinton, he said, easy, easy. In fact, on some occasions, he said, lock her up himself. On other occasions, he stood back and allowed those chants to continue. So he wasn't calming them down. He said, again, you're allowed to rob a store in California. You're not no matter what the amount. He said he won his civil fraud case, but then a lower court judge ignored an appeals court decision and still penalized him for a large amount of money. He never won that case. He's grossly mischaracterizing what the appeals court actually said. He said he did much better in Pennsylvania in the 2020 election than he did in 2016 when he won the state. No he did worse. He lost it fair and fair and square in 2020. And on that same note, he spoke vaguely of mystery votes in 2020 he claimed were not counted, votes in addition to his actual vote totals. Those votes simply did not exist. His vote total was his vote total. He lost the election fair and square.",

I mean, this is why, you know, when you hold a press conference like this and you see that the Harris campaign and allies would like him to do this every day. You know, David Urban was talking earlier. I'm sure he'll talk in a moment here about how great the scripted portion was that we heard earlier in the show, Wolf, this was obviously not that at all.And as Kristen said, when you think about Donald Trump's current place in this race, first of all, he clearly needs to alter the trajectory at the moment, something has to change for Donald Trump, and what he's doing here is actually going through the greatest hits. So I'm not sure how that will accomplish his goal, which he stated in this press conference. His goal is to define Kamala Harris. I don't know how going through court case by court case and prosecutor by prosecutor, or revisiting 20 -- lies about the 2020 election, or any of that is going to help him in his stated goal of defining Kamala Harris. Because he says, right now, his assessment is the country doesn't know her very well. That's working to her benefit this. So she's winning this battle at the moment of this race to define her. And he says, the onslaught is coming, but then gets completely taken off track into these other things. That is not what his campaign wanted out of this press conference.",

The president knows what he needs to do, but he kind of got lost along the way.Listen, I think he's strongest when he's talking about fracking and he's talking about people involved in the oil and gas industry, and how Kamala Harris needs to answer, how about she transitioned for being the queen of the Green New Deal to suddenly sending out some nameless, faceless press person to say, no, no, now I support fracking. I think he was strongest when he's talking about the first step act and working with, you know, in a bipartisan fashion to release, you know, nonviolent drug offenders from prison. And he had to wrestle up votes amongst the Republican Party to get things done in a bipartisan fashion. Those things are important. I think when we talk about issues, that Trump is very, very strong, and he doesn't talk about issues. It's weaker. We need to keep defining it. He needs to keep doing the job that he started out. And I think you know, the tide will turn if he keeps defining Kamala Harris is being part of the Harris-Biden administration. Her name is on the door.",
