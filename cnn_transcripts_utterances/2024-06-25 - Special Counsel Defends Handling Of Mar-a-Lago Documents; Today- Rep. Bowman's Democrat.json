      "sentences": "Welcome back. Seconds before 5New this morning, special counsel Jack Smith's office defending his investigators' handling of the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. In a scathing late-night filing that included never-before-seen evidence photos, the special counsel's office claims investigators found boxes with their contents spilled on the floor, insisting \"Nothing has been lost, much less destroyed, and there has been no bad faith. The court should see Trump's newly invented explanations, and his motion for what they are -- his latest unfounded accusations against law enforcement professionals doing their jobs.\" Let's bring in Deborah Pearlstein. She's a constitutional law professor at Princeton University. Deborah, good morning to you. Things seem to be getting pretty contentious here for the Jack Smith team to kind of put these photos out there in response to accusations from the Trump team. What do you make of kind of the tone, tenor, and level of tension that we seem be seeing here? DEBORAH PEARLSTEIN, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY (via Webex by Cisco):  So, good morning. It is extraordinary and there are a number of things that have become extraordinary about the case as it has gone on and really stretched out in these pretrial proceedings over a period of months. Even though both parties -- both sides of the case agreed some months back that they would be prepared to go to trial over the summer, the judge, extraordinarily, has not yet set a trial date. And most recently, in the last few days, beginning last Friday, there have been a series of hearings in the case involving the former president's challenge to the legality of the special counsel's authority altogether. These are authorities and laws that have been upheld by the Supreme Court for 50 years and, indeed, have been used since the 19th century in the country. So as trial -- or as trial should be getting closer and it's yet not, the judge's really sort of extraordinary behavior in this case is becoming I think increasingly contentious and is driving the growing tension in the case in general.",

Starting Wednesday, they announced that Thursday and Friday are also going to be days when they hand down decisions. And we know that the court typically waits until the very last day of their term. Usually, it's in June, but we could be pushing July this time around. What do expect from the court?

A) it's going to tell us how the issue of the Israel-Hamas War is really playing within the Democratic circles -- not in Washington, but at home among votes. The issue that has emerged as most important in this race in New York's 16th Congressional District is that Israel- Hamas war. You have someone like Jamaal Bowman, a pro-Palestinian progressive who is up in arms about the mounting humanitarian deaths in the Gaza Strip up against George Latimer, who is a local -- a local politician but somebody who has shown his pro-Israel bona fide. So we're seeing that Democratic split play out in full focus right now. It's going to be a big question of where Democratic voters at home -- you know, on the ground -- where they fall in this debate. And then the second thing it's going to tell with -- and it's within that first thought, is the strength of the progressive movement. If Bowman is picked off here in this primary, he would be a very large voice in the so-called Progressive Squad to lose his seat in this primary. It's going to test the potency of the progressive movement on the floor -- on the ground with voters on this extremely emotionally charged issue of the Israel-Hamas war.",

For Biden, the questions do revolve around competence. Whether he is still up to the job now, much less for another four years. And for Trump, even though the retrospective job approval on his presidency has been going up because people are focusing on contrasted inflation, there are still enormous doubts about his volatility, his divisiveness, his fundamental commitment to democracy and the rule of law.

That is a reflection of the fact that there are millions of Americans who think that Trump will be better for their bottom line but are still unwilling to vote for him because of everything else he brings to the presidency. And his job isn't so much to make the case to fire Biden. That's 60 percent of Americans or 58, or whatever disapprove of his job performance.

The lead was short-lived though. Edmonton's Mattias Janmark strikes oil with a breakaway goal just over two minutes later. We're tied at one. The Oilers nearly take the lead in the second period when Warren Foegele's shot gets passed Sergei Bobrovsky and the net. But look at Dmitry Klokov diving into the net to make the save.
