We will talk all about it ahead.But let's begin with our breaking news at this hour. CNN projects that voters in Ohio have rejected a measure that is seen as a proxy in the battle over abortion rights. They voted down an effort to make it harder to amend the state constitution ahead of a November referendum on whether to constitutionally guarantee abortion rights in that state. It sounds a bit confusing, but we're going to explain it all. At least, we have people here who can do that for me. (LAUGHTER) Tonight, we have CNN political commentator Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Harry Enten, CNN senior data reporter, and Lauren Leader, co-founder and CEO of \"All In Together.\" Plus, CNN political analyst Coleman Hughes, host of the podcast \"Conversations with Coleman.\" All right, here we go. Let me first ask you, Harry, about what this vote meant, because it was a vote \"no\" -- (LAUGHTER) -- but it meant that you have a \"yes\" when it comes to abortion rights.",

Okay, so pro-abortion rights advocates got a ballot measure on the ballot this upcoming November in which a \"yes\" vote would essentially mean that abortion rights would be legalized in the state of Ohio. At this point, the law is that you need 50% plus 1 in order for a ballot measure to pass.So tonight, what happened was Republicans, conservatives, decide, in fact, to put a ballot measure on the ballot in which they tried to say, no, no, no, it's not 50% plus 1 you need, it's 60% plus 1 that you need. So, all of a sudden, they were like, okay, we want to raise that bar for that abortion measure come November. So, in this particular case, the \"no\" vote was saying, no, we want to keep it at 50% plus 1, and what we saw was overwhelmingly the voters, in fact, said \"no.\"",

Is this a mistake for Republicans to focus on abortion because of some of the numbers that you've seen here?I do want to throw up a full screen to give you an idea of some recent polling that we have done. Sixty-four percent of Americans disapprove the overturning of Roe v. Wade. And when you look at those numbers, it's Democrats and independent voters who seem to be the ones that are up for grabs, if you will, on this issue who are saying, look, this is important to us, we really, really, really are going to pay attention to what people are saying about this issue. Should Republicans be pushing this issue if they're running for state office, if they're running for federal office? GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think it's important to recognize that democracy was put on display here, right? The Supreme Court pushed us back to the states, and each state's going to have their own personality, their own leans towards policies one way or another. Ohio spoke, and they spoke loudly with which direction they want to go. And also, these constitutional questions are really, really confusing. (LAUGHTER) One of the most confusing things I dealt with in 10 years in state government. How you actually write the question, how you present it, double negatives, how it's delivered out into the populace. But from a Republican standpoint, you know, I feel like this issue -- we need to do a better job of being empathetic. We need to do a better job. Regardless of pro-life, pro-choice, we need to be able to understand that that single teenage girl who's pregnant and scared and worried, we need to be empathetic and understand. Instead of just trying to preach, we need to understand. I look at Georgia. We passed the heartbeat bill. Stacey Abrams used that as a cornerstone issue to beat Brian Kemp, and it really didn't become an issue because he wasn't trying to go out and poke fingers and make a point out of it. He was simply trying to pass foster care legislation to make things easier for the adoptive process.",

And that's what we're seeing, is that where it's passing, it's passing against the will of the majority of the folks in that state. And even some Republican lawmakers, especially women lawmakers, are saying this is a loser for Republicans. Americans don't want this.

You know, so much of what the president has been claiming is that he can't get a fair trial and a fair grand jury in the city of Washington, D.C. because it's a blue city now. He's potentially -- the case is going before a Georgia grand jury. Completely different political landscape. It's a purple state. Democrats narrowly won the state.

At the same time, this also comes amid, you know, some very unrelated stories of other violence. Right here in New York City, you know, there was a riot basically in Union Square after an influencer, Kai Cenat, said he was going to give away game controllers and he didn't. And 6,000 people, you know, were in Union Square and there was this paroxysm of violence that took place. And we're seeing this, too, with musicians having things thrown at them.

Was it just some three drunk idiots with their pontoon boat and don't touch my boat? We don't really know. Was it -- you know, was there a racial element? Is this part of just the general rage among some people that their country is being taken away from them? Does this come from Trump? Does this come from irresponsible politicians and journalists who are stoking anger rather than calming it? And, you know, personally, I also think there might be a lane here. I think about that line in McCarthyism, have you no sense of decency, sir? Who is standing up for decency? I think it's an opportunity for the Democrats, certainly if Trump is the nominee, to be the party of decency. But I don't see it as political.

This is the sixth shark attack reported in New York so far just this summer.

Let's get some answers from wildlife biologist, super excited he's here, Jeff Corwin, the host of ABC's \"Wildlife Nation.\" Jeff, I want to look at a picture really quickly first from our affiliate WCBS that shows the woman being treated by first responders. This shark bite is the first confirmed attack in New York City in 70 years. Are we seeing more of them now or are we just hearing about them more?",

First of all, when Peter Benchley wrote \"Jaws\" which was, you know, a huge commercial hit, critical hit, of course, the movie was even bigger, he immediately, when that movie came out, immediately regretted writing that book, and he became an advocate for shark conservation because it literally -- I mean, I remember at that time, I was a little kid when that came out, and everyone was terrified to go in the water because of this book.And the other thing you touched on, which I think is so important, is that sharks are what we call a sentinel species. They're the aquatic canary in this oceanic coal mine around us. And when we see sharks here, they indicate as an indicator species that an ecosystem is healthy. When ecosystems collapse, they can no longer sustain their apex predator, and we lose those sharks. So, it's actually a nice sign. Of course, you don't want to be on the wrong end of a shark, right? So, there's things we can do to avoid that. But having sharks around is good for our ecosystem and it tells us that things are in a good place environmentally. And remember this, Sara, I don't know if this gives you comfort or not, when you're in the water, whether it's New England or New York or New Jersey, and that's a nice, clean, pristine beach, you're never more than 300 feet away from a shark. hopefully, that will put you to rest at ease tonight.",
