But for some communities, including here in the university area of Hillsborough County, that's further up north, this was completely devastating.You can still see all of these dramatic images of this floodwater, flash flooding that came to them, blindsided them really. And we've heard from the Hillsborough County Fire and Rescue that they conducted 500 rescue operations yesterday, one of them along with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office was at an assisted living facility. They rescued 135 individuals, some of which had actually evacuated there for safety out of Manatee County. So, they came here thinking that they would be safe in a zone that normally does not flood like this and they had to stand in flash waters overnight in the cold, some of them requiring medication, their own oxygen tanks. They can't walk and they were taken back to safety across the state. There's been over a thousand rescues, according to Governor Ron DeSantis. And, of course, some people lost it all. At least 16 lives have been claimed across the state over in St. Lucie County, where we saw that the outbreaks of these tornadoes, six deaths happened there. The sheriff saying that mobile homes were lifted up by the storm into the air and tossed aside like it was garbage is what he said. And then, of course, there's a matter of recovery, of turning the page, the power outages, 2.5 million of them across the state, making that incredibly hard. Here in Hillsborough County, nearly half a million people are without power. And across the bay over into the hard-hit Pinellas County, St. Petersburg, that city has restored water to drink, but they're under a water boil advisory until Monday. So, still a lot going on, rescues probably still going underway today when sunrise comes up. But turning the next page and recovering, that's still going to be a long process. Kate?",

It was, of course, the first black man to serve as president, offering those stern words, but also this is a campaign that has often talked about joy and being the change. And this was a sobering moment for trying to address what, again, polls have shown is a weak area for the Harris campaign.Now, of course, he delivered that speech in Pittsburgh. It was an emotional one where he talked about a range of issues, taking -- for example, slamming the former president for taking credit for the economy. He also tried to draw stark contrast between the character of former President Donald Trump and that Vice President Kamala Harris, and arguing that she is ready for the job. Now, as all of this was ongoing, the vice president was on the other side of the country where she was rallying Latino voters, both in Nevada and in Arizona. So, this is an effort by Democrats to try to shore up their coalition, knowing how critical they are going into November. And former President Barack Obama being in Pennsylvania, no coincidence. Of course, that is a state that when advisors look at the multiple pathways to 270, is always critical to that path. And so, certainly, in Pennsylvania, the, that issue of trying to get black voters behind Kamala Harris is a critical one for the campaign to try to address and one that, of course you saw there from former President Barack Obama, he's trying to do. Not his only stop, by the way. He's going to be on more stops across the country in battlegrounds in the coming days and weeks. John?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And we should say from the outset here that FEMA does have the money that it needs for its immediate concerns. That's according to the White House. That's according to the FEMA director. But there are other pots of money that they are concerned about and specifically when it comes to the Small Business Administration. They're responsible for providing low interest loans, not only to small businesses, but to homeowners and renters as well who are trying to recover from this storm. And what President Biden says is they only have a few weeks of funding left and they need more money very urgently.Now, FEMA is also burning through its funds pretty quickly. They've already spent almost half of their budget for the current fiscal year, which only began 11 days ago. Eventually, they will need that money replenished as well. And what we heard President Biden say yesterday explicitly for the first time is that Congress should come back to Washington to pass some of this money. He put the figure at several billions of dollars that will be needed for this disaster recovery relief. What we have heard from congressional leaders is that they aren't inclined to come back to Washington, at least in the near term, to pass this funding. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that because it will take some time for the federal government to assess exactly how much is needed, that it will be okay to wait until Congress is scheduled to return on November 12th. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has voiced his support similar sentiment. But, certainly, they are coming under pressure from members of both parties who are representing these states that have been affected, calling on the leaders to call on Congress to come back and secure these funds. Of course, in the backdrop to all of this, they are the lies and disinformation about government funding, including from the former president, Donald Trump. You have heard, for example, Barack Obama go very hard against that yesterday. We also heard President Biden say very bluntly, directly to President Trump, get a life, man.",

But this was a terrifying six hours for the 11 tourists and one guy trapped a thousand feet below ground in this mine after an equipment failure for an elevator malfunctioned, leaving one person dead.Now, officials last night were tight-lipped about that casualty. They would only describe it as a tragic accident. But by 8:00 P.M. yesterday evening, all of the people had been safely rescued. They were in good spirits. They had asked for pizza, which was waiting for them up above ground, and as one official put it last night, a big happy ending to an otherwise tragic day. Now, according to the sheriff, all of this began to unfolded around noon. That's when he got reports of an elevator that was stuck halfway, at about 500 feet below the surface with one of the two groups who were in the mine. We know that the death occurred within the group that was stuck in the elevator. They were rescued very early on in the day, almost as soon as the event broke out. They included two children, four people reported minor injuries. Of course, there was that casualty. And I want to apologize, there's some service trucks passing by us right now. And just for some context, this is a former gold mine that was active during the gold rush. Tourists are able to go down in this mine cage elevator. It's very rickety, like they're very tightly packed. They go down a vertical shaft a thousand feet, and just for some context, that's almost the height of the Empire State Building. At the bottom, they're able to look around and, and get demonstrations on how mining worked in the gold rush. And so one of the groups was stuck on their return up to the surface. The other 12 people, 11 adult tourists from out of town and their guide, trap down there for hours. Officials initially were looking at doing a rope rescue. But with that height, of course, there's danger with just that. They were able to get that elevator to ensure that the elevator was safe enough to pull them back up four at a time. By 8:00 P.M., all were above ground. Now, the sheriff teared up when he talked about the emotional impact of this event. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
