As you mentioned, he recently testified at that congressional hearing saying that athletes and WADA need to be held more accountable. So, now the top administrator of World Aquatics, he has been subpoenaed to answer questions about how all that went down with those Chinese swimmers. This comes after a House committee on China on May 21st asked the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate the case under a federal law that allows probes into suspected doping conspiracies, even if they occur outside of the U.S. Now, 11 of those Chinese swimmers are set to compete in Paris in three weeks. They won three gold medals in Tokyo. So, the spotlight will certainly be on them whenever they step into the pool. But, Fredricka, you know, none of this is going to be settled before the Paris games. You know, the hope is that through investigations that the competitions can be cleaned up as the U.S. is set to host the summer games come 2028.",
