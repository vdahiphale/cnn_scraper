And so, we do begin with sobering statistics from the United Nations as Ukraine prepares to mark a grim milestone this weekend. Now, the U.N. says more than 9000 civilians have been killed as Kyiv approaches 500 days since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. This as the United States gets ready to announce a new aid package to Ukraine. And for the first time, a controversial and dangerous item is expected to be on the list, cluster munitions. Meantime, on the battlefield, Ukraine says it's making advances in the Bakhmut region. And then there is the diplomatic front. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Istanbul today, where he's set to meet with the Turkish president at any moment on the agenda, a key grain deal set to expire in a matter of days. The Kremlin says it will closely watch that meeting. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now from London with all the developments. You know, we were just saying 500 days in, and yet the fact that no one anywhere in Ukraine is safe is really ringing true especially when you give that figure of 9000 civilians now dead.",

And this, of course, over the last few days, we have seen an example, really, of the reach of Russia's impact on civilian lives. Just overnight on Thursday, we saw that devastating attack on Lviv in the west of Ukraine and it has, over the last few months, largely been spared of Russia's incessant bombardment. But of course, we heard from officials in Lviv describing this missile attack by the Russian armed forces, one of the most devastating attacks that the city of Lviv has seen since the beginning of the war. And in fact, in the early hours of this morning there was that confirmation from local officials that a tenth person had been pulled from the rubble, ending that search and rescue effort. Of course, at least 42 others were injured in that attack. And so, there is a clear sign there of Russia's reach in terms of the impact that their bombardment has had on civilian lives.",

They scatter bomblets over a widespread area, or they can fail to explode on impact, posing a major threat to civilians long after that initial attack. And that's due to the unexploded munitions similar to landmines. Now, both Kyiv and Moscow have in fact used those bombs since the Russian invasion, a move the U.S. has actually criticized in the past. Listen.

In terms of how these cluster munitions work and the fact that they're so menacing long after the conflict is over. Why do you think at this point you're not getting anywhere with the United States or Ukraine, not to mention Russia? BONNIE DOCHERTY, SR. RESEARCHER, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  Well, I mean, as you said, these transfers are very concerning. And I wouldn't say we're getting nowhere. I think the certain states are holding firm. U.S.' allies have held firm those states that are holding, that are party to the treaty banning cluster munitions are holding firm. And the U.S. has held firm for a long time. However, the Ukrainian, the pressure from Ukraine to transfer cluster munition has finally pushed the U.S. particularly President Biden, who's issued a waiver over the U.S. rule that prohibits the transfer of cluster munitions if there's an over 1 percent failure rate. President Biden has finally issued this waiver, but it's taken a long time. So, there has been a delay, but finally the U.S. has agreed to this unacceptable transfer that will undermine the stigma against these weapons.",

Now, this follows yesterday's, pardon me, Thursday's surprise announcement that the head of the Wagner military group, Yevgeny Prigozhin is not in Belarus as previously believed. Our CNN's Matthew Chance is on the ground now with more. Listen. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera):  All right, well, you join me here in this military base in Belarus, about an hour's drive outside of the capital, Minsk. You can see it's a vast, tense city with all these enormous canvases, which we're told can house about 5000 people that have been erected in the past few weeks. There were satellite photographs of this place before and after, and we all believed this is the location where Wagner forces, the mercenaries from Russia, would be located if they came to Belarus. That was part of a deal, remember, with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, inviting Wagner and its leader to come into exile in Belarus as a way of diffusing their military uprising in Russia last month. Well, I mean, at the moment though, these tents are completely empty. I mean, have a look inside at one of these here. Completely empty. There's nobody in there. It's too dark for us to show you inside, but I can tell you it's just wooden platforms. Nobody in there at the moment, but ultimately it can house as many as 5000 people. The problem is, is of course, the events of yesterday here with the revelations from Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian leader, actually, is that plan is no longer sort of in operation. It's on hold at the moment. And at the moment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, is not here in Belarus. He's said to be in Russia. And not a single Wagner soldier has so far come here. And so, we don't know whether there is going to be a transfer of Wagner to Belarus or not. At the moment, all we can tell you is that it hasn't happened yet. Back to you.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) POZZEBON (on-camera):  So, Paula, we were saying, a glimmer of hope perhaps because deforestation in the Amazon seems to have topped in the first few months in the Brazilian Amazon, sorry, in the first few months of the presidency of Inacio Lula da Silva. But at the same time, you can understand the logistical challenges that these transnational organizations pose to these governments. The river that we were seeing at the beginning of that piece is the Japura River. It springs in Colombia and then flows towards the Amazon River in the Brazilian Amazon. And unless there is close coordination between the two governments in this case, but also, all of the nine governments involved in protecting the Amazon and controlling the Amazon, of course, the challenge is only going to be more mounting.",

And it was very important to me to do this just because there were quite a number of reasons why I wanted to even make the attempt in the first place. It was important to me to push through like, you know, my physical limits and, you know, like everything. And I pretty much like spoke to a couple people and we put together an amazing team and away from that it was also, I have a very strong nudging to put Nigerian cuisine and Nigerian recipes on the map because I genuinely feel like Nigerian food is really good food. And you know, the more people try our recipes or the more people will hear about it, they'll be willing to, you know, try the recipes, make it and, you know, and it would just cross overboard because it's honestly really amazing news.

So, even the, what's it called, even the kinds of exercises that was given to me was pretty much geared towards me being able to withstand that, you know, long, extended period of time on my feet.

And when the approval came, it came with a list of guidelines, a very long list of guidelines, which meant that, you know, it was important to us to put a lot of things in place.

This letter is light on details and also, the layout of Twitter is not exactly a trade secret. And so, it's not clear if there is anything more to this at this point. What I do think is happening here is that Twitter, really, is threatened. Musk is threatened by the launch of this new rival. Musk tweeted competition is fine, cheating is not.

A drug aiming to slow down the disease's progression got accelerated FDA approval in January, based on the fact that it clears amyloid plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's. But Medicare declined to cover it until the FDA granted a fuller, traditional approval based on a bigger clinical trial proving the drug has benefits for thinking clearly and being able to function in daily life.
