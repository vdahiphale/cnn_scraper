      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we're following new developments in the Middle East where the U.S. has launched a punishing barrage of airstrikes. Russia is now calling for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting over the operation. The U.S. retaliatory airstrikes hit 85 targets across Syria and Iraq on Friday, all linked to Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force and affiliated militia groups. It's a response to Sunday's attack on U.S. troops in Jordan which killed three soldiers. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is saying this is just the beginning of the United States response. Iraq, Syria and Russia are warning that the U.S. is fueling the conflict in the Middle East. Iran says the U.S. has made a strategic mistake. CNN has teams around the globe covering all of these developments. Let's go first to CNN is Ben Wedeman in Jordan. Ben, Jordan's Air Force is denying any involvement in these U.S. strikes, but a source tells CNN that there was some cooperation. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the -- the statement that was given to CNN by a U.S. official was that there was Jordanian participation. Now, what that participation might be is not clear.Now, Petra which is the Jordanian Official News Agency came out with a statement saying that the Jordanian air force categorically denies that any Jordanian aircraft were involved in airstrikes along with the Americans on Iraq. However, it does not mention Syria. So it's not clear if perhaps they were involved there. But at this point, there's been no comment from Jordanian officials. Now, back during the war against ISIS. Jordan was a member of the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition and Jordanian war planes did participate in those strikes at the time. But clearly, we're still trying to get to the bottom of what exactly Jordan did if it did anything. As part of these this American operation, which of course, is not over and is expected this is going to go on. I must stress also Jordans in a rather sensitive position. The Jordanian Street is very much in opposition to -- to the U.S. in general because of its diplomatic and military support for Israel. But the Jordanian government has traditionally been a very close and cooperative partner of the United States in the Middle East. Fredricka?",

But in terms of when and what that looks like that the Pentagon and the White House are at this point keeping quiet. It wasn't just Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said this is the start of the response. President Joe Biden as well hinted there would be more to come.The question is, how does that play out? There is no expectation, at least not right now that the U.S. is going to strike inside of Iran. In which case it's what else do you go after in Iraq or Syria? Or do you look elsewhere? Notable in the list of targets we were provided yesterday from U.S. Central Command, they didn't go any after any of the leaders of any of these militant groups backed by Iran. So perhaps that is something they seek to do in the future. There are plenty of options here. And there is quite a spectrum of what the U.S. could do, short of striking inside Iran itself. The U.S. very closely watching the region. I think the U.S. made it clear there would be a response. Officials have described it as multi-tiered or multi phased. And when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked, why not just go big on one night and carry out strikes earlier this week, he said, look, our enemies don't see this as a one-day operation, and neither do we. They have a lot of capabilities. I have a lot more, he said at the end of a press briefing. So at this point, Fredricka, it seems like it's just a matter of time until we see what other U.S. capabilities they have in mind.",

      "sentences": "Well, as you heard there from Oren, this is really just the beginning, that is what President Biden signaled in his statement on Friday where he said, quote, \"Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing. He goes on to say, \"The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let us -- let all those who might seek to do us harm know this, if you harm an American, we will respond.\" Of course, that resulted in the strikes that hit those 85 targets in Iraq and Syria on Friday afternoon.Now, U.S. officials have told CNN that President Biden reach that decision on Monday, of course, there was a bit of a lag between his decision and when these strikes were carried out. And part of the reason for that had to do with the weather, they were looking for clear skies to determine their targets, and also avoid any unintended casualties. Now, going into this, the question has been, whether they can have -- whether they can hit those capabilities without being pulled into a regional war. And that's really what they were seeking to do here is essentially deter these Iranian proxies from carrying out additional strikes while also hitting their capabilities. And that is what we may continue to see in follow up strikes. But all of this just goes to the delicate balance that President Biden is trying to strike here in deterring these proxies, while also making clear that U.S. will retaliate and forcefully if U.S. service members are killed. And also the President trying to make clear that he does not want the tensions in the -- in the Middle East to escalate any further. That is what we have continually heard from U.S. officials and really speaks to this region being on edge and the U.S. in this precarious position of responding when Iranian proxies strike, but also trying to avoid any type of escalation.

Good to see you. So the Defense Secretary says, you know, this is just the beginning of the U.S. operation, what do you think is likely to come next? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's just the beginning, Fred. I think we could see a variety of things happening various course of actions, as part of a campaign, we may see another strike tonight, it's about hour -- an hour before midnight, right now in Baghdad. There could be more strikes not only in Iraq, and in Syria, but also in other areas of the Middle East to include Yemen, against the Houthis. We are going to see the potential for a day's worth of strikes, there may be delays, which puts the enemy in this case, the PMF forces on the alert that something may happen, but they don't know when and where. So I think it's a very good campaign plan of not announcing any further strikes and making the enemy try and figure out when it's going to come next and where it's going to come next.",

And it takes away capabilities.Last evening strikes as well as a couple of the ones that preceded it has actually contributed to -- to not having the PMF Forces and the Houthis have the capabilities that they had before the strike. So what you're seeing is, yes, it appears like an escalation. Perhaps it is. But it's an escalation to the point of saying that these forces that are putting U.S. forces and dangers, knock this off. We're not going to allow it anymore. And we're going to strike targets of our choosing.",

So when you're sending a foresight dad from Dyess Texas -- from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, that's telling the Iranians we can strike with a multitude of capabilities against the targets that we're looking at. And they can return tomorrow night from a safe haven 7000 miles away. All of those things are part of the calculus of how do you put munitions on target and put the enemy off guard. And by the way, Fred, mentioned you -- you talked about the Jordanians and their capability of contributing. The Jordanians said they didn't contribute as part of the strike package, but knowing the Jordanian air force, which is very capable, they have other aircraft, like refuelers and intelligence collections and command and control aircraft. So they may have not participated in a strike. But I think they're leaving it open to say, what did -- how did they participate?",

So here, House Speaker Mike Johnson is saying that he is going to put this on the floor to provide aid to Israel. But, of course, Fredricka, the priority for the White House has been not only getting aid to Israel, but also doing -- getting money to Ukraine, as well as funding border security, among other priorities. And I asked the White House about this latest letter. I haven't heard from them yet. But the general line from the White House has been the President's supplemental request that he introduced last October is just is an emergency request. That's what it is in in nature. And so by not -- by only putting Israel on the floor, that puts Democrats in a difficult position when they have repeatedly said that it's not just Israel that needs the funds, but also Ukraine. Now, as a reminder, there are continuing border security talks that have been ongoing for the last few months, those talks have been attached to the supplemental request, because Republicans have said they weren't going to move on any additional funds for any of these administration priorities without border policy changes. Now, those negotiations have been happening on the Senate side with Senate negotiators. And that is what House Speaker Johnson is criticizing here that the House wasn't involved and that they did not provide any input. And he's saying this as we're on the cusp of potentially seeing a deal and a vote in the Senate next week. And so all of these things coming together in this moment where the White House is repeatedly saying that they want to see all of these priorities get the additional money that they need in an emergency request that has been stalled in Congress for months for border security, Ukraine and Israel. The House Speaker now putting Democrats on the spot by saying that he will give a -- or at least put a floor vote on the House floor for aid, but only to Israel. Fredricka?",

And it's not just this, yesterday, we saw in three different instances eight Houthi drones were shut down, four more were destroyed on the ground by U.S. destroyers as well as U.S. fighter jets. So you see this continued effort to try to go after the sorts of weapons the Houthis have used to threaten international shipping. In the past couple of weeks, a few ships with ties to the U.S. have been hitting have suffered some minor damage one oil tanker not belonging to the U.S. suffered a hit and -- and also had to issue to distress signal where U.S. destroyers responded to -- to try to essentially help put out what was a burning tanker. So you see there the threat of these ongoing attacks and the U.S. effort to try to go after these. It has not been able to stop them, not at all. We have seen the Houthis continued to launch their attacks and vowed to keep doing so. But this -- this strike on six -- six anti-ship cruise missiles by the Houthis is part of that effort to try to disrupt their ability to threaten one of the world's most critical waterways.",
