      "sentences": "All right, Clare. We know you'll keep following it for us. Thank you so much.All right. New satellite images of Chinese cities capture overcrowding at funeral homes and crematoriums, suggesting the scale of China's COVID deaths since easing restrictions is horrific. The country's official death toll remains extremely low. CNN's Selina Wang has more from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  COVID lockdowns may be over in China but for many, there's misery at the end of zero-COVID. The virus is overwhelming hospitals across the country. The sick struggle to get help. Patients crammed into every available space -- every hallway and corner of this northern Chinese hospital. Not everyone survives the struggle. Rows of bodies fill this funeral home's storage room in Liaoning province, but we don't know how many died of COVID. In Jiangsu, families in mourning clothes flood the gate. And in Suitswan (PH) families line up outside right next to coffins, waiting to cremate their loved ones. China has only officially reported a few dozen COVID-19 deaths since reopening, but satellite images confirm the different reality we see on the ground. These images taken in late December and early January show crowds and long lines of cars waiting outside of funeral homes in six Chinese cities. The images from the outskirts of Beijing show that a brand-new parking lot was even constructed. We visited that funeral home. Rows of cars were already there. WANG (on camera):  I am now standing in that new parking lot of this Beijing funeral home. This entire parking lot area did not exist a month ago. And as you can see, the roads are not paved. WANG (voice-over):  One van pulls in, unloads a body, and another follows. A man tells me he waited hours for his brother's body to be cremated. But the wait is nothing, he says, compared to the crowds from a few weeks ago. Experts say Beijing's COVID outbreak has already peaked. In December, we filmed these body bags piling up in metal crates at another Beijing crematorium during the height of Omicron's spread in the city. This video CNN has obtained was filmed by a man who said his father's body was lying in this overflowing Beijing hospital morgue for days. He said his father waited hours for hospital bed space. By the time a bed opened up, it was too late. Cities are now scrambling to set up fever clinics and increase ICU capacity. For weeks, it was nearly impossible to buy cold or fever medicine. They were all sold out because of the huge demand. WANG (on camera):  Drug companies, like this major pharmaceutical manufacturer in Beijing -- they are going into overdrive to increase supply after there was a shortage of medicine to treat COVID-19 symptoms. I asked the vice president if they had received any advance warning from the government that they were going to abandon zero-COVID so they could prepare to ramp up production. Well, he didn't directly answer my question but it's clear that now they are doubling down. WANG (voice-over):  The company told us they simply follow government policy. The drug shortage, overflowing hospitals and crematoriums -- they're images of a country unprepared for the sudden end of zero-COVID. So many families in mourning are questioning what their three years of sacrifice during zero-COVID was really all for. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we end this morning in the NBA. Ja Morant adding another candidate to the dunk of the year competition, sending it over Jakob Poeltl late in the fourth quarter to a game-high 38 points. And the Grizzlies win over the Spurs. An absolute poster moment. More impressive, though, was Morant's play after the game. Check this out, Christine. Taking off his shoes and jersey, signing them, and giving them to a young fan, 11-year-old Elly, after he learned that the basketball that he signed for Elly at the Grizzlies game on Monday night was actually stolen.

That was back in the 1930s. Now, we're not there at this point, but the World Bank, this week, sharply lowered its forecast for global economic growth.Looking at markets around the world right now, you can see Asian shares are closed for their session. They closed higher. Europe has opened higher. And on Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour are decidedly mixed here. We've got some big data coming up in a few hours. U.S. stocks rallied at the close Wednesday. Long-term bond yields fell. The Nasdaq rose nearly two percent. The S&amp;P 500 up more than one percent. The Dow gained about 270 points. Investors optimistic the Fed will slow rate hikes. And today's key inflation report will confirm that red-hot inflation has peaked. Gas prices have also settled down from last winter as rising interest rates reduced demand, bringing oil prices down. All right, let's bring in Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. All right, Greg, where are you -- where are you putting your money this morning? Has inflation peaked? GREG MCBRIDE, CHIEF FINANCIAL ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM (via Skype):  I think it has. We are -- there are high expectations that we're going to get a much better number and continue this trend of decelerating inflation pressures, but we're a long way from where we need to be. Inflation has run seven percent over the last year. The goal is two percent. And by the way, a year ago at this time, inflation was also around seven percent. So we've only made progress from a peak of nine and we've still got a long way to go to get to two. So -- but what investors are looking for is just a continuation of this trend, less inflation pressure, and more broad-based improvement.",

So you've got this tug-of-war between the two. And so, markets kind of go up on this belief, then the Fed throws cold water on it and you see markets pull back.

But when you look at businesses who are cyclical in nature -- they're very closely tied to the health of the economy -- financial services is at the top of the list. Mortgage applications have fallen off the table as rates doubled over the last year. The stock market, as you noted a moment ago, was down almost 20 percent last year. Well, if you're a mortgage lender or you're an asset manager that gets paid on a percentage of assets that you manage -- well, you got 20 percent less money coming in the door. So I think what you're seeing there is kind of a harbinger of what we're more -- what we're seeing -- likely to see as the economy continues to slow further and particularly if those two out of three economists predicting a recession end up being correct.",
