But there's real tension between big cities who needs to cut, California. The irrigation districts there have some of the earliest water rights, so they have more power than the others.And the big red flag, or the wild card here is who Donald Trump appoints as Bureau of Reclamation. If he puts a loyalist in charge of all that water out there, that could complicate the politics. The Biden administration hoping to get something done, but a real Hail Mary because some of these players in these seven states and the tribes that are involved may wait for the Trump administration, may think they get a better hand that way. But it's fascinating, the politics around water out there.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think today is really a key test, both for Hegseth, who of course, is going to be confronted with a lot of what Sara just laid out. A lot of Republicans in the Senate who are going to be vital to ensuring whether or not Hegseth can get confirmed, they're really going to have to see whether or not they are comfortable with having him serve as the head of the Department of Defense. So it's a big test for him.It's also a big test, of course, though, for J.D. Vance J.D. Vance. He has been tasked directly by Donald Trump to bring some of these controversial nominees, or potential nominees and appointees, to the Hill to have these meetings with these key senators. And really, whether or not Donald Trump can get his preferred cabinet picks confirmed is really going to be a test of J.D. Vance's influence. And what we've learned in some of our new reporting today is that Donald Trump has directly asked J.D. Vance to kind of be his point person on Capitol Hill. Yes, he has others who are going to be officially named as the liaison to Congress, but J.D. Vance has been someone that he has asked directly to, one, help him with these cabinet picks, but also to ensure that they stand behind him on a lot of his agenda. Donald Trump firmly believes that he has a mandate that he was given, other people question if that's true, because he had won the popular vote and because of the results of the election, and he wants J.D. Vance to make sure that now that they have majorities in the House and the Senate, that they move forward with what Donald Trump wants to do and don't get in Donald Trump's way. So this is a test of that. And we also saw that, of course, yesterday when Vance kind of paraded Matt Gaetz through the Senate halls as well for these important meetings. And all to say, as well, I think when it really comes down to it, there's a lot of questions about whether some of these nominees, whether Matt Gaetz or Hegseth could kind of be viewed as the sacrificial lamb. I've heard some people argue that perhaps they are being used as a distraction so that Donald Trump can fill the rest of his cabinet. When I talk to those close to Donald Trump, they tell me that that is not the case. He really wants, particularly with Matt Gaetz, to be his attorney general. He wants Pete Hegseth to serve at the Department of Defense. And so I think this is going to be a huge test for them today, and really how we see senators and Republicans respond to how these meetings go.",

I mean, \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday published an op ed on Pete Hegseth saying it was unfortunate that the Trump team didn't know about that. And today they have a new editorial about Matt Gaetz, the attorney general nominee, saying the Senate has every right to demand to see the report on Matt Gaetz before confirming his nomination. \"It's one thing to keep sordid details private when a lawmaker accused of misbehavior is chastened enough to resign and go back to private life. This looks more like an effort to dodge accountability by getting a promotion.\" The Rupert Murdoch owned \"Wall Street Journal\", David.",

Also in this editorial, John, it says to the senators, the president-elect has every right to put his trust in whomever he wants to serve in these roles, but that, the editorial board reminds senators it is their duty to decide on behalf of the American people if these people should be trusted in these roles.And so I think we are going to get to a really interesting political conundrum for Republican senators real fast here, John, because President-elect Trump obviously had a very decisive victory. He has wind at his back as he moves into his second term as president of the United States. And there is a new a majority of 53 Republican senators in the Senate. The question is, are we at the very outset of this administration going to see just Republicans fall in line and give President-elect Trump the team that he wants irrespective of any of this, or are we going to see these Republican senators set at the outset, basically say to President-elect Trump, we have a role to play here, too. And it doesn't mean as a co-equal branch that we are always going to be completely aligned with you. And I think watching how that dynamic plays out is going to define sort of the Republican party era of Trump 2.0.",

That's going to be an instant -- so you're going to see these crosscurrents inside the Republican Party about the pressure from the outside being brought to bear on Republican senators. And yet, you see Matt Gaetz and J.D. Vance trying to work the inside game right now of trying to persuade and bring the senators on board. So this has a many more beats to go. BERMAN",

And they also, in doing so, foiled a plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange. This was first reported by the website Court Watch.Investigators first got a tip in February. They say that the 30-year- old was storing what they called bomb making schematics in a storage unit. They later found sketches and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices. The FBI also says that he told undercover agents that he wanted to detonate a bomb at the Stock Exchange the week before Thanksgiving. According to court documents, the man also told them this. \"The Stock Exchange we want to hit that, because it will wake people up.\" Also saying that the Stock Exchange was the target in order to, \"reboot\" the US government. Joining us right now is the former deputy director of the FBI and CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe. It's good to see you, Andy. Thanks for coming in. When I was reading through this, this is exactly how the FBI is supposed to operate. Plot discovered, investigated, and foiled before it can be carried out. What went right here?

Every crime is a combination of intent and action and so, you've got to see that person taking those actions like purchasing the precursor materials, in this case, buying the tools that it took to build the bomb.He actually constructed the detonation device, or at least the outlines of the detonation device in the presence of the undercover agents. But it's also key to making this assessment as to whether or not this person truly presents a threat. And at every step in this process, this subject showed the FBI that he was organized in the way he was thinking about this. He had some experience in doing extensive research on building these items. He was able to build the detonators for them when provided with the requisite kind of underlying elements. He had a plan. He recorded a video that he wanted to put on television after the bomb went off. So, this guy checked every box along the way and ultimately the Bureau decided I believe correctly here, that he needed to be disrupted before anybody got hurt.",

Much of the FBI's criminal investigative jurisdiction is built on this concept of interstate commerce, right? That's how the Bureau gets the authority to investigate things that otherwise wouldn't rise to the level of federal crimes. If they are conducted across state lines, that's how we get our authority. And that's where the bureau comes from.We decided we needed a kind of federal police force to address criminal activities when state authorities would stop at the border and criminals would essentially flee into other states. That seems to be what's happening here. It's the Bureau's unique capability to see and penetrate criminal activity, not just across states, but across, of course, international borders as well. These robberies appear to be -- they're so similar in nature. The target selection is so specific and so similar in nature that the Bureau is likely concluding that there's some sort of interstate or international group that's responsible for them, and they're providing that assistance to local law enforcement.",

They were street vendors for a very long time. We were able to buy a home and become citizens and I think when we think about why this law is in place, is to protect people like that, protect people that many of us know who are in this country, and they just happen to be undocumented.
