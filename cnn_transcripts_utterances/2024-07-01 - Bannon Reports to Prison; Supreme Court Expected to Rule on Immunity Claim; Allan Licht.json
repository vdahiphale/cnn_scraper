      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I mean I think Steve Bannon had hoped to do a live show out here this morning. They sort of had to rearrange that plan. I think he's live from his hotel.They are still going to try to make a statement before Steve Bannon pulls into the gates behind me and officially reports to prison, which will happen in just a couple of hours. And then once he's in those gates, you know, he becomes like a regular inmate. He's going to go through the metal detectors. He's going to get stripped searched. He's going to undergo a mental health evaluation. And then he's going to report to his housing unit. And this is where he's going to spend four months behind bars. Now, he has projected this era of defiance. He sort of acted like he doesn't care at all about the fact that he's facing this prison sentence. When I spoke to him about it, he predicted, \"I'm going to be more powerful in prison than I am now.\" He also told me, \"I will have a much bigger impact on the campaign when I'm in prison than I have now.\" At this rate he's likely to get out in October, just before Election Day. But I also talked to sources closer to Bannon who said, you know, behind the scenes, this is someone who was sort of in denial about the fact that he was actually going to have to report to prison. He really thought that he would be spared by the Supreme Court or one of the lower courts. You know, there's a certain amount of apprehension about going here, about spending this time behind bars for someone like Bannon. So, I'm sure we'll get a lot more of the defiance, a lot more about President Trump's - former President Trump's campaign when Bannon arrives here in just a couple of hours, John.",

So, as that is going on, obviously the other major story this morning is what will happen with President Biden and his presidential campaign. There are people out there wondering whether he should stay in the race. However, no prominent elected Democrats have said that he should drop out just yet. And one historian who has predicted nine out of ten presidential elections says replacing the president could cost Democrats in November. With us now is Allan Lichtman, presidential historian and history professor at American University. Professor, when we last heard from you Friday night with Abby Phillip, you said, no, replacing President Biden would be a mistake. You've had two more days to think about it. How do you feel this morning?",

      "sentences": "Even more strongly that it would be a mistake. You know, all of those who are calling for Biden's withdrawal, they have zero track record in predicting elections, and yet they presume to tell us what the Democrats need to do to win this election.And remember, all the pundits, you know, watched Hillary Clinton win three debates in 2016. They all said Trump was finished after \"Access Hollywood.\" And they are so often wrong. I have a system, as you know, that's been successful I would say ten of ten, but we can argue about 2000, since 1984. And the way it works, I have 13 keys of six fall against the White House party, they are predicted losers. Biden ticks off the incumbency key, and he ticks off the party contest key. You push him out, you lose the incumbency key, and you lose the contest key. So, instead of starting two keys up and having six more keys to fold and predict the Democrats' defeat, they start two keys down and only four more keys would have to fall. Moreover, how often since the turn of the 20th century has the party holding the White House every won in an open seat with an uncertain or contested nomination? The answer is never. And that's what all these critics would be setting up if they push Biden out of this race. They could not be more misguided. And his term - in terms of Biden's capacities. I'm not a neurologist. They are not neurologists. They have no standing to comment on that. And I would only say far better to judge Biden by three and three- quarter years or so of his presidency than 90 minutes.",

Have - what have - what's the discussion been around you with people who may not be in politics since the debate Thursday night?

Thank you for highlighting the importance of keeping Biden in this race and that the real danger is not Biden faltering in a debate but Donald Trump lying his way into the presidency and threatening our democracy. That's been the great bulk of communications I've gotten. Totally non-scientific, of course, don't draw any conclusions from that, but the American people who seem to be aware of the very serious stakes that are involved in another term for Donald Trump.",

But I have said, you know, with Biden winning those two keys upfront, he's only down two keys right now. Four more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. So, a lot would have to go wrong. It could.One of the four keys to look at. You know, forget the polls, forget the pundits, it's governance, not campaigning that counts. So, look at third party, which is a sign of discontent with governing, social unrest, another sign, and with two wars raging, look at my keys on foreign policy, failure and success. So, my final word is, forget the polls, ignore the pundits, keep your eye on the big picture as gauged by the keys to the White House. And I wish those who were so quick to dismiss Joe Biden would pay more attention to the fundamentals of how elections really work.",
