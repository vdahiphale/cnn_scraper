      "sentences": "President Biden calling the attacks on U.S. troops in Jordan despicable and wholly unjust, saying that America's heart is heavy and vowing to respond at a time and in a manner of our choosing.President Biden was on the road in South Carolina as this was all unfolding, briefed by his national security team, including the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. And you can imagine in those discussions a talk about how to respond in a way that would deter these attacks from happening again, but also the imperative to prevent this conflict from spreading even further. And at the end of the day, President Biden does have quite a consequential choice to make here. He is coming under pressure from some Republicans to respond directly in Iran to some of these attacks. But certainly, the imperative inside the White House has been to prevent this conflict from broadening. And the fear among American officials as these attacks had proceeded on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria is that it would eventually result in fatalities. Now that that fear has been realized, the decision President Biden has is how to respond so that it doesn't happen again. And certainly, he will be making that decision over the coming days. But in a statement, President Biden saying that the three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest sense, and their ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation. Together, we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families. Now, at the same time, the president is dispatching his top intelligence official, Bill Burns, to France for talks with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel on these hostage negotiations. Certainly, the hope among American officials is that these will be fruitful in securing the release of all of the remaining hostages in Gaza, paired with a prolonged cessation of hostilities. And really the hope had been that this pause in the fighting could cause some space for American officials and Israeli officials, along with their counterparts in the region, to come up with a plan to end this conflict permanently. And certainly, the death of the American soldiers in Jordan will lend some urgency to these talks as the U.S. continues to try and come up with a solution to this conflict and eventually result in lasting peace.

GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: We will see additional strikes, probably a lot more kinetic activity on some major bases that belong to the popular mobilization forces that are the puppets of the Iranian government. Don't know how difficult that's going to be, because, as you know, in this kind of environment, you can go after some forces, but it's difficult to hit all of those that are trying to harm the United States citizens, the soldiers in the area. So, there will be some more kinetic activity. And I would guess there might be some covert action, too, against not just the PMS and the Al Quds Force, but also possibly even some elements within Iran itself, because they know they have intelligence that Iran is behind this. Or so that's what the NSC has stated. Everyone's counting the 160 strikes or so that have happened since October the 7th, when Hamas invaded or, you know, conducted terrorist attacks inside of Israel. What we have to remember is this has been going on for a lot longer than that. Years of popular mobilization forces, the proxies of the Iranian government, have been conducting multiple strikes against not only the U.S., but also the Iraqi government. They have been fighting hard not just against ISIS in Syria, but also against the Kurds, the United States and anyone else that's trying to camp down ISIS. So, this is an opportunity for Iran to use their proxy forces. And by the way, let me state for the record, Iran could care less about any casualties that occur with the Houthis or the PMS or Hezbollah or Hamas. They just know this is an opportunity to continue to conduct strikes against the West, against the United States, because they don't want the U.S. forces in any of these Middle Eastern countries.

But in part because other signals have suggested Iran doesn't want to get into a direct conflict with the United States and Israel either.So, I think General Hertling laid out the options out here. There's the unsatisfying option of striking against a number of the proxy groups, including the one that launched this. Unsatisfying because you're not going to get all of them. And because so far that strategy has not succeeded in stopping the attacks. And then there's the risky side of this, which is going after Iran itself. Now, General Hertling suggested maybe some of that would be covert, which would presumably create a higher chance of sending a signal and a lower chance of bringing about a major response. Maybe it's against the supply lines of weaponry that Iran is sending to these different groups. And that would not necessarily require striking inside Iran but does require really explicit intelligence about what weaponry is.",

And that's fairly easy coming from people who don't then have to go deal with the and then what questions that would arise from it.I suspect that the president has already mapped out. I know the president has already mapped out what those options would be or his aides have. But my guess is you're going to find some in-between option chosen. The politics of this are all bad for him because President -- former President Trump is out there saying this never would have happened if I was there. That would have respected me more. Well, things like this did happen. Of course, when President Trump was president. And it was President Trump who had to pull back from attacking Iran directly at one point.

      "sentences": "Yes, so according to the Interior Ministry and according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper, it is the terror group ISIS that is claiming responsibility for this. The suspects, according to the Interior Minister, are one person from Tajikistan, one person from Russia. And according to AMOK, an ISIS- affiliated media outlet, citing an ISIS source, this was in response to a call that had come in recent weeks from an ISIS spokesperson released on an audio message calling on ISIS supporters, ISIS members, ISIS sympathizers, to target specifically Christians and Jews everywhere in the broader context of what is happening right now in Gaza.So this happened yesterday at the Santa Maria Church. This is in the Sariyer district of Istanbul. This is in the far north of the city on the European side, not too far from the Black Sea, and about 15 kilometers or so from what you would consider central Istanbul. So not close to the center at all. And there's actually security footage of the shooting itself that's widely circulated. We're not showing you the entire video, but we can show you a small section of the aftermath. But I can describe what happens in that video. Basically, one person is seen walking into the back of the church. Two people, masked men, follow. That person is shot. They go down. The rest of the parishioners go down as well. You can see one of the attackers walking up the aisle. And then very quickly, they leave. The parishioners, one of them quickly runs and closes the door. And then you can see them slowly get up from the pews. An absolutely terrifying, terrifying incident that happened. In the hours that followed, obviously there was a huge security presence in that particular area. And then a huge manhunt as well. As you pointed out, the Interior Ministry is saying that there were dozens of raids that took place. Some 47 people had been arrested in relation to this. And obviously the two suspects had been arrested as well. And this is especially significant, Max, because this is actually the first ISIS attack on Turkish soil since the 2017 attack on a nightclub in Istanbul that killed well over 30 people. And so, this is something that the Turkish government, the security service has worked very hard to try to prevent. In fact, the Interior Ministry says that there have been, he says, describes them as operations. Not clear precisely what that means, but more than a thousand of them just since last summer. And several hundred people who've actually been arrested in those operations. It is also important to note, Max, that this has been obviously condemned by all levels of the Turkish government, from the president himself to ministers right down to the mayor of Istanbul. And the list goes on and on. Obviously, Turkey is, the vast majority of people here are Muslim, but this country was founded on secular ideals that persist to this day. And so, the Interior Minister made very clear that there are many faiths in this country and in this city, and he wants them to be able to worship in safety. It was also, the Pope also mentioned this, saying that he felt closeness to the people in that church itself. And I can also tell you, Max, that the Catholic Church in Istanbul is quite a diverse community. Obviously, it's attended by some Turks, some masses in Turks, but it also caters, many churches cater largely to foreigners with services in different languages as well.",
