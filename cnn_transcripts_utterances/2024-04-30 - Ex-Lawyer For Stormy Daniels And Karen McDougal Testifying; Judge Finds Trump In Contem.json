      "sentences": "That's right, Paula.We're going to start though with an extremely busy day in Donald Trump's hush money trial. Four witnesses have taken the stand so far. The latest, a former lawyer for both for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, two women who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. Now, Keith Davidson negotiated deals for them to sell their stories. He says interest in Daniels' story reached a crescendo in October 2016 after those Access Hollywood tapes, that story broke. Prosecutors then showed an e-mail from Davidson to Trump's fixer, former attorney, Michael Cohen, discussing a $130,000.00 settlement sum. As for Karen McDougal, Davidson says she was more interested in selling her story than telling him. He brokered a $150,000.00 catch and kill deal with the publisher of the \"National Enquirer.\" Now the day began with the judge ruling on a separate, but related matter that Trump had violated his gag order nine times in posts on social media and his campaign website. Trump was ordered to remove the post in question, which went against the order because it attacked witnesses and jurors. The former president has also been ordered for to pay a thousand dollars per violation. Now, obviously, $9,000.00 is not a lot of money to Trump, but the judge warned that future violations could land him in jail. Now, I want to direct you to the left side of your screen, while we are having this conversation and talking about the latest in court here, on the left side of your screen there, you're going to be able to see key updates from the trial. CNN, we have reporters inside the courtroom keeping us up to the minute on what is going on since cameras aren't allowed inside. Everything they see and hear will appear on that side panel, so you'll be able to follow along in real time. Katelyn Polantz is live in Washington for us, who has also been following everything here. Katelyn, just get us up to speed on what we have learned so far, and I mean, how much longer are we expecting testimony to go here with Davidson?",

So it shouldn't be toomuch longer that we are getting testimony from Keith Davidson, though he certainly isn't finished testifying today. What his role is, is he is a very key person in this chain of people between the women who had stories to tell about Donald Trump alleging affairs, Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump himself. He is the person who has testified he had to deal with Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was very hard to deal with in 2016 and really trying to keep these women quiet in different ways, and so Keith Davidson was the lawyer who was representing both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal at different points negotiating with Michael Cohen and also working to solidify these catch and kill deals, either with the \"National Enquirer\" for Karen McDougal for $150,000.00 or ultimately $130,000.00 to keep the Stormy Daniels story quiet before the 2016 election. Omar, if you step back a second and look at the big picture of what we've learned today we are seeing the pieces being put together by the prosecutors of exactly how these transactions came to be, and how it was important that Donald Trump was behind these as alleged and some people like Keith Davidson were quite aware what this meant for Trump to keep these stories quiet, it would help him in the 2016 campaign, and also that they were very aware that Michael Cohen was doing all its business for Donald Trump.",

They have to pierce through many layers of intermediaries to get to the criminal defendant here on trial who is Donald Trump. So what they have to do is show that Michael Cohen was acting as a conduit for Trump and that all of this was going back and forth. Another piece of interesting evidence that came out today was that Joshua Steinglass got the witness to acknowledge that the e-mails went to Michael Cohen's e-mail address at the Trump Organization, again, showing he is not an outside lawyer, he is part of the Trump Organization. He is not acting on his own and he has a pivotal role during this negotiation directly with Donald Trump himself.",

I don't think anyone anticipates that happening on Thursday because that is for violations that predate his order of today. But I do think if you see more of them, you will see jail time because frankly, what the judge was saying today is that he really is restricted by this criminal contempt statute at a thousand dollars per find or 30 days in incarceration, up to 30 days incarceration. So I think if he is finding that these very small fines aren't doing what he wants them to do, I think he will have no option, but to impose jail time, but also, let me just mention that this is the first time in history that a former president of the United States has been found to be held in criminal contempt for willful disobedience of a courts mandate. But he has been attacking the witnesses and the jurors and I think the judge really has no option, but to put him in jail if he continues this behavior at this point.",

That is to reduce Jewish identity to only one sense of what it means to be Jewish or Israeli is a terrible thing. A healthy democracy or a healthy people have a collection of attitudes. What is happening in these protests is often, not always, is sort of an unleashing of an idea that we are monolithic and that of course, because of who we are, that must mean we support what is happening at every step of the way, right? That this is a complicated, difficult war between a nation state and a terrorist organization and plenty of people are caught in the middle and what is happening in the protest movement is a reduction to a very simplistic level of conversation and that is splitting a community, not just a Jewish community, it is splitting the campus community along the lines of identity and along very simplistic sense of what is happening.",

The former president was ordered to pay a $9,000 fine and then he deleted the post. The judge though warned that future violations could lead to jail time.

I mean, even today, by saying that someone should be more aggressive or wherever that might not be -- that's not really taking advantage of their expertise.

And there's also been near the prior trial from the A.G.'s office, you know, with the finding of fraud against Donald Trump, in which, you know, there were really a lot of threats and actions taken against the judge there, the judge's clerk and other people. So it's not like these are unbelievable possibilities. So I think it's a very, very tough. I mean, look, jailing people for civil contempt by courts happens, you know, not infrequently, and definitely also usually happens for far less than this, right? So sometimes people are jailed for not -- even young people, but for practical purposes stopped thankfully, but people who are minors for not obeying a court order to, you know, show up in court, even though they may not have sort of been totally aware of what they're supposed to do. So here we have a very, very, you know, wealthy, privileged, with lots of experienced lawyers representing, who was deliberately over and over in writing violating a court order.

He says with or without a deal, Israeli forces will enter Rafah and eliminate the Hamas battalions there. Now he is the Israeli prime minister, his words should certainly be taken with the seriousness that they require, but they should also be taken with a grain of salt and viewed through the lens in which they were delivered. And that is certainly a political lens, one that is -- words that are intended for a domestic political audience as the Israeli prime minister tries to ensure that his right flank in his current government sticks with him. But there's no question that this is bluster in part and that's because in speaking privately with Israeli officials, it's very clear that a hostage deal would indeed a prevent or at least delay a significant Israeli ground operation in Rafah. If there is a hostage deal, that means that there will be a ceasefire on the ground and that means that Israeli forces will not for at least some time enter Rafah. And there's no question that the possibility of that Rafah offensive is weighing very heavily on these negotiations, weighing very heavily on this latest Egyptian framework, which could see some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released over several weeks, weeks of pause in the fighting and potentially even a longer-term ceasefire for at least one year. But now the question is, what will Hamas' response be? Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has received this proposal over the course of the last few days, and he's been reviewing it and his response could come as early as today, perhaps tomorrow, but there's no question that that response will be critical to determining whether or not a hostage deal, a ceasefire, will be possible in the coming weeks, or whether instead Israeli forces will begin evacuating civilians from Rafah and then moving troops in.

We have seen large groups of protestersface off against police outside parliament. And we have also seen police use water cannons and Reuters reports they used tear gas to try and disperse the crowds. You're seeing the video there from earlier. Opposition protesters are angry over the so-called foreign agents bill, which is getting a second reading in parliament now. Critics say the bill would hurt Georgia's bid to join the European Union. There have been repeated protests over the draft legislation. And we will continue to follow that story for you. Now Amazon released its first quarter earnings just minutes ago after the closing bell on Wall Street. It reported a 13 percent jump in sales compared to the same period last year. Its shares are up more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after closing lower. In fact, Nathaniel Meyersohn has been following all of this. I actually had a look at the earnings and I thought that's what was really impressive here. What more did you see in the numbers?",

That's what investors are really focused on, not just the retail sales, but the growth in advertising, about 24 percent growth in advertising. So Amazon are just -- is in all of these different places in our lives, everything from shopping to streaming. We're going to be seeing more moves from Amazon in streaming and entertainment. So investors are going to be looking at that closely. Also, Amazon has been trying to increase the speed of delivery. So you're seeing more one-day delivery. So all these different factors are leading to this rise in Amazon stock prize. And it's a positive sign both for the economy and also the tech sector after kind of a difficult couple of years here.",

And that's the customers that are feeling the squeeze from inflation and higher prices we've seen in the past few years. And McDonald's has been hammered, as you and I have talked about, on social media for some of the higher prices that we've seen for Big Macs and fries. You know, these viral videos have really dented McDonald's reputation for low prices. So if you listen to the analyst call today, the CEO basically was talking about trying to provide value for customers. One analyst's funny tweet said, all he was basically talking about was value, value, value, and bigger burgers. And so that's how McDonald's is trying to lure back customers. More promotions, more deals, and maybe some bigger Big Macs. But certainly a challenging environment for McDonald's right now.",

The city is trying to address the problem with more rent controlled and government owned housing. Melissa Bell takes a look from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The view is second to none, the location as central as they get. But this rent- controlled apartment is now Catherine's for just $800 a month. CATHERINE CORTINOVIS, LA SAMARITAINE RESIDENT (through text translation): Welcome.

But here in Paris, there's the addedparticularity that this was a city entirely redesigned in the mid-19th century. And that's exactly what gives it its beauty, but also what makes it difficult for the city to adapt to the needs of the 21st century. (Voice-over): All the more so that in the 20th century, social housing was built on the outskirts, in the so-called banlieue, where occasionally top architects were hired to design vast social housing and sometimes grand projects, like the Espaces d'Abraxas estate that was built in the early 1980s. But for all their occasional grandeur, estates like these were kept at arm's length of the chic streets of central Paris, which meant long commutes for those who lived there. Then, in 2001, Paris's town hall was won by the left. IAN BROSSAT, COMMUNIST PARTY SENATOR (through text translation): Our objective is social mixing and avoiding making ghettos. Avoiding ghettos for poor people, avoiding ghettos for rich people. And therefore prioritizing social housing where there is not enough.",
