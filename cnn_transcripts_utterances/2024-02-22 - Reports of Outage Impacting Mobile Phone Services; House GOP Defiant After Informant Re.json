And in August 2022, he was promoted to Chief Fire Controlman, a critical role on a U.S. Navy warship. But according to Navy prosecutors, in November 2022, several months after that promotion, he began sharing classified information with a foreign government. Now, the charge sheet that we have seen doesn't list the foreign government, but according to prosecutors, this happened several times, November, December, January and February. Then in May of 2023, as Pedicini was serving on the Higgins in Japan, prosecutors say he had took a picture of a classified screen and was attempting to transfer that to a foreign government when he was arrested and taken into pre-trial confinement. He remains there several months later, now being held in San Diego, awaiting his court-martial here. He has been charged with 14 counts of espionage and the attempted transfer of classified information as we wait to see how this moves forward. Phil, it's worth pointing out here that part of this, according to prosecutors, played out at exactly the same time as Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who was charged with leaking classified information online on Discord.
