The first factor being that he wanted to avoid Russian bloodshed, and also that the march was a demonstration of protest and not intended to overturn power in Russia. Although he did end up downing three aircraft, two helicopters, and a plane.Joining us now from Kyiv, Ukraine is CNN Chief International Security Editor Nick Paton Walsh. And here with me is CNN Senior Global Affairs Analyst, Bianna Golodryga. Thank you so much for being here. And thank you to Nick. I do want to talk to you first, Bianna, about what has been said by Prigozhin because I think the headline here is he said that it was planned that his unit would cease to exist on July 1, which is basically accusing the military of trying to clamp down and get rid of his group that is fighting in Ukraine.",

And this came after a directive by Defense Minister Shoigu on June 10, said as much that all control of mercenary groups and private fighters would come under the auspices of the Minister of -- Ministry of Defense. Now, that having been said, what's interesting is that Vladimir Putin had supported that order and dictate from Shoigu.And U.S. intelligence and my sources tell me Ukrainian intelligence as well, and perhaps even Russian intelligence were aware that Yevgeny Prigozhin was planning to do something in terms of fighting back some kind of resistance. Why there wasn't better preparation on the part of Vladimir Putin on the Ministry of Defense's department, and why they were able to get as far as they did not over -- not only overtake a city of one million people from where the war was being directed itself.

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, it does sound from this 11-minute audio message. And it is often that Prigozhin sends audio and not video sometimes rambling this in particular over 11 minutes.It does sound like he thinks he can continue to keep the Wagner in existence as a legal entity saying that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, extended a hand and essentially suggesting that they may be able to find a way to continue to exist as a legal entity inside of Belarus. Now, I don't know if that was originally part of what the Kremlin thought was going to happen. And it's not clear, as Bianna was saying if Prigozhin is indeed in Belarus. But this is, I think, a culmination or another chapter of Prigozhin being a form in the Russian military side. And for months, he's been highlighting what everyone can see, frankly, the catastrophic mismanagement of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So, Ukrainian officials, I think, will hear this and perhaps be interested to learn that Prigozhin is trying to dial down where he is saying this is not a conflict with Putin. He did originally start out saying his beef was in the -- with the Russian top brass. And that escalated on Saturday morning when Putin accused him of being scum who needed inevitable punishment. But he's now suggesting it could be a way forward. And importantly, pointing out that a plan had been put forward where Wagner could essentially join the Russian Ministry of Defense at the end of the month, but only one or two percent of Wagner fighters chose to do that because they realized it would end their combat effectiveness. Are we going to see them pulled from the front line here? Is that going to weaken Russian positions? That's something that Ukraine is going to be poring over intensely. We've seen incremental progress over the weekend. Nothing is a departure from what we've seen during these weeks with the first part of the counter-offensive, but there may also have been Russian military recalibration during the past 72 hours to try and respond to the Wagner threat. We know 3000 Chechen fighters were redeployed to Moscow. That may have weakened part of the frontline near Marinka in Donetsk. All of this is being poured over. But the ultimate takeaway here, frankly, for Ukraine, is there's clear there's chaos inside Putin's inner circle here. We knew Prigozhin was critical but we didn't know that Russia and even Moscow, the capital, could potentially allow for over hundreds of miles a column, the Wagner forces to move towards it no matter how small or shabby they may turn out to have been appalling optics. And still today, Vladimir Putin releasing pre-recorded speeches. Not circulating himself, whether that's by design to distance himself from the catastrophe or whether that's because he's still working out what to do. We don't know. But the appalling time for the Russian higher command. Sara.",

And that has been really focusing on the more liberal opposition groups.They either left the country, they've been killed, poisoned, or are in prison, like Alexei Navalny. And what's been the big riddle is why he's allowed someone like Yevgeny Prigozhin for months now to not attack him directly, but attack the way this war is being orchestrated, and the leaders of this war. And the position that this puts him in, now let's remind ourselves that Vladimir Putin is still in charge and that this did not end up working in Yevgeny Prigozhin's favor.",

And this is after a decision earlier this month where they did uphold Section Two of the Voting Rights Act. And earlier this month, they ordered Alabama's Congressional maps to be redrawn ahead of 2024. So now, this is involving the Louisiana maps. And this dispute resulted because only one out of the six voting districts there were initially drawn to be majority black. And that map held for 2022 despite the fact that black voters in the state make up 33 percent of the state's population. So, black voters arguing that they should have at least -- had two of the six districts as majority black so that they were fairly represented in elections. And, John, all of this is significant because the Supreme Court's ruling upholding Section Two of the Voting Rights Act, this really could lead to minorities.

You know, Trump is out of office. He no longer owns that hotel. And it's also likely because the individual members of Congress are no longer seeking these documents. So, John, the Supreme Court will not hear this case. And that sort of still leaves this question open for future litigation, whether or not -- aside from a committee, whether these individual members of Congress can actually sue to get documents from another -- from an executive branch agency.
