Sister Hillary Clinton lost because she was not a good candidate. She didn't go to Wisconsin and you know even better than all of us, all the various factors that go into why she also didn't lose, not just that one factor.So the idea of putting all the responsibility on the candidates who get the few with votes compared to the other big two is just a way of rationalizing a two party system that has become more and more outdated and antiquated, both tied to big money and big military, and they don't allow us to speak to 60 percent of our fellow citizens who were arrested every day trying to put money on the table and waiting for the next check. And the gross wealth inequality continues. And and the military budget contends to expand. We saw this with Brother Biden, but I do want to say this, though, just quickly, that this campaign is also about getting beyond hatred and revenge. You see, I don't hate Brother Trump. I hate his lives and his gangster, neo-fascism. I don't hate Brother Biden. I hate his hypocrisy and I hate his milk toast neoliberal policy. And we have to be able to engage in a public conversation. It gets beyond eye for an eye and this vicious kind of revenge so that it reinforces the distrust and the paranoia. And that's a immeasurable dimension. That's an invisible dimension of my campaign that's going to set a different kind of tone of what my brother Cliff West calls a paradigm shift in American politics.

Top Biden campaign officials, DNC officials, including the Biden campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, they're hitting the road beginning today in Atlanta, hitting six cities in six different states. And this is really designed to try and engage, not only donors, but grassroots supporters, local democratic officials, effectively the president's top supporters to try and gin up enthusiasm.They're going to be giving them a peak under the hood of the reelection machine that they are beginning to build. And one of the critical ideas here, even though these events aren't specifically fundraisers, they are designed to try and build up some fundraising momentum ahead of what is a critical first quarterly fundraising deadline at the end of this month. And the Biden campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, she told me earlier today in an interview that, look, one of the messages they're going to deliver is that this is a critical time to invest in that campaign machine. And that's because it gives them an opportunity to build out the types of programs that they would like to see to reach victory in 2024. At the same time, on a separate track, you have President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other top officials, they're embarking on a fundraising blitz holding nearly two dozen fundraisers all before the end of this month. That fundraising number at the end of the month is going to be a critical sign for this campaign to show that they have the enthusiasm to win.",
