They have, you have, we all have, unfortunately, been here before.Today, the House will vote on a funding package of six annual spending bills mashed up into one that's been described as a mega mini bus. And Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, he is going to need the help of Democrats to get this over the finish line and do so in time. And what does that mean for his speakership and future. CNN's Lauren Fox is looking at all of it for us from Washington. What is the reality of what's happening here, Lauren?",

      "sentences": "Well, this was really inevitable all along, Kate. When the deal was struck last summer in that debt ceiling proposal and passed in the House and Senate, it really did set out this course of this spending negotiation over the last several months. It just took them almost a year to get to this grand finale.So, here's what's going to happen. The House of Representatives is going to vote today on this package of six spending bills. Then they're going to kick it over to the Senate. It's going to be up to lawmakers to decide how quickly they want to process it over there. They need to get agreement of all 100 senators to move expeditiously. The hope is that they might be able to get this done before the president has the State of the Union tomorrow night. If for some reason they can't get a time agreement, then you could see this kick into Friday, or over the weekend. But senators are optimistic they're going to be able to nail down some kind of agreement among their members. Once this happens, you still have another six spending bills that have to be passed by March 22nd. That second tranche of spending bills is even more difficult to get across the finish line because it includes programs that are much more controversial. Now, for Johnson and his future, you already have members of the House Freedom Caucus saying they don't like these bills. They're not supporting these bills. But ultimately, while many of them are grumbling, you haven't heard them saying this is the end of Johnson's speakership, in part because they do believe that when McCarthy set the course last summer with that debt ceiling deal, it became very difficult for any future speaker to get off the tracks that were already set for him.

She wasn't holding the gun when it went off. Prosecutors don't even know how live rounds of ammunition made their way onto the set. But this hinges on whether the jury believes that she, in her role as the armor, was negligent in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Now, this trial has gone on for over nine days now. The jury hearing from over 35 witnesses that prosecutors have really focused on that negligence. And in one particular moment, I'll play this for you, the prosecutor got up and said, look, we went through the scene, taking pictures of everything we saw, and we actually saw what appeared to be live rounds of ammunition commingled into what are called dummy rounds. This was across the movie set. And he played this video for the jurors and actually showing them some of these photos, including one photo where Hannah Gutierrez-Reed is allegedly sitting there with a live round of ammunition in the shot. Have a watch. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON LEWIS, SPECIAL PROSECUTOR: We were able to identify several points in time where the cartridges with a silver primer (ph) and a shiny brass cartridge ended up being spotted inside of the gun belts and bandolier that the cast members were wearing on the set.

But also, critically, how he will continue to fight for the middle class. His task tomorrow is really to lay out a vision for the next four years. What it looks like under Joe Biden, who would thrive, who he's fighting for, whose side he's on critically, versus what the world would look like under Donald Trump. I think for -- to reach these -- these Haley voters, and we saw this, you know, in the results last night. I mean we saw suburban voters who are going to be so critical to determining the outcome of this election. They didn't come out for Donald Trump. They came out for Nikki Haley. They told exit pollers that they couldn't -- they couldn't stomach voting for Donald Trump, even if he's the Republican nominee. So, there is a path for Joe Biden through the suburbs, in particular. And so he's really got to make this race about issues that we know motivate those voters. This question of who's going to protect your right to choose. This -- on this question of democracy and freedom and under -- under Donald Trump or Joe Biden, under which presidency are you going to have more rights? Are you going to be able to live your life the way you want to live it. So, he has an opportunity tomorrow night when people are going to be paying attention in a way that, at this stage of the game they're not really paying attention to presidential politics most nights.

Now, the challenge with work like this is that it's often behind the scenes, sometimes necessarily so. So, he has an opportunity tomorrow -- tomorrow night to explain to voters what he's pushing for, why, and his own personal values behind it too, which I do think is an important piece of this conversation that doesn't always - doesn't always show up. So, he'll have a chance to do that. But I think the other thing to think about is, for voters who are frustrated with his policy, you know, if you look at the choice in November, it's going to be a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Donald Trump went on Fox two days ago and was asked what the IDF should do, and he said they should go into Gaza and finish the problem. So, as the race -- as the race crystallizes, as the choice becomes not just Joe Biden and, well, I'm frustrated with some elements of his policy and in theory I'd like to see another option, the choice is going to be, Joe Biden or Donald Trump. And I just -- I think for voters who are concerned about the loss of life in Gaza and what they're seeing, what they're witnessing there, Donald Trump isn't the answer to alleviate that suffering.",

DeSantis championed the law throughout his failed run for president, and it was a key part of his war on, quote, \"woke ideology.\" The law banned teachings or mandatory workplace activities that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based on their race, color, sex, or national origin. Now, the state of Florida argued that the legislation regulated the conduct of requiring employees to attend meetings. The court, however, they disagreed and said that the law targets speech. Court of Appeals Judge Britt Grant, who was appointed by former President Trump, issued the opinion, writing in part, quote, \"even if we presumed that the act served the interest of combating discrimination in some way, its breadth and scope would doom it. Banning speech on a wide variety of political topics is bad; banning speech on a wide variety of political viewpoints is worse.\" The governor's office pushed back on the ruling, saying that the court, quote, \"held that companies have a right to indoctrinate their employees with racist and discriminatory ideologies. We are reviewing all options going forward.\" Monday's ruling focused on the workplace related provision of the law.
