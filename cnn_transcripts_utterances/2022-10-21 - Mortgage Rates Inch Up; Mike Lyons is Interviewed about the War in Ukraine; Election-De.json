And part of the reason why is because there's still quite a bit of demand, certainly not as much as there had been, but because inventory is so tight. Supply is so tight. For one reason because what Christine said. I mean most people who have a mortgage right now, that mortgage starts with a 3 or a 4, not above 5. So, if you're locked in at 3, 4 percent, there has to be a huge incentive for you to want to buy in this market.",

For buyers, if you can afford it, if you can afford those higher monthly payments, you actually might be in a better position now than you were the last few years simply because you have more negotiating power.

With me now is retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. Let's start with the idea of the northern front. This is the area we're talking about right here. The north of Ukraine, the border with Belarus. How would the Russians and why would the Russians do this? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, first, they'd open up that second front. It would be important. It would force the Ukraine military to respond with some level of troops, right? And there's talk of a joint task force between Belarus troops and Russian troops. So if you take 15,000 Russian troops, BTGs, and you bring them up to Belarus, combine them with their military, 20,000 or 25,000 of them, you've got a formidable 40,000 use (ph) force there that Ukraine would have to send 15,000 to 20,000 troops at least to try to make sure nothing happens there.
