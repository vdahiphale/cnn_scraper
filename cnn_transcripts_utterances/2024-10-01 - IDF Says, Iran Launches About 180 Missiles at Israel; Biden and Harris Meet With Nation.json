And I'm watching, as I'm speaking to you, Hezbollah's T.V. station, Al-Manar, is running loops of incoming missiles hitting Israel.So, clearly, there is -- among those supporters of Hezbollah, there is a certain amount of satisfaction seeing this happen, keeping in mind that two weeks ago, with the pagers attacks, the walkie-talkie attacks and since the over the last eight days, punishing Israeli airstrikes, and, of course, last Friday, the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. Certainly Hezbollah has taken just one body blow after another. So, clearly, there are certain elements within Lebanese society that are taking satisfaction at what is going on at the moment, not necessarily the broader population in Lebanon, many of whom have just been sitting watching television with a certain amount of dread certainly over the last 24 hours, as we've seen Israel start limited ground operations so far into the south. But, certainly, this additional development of these extensive Iranian missile strikes on Israel certainly raises the level of concern to heights we haven't seen yet. Anderson?",

As you know, and all of our -- most of our viewers should know by now, the Hezbollah forces in South Lebanon have accumulated thousands of rockets and drones and missiles potentially that could be aimed towards Israel. I haven't seen a huge -- I mean, they've been doing it a lot. They started October 8th, the day after October 7th, they began, Hezbollah, launching some of these rockets and missiles towards Israel.But given their capabilities of the assumption by U.S. intelligence, Israeli intelligence, was that Hezbollah always had a major threat, potential threat to Israel. Why haven't the Hezbollah forces in South Lebanon launched more of these projectiles towards Israel?",

We demonstrated once again our commitment to Israel's defense. We'll remain in very close touch with Israel and other partners in the region in the hours and days ahead. On a happier note, let me say what a pleasure it is to welcome my friend here. I think we've seen just in recent weeks, once again, the incredible vibrancy strength behind the partnership that joins the United States and India.

But Israel can reach most of Iran, I think. And/or you could strike at the oil export terminals in Iran and try to cut off their flow of oil or exports and cut off their flow of any foreign currency that they're getting. So, those are two options. Or you could stand by and you can count on the United States and its policy of let's don't escalate and hope that this is the end of it.But my guess is the political pressures inside Israel are going to demand a response, even though, as Antony Blinken just said, the attack was defeated. It was blunted, but it was still an attack. And if something's not done, it'll come back again, stronger at a later time, perhaps with some nuclear weapons, if something's not done. So, my guess is Israel has to respond.",
