The Lakers celebrate like they won, but there was still one second actually left on the clock. It went to overtime.

That's a reality we've discussed on this show, more active shooters than there have been days of the year. So, this has been a developing focus in training.It was a year ago today that I was standing in front of those microphones in Brooklyn for the active shooter on the subway who shot ten people in New York City. And, you know, we worked on this to make sure that everyone of 36,000 police officers in New York was trained in these tactics. And what you see here, you know, C.J. Galloway, the police officer, fires that shot that takes the gunman down, and his partner, you know they're approaching with these tactics in mind. They go to the far left, they're hugging that wall and they find out the hard way, the wall they're using for cover is the wrong angle. You know, nick goes down, C.J. cuts to the left and finds, you know, different cover. You just saw him on that video switching sides trying to get that beat on the gunman. Deputy Chief Humphrey said yesterday it wasn't perfect but it was pretty good, you know, in the circumstances, and I would go through a door with either one of these officers. And what does not perfect mean when you're under fire? It means in a perfect world, you would have waited for two more units, formed a four person contact team, split two directions so that the subject field of fire would be split into and so on. But perfect doesn't exist in these situations. You go with the cards you're dealt and they did, and they both acted very heroically, and aside from the courage, very tactically proficient.",

Of course, this was the first ever indictment of a president or a former president. Now, people started to take sides pretty early here. For example, Representative Jim Jordan, the new House judiciary chairman, wrote a letter to Alvin Bragg in which he said, quote, this is an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority and he demanded information from Bragg around the case.

And now what Alvin Bragg has done with this lawsuit is he's gone into federal court and he's asked the judge to do two things.
