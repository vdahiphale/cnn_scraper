His fate is up to the Shelby County Board of Supervisors.CNN's Ryan Young is in Memphis, the county seat for Shelby County. Ryan, a rally is happening now to support Pearson. Any doubts about whether he will be reinstated? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, that's what they believe that Pearson will be reinstated. The energy is behind him as you can feel with this crowd that is marching a mile from the Lorraine Motel all the way to the County Commission building. Let's look in this direction, the Tennessee Three are actually walking just ahead of us. This is actually been an attrition given with this weather right now because the weather has been so high that several people have sort of passed out on this walk. We do know that they're planning to move people toward that county commission. We believe that will last about two hours. And then they will send back those minutes to the state capitol. What a week this has been to see democracy play out this way with all three of these leaders now being catapulted into the top of the country, and everyone knowing their names. The talk here, especially that early part of this rally was all about gun violence and making sure real gun control laws get passed. With that, take a listen to part of that early rally from just a few minutes ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. JUSTIN PEARSON (D-TN): Representative Johnson and Representative Jones here in Memphis to continue what the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said the movement lives or dies in Memphis. The movement lives or dies in Memphis. And here at this hallowed place -- in this sacred place, we show in the United States of America and the Republicans in Tennessee that the movement is still alive. This is a democracy that's going to lift up the victims of gun violence instead of supporting the NRA and the gun lobbyists. This is the democracy that they're scared of. This is the democracy that they're worried about because this is the democracy that changes the status quo. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are people talking about voting coalition's all-around gun violence. And you add what happened in Louisville, you can understand why people are just tired of the senseless violence that happens with the innocent victims. Let's not forget about the victims here in Nashville, six of them killed, including three under nine. That's what really galvanizing people to come together. Black, white, and other, all standing together to really march and push this forward. But let's get back to the representative vote. That should happen within about an hour. We're not sure if they're going to do a public comment section yet. If that happens, it could take a little longer.

When you think about how popular the state is, especially Nashville with tourism, they understand that the country is watching to try to see exactly what happens. So, when you put all that together, and you add this energy behind it with young, with old, with black and white, it's a different sort of calculus in terms of how they may move this forward.
