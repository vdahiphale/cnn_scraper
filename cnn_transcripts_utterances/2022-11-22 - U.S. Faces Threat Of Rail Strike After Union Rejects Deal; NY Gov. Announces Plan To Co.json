EHRIE: Well, it's a two-part problem, Victor. The first one, as you bring up, there are monies available for people and I just spoke with several of my colleagues in the nonprofit space with these constituents, with community members who said what can we do. Specifically looking at houses of worship, how do we harden it, how do we protect ourselves there so we can gather in safety, which is a terrible thing just to have to think about. These are houses of worship where people want to come and receive some kind of relief or practice their religion. Now, we don't want to make these castles with armed guards out front. But these monies are available. The expertise is available. As far as the de-radicalization, this is something that's still in its nascent stage. We've been looking at this for years, not only in the law enforcement community, but in other communities. Does it work? Because in its simplest form, proving it works means nothing has happened, but is that proof enough? So I'm not sure it's worth us exploring, but the whole idea to protect ourselves and understand the society of this threat is growing and identify those threats as quickly as we can.",
