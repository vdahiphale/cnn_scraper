And since then, his military has really taken a beating.And these exercises will include, for example, Russia's Pacific fleet flagship -- warship. But the Black Sea fleets flagship -- that was sunk back in April by, we believe, a Ukrainian anti-ship missile. The Russians may be trying to demonstrate that they can fight a war where they're taking immense losses and still operate in a place like the Pacific Ocean. They may also be trying to illustrate that they are not totally isolated. That the Chinese are still willing to work with them. For China, they get to kind of show Japan, which is a close U.S. ally that has just announced it is dramatically ramping up its military expenditures, that it's got friends that can kind of make trouble and keep them on their toes. So there's some muscle-flexing and clearly, some signaling going on, and something that Tokyo and Washington are watching closely.",

Bankman-Fried appeared in court Monday agreeing to be extradited to the U.S. before the proceedings descended into miscommunication and confusion. The judge -- at one point, the magistrate clearing the room so attorneys could talk to each other about what to do next. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Bahamian prosecutors say that they had come on Monday to the courthouse behind me expecting to finalize an extradition agreement that would allow Sam Bankman- Fried to leave the Bahamas -- essentially, end his fight against extradition and go to the United States where he's facing federal charges for his alleged role in the meltdown of the FTX crypto organization and trading house. That did not take place as very quickly in the hearing on Monday, prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's local attorney faced off. There was finger-pointing and accusations. The local attorney said that he had not been consulted and had not been part of this agreement that had been reached apparently, according to prosecutors, with Bankman- Fried's U.S. attorneys. There were accusations throughout the hearing and eventually the judge allowed, at Sam Bankman-Fried's own request, a call to take place between his local attorney and U.S. attorneys to try to work out whatever differences have occurred. Shortly thereafter, within minutes, we saw Bankman-Fried be taken away under heavy guard back to the prison where he is currently being held. Some of his U.S. representatives said that he had been eager to leave the Bahamas and face the charges against him -- charges that could lead, if he is convicted, to over 100 years in jail. And one of the reasons behind that change in his legal strategy is that he is incarcerated at the moment at a prison in the Bahamas that, according to the State Department and human rights groups, is really unfit for prisoners. There's not enough space for enough beds. It's infested with maggots and rats. It's a violent place. And certainly, one could understand why a billionaire -- a former billionaire like Bankman-Fried would not want to spend any more time there. But as the extradition -- as the extradition negotiations have broken down here it appears that he will be staying in the Bahamas behind bars for some time longer.

[05:55:00] The plane carrying the national team landed here in Buenos Aires at 2:30 a.m. And as soon as the captain, Messi, emerged from the plane carrying the trophy, he was greeted by a live band and hundreds of fans that had been waiting for him for hours just to welcome him back to his homeland -- to the homeland of all the team, of course, in the early hours. After landing, the team jumped on an open bus that will take them to the headquarters of the National Football Federation where they are expected to rest for a few hours before a parade on the streets of Buenos Aires. The Football Federation is just a few kilometers away from Buenos Aires International Airport, but even that short journey was surrounded by hundreds of fans with flags and screaming -- and just expressing their joy at the return of the team. Tuesday has been declared a national holiday here in Argentina, so we can expect even more people on the streets of Buenos Aires as the team makes their way with the cup. It's the first time that Argentina wins the FIFA World Cup since 1986. And it comes at a moment where the Argentina economy is in dire straits with inflation at over 90 percent and the political polarization is as deep as ever. But this team and this captain, Lionel Messi, were able to really embody the spirit of the entire Argentinian people and that is why there are truly 45 million Argentinians waiting for them here in their homeland.
