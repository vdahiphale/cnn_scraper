From Iran's attack on Israel to new IDF strikes in Lebanon, you are looking at live pictures out of Beirut this morning. Plumes of smoke are still rising from the densely populated southern suburbs there, where the Israeli military went after Hezbollah targets overnight. Hezbollah claims to have hit back with a rocket strike on Israeli military barracks along the border and other launches at Israel. The fighting follows Iran's largest ever attack against Israel. The commander-in-chief of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says 200 missiles were fired and 90 percent of them, he says, hit their targets. The IDF's earlier estimate was 180 mostly ballistic missiles. The Israeli prime minister says most were intercepted and the attack failed, and that echoed by Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser in the U.S., who described the attack as defeated. Well, my colleague Jim Sciutto and his crew and my team were here in Tel Aviv as the rockets reached Israel. Jim was on air. Have a listen to what happened.

Earlier, we were a bit south of here in Gadara, Israel, where we visited the damage of one of these missiles, that one of these missiles apparently wrought on an elementary school, landing in the schoolyard right next to second and third grade classrooms, severely damaging that school building. The Israeli military is vowing tonight that they will exact serious consequences for these attacks by Iran. Some 180 ballistic missiles fired, several of them landing in central as well as in southern Israel. The Israeli military says they were able to intercept most of those missiles, but now it's certainly a region even more on edge than it already was as Israel threatens further retaliation.

Meanwhile, on Israel's other war front, video filmed by CNN crews in Gaza captured the sounds of cheering as the Iranian rockets flew overhead en route to Israel. With me now from Tel Aviv is the IDF international spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. And Peter, it's good to have you. We were here on this terrace at 7:30 last night when the largest ever aerial attack on Israel began, and it was ferocious. You will have witnessed the same scenes. The sirens were going off. It was a very, very frightening scene. And as the mourning continues and the damage assessment goes on, there are certainly competing claims as to the damage, destruction and casualties. So can you be very specific last night? What is the assessment by Israel on the impact of this ferocious attack? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Good morning, Becky. Indeed, 180 ballistic missiles indiscriminately fired at Israel from Iran. Of course, there were some hits, but they were mostly, I would say, marginal and never had any impact on our ability to defend ourselves, did not limit our air force capabilities, our aerial defense capabilities. As you rightly saw, we've seen images circulating on social media, but it's very hard to jump to conclusions. What we understand is the vast majority were defeated and intercepted or landed in open areas that had no impact, except for the inconvenience of being afraid. Those sirens sent 10 million people into shelters. There was one person that was killed in this barrage of ballistic missiles, a Palestinian in the area of Jericho. But other than that, most of us, like yourself, like us, we took shelter and did the responsible thing and took cover in the anticipation that there could be wider damage. Of course, it goes to the underlying message is Iran. Sure. Sorry.",

The aerial defense system was effective on its multi-layers different capabilities, from the Iron Dome and David's Sling and beyond.And I think what is important, of course, 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel with the intent to kill and cause death and destruction failed.",

I think we need to understand that our primary focus currently is destroying Hezbollah's capabilities on the border with Israel to restore safety and security and bring home the 60,000 Israelis that have been living out of home. If you want to ask what we can do, Nic Robertson was on a flight to Yemen when we conducted strikes against the Houthis just two days ago.And I think that illustrates our ability to go long distances, to exert destruction on our enemies that are all operating under the umbrella of Iran. So it does make sense. And I think that there is no distance we won't go in order to make sure that Iran pays the consequences for its actions against us. I think the prime minister, the defense minister, chief of staff, the IDF's chief of staff have all spoken very, very clearly. Iran can't be allowed to get away with what they did. There needs to be a very, very strong message that if you decide to launch an attack on Israel, then there is a price. But it's not only against Israel, because Iran is involved in disruption everywhere. They focused on Israel for sure with empowering and engaging and funding and training Hezbollah and funding and training and equipping Hamas in the south or the Houthis, which would not have any firepower without Iran. But so with them operating as this puppet master, there is a huge shift and we will have to deal with that.",

So it's the leadership to begin with.Secondary, I would say, there's the operations that are to take out their strategic assets. So what we've seen in the last few days is an increase on the pressure of their precision-guided capabilities, their coast-to-sea missiles, their surface-to-surface missiles, all of the heavy warheads that they have, all of these tools of destruction that pose an inferior serious threat, including multiple launch rocket systems. And the third component is what we've seen in the last few days is the ground operations against the staging grounds that Hezbollah have positioned on our borders to conduct a 7th of October-like attack. So we're currently engaging on those three different levels. The goal is to restore safety and security to the north, so that 60,000 people that have been evacuated over the last year can go home.

Tehran aims to enlist Washington and the broader West in its bid to foil Jerusalem's war aims, one of which is to destroy Hamas.

Because the past two or three weeks since that article have been game-changing weeks that have really eroded years of the Islamic Republic's investment in its terrorist apparatus, chiefly Hezbollah, but not limited to that entity across the heartland of the Middle East.And that was brought to you by a change in the way Israel had actually been engaging in these military operations. It went from problem managing to problem solving, and it tried to validate the theory that Iran has been invalidating since October 7th. And it's why for the first 10 1/2, 11 months of this war, Iran was indeed taking the win, up until this series of deeper attacks, pager attacks, targeting of Hezbollah command and control, special operations leaders, IRGC officials, and most recently, the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah in Lebanon. So all of those things combined have changed it, and now the balance politically and militarily favors Israel. And the Islamic Republic tried to save face with its nearly 200 ballistic missile barrage just the other night at the Jewish State. A vast majority of those, as you know, were intercepted. Still, some warheads, based on social media video, did indeed land and make contact, but not necessarily a direct hit. From that, though, how Israel responds and how Israel may be poised to take the win, whether that's going after the nuclear program, regime command and control, energy facilities, all of that remains to be seen. But the balance has drastically, drastically shifted, and it's drastically shifted in rapid succession. And another X factor to this question, and that gets to the heart of the quote that you read, is where is Washington in all of this? Will Washington again enter on the side of de-escalation, and will the election, given the fact that the first question in the vice presidential debate last night was about potentially supporting a preemptive Israeli attack on the nuclear program?",

And then once you sit in that place, we'll know where you stand on this issue, whether you're in the region, whether you're on the left in Washington, whether you're on the right in Washington.But look, there is a larger problem here. And that is well before President Biden chose not to run. There has been a deterrence deficit with even the way Washington approached the region's myriad security issues. The fact that from October 7th to present, there's been 176 or 177 indirect fire attacks on U.S. forces in the region by Iran backed proxies in a bid again, to threaten a wider war to force America to put the political handcuffs on Israel's military operation. That attempt has failed, but Washington has only responded militarily 11 times. So again, there's a real question of where is Washington and this sense that both adversaries and allies alike don't feel like it's done Washington has done its most is a palpable and understandable assessment.",
