We will have much more on that coming up later this hour.But let's begin this hour with the presidential race. CNN senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee is here with me, along with national correspondent Kristen Holmes. M.J., you first. How is the Harris camp viewing last night's debate performance? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, there's no question that the Harris campaign was and is feeling very good about last night. They felt like she delivered the message with millions of Americans tuning in. And she saw this as an important opportunity to make that first or maybe even second or third impression for a lot of folks who are still undecided. They were also really pleased with how often they felt like Donald Trump took her bait on a number of issues, including when she commented about his crowd size. But I think, despite the fact that they were feeling good, we are not going to be hearing the campaign saying this meant that this was a race-changing moment for the campaign. In fact, I think we are going to continue hearing the campaign calling her the underdog in the race, continuing to say that the election is expected to be incredibly close. And, in fact, a fund-raising note that we saw from the campaign just this morning, the subject line was: \"Debates Don't Win Elections.\" What that means is that the vice president is going to go back to campaigning and also, of course, juggling her day job. We saw her at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City earlier today. And she was there alongside President Joe Biden, of course, and also Donald Trump. The two actually shook hands for the second time in the course of just 24 hours, so a pretty remarkable scene there. And as for the campaign, we saw the team last night saying that they're ready for a second debate, trying to clearly signal that they're not afraid to do this one more time. She's going to be hitting the road. It's going to be North Carolina tomorrow, on Friday back to Pennsylvania, a number of big fund-raisers coming her way as well. And I think the other thing to remind everyone, there was a huge celebrity endorsement that she received last night. We are clearly going to see Kamala Harris and her campaign try to maximize in whatever ways they can the fact that she got the endorsement from Taylor Swift. She signed that endorsement, of course, on Instagram as \"Childless Cat Lady.\"",

Not obvious -- it doesn't seem, at least, that they will come from a position of strength if you're trying to back out of any sort of future debate. But, again, as M.J. said, it's really similar to what the Harris campaign is saying. Are they going to say that this was a full-on loss? No, and they don't believe that. They believe that, no matter what, at the end of the day, there are still two months until the election. There's a lot of ground to make up and that this is going to be a very close race. And that is what you're going to hear from the campaign over and over again. They don't believe this was a defining moment, but, again, those Republicans that I have spoken to were a little bit disappointed in his performance last night.",

However, Trump wasn't the only one who made some misleading comments. Vice President Kamala Harris made some as well. Joining us now are our senior reporter covering all of these issues. Daniel Dale is our fact-checker. Daniel, let's begin with Trump's claims about the economic impact of tariffs.

      "sentences": "That's a lot of wrongness, Wolf.CNN colleague Katie Lobosco asked the Trump campaign for any evidence that his proposed across-the-board tariffs on imported products would not raise prices for Americans, and they sent her a study which, when you read it, actually says prices for Americans would rise if and when those tariffs were implemented. And that's what happens with tariffs. That is normal. Tariffs are taxed on imported products, but that tax payment to the U.S. Treasury is not made by foreign countries like China. It is made by the importer who brought the item into the U.S. And, in many cases, we know that business passes on some or all of the costs to the final U.S. consumer. We have study after study, including one from the bipartisan Federal Trade Commission, that found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump's existing tariffs on China. So, when Trump says he took in hundreds of billions from China through those tariffs he put on as presidents, no, Wolf, that money was from Americans.",

But if you read that transcript, as I did again last night, nowhere in that debate did Harris say she had changed her own mind on a fracking ban. What she said twice was that Joe Biden, then the head of the Democratic ticket, would not himself ban fracking. Now, that made sense at the time. He was the presidential candidate. She was talking about what the presidential candidate would do. But she certainly nowhere in that 2020 debate made clear that her personal position had changed, that she personally wouldn't want a fracking ban if she were ever president.",

He says Trump is a guy who doesn't have any realty to principal, party, or patriotism, right? So he's this guy who's going to only do what's best for him. He's not actually looking out for the Republican Party. He's not like an ideologue, so you know what he's up to. And he's not really looking out for the country in any big way. He's really trying to figure out what's the best place for him to be at any moment, which makes him hard to debate, which is why it's so great that the vice president was able to debate him last night, one, get under his skin, but, two, dismiss him with just the look of her eyes.

That is the lowest level that we have seen in more than three years, which is welcome news for those hoping for rate cuts beginning next week. In terms of what's continuing to cause pressures on prices, rent. We know there's an affordability crisis going on in this country and it continues, housing, shelter costs still rising 0.5 percent last month. Airfares, a surprise. We have had five months of declines. They popped higher, perhaps some late summer travel influencing these numbers. And something that a lot of people keep coming to me and saying, car insurance prices are off the charts. They rose once again last month. And it's a huge part of the cost of buying a new car. On the downside, it's all about energy, energy prices falling, gasoline prices in particular falling some six-tenths of 1 percent, used cars also down. According to AAA, the average cost of a gallon of gas now down double digits over the past year, which is also welcome news. But the big question is, what does this mean for the Federal Reserve? This number and this data point tells me why they're saying, look, we're less worried about price pressures, as painful as they are. We're more focused on the jobs market. But the stock market today is disappointed because I think it's saying, look, these numbers don't justify a half-a-percentage-point cut. We're probably going to get a quarter. But if you're a borrower out there, Wolf, don't panic. More cuts are coming, the date September 18. We will see what they do.",
