How Snapchat went from a friendly platform to a target for child exploitation and their new plan to go back.I'm John Berman with Sarah Sidner and Kate Baldwin. We are all here. And this is CNN News Central. Just two days until the historic CNN presidential debate, and this morning, President Biden is getting brand new advice, unclear whether it is welcome or not. Some of it comes from the only person who has debated both President Biden and Donald Trump, that is Hillary Clinton. In a new op-ed in The New York Times, she writes, quote, it is a waste of time to try to refute Mr. Trump's arguments like in a normal debate. It's nearly impossible to identify what his arguments even are. He starts with nonsense and then digresses into blather. Yet expectations for him are so low that if he doesn't literally light himself on fire on Thursday evening, some will say he was downright presidential. Separately, CNN has learned that advisers outside the Biden campaign want the president to focus squarely on Trump and his policies and not on Biden's own first term record really at all. We've got the latest from both campaigns. First, let's go to Arlette Saenz at the White House. So, what is the mood in the Biden camp this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden's debate preparations went late into the evening as his team is trying to use every possible minute to prepare for a showdown against Donald Trump in just two days.Now, the campaign has signaled that there are three areas where they're really seeking to draw contrast with Trump on the debate stage. That includes abortion, democracy and the economy. And CNN has new reporting that some prominent Democrats have urged Biden's team to focus less on taking a victory lap on the president's economic accomplishments and focus more on targeting the way Donald Trump would handle the economy if he's elected to a second term. They believe that Biden should focus more on trying to tie Trump to corporate America and highlight some of the inflationary nature of his economic plan. Part of the concern is that when the president goes out to talk about his own accomplishments, things like 15 million jobs created, the fact that the economy has not gotten into a recession, that that's just something that hasn't completely landed with voters, as many still hold deep reservations about the president's handling of the economy, and many polls have shown that they believe they trust Trump more on the economy than President Biden. Now, the campaign today is trying to push their economic messaging. They've released a new ad, which will run across battleground states, really trying to draw a contrast between the two men, arguing that Donald Trump is looking out just for himself and not the American people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why they fired Donald Trump in 2020, and it's why Joe Biden will beat him again in November.So, President Biden is expected to spend the rest of today and tomorrow preparing for this debate as they are mapping out every possible scenario, including on how to make those economic arguments against Trump.",

      "sentences": "Well, he is not hunkered down at Camp David, like President Joe Biden and his campaign. But Donald Trump has been keeping up a pretty aggressive schedule. And I do just want to walk you through exactly what he's been doing.So, yesterday, he flew to a fundraiser with Steve Scalise, Majority Leader Steve Scalise in the House, in Louisiana. Today and tomorrow, he will be at Mar-a-Lago. I'm told they're going to continue to have some of those policy discussions that his campaign is continuing to dub as their, quote/unquote, debate prep. Thursday he will go to the debate afterward. He's expected to stop by at a watch party hosted by the RNC chairman, Michael Whatley, as well as the co-chair and Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, afterward. And then Friday he has a rally in Virginia. And the schedule is really kind of what the Trump campaign is trying to show, that Donald Trump is continuing to aggressively campaign regardless of this debate, and that he does not need as much prep as someone like Joe Biden. Of course, Donald Trump behind the scenes is doing his homework. He is prepping. He is sharpening his rhetoric. Arlette mentioned three key topics that Joe Biden and his campaign is focused on. Those are three topics I know that Donald Trump and his team are also have been talking about behind the scenes, abortion, the economy, as well as American democracy and Donald Trump's handling of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. However, I do want to point your attention to, John, another thing we're seeing the Trump campaign do behind the scenes, and it's really this pre-spin campaign, trying to set up this debate ahead of time as already being rigged against him. We saw the Trump campaign and Donald Trump himself attack CNN, attack the moderators all throughout yesterday, trying to argue that if this doesn't go well, Donald Trump can try to ride that outrage. It's something we've seen Donald Trump do time and time again. He's pulling this out of his playbook. They're also trying to manage the expectations for Joe Biden himself. We've seen Donald Trump repeatedly and baselessly claim that perhaps Joe Biden may take performing, enhancing drugs, something we have no evidence to prove. I'm going to read for you what Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday. He said, quote, drug test for crooked Joe Biden. I would also immediately agree to one. And now we know clearly the Biden team is not trying to take the bait here and not engaging on this, but this continues to be a key theme for what Donald Trump and his team are focused on. They are trying to manage expectations ahead of this debate. And behind the scenes, I'm told it's partly because I think they recognize that Joe Biden is in this weeklong boot camp leading up to Thursday, and they have set the bar, Donald Trump's team, I should say, have set the bar very low for Joe Biden. And so they're really trying to raise the bar here, raise expectations, as well as try and frame the debate itself as something that potentially they can walk away from and claim was biased. John?",

Assange bolts for the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He's there until he's extradited from there in 2019, held in the U.K. Belmarsh Jail since then for the last 62 months fighting extradition to the United States every step of the way.

So, what's interesting about these new features, the Snapchat has for a long time tried to prevent kids from being contacted by strangers they don't know on the app. But these new features use location data to try to detect potential scammers. So, now if a teenager receives a message from somebody who's not in their contacts, who isn't a mutual friend and who comes from a region where most of their other friends aren't located, they'll receive a pop up message warning them that it could be a scammer. The app is also going to prevent friend requests from being delivered to teens by people who again aren't in their mutual friends and are coming from a region where scammers are often located.So, this is all an effort to address the specific kind of scam called financial sextortion where bad actors often pretend to be other teenagers to gain the trust of young people online, get them to send nude photos, and then threaten them saying that they're going to release the photos if they don't, if the teen doesn't send them money.",
