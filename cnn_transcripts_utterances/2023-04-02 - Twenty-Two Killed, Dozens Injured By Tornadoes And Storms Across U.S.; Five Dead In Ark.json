Well, former President Trump's aides, allies, advisers have all expressed concern that he might not get a fair trial if this actually does go to trial in Manhattan, given the political makeup of that borough. But we have talked to a number of sources who say that Trump's legal team is not considering asking for a change of venue to perhaps a more Republican friendly borough, but that they are just waiting to actually see that indictment, which they are expected to do on Tuesday at that arraignment before they make any decisions.But the messaging behind this that this potential trial might not be fair is really what we have heard from the former president for the last several days. He has painted this as a witch hunt, this indictment, this case. He has said that Alvin Bragg is linked to Democrats, linked to Joe Biden, that this was in some way a favor to Joe Biden. He's even gone after the judge who he is expected to appear in front of on Tuesday, saying that that judge hates him. And this is something that we haven't just heard from the former president but also from many Republicans. And a lot of that is due to what we know the president is doing right now behind closed doors. He is making phone calls to allies across the country and on Capitol Hill. He is shoring up the support that he has ahead of this indictment. And I will tell you that the sources that I am talking to every day they feel like it is working. They feel like they are having Republicans rally around them. Now, of course, the question still remains whether or not this will be politically helpful in a primary. Many of these Republicans believe it will be but also in a general election, and that is just a big unknown right now.",

You know, what's left out of a lot of this commentary is that Donald Trump's organization, the Trump organization, his company was found guilty of criminal tax fraud. And the judge in that case, in fact, is Judge Merchan, who's going to be hearing -- most likely he's going to be the arraigning judge when Donald Trump does surrender, expected on Tuesday.And so, what that means is there are a lot of parts of this court system, including this Manhattan district attorney that are very familiar with his business operations, with the fraudulent way that they've done business for the last 15 years. Donald Trump's former chief financial officer is in jail right now this morning in relation to that criminal tax fraud that they were found guilty of. So, I understand why they don't necessarily want to go through another round of that, especially with the same judge, but they don't really have a lot of options unless they're going to try and either waive their right to a jury trial, in which case it's just the judge, that's not going to be so easy. And the other alternative is to seek a change of venue. Even that, though that's permissive. You know, the courts have to allow you to do that.

This is a criminal case. And it's a very different set of circumstances. We'll know for sure when the indictment is unsealed, but it doesn't do much good, really, to kind of attack the fairness of the system or attack the judge in a context where you don't really have the option of making that go away. This case is probably not going to be settled. This is probably going to go to trial. And, you know, ultimately you can stall and you can delay and you can insult and you can demean and you can try and study for the wrong test in the sense of rounding up your political allies who will be powerless to help you in court.

That number has grown exponentially with those who know the victims and those who have never met them, but are just moved by this tragedy, laying down balloons and flowers. But more often than not, it's stuffed animals, which is really just a reflection on where this happened, a grade school, and how young some of these victims are. They are children. And one of those children, nine-year-old Will Kinney, will be laid to rest today. Here his family, friends, described him as someone with an unflappable spirit, saying that the nine-year-old was unfailingly kind, quick to laugh, always inclusive of others. He loved his sisters and adored his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and was always excited to host friends. His classmate at the Covenant School, nine-year-old Hallie Scruggs, a funeral was held for her at Covenant Presbyterian Church on Saturday. Her father is the pastor at that church. Her aunt described her as incredibly smart and feisty enough to keep up with her three brothers. Her aunt said that if she had had a daughter that Hallie would have embodied all of the things that she would want in her own little girl. And just before Hallie was laid to rest, 61-year-old Cynthia Peak who we're told her friends called Cindy was also laid to rest. One of the best friends, the governor said, of the first lady of Tennessee. She was a substitute teacher at the school that day, a native of Leesville, Louisiana. A state representative in Louisiana told us that he had known Cindy his whole life and that she was a great friend and a good person. And the entire community in Leesville is in mourning right now.

The Vatican says there were about 60,000 people in the square, but they were lining down the streets of the Via della Conciliazione that leads up to the basilica, and the Pope took his Pope mobile after mass around, waving to people giving him a thumbs up. So certainly we saw the old Francis there who really wants to show that he's not going to let a bout with bronchitis get him down. He gave a lovely homily, speaking about people that society abandons, the sick, the elderly, migrants, some of those themes that are close to his heart. And of course, this coming week -- Palm Sunday starts off the most solemn and important week for the Christian calendar, and it is a busy one for Pope Francis on Thursday.

And their role and remit on Tuesday is a little bit different than we normally see with the agency.Typically, we see the Secret Service acting as the lead coordinating entity in terms of putting together a security plan. We see that time and time again with things such as the, you know, political events, things around the president, you know, State of the Union, etcetera. But here, we're seeing the Secret Service take a different role. They are participating in the planning process, but they are not the lead agency. And the reason being is because this is not their event. This is not something that Donald Trump, as the former president, is actually engaging in. He is doing business, what referred to is just private business before the courts. The role of the Secret Service is really to get the Former President from point A to the courthouse, let him do his business in front of the court, and then get them back safely. So, they're focusing on their primary remit which is the protection of the principal themselves, which is the former president. But in terms of the perimeter, the courthouse security itself, they're deferring to the NYPD, which will be taking care of all of the security protocols outside of the courthouse and the New York state court officers who will really be guiding all of the security procedures inside. So, it's a very unique situation. There's a lot of coordination between federal, state, and local entities. The Secret Service is not the lead agency on Tuesday.",

And I think that is, what is, you know, really driving a lot of the security preparations on Tuesday.And the NYPD is going to be primarily responsible for that external perimeter around the courthouse, but also remember, they have the remit of protecting the entire city. So, while we are focused on the courthouse and the actions on Tuesday morning there, the NYPD has a responsibility to make sure that all of the city is safe, that any of these groups or hostile actors who try to seize upon this moment don't do that.

Devastating strikes, both shelling and rocket attacks in that part of the country. You also had this moment that Wagner, the mercenary group has shared in a propaganda coup somewhat of their black flag right in the center of Bakhmut. That's an area that's been heavily contested by Ukrainian and Russian troops, and of course, that mercenary group. It doesn't necessarily mean they have taken that city, but it does show there's still heavy fighting in the area. This war has dragged on now for many, many months. There's been serious casualties, of course, by the Ukrainian military and civilians, but those who survive often have very devastating injuries.

Let's take a look at some new CDC numbers. When you look at ADHD prescriptions from 2020 to 2021, for males and females in basically all ages, they went up 10 percent. For women ages 20 to 24, they went up actually, almost double, more than 19 percent. It's not entirely clear why these numbers went up during the pandemic or really, if it's the pandemic to blame, or maybe it isn't. But if you look at the numbers for women that went up so dramatically, this might be part of what's going on. In recent years, there's been more of a recognition that ADHD symptoms for women are different than men, and it could be just the doctors are more aware of how this disease is different, and so they're prescribing more often.
