      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN Tonight.Alex Murdaugh will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the murders of his own wife and son. The judge who sentenced him today knew Murdaugh professionally and personally before all of this and called him a monster. Tonight, some legal observers say that those three hours of jury deliberations were too fast for a six-week trial. We'll debate that. Plus, you what will the future be like for the people of Palestine, Ohio, who been exposed to toxic chemicals from that train derailment. Tonight, a woman who grew up in the middle of a different environmental disaster has a message for the people of East Palestine. What she says they need to do starting now. And here's a question for you, how would you like to travel the world for a year, all seven continents, and see all of the historic sites like the Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu, the Great Wall of China, all your food and lodging is including, even some booze, for the bargain price of $30,000. But there is a catch, and we'll tell you all about it and see if our panelists are game to try it. All right, we've got a lot to talk about tonight. So, let's bring in our guests, we have expert Criminal Attorney Donte Mills, also Patrick McEnroe, an expert on a different kind of court, Grio badass Natasha Alford and Republican Jersey Shore-lover Doug Heye. Great to have all of you guys here with me tonight. Okay. So, Donte, I want to start with you about the trial. It was very interesting today to hear the judge talk about how long he has personally known Alex Murdaugh. So, I just want to play that for everybody because he talks about, you know, what his impression was then and then what is to come. So, listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE CLIFTON NEWMAN, SOUTH CAROLINA CIRCUIT COURT: You've practiced law before me and we've seen each other at various occasions throughout the years. And it was especially heartbreaking for me to see you gone -- go in the media from being a grieving father who lost a wife and a son, to being the person indicted and convicted of killing them.

They didn't see the emotion that they expected and that also he just was too smart for his own good. Having an instant defense when the police were on the scene and that being the body camera footage, that all backfired.So, juries are about democracy.

In other words -- well, let me ask you this. Let me just give you his point first. He says, our devices now capture everything about what everyone is doing. But making sense of that data is not trivial. In the Murdaugh case, both sides pointed to the digital record. But by the end of the trial, I felt like I had no idea what actually happened. The jury was hardly so cautious. Donte, his point was that we've all had the experience where our cell phone tells us that we are driving, when, in fact, we're a passenger or we're walking.

And whether it was the kennel video, where they heard his voice at the scene of the murder minutes before, and said no matter what the other cell phone data says or means, this has convinced me.
