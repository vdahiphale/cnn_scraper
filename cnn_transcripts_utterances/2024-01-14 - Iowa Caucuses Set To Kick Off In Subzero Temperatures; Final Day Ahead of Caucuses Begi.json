That is simply -- simply what he said he would not do. Back in November, he said there'll be no more short-term stopgap bills. Well, he is bowing to reality and trying to move ahead here given the divisions within his conference. I spent so much of last week talking to these members about exactly what happened over the last few weeks. And a lot of the members, particularly the ones who supported Kevin McCarthy, say the efforts to push him out made absolutely no sense in their view because they are left in the precisely the same place they were amid McCarthy's ouster.

And so, those members that now are starting thinking if things are going to change, they elect somebody new, you got to face reality now. Okay. And they're not facing reality where were going to end up from the get-go. I'm not big fans of them. Let's put it that way. REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  I feel like we just went through a four or five months detour to go -- to end up where we should have been all along. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  I just think there's a lot of people that would like to see him fail.

He has said that Johnsons job is not in his view, in secured the moment. He said he's not going to push for his ouster because Johnson is simply walking into this position right now, he said he cannot blame them for the mess left behind, but allow the Republicans blame those members on the far right for the mess that they are currently in, which is lurching from potential crisis to potential crisis and potentially kicking the can down the road for just another few weeks where they'll face yet another shutdown deadline and questions about how they can proceed.",

MeteorologistAllison Chinchar is tracking this chill from the CNN Weather Center. Allison, tell us more. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Right. So, I think the key thing is just how many people are affected by this. Take a look at this map. These are wind chill alerts and they stretch from the North Dakota, Canada border all the way down to Mexico, again to varying degrees because the criteria for each of these varies. So for safe folks in North Dakota, you're looking at wind chills as low as 70 below zero down across Texas, those temperatures are going to be closer to say about 10 to 15 degrees above zero. But even still, very cold and dangerously cold, especially across the northern and central portion of the country. These are current temperatures and wind chills. Right now, in Bismarck, the actual temperature is 21 degrees below zero, but that feels like temperature 47 below zero, not much better in Minneapolis. That feels like as 26 below zero and Des Moines looking at a wind chill of minus 41 at the moment, and its really not expected to get all that warmer as we go into tomorrow. So that means for a lot hi folks heading out to the caucuses. This is going to be absolutely the coldest set of caucuses in history. You can take a look at all of the previous ones compared to the forecast for tomorrow. Not even close. Again, that forecast high right around four degrees below zero. And to put that in perspective, that means Des Moines high temperature tomorrow will actually be significant colder than the high temperature in Anchorage, Alaska. Again, just to show you how unbelievably cold it is going to be in some of these places because that cold air is in place, that means is moisture moves across the country. You're going to get it in the form of snow and ice, even in places you wouldn't normally expect it now, in the northeast, we do and you're still having some lingering spring snow squalls and some lake effect showers, places like Buffalo, Erie into Pittsburgh in Cleveland. But it's down to the South. This is where it's a different story. A lot of these places aren't used to all of this. You're looking at snow starting to ramp up later on today across Oklahoma City and potentially some of that freezing precipitation for places like Dallas and Shreveport. I know its a holiday tomorrow, maybe not. Everybody has to work. But for those that do its likely going to be very slick tomorrow in Dallas and Shreveport is that's when you're really going to see a lot of that sleet and freezing rain coming down. To the north, you're looking at snow from little rock all the way over towards Knoxville, Tennessee. And that's going to continue through the day Monday and even transition into very early Tuesday so keep that in mind for some of these areas, especially across Tennessee, this is still going to linger Tuesday for so for those that have to go back to work, then you're likely going to encounter some slick spots there. Overall, most of these areas, especially across portions of Arkansas, areas south of Memphis, you're looking at widespread about three to five inches of snow that's on the ground. Farther south where ice and freezing rain are going to be the main concern, for those areas, it could be as much as a tenth of an inch, maybe even a quarter of an inch of ice accumulating not only on those roadways, but also on power lines and trees as well, Victor and Amara.",
