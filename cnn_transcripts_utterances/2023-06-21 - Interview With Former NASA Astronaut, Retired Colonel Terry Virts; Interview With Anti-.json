Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. A huge search is underway for five people on a missing sub, which is running dangerously low on oxygen. Searchers have picked up the sound of banging underwater, according to an internal U.S. government memo seed by CNN. Now, that has given rescue teams hope of finding the Titan submersible, which went missing on a dive to the wreckage of the Titanic. But time is critical. Officials think they have less than a day of oxygen left. On board are a British adventure, a French diver, a Pakistani father and son, and the founder of the company operating the tour, OceanGate. The Titanic lies around 12,500 feet below sea level, at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now, that's about 10 times the height of the Empire State Building, just to put it into perspective for viewers. Terry Virts is a veteran NASA astronaut and retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He is also close friends with Hamish Harding, who is on the submersible. Colonel Virts, thank you so much with being -- for being with us today. I know it's a very difficult time for you. Tell us about the last contact that you had with Hamish, right before he set off on this expedition. RET. COL. TERRY VIRTS, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT AND CLOSE FRIENDS WITH HAMISH HARDING: Yes. Hamish texted his crew from One More Orbit, the mission that we did flying around the earth a few years ago, and said, you know, I'm heading off to dive today, with a big exclamation point. He was very excited about it. The weather had been bad. So, there had been some delays. And that was right before they went below the sea and submerged.",

I haven't been able to verify that, it was reported on some news outlets. So, if that's true, that means the crew is alive, the cabin, the pressure vessel is intact. And that's really the question. And so, there's a couple things that need to happen. It's a search and rescue mission. So, there are several drones underwater right now. Very deep water, it's over 12,000 feet below the surface of the sea looking for them, trying to find them, tapping will actually help, the sonar can home in on that and triangulate. And then, they'll need to be able to rescue them, and this is all happening when the time is very short. You know, they're running low on oxygen. There might be carbon dioxide building up, and it's very cold in there, which, ironically, to a point, is good because that slows your metabolic rate. It actually slows the amount of oxygen and Co2. So, that makes that problem better. But if you're too cold, then that's not good either. So, it's a tough problem right now.",

I think if they can be rescued, they will because this effort -- you know, we have some of the best people in the world doing it. But the problem is going to be time, and they need to be able to find them. They probably need a little bit of luck. Another problem is, assuming -- we're assuming they're on the floor, they could be at the surface. I don't think they are because I think radar would be able to find them. But it's been five (INAUDIBLE), I understand, and that makes it harder to find something. I've spoken with some very senior navy folks and they could potentially be on the surface and we just haven't found them yet. That would be the best-case scenario. The problem is they're near the Titanic, which is a debris field full of metal debris. And so, sonar is going to have a hard time picking them out from a piece of the Titanic that might be right near them. So, I, you know, hope and pray that this search effort goes quickly.

But we do know that the search is ongoing. Any idea, in your view, as to what could've gone wrong? Because this is the third expedition of this type for this vessel to have taken place. And we have heard the previous two, though they have been successful, there were some issues that even lead to legal challenges and cases. They had lost contact and communication.

And I thinkthere's going to be lots of things that come out. But in the short-term, you know, there could just be a pressure hole failure, and that would be bad, that would have been instantaneous. That probably would've been very obvious on sonar. So, we probably would've known if that had happened. If there's a smaller mechanical failure, there could be a compartment or some part of the outside part of the submarine that filled up with water. And when that happens, it would sink. And it has a system that drops weights, and when it drops weights, it should go to the surface. But if some of those compartments is filled with water, dropping the weights won't help, it's going to be stuck at the bottom. I've heard some speculation that that might have been what happened. And if there was a mechanical failure that might have broken off their sonar antenna so they're not able to talk to us. So, it maybe that there were some -- like Apollo 13 had an explosion on the outside of the spaceship, but they were OK on the inside. Something like that might have happened. And essentially, we're in an Apollo 13 situation right now, race against the clock, the crews are running low on oxygen, and other consumables. It's -- they're very cold. And there's a huge effort, you know, up here on earth, back then it was down here on earth, to get them home. The parallels to Apollo 13 are very interesting.",

They've had issues getting off the ship in rough seas where they actually damaged the sub and passed missions, from what I understand. So, getting them on being -- having the boat be able to stabilize the crane. I'm not a navy guy, I'm just a fighter pilot. So, I don't talk too much navy here. But clearly, they're requiring ships to be somewhat stable. And also, you know, if there is noise from waves, that might complicate the sonar. But you'll have to ask the coast guard and navy about that. I'm just an air force guy. But the one thing I want to say, you know, people are talking about this is a big effort and there's a lot of expense and people are working on it. The good news is, I don't think anything like this has been attempted before. So, I'm sure that the coast guard and navy are going to learn some very valuable lessons. This is operational exercise that we didn't want and we certainly didn't plan, but I think it's going to be a good exercise for the men and women that are making this happen.",

But this particular company, CNN is reporting, that two former OceanGate employees voiced safety concerns two years ago about the vessel. And this follows a \"New York Times\" report that in 2018 more than three dozen industry leaders had warned this company's CEO, who happens to be on board, that its experimental approach, is what the word -- the phrasing they used, and decision to forgo a traditional assessment could lead to potentially catastrophic problems with this mission.

And we talk about the challenger in Columbia accidents that were two NASA space shuttle accidents, and they were entirely preventable. There were people speaking up, management didn't listen to that because they had budgetary and scheduled pressures. And so, that's a common problem that space company -- aerospace companies have to look out for, any company, if you're a Wall Street investment bank, if you're a pharmaceutical company, any large organization has to look out for these problems, which is why that course is so relevant.

And they deserve to go home to countries where they have a chance to get a job, to live in a community, to be a part of a faith-based institution. Too frequently, that's not the case. And so, we are -- part of what we're doing here is reminding people that special Olympics is more than simply a sports organization. We're super proud of the athletic achievement of our community. But we're challenging countries. We launched a global coalition for inclusion here. Countries like China and Egypt, and now Angola and others are joining us, committing to opening schools. I mean, you'd think it would be normal nowadays to assume that every child can go to school. It's not. 85 percent of children with intellectual disabilities don't ever go to school. Can you imagine? And so, countries are recognizing, they've made commitments to U.N. conventions and these kinds of things. But now, it's time for action. You know, we don't want to just wait and wait and wait and wait. It's time for action. So, we're challenging nations all over the world to join us. We'll bring the sports, we'll teach children to play together, we'll teach children to join unified teams. When we teach children to do that, they themselves will become agents of inclusion and schools will be better. Children who don't have disabilities will learn more. They'll learn better values. They'll learn better behaviors. They'll make their school climates, and they'll actually achieve higher test scores. This is a remarkable data we found when we implement our unified sports programs in schools in the United States and other countries. So, we're here to have a great time. To have a, kind of, a release from the painful experiences of the last several years of COVID and being isolated. But our athletes know a lot about isolation.",

With my book, I've traveled around the country to a lot of medical schools and I've been really excited about their willingness to think differently. To want to be different kinds of providers. I think of Doula Care. Doula Care used to be something that was only for the privilege. Many doulas, including the ones I wrote about in 2018, the doula collective, are much more birth justice oriented. We'll work with people on a sliding scale. Some states cover doula services for often the most poor women or the women who need it most. So, a doula is someone who can be with you when you're birthing to be your eyes and ears. When I was covering maternal mortality in 2018, it was really the doula that saved the birthing person's life that I watched and was the hero of the story.

And I don't go in saying, I think you're all racist. I go in saying, we have a systemic and an institutional problem. And one of the ways you can combat it is by going through some, kind of, implicit bias training or anti-racism training yourself just so you're aware as individuals of, you know, of what you -- what may be going through your mind because of, you know, the racism that is baked into society. And I try not to blame individuals. But I do say this is a problem. There is, without a doubt, there's so much evidence to say that we have discrimination and racism in our health care system. It's not even arguable anymore. There's been, I like to say, that we have enough evidence to fill the Library of Congress. So, we should stop arguing about that and try to figure out how to address the problem.",
