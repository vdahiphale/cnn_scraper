But late today, authorities arrested a suspect in the killings.I'm Pamela Brown, in for Anderson tonight, and I'm just getting new information from a source familiar with the investigation. We're learning that the suspect actually drove cross country from Idaho to his parents' home in Pennsylvania and arrived there around Christmas. This source telling me it was a combination of DNA found at the crime scene, as well as the car that helped authorities figure out who the suspect was last week, and that is when law enforcement got together to sort all this out and then they made the arrest, culminating in everything happening today. So they announced the arrest of Bryan Kohberger, this right here is his booking photo. He is a graduate student from Washington State University less than 10 miles from where the four victims attended school. He was arrested in Pennsylvania on four counts of murder in the first degree plus a separate charge of felony burglary. As we said, sources tell CNN, his DNA was matched to DNA recovered at the scene of the deaths. And tonight, law enforcement is asking for the public's help with uncertainties still surrounding the case, including motive and location of the murder weapon. Authorities today are specifically asking media outlets to publicize this information. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A source that is close to and has knowledge with the investigation tells me that it was genetic genealogy that helped them find who is now their suspect in this case.That DNA was unknown DNA, it is always put through the CODIS database when there are no hits, genetic genealogy takes over, and it was put through public database that found potential familial relatives, and then it is old fashioned investigation work that proceeds from there. But ultimately, they have to have the DNA from this potential suspect that they believe is the one to match with that unknown DNA. Now, here we are in Northeastern Pennsylvania. This is rural Pennsylvania. He was arrested this morning at 1:30 in the morning, Albrightsville, which is about eight miles away, a very country area with farms, and yes, there are subdivisions, but they are rural subdivisions. And from what we know, a CNN source tells CNN that the Philadelphia FBI was surveilling him right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania for the last four days. While that was happening here, they were very busy in Idaho because the FBI, local police, and the Idaho State Police were putting together the information they had to form the probable cause to go before a Judge to get that arrest warrant. It was the DNA, that source tells CNN along with the vehicle. Once they got that arrest warrant, a criminal complaint was filed yesterday, four charges of first-degree murder, and also a charge of burglary, the breaking and the entering of that home for the intent to commit a felony in that home. He was arrested. He is right behind me now at the Monroe County Correctional Facility. He had a hearing this morning, but he has no bond. The next hearing will be a hearing on Tuesday for extradition. Will he be extradited voluntarily?

CASAREZWe also don't know how they knew he was in Northeastern Pennsylvania, if they surveilled him on that entire drive, because you're talking about across the entire country at this point, and most importantly, they don't have the murder weapon. They announced that today at the press conference. But they made a plea today at that press conference that anyone that has any information of what happened and why did it happen, so that's going toward motive right there, right? They want to hear from those people. They say the investigation is ongoing, but this is a brand new phase of the investigation.",

But we also learned that he had a white Elantra, he was 15 minutes away from the scene, he arrived in, you know, Pennsylvania around Christmas. Well, by then, the entire area was already looking for a white Elantra and giving police tips whenever they saw one. So, it is entirely possible that someone from where he was in Pullman, 15 minutes away, said, hey, there was a guy with a white Elantra and he just, you know, disappeared and you know, drove away and we haven't seen him. So we're still kind of waiting for those details to come together. As for the apartment and the cleaning crew, it's also entirely possible that as the cleaning crew was going to work this morning, they already had this arrest in place and he had been assigned a public defender with an attorney there. He may have even asked for, or they may have just put a halt on that thing, the defense might want to have their own examination of the crime scene before it is altered.

The first thing you do is you run it through CODIS, which is the National Criminal DNA database. If there is no hit in there, so that DNA doesn't currently exist in CODIS, then you go to the genealogy kind of examination that we understand they used in this case.Now, if your person has -- his exact DNA is in the genealogy database, great. But more likely, what happens is you identify people who have familial connections, potentially with your DNA contributor. Now you have to go out and investigate each one of those people to figure out if they're actually related to someone who lives in the area, maybe drives a white Hyundai, you know, those sorts of things. That could lead you to your suspect. But you still don't know if it's the exact guy until you get a sample from that person, and then compare the original sample with the one you've obtained. That's typically done by just good surveillance, following that person around until they drink out of a water bottle, smoke a cigarette, leave something in a trash can somewhere that you can extract DNA from. It is likely all of those things have been going on in the background over the last week or so, as they've closed in kind of really close the loop on this subject.",

They'll look for it when they search that car. All of those warrants are being processed now.And they will keep looking for it. The interesting factor is that, you know, the killer brought an edged weapon with a fixed blade, which shows you know that they intended it -- they intended to use it for something at that place at that time and they took it with them, which may mean that the killer has an attachment to that weapon, which would suggest that they hung on to it, which would be good for the case. On the other hand, as you pointed out, Pam, he had 38 hours of driving to throw it out the window and multiple desert roads and deserted places. So we'll have to see how they do with their search.",

I wonder, is it unusual for someone accused of a crime like this to have an educational background in criminality? What do you make of that? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT AND PROFILER: Well, it's an interesting question, but it's not unheard of. So we had Ted Bundy who had a background in Psychology, his degree, bachelor's degree with psychology. We had BTK, bind, torture, kill, serial murder, his background, his academic background was also in criminology. So that's not unusual that they will go to college. And they may even do well and study in an area that they find of interest. The Unabomber was a PhD in mathematics. So we don't want to make too much of it until we learn more information about this individual and how he was using his academic training, academic knowledge and was he using that to help plan these cases?

O'TOOLE: If it is the same person, it certainly would be very interesting, because it would suggest that this suspect was really drawn to that kind of a topic, that kind of study, was interested in really trying to understand how murders are committed and what's going on in people's heads. So that would certainly give the investigators and someone like me, a profiler, more information about perhaps how well-planned this crime was, what else went into the planning? How long was it in the planning? So when you're interviewing someone, you've really got to do your homework of the suspect, you have to understand more about them than what they're going to tell you. So if there is this kind of planning, through academics and through research, if you know about it ahead of time, if they simply say, I just don't know, I just don't know why I did it, I just chose that house, I went in there and I did it.

An interest is there and they pursue that academic interest, but the personality is such -- the personality is really involved someone that is, in many cases, very cold blooded, very predatory in their actions without empathy for another human being.

There are a lot of questions about why he was still holding a bank account in China and I've talked to several business analysts who say they want to know more about that. What were his actual business interests in China? And is there any indication that his policies were impacted by the fact that he had this business interest there. We're talking about foreign governments and foreign taxes, one other thing to point out. We already talked about his income tax in the U.S. in 2017, he only paid $720. But that same year, he paid a million dollars in foreign taxes. The reason why this is significant, it is custom for a businessman who has entities across the globe to pay this kind of money. But what it sheds light on is that as President, we now know that while he was serving in the White House, where his actual business interest lies in some of those countries, India, China, Turkey and Mexico.

There was a great example in this latest trove where during his one year that he reported a significant positive income, that was 2018 of about $24 million. It looked like it had been a turn for him because that was the first year he reported positive income in more than a decade. But actually, what happened is he sold assets that he inherited from his father for $26 million. So that more than accounted for all of that positive income and that's been a theme throughout his life. And then you see other things in terms of kind of working the tax laws to his favor in ways that are somewhere between aggressive and just outright audacious.",

You report a number that has to match that W-2 on your reform. Those numbers have to match up exactly right, or you've got a real problem. But what you see here is that Donald Trump is reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, more in expenses to report losses. And no one is going in to ask him to substantiate that. In fact, the IRS when this begins has an open audit for a refund that he obtained of $72 million dollars in 2009 and they're still reviewing that all these years later.That's not resolved, even to this date, as far as we know, that's not resolved. And they have one auditor assigned to look at these 500 tax returns that he files every year until pressure increases and they upped that to three which is still wholly inadequate. And they are still not even thinking about reviewing all of those businesses, just his personal return and a couple of the business entities.",

My experience is that the four corners of a tax return don't generally show a red flag that sort of points straight to an indictment, but there are things that require further examination.There's a charitable donation that he claimed the tax return just shows it was a charitable donation of land for $21 million, but the underlying story of that is land he bought around in a state in Westchester County. He tried for more than a decade to develop it, he failed, it wasn't really worth very much, but yet he got an appraisal to say it was worth $21 million filed that in order to lower his taxes that year. And in future years, the IRS finally under pressure started looking at that and there it seems going to say it was worth somewhere between 8 million dollars and 0. So those are the sorts of things that like could be looked at more. There are a lot of expenses that are quite suspicious that should be looked at his golf course in Bedminster one year, the category of general and administrative expenses increases fivefold and it's just not explained. Somebody should go in and look at that and figure out whether that's a real number or he's padding it with other things.",
