This as martial law goes into effect in four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia.Joining us now, we have CNN military analyst and former member of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, talk to us a little bit about these four regions. What does martial law means for them and for the civilians that live there? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, good morning, Brianna. So, the four regions that we're talking about here are Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, an Luhansk. These are the areas that the Russians have occupied since the start of this latest phase of the war. So, what does martial law actually mean for the people there? Well, it's basically a substitution of military authority for civilian rule and it means that all existing laws, civil authority and administration of justice in the ordinary way is suspended. The military commander has unlimited authority to make and enforce laws. So that means that they can actually control these things in these areas. Now, Ukraine has also declared martial law in the past. In fact, in November of 2018, the Ukrainian lawmakers had to - had enacted this when the Russians seized Ukrainian navy ships. And, of course, in February, when Ukraine was invaded, President Zelenskyy introduced martial law after the invasion was announced.",
