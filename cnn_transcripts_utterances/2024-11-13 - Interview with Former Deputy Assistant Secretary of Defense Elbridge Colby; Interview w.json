I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. An image for the history books. Donald Trump back at the White House meeting with President Biden for a handover that Trump denied him just four years ago. The president-elect also is on Capitol Hill this day to huddle with Republican allies who all but control Congress now, four years after the January 6th insurrection by Trump allies. Trump is also filling out his national security team, including the shock pick for defense secretary, a Fox News Weekend host and Army National Guard veteran, Peter Hegseth. One defense industry lobbyist reacted to Politico by saying, who the F is this guy? Arch Trump loyalist and former congressman John Ratcliffe, who helped pursue investigations into Hunter Biden, will be nominated for CIA director. Elbridge Colby served in the Pentagon during Trump's first term and has praised his cabinet selections. Elbridge Colby, welcome back to the program and welcome from Washington. Look, can we first ask you, I mean, I know you're not going to go off on Trump's picks, but who the heck is this Hegseth guy, as the defense industry is asking? What qualifies him for this role?",

First of all, an anonymousdefense industry lobbyist making comments in Politico is probably praise for Speaker Nominee Hegseth. So, a lot of the people who are attacking them include, for instance, Vice President Cheney's key adviser, that was in the same article. Vice President Cheney and Liz Cheney endorsed Vice President Harris in the election, and President Trump has received a decisive electoral mandate. Second of all, Pete Hegseth is a decorated combat veteran. He's been a leading voice for veterans. He's written books, he went to Princeton, he went to Harvard. He's a major figure in the United States. And as President Trump has pointed out, he's very aligned with the America First foreign policy that President Trump has decisively been elected on, to his credit. And the other thing I would just stress here, Christiane, is this is not like 2017, late 2016, when President Trump was, you know, a change agent, but was very new to Washington. He's very much a change agent. He's received a decisive electoral mandate. And now, he's picking people who he knows and he thinks are going to implement his vision. And I think that's the key thing to bear in mind here, is that President Trump's vision of America first is -- has received that mandate and is best, I believe, for Americans, but also for our allies around the world and for the cause of peace, frankly.",

What I'm going to say is that our Pentagon, and a lot of our generals, includingretired general and flag officers, have gotten themselves way into inappropriate politics over the last few years. After a 25-year span in which our foreign policy and defense establishment has failed utterly to the American people. What I think President Trump is doing is not ejecting the post-war approach to American foreign policy, he's rejecting the post-Cold War hubris of the last kind of 30 years. And a lot of that goes to the civilian leadership, but our generals have not done a great job, and a lot of them are out calling him, you know, fascist or it's the end of democracy or whatever. We need to get our general and flag officers back the focus on winning, winning wars or -- and wherever possible, avoiding wars by understanding what it is that we can and can't do and the American people will support. So, I think -- you know, here's something, and I know this from personal experience. Our military establishment and its associated sort of apparatus has gotten really big. And every once in a while, you know, as I always like to point out, the founding fathers thought a standing army was the bug and the tough politics was a feature. We have a standing army for a good reason. You mentioned John Radcliffe, a great pick to lead the CIA. Bring some accountability back. Every once in a while, there needs to be a democratic focus on accountability and getting back to the basics. And I think our -- you know, many in our military establishment -- not all, they're great people in the military. Pete Hegseth is an example of a guy who's a combat decorated veteran. There's a lot of people, including at the upper ranks who are ready to do this kind of thing. In my view, and I think this is what president -- you know, it doesn't matter what I think, it's what President Trump has said, those are the people who should be elevated.",

The other thing is, you know, definitely President Trump said, and I think people are seeing that the slogan personnel is policy, but also that it is the mandate he claims is to turn America into his image and into his agenda, you know, pursuing his agenda. So, are you comfortable with -- I want to say blind loyalty, being the calling card or the litmus test for some of the appointees? And I'm going to stay on Hegseth. Because, again, the leader of one veterans group said he's actually the least qualified nominee for secretary of defense in American history and the most overtly political.

Nixon didn't do that in '68. Reagan didn't do that in '80. I very much hope he's successful. You've seen signals from both Moscow and Kyiv that they're open to a form of negotiations. What exactly that looks like, I don't pretend to know. There was reporting today, again, I can't confirm it, but that there might be an appointment of a Ukraine peace special envoy. We'll see how that goes, but I think that's a clear policy plank. Here's the thing, Christiane, you're in Europe. The message has been clear. I've been saying this for a number of years, I said it earlier on your show, the Europeans need to step up. Because here are a few things. First of all, they need to take more reliance for their own security. That's not just a matter of fairness, that's a structural military fiscal reality given the threats the United States faces and the constraints on our military forces. Europeans know that. I talked to European officials all the time. They're getting the message. I actually think this is an area where it's -- this is good -- a Trump victory is really good news for Europe because it's finally going to push Europe to do what it needs. Apparently, in Germany, polling I was seeing yesterday, half of your Germans or something like that agree with Boris Pistorius, the social Democrat minister of defense who says Germany should be spending like 3.5 percent.",

And he believes the United States is in decline. So, what is the best way to counter that seeking for dominance? You know, the Biden administration and before that, the Obama administration was about alliances and they've built a lot of alliances, it was about -- like the Chips Act. It was about all these things to try to manage properly and securely a competition. What do you think will change?",

So, my view is that, at least, is we want peace through strength vis-a-vis China. This is where President Trump's message of strength and Vice President-Elect Vance has been very articulate where we need to husband our constrained military power to deter a Chinese attack while also keeping open options for negotiation with Xi Jinping. And I think this is where President Trump's got a lot of flack, ironically, from the left, for his willingness to talk to Xi Jinping and others like Putin and Kim Jong Un. But actually, that's good, where there's an opening to China. And I'll say we're already seeing positive progress. The Financial Times has reported that Taiwan, President Trump has said, why aren't they spending more? Totally common sense and correct to their benefit. The Financial Times is reporting that Taiwan is now looking to do a major increase in defense spending. That's great. That's it. But that's a huge indictment of the last few years. So, here's a key thing, Christiane, I want to really want to stress, the Biden-Harris administration has left the world in a terrible place, left the American military and our political position out of posture, out of position, and we're going to have to cut some slack to President Trump's administration to put us into a good way. Bear in mind, secretary of the Air Force, Frank Kendall, a Biden administration appointee, he's not only reconfirmed Blinken and Byrne's statement that China is preparing for a war over Taiwan by 2027, but he said the Chinese military will say it's ready by 2027. That's in this presidential term. So, you know, my view is if we want to achieve peace through strength, President Trump's vision, we're going to have to focus on that a lot.",

So, it's President Biden who departed from our traditional policy ofstrategic ambiguity on that issue and then had it walked back by staff. So, I think President Trump's position is consistent with our traditional policy, which I think is the advisable course in terms of what you'd call declaratory policy at this point. But, you know, Taiwan has really got to understand, this is a point that I've been making that I believe is consistent with what President Trump's been arguing, is that they need to build up their defense, not only as a matter of fairness because, you know, the Chinese military is very formidable. We've just seen you know, reporting of a new stealth jet fighter, for instance. They've got to do their part. And I mean, what's almost mind-boggling is that the Taiwanese have been spending less as a fraction of their GDP on defense than the American people have, and that is a dangerous place to be. So, again, if people are getting the memo, hey, I need to do my part and I'm not just going to take these blase assurances from the Biden team as, you know, take him to the bank, I think that's, again, better for not only the American people, but for our allies, better for Taiwan.",

I think we're going to look to allies like Israel that are willing and able to take their defense more into their own hands, you're going to see, actually -- I mean, kind of contrary to what you're saying, Christiane, I think, you know, and initiatives like the Abraham Accords, you're going to see, hopefully, a pragmatic approach towards building relationships across the region, in a sense, something that the Biden administration tried and it was not very successful in advancing, but you can see that kind of building on the Abraham Accords model. And frankly, you've already seen some, you know, responses from the Qataris vis-a-vis Hamas, even from the Iranians. The New York Times is reporting that they're softening their position. So, I think you see progress.

I just wonder whether there was anything you heard from Mr. Colby as to the, you know, future nature of a Trump administration in various foreign policy aspects that you wanted to comment on. RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT EMERITUS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  No, I think he's understandably improperly being quite careful not to get out in front of the president-elect or, you know, the next administration.

This talk about potentially using the U.S. military, a lot of people are concerned about this, under the Insurrection Act to deal with disturbances that, for example, could stem from an effort to deport many individuals.

Plus, he served in the executive branch in the Pentagon. So, I like the fact that they come with some independence, some a base, if you will, of their own. Yes, they're both very tough on China. The real question is how that gets translated into policy. Is it simply an economic based relationship with China? Do we threaten tariffs and sanctions, or are we prepared to use military force if need be? A big question mark. I think an even bigger question mark is what they're prepared to do vis-a-vis Ukraine. Both, as I understand it, voted against the most recent tranche of military aid for Ukraine. But the real question is, if you want to get from where we are now to a negotiation, cutting off aid to Ukraine is not the way to do it. Russia has to understand that it faces a capable Ukraine. That's the only way to get Putin to consider compromising. And we have to give Mr. Zelenskyy the confidence that if he does make some compromises, Ukraine will remain an independent functioning country. So, I think there's a big question mark over where we're going to come out in Ukraine, the Middle East. You mentioned Mike Huckabee before and others. What concerns me there is that we're -- we've got people getting involved in the Middle East who seem to think that U.S. policy is simply to give Israel a green light.

Hamas would not be able to reemerge. You wouldn't need an Israeli occupation. This seems to me to be so much in Israel's interest. And the opportunities there, the Arab states are willing to do it and then you could rebuild. So, it would be a political, a strategic, an economic, and a humanitarian gain. In Lebanon, Israel has delivered a decisive blow against Hezbollah. So, I would say, let's build on that. Let's get a ceasefire. Let's get those 60,000 or 70,000 Israelis back in their homes in Northern Israel and let's create the basis for a long-term ceasefire. And maybe, just maybe, the beginning of the rebuilding of a modern state of Lebanon. Let's stop the settlement activity, which I think precludes or closes off potential for diplomacy in this part of the world. Hopefully, the Iranians won't take another step against Israel, and then we can maybe calm the Israeli-Iranian relationship for a time. So, I actually think Mr. Trump comes to office, potentially, with extraordinary opportunity. But that opportunity will only be harvested not if the Americans give the Israelis a free hand to do anything and everything, but if we press Israel to basically, let's bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, let's bring about a ceasefire in the north, and let's begin a political process. We're not talking about a Palestinian State tomorrow or next week or next year, but let's at least begin a political process that, among other things, would allow an Arab stabilization force to enter Gaza.",
