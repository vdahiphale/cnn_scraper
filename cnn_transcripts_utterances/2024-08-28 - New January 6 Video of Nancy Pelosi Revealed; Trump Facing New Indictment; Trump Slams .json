      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly right, Brianna. Where they are going today tells us a lot about how the campaign is strategizing in this critical battleground state and how they plan to close margins with Republicans. Now, this is a strategy from Senator Raphael Warnock's 2022 run-off, who, by the way, the person leading that campaign was Quentin Fulks, who is now the deputy campaign manager of the Harris campaign.What he tells me is what they found to be successful was doing the best that they could in metro Atlanta and then peeling off voters from Republicans in South Georgia, essentially losing by less in those counties, which, if they look at a presidential election year, when they already anticipate higher turnout and they see the Harris/Walz ticket as appealing to a broader base of voters, then they feel like they could pull off what Warnock did in 2022. So that is why they are hitting these counties on this bus tour. Now, what Democratic strategists also tell me is that there is the Tim Walz factor. Of course, he has a rural upbringing. He has his football and military roots. So the other question here is how he resonates with voters in these areas and how he can help boost the ticket. Now, of course, coinciding with this swing is also a lot of money being poured into ads in the Savannah area media market. With that, we have a new ad today. That's something we have been talking about quite a bit over the course of the week, the economy earlier this week, now Project 2025. That's that project that the campaign has tried to tie directly to former President Donald Trump as some of his former administration officials have worked on it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
