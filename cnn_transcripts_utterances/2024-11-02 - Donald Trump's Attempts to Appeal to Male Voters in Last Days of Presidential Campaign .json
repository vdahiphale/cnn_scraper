It's time to break down the big stories with some smart people.Today, we're asking, with Election Day almost here, some Donald Trump supporters worry about his closing message. Why is he manning up so much? Then, trash talk twists. Will the Puerto Rico insult turn Biden gaffe help or hurt Kamala Harris's chances? And later, lock the clock. The yearly ritual dozens of states and some on our panel want to stop. The gang is here and ready to go. Sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, with just three days to go until Election Day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still locked in a dead heat, according to the latest CNN national poll. As they barnstorm the swing states, Donald Trump has been focusing on his male MAGA base, ramping up inflammatory rhetoric with some supporters fearing will turn off women voters.
