Welcome to\"Connect the World.\" A tense and angry scene is playing out right now in the streets of Paris. A large crowd of protesters has gathered near a Kurdish community center, facing off with police. The crowd angry about a shooting that happened at the Kurdish center just a few hours ago. Three people, all of them Kurds, were killed, several others were wounded when a gunman opened fired. A suspect has been taken into custody. Authorities say the alleged shooter had been involved with racist violence in the past, including an incident at a migrant tent camp. I want to bring in CNN's Jim Bittermann who's following the developments and joins us from Paris. Jim, just take us through what has been happening. Why protesters are facing off with police there?",

Three people were killed and three people were injured in that attack. The first prosecutor was here, as well as the Interior Minister of France, and he basically said that there was no doubt about the racist nature of this. And this is a heavily race - racially mixed neighborhood. And it's a Friday afternoon, a lot of people on the street. And that has now quickly degenerated into a confrontation between the police and the demonstrators who have been shouting assassins, murderers, et cetera. The police have now established a line here. But earlier they were shooting tear gas in the crowd, trying to disperse them. And we'll just see how this develops as the evening plays out here. But in fact, at the moment, as far as the shooting is concerned, three people dead, three people injured, and they're still investigating. And uncertain whether they want to classify this as a racial incident or a terrorist incident. The difference is that a terrorist gets - a terrorist incident gives the prosecutor much more power in terms of investigation and in terms of holding the suspect. They have the suspect in custody. 69-year- old man who had been accused in the past of racial conduct - anti-racial contract. He was sent to jail. And only recently - according to reports, only recently he has come out of jail no matter of days ago and then apparently committed this attack, and the police have hidden in custody.",

There is also a large influx of migrants, not just here in Colorado, but in many of the neighboring States. But Denver has seen nearly 2000 Newly arrived migrants making their way from Central and South America. And there was a scramble to find a warm place to stay for a lot of these families who didn't necessarily have a place to go. Yes, Denver opened this massive Coliseum, which it used as a 24 hour emergency warming center. The demand was so strong, so many people wanted a warm place to stay that they ran out of beds and the city actually opened to more emergency shelters.
