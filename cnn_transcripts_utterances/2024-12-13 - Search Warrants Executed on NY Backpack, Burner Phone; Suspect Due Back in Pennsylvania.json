Now, it's not that surprising that one of the loudest voices pushing for her is RFK Jr., her father-in-law, who has become quite a staple in Trump's inner circle, someone who Trump actually listens to, which we saw in that time interview.He was very clear that RFK was a voice in his ear. Now, the other part of this that has been so fascinating is the relationship that the Kennedys have with the CIA, particularly when it comes to RFK Jr. who has long said that he believes the CIA was involved in the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy. Donald Trump also, while on the campaign, said that he would release any remaining files that were under seal around the investigation on the assassination. So, that's just an extra little added part of all of this. The other thing about Amaryllis Kennedy, and I'm hearing this from a number of people who are more on the MAGA wing of Donald Trump's Republican Party, is that they believe that she would be somewhat of a disrupter, that she's a little bit of an outsider, despite the fact that she was herself a CIA official, that they believe she's not as mainstream as the person who has been tapped to be the leader of the CIA, John Ratcliffe. Now she has met with both Trump and Ratcliffe, but one other interesting part of all of this Is that she's getting some pushback from another Trump ally, and that is Senator Tom Cotton, who is going to be the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, so that's a pretty loud voice there, but as everything within Trump world, we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out. Who in this small group of people who are in Trump's inner circle wins out the battle when it comes to the deputy director of the CIA?",

The way it usually works is the bipartisan committee that works on the inauguration puts out these invitations to diplomats who come, but they don't invite foreign leaders. But Donald Trump, unsurprisingly, I would think to many, wants this to be a global affair.And he is reaching out and his team is reaching out either directly or through handlers to various foreign leaders to invite them to the inauguration. One of them being China's Xi Jinping, which in itself, is incredibly controversial because he's inviting this communist leader. Now, we don't expect Xi Jinping to come. It sounds like he's going to be sending a senior ranking delegation from China instead, but it'll be interesting to see who actually shows up. And part of this is what I'm being told is a lot of these asks are informal. They're coming up in conversations on the phone. He's talking about other issues. Then he mentions that these leaders should come to the inauguration. Another way that this might have come up and I'm told is that when he was in France, for the reopening of Notre Dame, that he was talking to world leaders, he dropped the inauguration with some of them as well. It is so informal in some cases, not all, but in some cases that even his closest aides don't know who exactly he has invited. So again, something we're watching to see how this plays out because it's just not the traditional way that we see an inauguration and the invitations go out.",

And it was a sad reality, and I realized, like, oh, this is deeper than rats. I can't just open up stores in communities like this.

So literally, there were thousands of people in the air flying to the United States who did not know about the ban until they landed at LAX or JFK, for example. And then there were likewise thousands of people outside of the United States who were denied boarding by airlines during the visa check, the preflight visa check process.
