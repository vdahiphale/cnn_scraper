Syrian rebel forces are pushing further into Aleppo after launching a surprise offensive this week.Video geolocated by CNN shows rebel fighters reaching the center of Syria's second largest city on Friday night. It's the first time they've set foot in Aleppo since 2016. But one of president Bashar al- Assad's chief allies is striking back. Russian state media reports that Russian warplanes launched airstrikes on Friday, targeting rebels in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Russia claims to have killed at least 200 members of a Syrian jihadist group. CNN's Ben Wedeman is following the latest developments and he joins us now from Rome. So Ben, a conflict that seems static now anything but. What's the latest? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, what we've seen is basically confirmation that these Syrian rebels have indeed reached the center of Aleppo. We've seen video of rebels in Saadallah al-Jabiri Square, which is the main, large open square in the more modern part of the city. And also last night, rebels were livestreaming from next to Aleppo's ancient citadel as well, which is really the very center of the city. And that was after what has been a lightning offensive that began only on Wednesday. Since then, the rebels seem to have taken more than 70 villages in the western part of Aleppo, Aleppo province. Now as you mentioned, Russia has been striking back as well as Syrian regime forces but not, it appears, on Aleppo itself  but rather in parts of Idlib province, where the rebels are based, as well as Western Aleppo province. But by and large, it seems that the rebels were able to take large parts although -- of Aleppo city, although it doesn't appear they have control of the entire city without much resistance from Syrian forces, who have been in control of Aleppo since the end of 2016. Now as far as Syria's main ally Russia is concerned, they've put out a statement. We heard from Dmitry Peskov, who's the main spokesman for the Kremlin. He said, \"We are for the Syrian government to quickly restore order in this district\" --  referring to Aleppo -- and restore what he called \"the constitutional order.\" But by and large, it appears that those allies of Syria, that were fundamental in restoring some amount of government control to areas like Aleppo, have, by and large, not been able to do much to stop this rebel offensive. Hezbollah, which had provided many of the sort of shock troops for the Syrian government, its forces have largely withdrawn back to Lebanon, where, of course, Hezbollah has been by and large decapitated by Israel. The Iranians have received a series of deadly blows from Israel so far this year. And, of course, Russia, which, in September 2015, deployed forces to Syria and essentially shored up a Syrian regime, which, at the time, appeared to be on the brink of collapse, it has moved many of its forces that were in Syria back to Russia and Ukraine. Where, of course, it's involved in the war there. Kim.",

And that's why the U.S. military will watch this very closely. There are about 900 U.S. troops in Syria across several smaller facilities there. They are a part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. And that's their primary mission. They do, with some frequency, especially in recent weeks, come under attack from the Iranian backed militias in the form of rocket attacks and drone attacks. And we have seen responses to those. For example, just this past Wednesday, U.S. Central Command, which governs operations in the Middle East, carried out a strike in response to one of these attacks on U.S. forces. But that, by and large, is where the U.S. focuses its effort, a different part of the country from Aleppo. The U.S. also works with the Kurds, for example, to run some of the prisons that hold ISIS detainees. So that's another role the U.S. plays there. And yet the military is well aware of the instability in the wartorn country. And that's why the U.S. will watch this very closely, to see how it develops. Certainly caught the Syrian regime by surprise. And the U.S. just trying to monitor the situation with its presence in the country-- Oren Liebermann, CNN, in the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This dinner comes just days after Donald Trump threatened to impose massive hikes on tariffs if both Canada and Mexico did not do enough to crack down on drugs coming over the borders as well as migrants. Now we did hear the prime minister actually address reporters on this issue Friday morning earlier in the day, before he flew down to meet with Donald Trump. I'm going to read for you some of what he said. He said, quote, \"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There is no question about it,\" he said. He went on to add that, \"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians who work so well with the United States but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business.\" So clearly Trudeau being very public, criticizing that threat from Donald Trump. I think the clear question now is whether or not they were able to come to some sort of deal or agreement over that dinner. Now I can also tell you that these two men know each other very well. They worked together during Donald Trump's first term. Trudeau's team helped renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, as it more commonly -- as it's more commonly known, with the United States. Really working on his relationship with Donald Trump and ensuring that the United States and Canada continue to have a great working relationship. Now we do know that, shortly after Donald Trump had made that post on Truth Social, threatening to impose steep tariffs on Canada, Trudeau actually got on the phone with Donald Trump. He said that they had a conductive (sic) call and that he believes that they will continue to work together. He added, quote, \"This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on. And that's what we'll do\" -- Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And at Sue Ryder, one of the things that we've been saying over the past few days is that, you know, whilst we take a neutral stance on the position of assisted dying, we're really concerned about the fear that people have reported to us. That because a number of people at the moment are missing out on palliative and end of life care, we don't want to have a situation where people are forced to adopt a position where they will elect for an assisted death due to that lack of support.

And really, interestingly, of those that were in favor of assisted dying, that fear rose to 84 percent.

Well, it started out as a pretty small project 10 years ago and we decided to look into these quite repulsive fossils to understand what they contained.And it showed that -- showed up that actually they contain quite rich amounts of undigested food remnants. So we decided to make a larger study about that. And the study just grew and grew. And as you were saying, in the end, we analyzed these droppings and vomits for 10 years and put together this quite comprehensive picture of the rise of dinosaurs based on, you know, ecology and how their ecological roles shifted throughout their early history.",

When we started analyzing this, we had no idea that we would find such tiny, well- preserved insects in the feces of 230-million-year-old droppings from early dinosaurs.So these are droppings from one of the earliest dinosaurs in the northern part of the supercontinent, Pangaea -- so the area we've been analyzing in Poland. And as you can see, they contain a lot of small pieces of insects and even complete beetles with the antennae and the legs preserved. So what we can say about these early dinosaurs is that they were eating a lot of insects but also other things. So in other coprolites or fossil poops, we find fish remains and parts of plants and so on. So they had a pretty, pretty diverse diet.",

And, of course, our study is just a piece of the puzzle here. But, yes, it's an interesting piece, I would say. BRUNHUBER:  A fascinating if slightly disgusting piece.

He said the people who rebuilt the gothic masterpiece after a raging fire have, quote, \"transformed ashes into art.\" CNN's Melissa Bell is in Paris.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A new dawn for Notre-Dame cathedral. More than five-and-a-half years after a fire tore through parts of the gothic structure in the heart of Paris. Sparkling stonework highlighting the stunning results of the estimated $737 million restoration as it was unveiled to France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. After the 2019 blaze, the president had vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame even more beautiful than it was. Entering the cathedral with his wife Brigitte on Friday, it was clear that France had achieved just that. \"It was at the same time repaired, restored and rebaptized,\" Macron said. Millions had watched in shock and horror as Notre-Dame's 96-meter spire tumbled into the church during the 2019 blaze. Now it's renaissance is complete. Touring the epicenter of the blaze, the medieval roof structure known as the Forest, Macron saw the beams rebuilt by hand from 1,200 oak trees from across France. Among the highlights of Macron's tour, a mural in the north enclosure of the choir that was badly damaged in the fire and the Virgin of Paris, a 14th century statue that became a symbol of resistance when it was found standing resolute, surrounded by burnt wood and collapsed stone. And the beautiful Saint-Marcel Chapel, one of 29 chapels that have been lovingly restored. Viewing the 12-meterwide grand organ, Macron described it as sublime. More than 1,300 people involved in the restoration were invited inside as the French president wrapped up his final visit to the site before it's formal reopening. \"You have transformed ashes into art,\" he told them. \"The whole planet was upset that day in April. The shock of the reopening will be as big as that of the fire,\" he said, thanking the crowds. The scaffolding on the outside speaks to the work that's yet to be done. 2030 will be the actual date of completion for the full restoration of the cathedral but what we will see is from December 8th, it will once again be open to the public. And the many millions who watched it with such a heavy heart burn that dreadful night of April 2019 will once again be able to get inside -- Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
