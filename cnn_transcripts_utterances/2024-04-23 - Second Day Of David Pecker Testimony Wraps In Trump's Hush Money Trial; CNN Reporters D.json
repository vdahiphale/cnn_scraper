And it is day two of testimony in the historic Donald Trump hush money trial that is just wrapped up.Trump's longtime friend and tabloid executive, David Pecker was back on the stand today, and he detailed a pivotal 2015 meeting with Trump and Michael Cohen that resulted in Pecker making a secret gentleman's agreement to shield Trump from damaging stories during the 2016 campaign. Pecker testifying that the deal was, quote, highly confidential.",

And that is now at the heart of the first criminal trial of a former president. CNN chief legal correspondent Paula Reid has been following the case. Paula, what else did jurors hear from David Pecker?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, this must be a fascinating witness for the jury to listen to because they led up to that 2015 meeting by talking about Pecker's relationship, a longstanding relationship that he had with Trump throughout the 80s and 90s, how they had this mutually beneficial friendship where Trump would help him with stories that sold really well.But then ahead of the 2016 election, they had this now infamous meeting in 2015 where they talked about how Pecker, through the National Enquirer, could help the campaign. Pecker vowed to be the eyes and ears of the campaign in terms of hearing what kind of stories were being sold out there, what kind of stories were being pitched, and of course, that's how we know the National Enquirer came to purchase the rights and then suppress two stories that were mentioned in today's testimony. The first was from a doorman who falsely claimed that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock. They paid him $30,000 for the rights to his story and then buried it until shortly after the election. Then, just before we broke for the day, the jury started to hear about another similar story, Karen McDougal. Now, this is significant because this is the allegation about an extramarital affair that Trump denies. But it's significant because we know, of course, AMI paid her for her story and then also suppressed that ahead of the election. And this is also incredibly important to the prosecution's case because they're arguing that Trump wanted to cover up the hush money that he and Michael Cohen allegedly paid to Stormy Daniels because he was trying to help his chances in the 2016 election. And they're arguing that everything that David Pecker did here was, in Pecker's own words, as part of this larger effort to help Trump in the election. And that's what, you know, leads this into possible, you know, criminal conduct. It's different if you want to help your friend get some stories in the tabloid, but if you're doing things like this, you know, giving people tens of thousands or even well over $100,000 to help a candidate in a campaign while simultaneously publishing damaging stories about their opponents, well, that's what brings us to court for the next few weeks.",

And David Pecker is exactly that in this case. He's a former publisher of the National Enquirer and was said to be, and is acknowledged being involved in an effort to stop this embarrassing conduct about former President Trump from getting public ahead of the 2016 election.Now, there's a long history of the National Enquirer, number one, pushing out stories that were very favorable to the former president and very critical of his opponents. And that's Ted Cruz there, senator from Texas. He was running against at the time, a number of critical articles of Hillary Clinton, the senator at the time -- first lady as well. And so that's sort of the National Enquirer's role in all of this. And David Pecker had a hand in it.",

Now, what he can testify to is this idea of the catch-and-kill pattern, buying stories and suppressing them so they're not harmful to the former president. That's one tying it to the 2016 campaign, which is also relevant.You don't have a crime here. And Paula touched on this a little bit. Until there is falsifying business records to suppress this information from getting out, falsely business records or cooking the books, as we have here. And it all comes together in this 2015 meeting. Donald Trump, David Pecker, Michael Cohen, former attorney for the former president, and Hope Hicks, a White House staffer, were in and out of Trump Tower this meeting where a lot of these things in this prior slide were talked about, catch and kill, perhaps cooking the books, or at least falsifying business records.

It's set by New York law, New York judiciary law 751 sets $1,000 per instance, so per statement, per comment, whatever, and or could be either 30 days in jail.Now, it wouldn't be uncommon for a judge to start low and then work their way up to jail because you also have to remember, Donald Trump in this case has not been formally sanctioned. It's all the other cases where he's had gag orders and so on. So surprising that he's talking about, this is what the prosecutors have asked for. They've asked for fines. Now, if Donald Trump is sanctioned, if there is one statement that is the one that his attorneys are blowing their minds over, it's this statement he retweeted or tweeted about Jesse Watters from Fox News, talking about liberal activists lying to the judge. There is no defending this statement whatsoever. The other ones, he has some statements where he gets into it with Michael Cohen, a closer call. This is a defendant talking about a jury pool in a way that just doesn't have protection. And to quote Little Orphan Annie, bet your bottom dollar the judge refers to this in whatever he does for Donald Trump.",

She's served as a jury consultant in a number of high profile trials, including those of Wesley Snipes and Elizabeth Holmes. Linda, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.

It seems that a lot of us have common sense. You know, you walk into a meeting or you meet someone you've never met before, and you think, I don't believe a word out of his mouth, or I believe everything she says. So we have this internal radar, but the jury instructions will tell the jurors that they can look for a lot of things. Does the story make sense? Does it hold together? What are the biases, the self-interest and the motivations that are playing throughout here? And to phrase from the Latin cui bono, who benefits from this case, from this alleged conduct?

Of course, that's important because that would sway, as you've suggested, their opinions. But you'd be surprised at how well jurors can do. And at the end of the day, you have to just believe that when they tell you that they're doing their very best and they're just listening to the evidence that's produced at the trial, the witnesses, and looking at the documents, that's what they're doing. It's a challenging role, indeed.",
