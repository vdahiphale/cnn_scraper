That's tonight on NEWSNIGHT.Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip, and we begin with a damning indictment of American politics. At a time when the nation severely lacks a functioning, capable and competent government, the House, which just completed one of its least-productive years ever, just did something rare. The chamber actually passed a bipartisan tax bill. That bill enhances a child tax credit for lower-income families, and it boosts tax breaks for businesses. Now, it moves to the Senate. But if you ask at least one Republican there, it's a no-go. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley says, quote, I think that passing a tax bill that makes the president look good may allow checks before the election, means that Biden could be re-elected, and then we won't extend the 2017 tax bill. Now, he's talking about checks there that could lift thousands of children out of poverty. That's pretty cynical. And the same sentiment extends over to that border bill that bipartisan senators have been working on. Now, as you know, Donald Trump is sabotaging it because he doesn't want to hand Biden a win during an election year. And House Republicans are falling in line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX):  Why would we do anything right now to help him with that 33 percent? Do you believe if Joe Biden's approval rate was at 53 percent we would even be talking about the border?

He's the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to one of the nation's largest Arab-American communities. Mayor, thanks for joining us. President Biden is in your state courting union members, but he did not meet with Arab-Americans during this trip. Was this a missed opportunity? MAYOR ABDULLAH HAMMOUD (D-DEARBORN, MI):  I absolutely think it's a missed opportunity whenever dialogue can happen, constructive dialogue that can help save lives because that's the conversation we want to have, and calling for a ceasefire and ending the bombing and unrestricted military aid to Israel, we want to save lives.

It's the opposite of eight years ago, sorry, four years ago, when Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 4, 4.5 percent. So you've seen these 8 percentage shifts, even though Joe Biden's been president for the last three years. And the other number that I find interesting is that 66 percent, two-thirds, believe that Joe Biden has not earned re- election. Both candidates have to see this as bad news. Both candidates should realize that the American people want something different.

He has spent the last three years talking about how Joe Biden stole the elections, how he's an illegitimate President, and continuing to build hostility and pit Americans against each other.
