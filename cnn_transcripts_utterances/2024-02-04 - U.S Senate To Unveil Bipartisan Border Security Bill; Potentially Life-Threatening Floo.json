      "sentences": "Welcome everyone. You are in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington in for Jim Acosta. At any moment, the Senate will release its bipartisan border bill, but even if it can pass the legislation, the bill is set to face stiff opposition from House Republicans. Speaker Johnson has said it's dead on arrival. That's quoting him, and that's even before he's seen what's in it at all.That has Leader Hakeem Jeffries slamming House Republicans as wholly owned subsidiaries of Donald Trump. The White House is also criticizing Speaker Johnson saying he's tying himself in knots to delay border security. We're going to bring you the details on what's in the bill as soon as we have it. But first, we are tracking severe weather on the West Coast. The Los Angeles Fire Department is warning people to evacuate in some parts of Southern California. You can see some of the regions there as the area braces for potentially life-threatening flooding conditions. So, I want to get right now to the CNN Weather Center where meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking that intense storm system known as an atmospheric river. And Elisa, the L.A. National Weather Service says the area hasn't seen any kind of weather event like this in years. Break it down for us.",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, this has been months in the making. Senate negotiators, Democrats, and Republicans have been working for weeks to put this deal together on what, of course, has been a vexing issue for Congress for decades. Now, I've been talking to sources this afternoon who have described a deal that would really mark a dramatic overhaul of immigration law. And if it were passed, it would mark the most drastic change that we have made to immigration law in decades.Now, what to look for here is really the changes it makes to asylum. So, what has been described to me is really a deal that would really restrict asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in hopes these negotiators think of trying to cut down on border crossings because over the last few years, the way the migration flow has evolved is that there have been more and more people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and our system is just simply not prepared to deal with those numbers. Now, some of these items that have been described to me are conservative wishlist items. And even so, the White House has embraced what we do know of the deal so far. President Biden going so far as to say last week that he would shut down the border and do it quickly if given the authority, an authority that would be included in this deal. But it's important, Omar, to remind viewers about how we got to this moment. Last October, President Biden asked Congress for a national security supplemental request. That included billions of funds for Israel- Ukraine border security among other priorities. But Republicans made it quite clear from the get-go that they didn't want to pass any of that unless there were major border policy changes and that has culminated in these talks that have occurred over the last few weeks. And really, if you zoom out, it puts this political liability for President Biden at the center of his foreign policy agenda as the White House has tried to reach an agreement with the Senate negotiators while trying to get that aid passed for, again, the president's foreign policy priorities being Israel and Ukraine. Now, as you mentioned there, Senator Chuck Schumer wants to put a vote on the floor, on the Senate floor this week. That means that we need to get the text sometime soon. But the House Republicans have made clear too, that this is dead on arrival in the House. So, whether this has any future really remains to be seen.",

They want to reject it because they think it'll hurt their election chances and because the head of their party, and he's clearly the head of their party once again, Donald Trump has told them to reject it. He hasn't been subtle about it, but he rarely is. So, they have chosen politics rather than solving a major problem that most Americans regard as being very important.Their bet is, and I guess it's probably going to work out for them, their bet is that Americans as usual will not pay attention to legislative maneuvering. They won't know who's responsible for killing the reforms. And therefore, they will benefit from having no reform because people will continue to see chaos at the border and they will blame the incumbent President Biden.",

But of course, you need both of them to make this happen.I want to point out a new NBC poll which shows Trump leading Biden by a wide margin on the issue of border security, but Trump is openly bragged about torpedoing the border security bill, which is what we're talking about, saying he doesn't want to give Democrats a win.

And the Biden people haven't really started to focus on Trump and his relationship to the border. You know, Omar, you remember, this was all solved during the four years of Trump's presidency with that big, beautiful wall that he built that was paid for by Mexico. Oh wait, that didn't happen.

It's nine months until the election, so you don't want to overreact, but you also don't want to underreact. And it's pretty clear that Americans aren't accepting the positive changes that are occurring in the economy and in a number of other sectors in public policy.That is a problem for President Biden and his team. They have to start figuring out how to do a better job of getting credit for what is happening and the economy is clearly turning around. Major positive changes have been occurring. Yes, it takes a long time for people to catch on, especially if they aren't paying attention to the ins and outs of politics. But it's there. The data is there. The arguments are there. And they have to be utilized, repetition, repetition, every day, every day, every day. That's how you teach, by the way. Well, and you know, part of the momentum I think they're trying to grab is a little bit of what we saw in South Carolina over the weekend. He performed very well in last night's South Carolina primary, his close ally, Congressman James Clyburn said it proves his support among black voters is still strong. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): He got 96 percent of the vote in this primary, but his largest percentage, over 97 percent, was in the town of Orangeburg, where there are two HBCUs and a community college. And he got the largest percentage of the whole state. So that demonstrates to me what I've been saying all the time that Joe Biden has not lost any support among African-Americans.

The bipartisan bill, which faces heavy skepticism from some Republicans, would link aid to Ukraine and Israel with new measures to curb immigration at the southern border. A lot to talk about, so let's talk about it more with Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. He's also a member of the House Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. Great to see you. Thanks for being with us.I want to start with what's expected to be in this bill. Obviously, we're still waiting on this text, but it could expedite the asylum process and policies like catch and release while severely restricting daily border crossings. So just from those points alone, is that something that you would support? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Yes. I support more security at the border, more certainty at the border. That's what President Biden is trying to achieve. He needs authorities from Congress to do that. And what we're seeing is that he is trying to govern and Republicans are trying to sabotage. And President Bush -- I'm sorry -- President Trump is telling them, don't take this deal, it only helps President Biden. And, Omar, by the way, this deal was conceived by the second most conservative member of the Senate, James Lankford. And so, it shows that President Biden and Democrats are willing to roll up our sleeves and collaborate and compromise for the good of security, for the good of the nation. And at the end of the day, you know, this is what we've seen with this Republican Party. They are a party of followers, and that's in contrast with Democrats trying to be a party of leaders.",

They don't have it. And so, we do need an expedited earned citizenship or, you know, workplace citizenship or visa process.We can do all of that. I went to Washington to do big things, not to just play politics and sabotage the other side's ideas if it benefits me. And so, I do hope we get a vote for it, but it's really, you know, do you want to govern or do you want to ruin? It comes down to that. JIMENEZ: Well, I think we are seeing an intersection of politics and policy here. No coincidence it is an election year, but along those same lines, polls continue to show President Biden getting crushed on immigration among voters. A new poll released by NBC shows 57 percent say Donald Trump would do a better job securing the border and controlling immigration. Only 22 percent say Biden would, again, according to this poll.

And you know, frankly, we shouldn't be so nice and we shouldn't be so virtuous. Too much is at stake right now. And if we're going to be the ones offering solutions, as we did on infrastructure and jobs and on the CHIPS Act and on the gun safety legislation, and we're doing that now on the border, the American people should know it because in nine months, they're going to have to make a decision as to whether they want a party of followers, followers of Donald Trump or a party of leaders, following president Biden who has worked in a bipartisan way.",

You must touch issues or assets of important to the regime leadership itself. There is one other issue here and that is we can't go too far into Iraq or be too robust in our attacks because we're currently in delicate negotiations with the Iraqi government on the status of U.S. forces and this would inflame Iran's population where we conduct broader attacks and perhaps accelerate the departure of U.S. forces and impact our fight against Daesh.",

The other thing Senator Graham said Thursday before the Friday of the first strike is he wanted to strike Tehran, a city of 9 million people. I'm not sure what targeting procedure he's using, but I don't think that would allow the kind of action that we want to take against the Iranian proxies that are in Syria, Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen. We are trying to strike those targets because they form the decisive points and the center of gravity for the Iranian strategy. They use their proxies as their forward forces.
