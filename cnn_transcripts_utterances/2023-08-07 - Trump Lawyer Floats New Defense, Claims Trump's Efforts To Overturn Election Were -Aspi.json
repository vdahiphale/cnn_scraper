So first to that protective order deadline, Judge Tanya Chutkan will ultimately determine whether or not to restrict Trump's access to this evidence, put parameters on what he can disclose publicly -- asking for.And the special counsel's case might be particularly strong because of what Trump just put out on Truth Social this morning. He wrote this. He said, deranged Jack Smith is going before his number one draft pick, the judge of his dreams, who must be recused in an attempt to take away my First Amendment rights. And, you know, the special counsel's team has referenced Trump's penchant for posting when they asked the judge to restrict what he and his attorneys can disclose in this case. So Trump's team will be opposing this in their filing today. And this is really just one of the many fights that we can expect with this case. Both sides, they have to propose a starting date for this trial that's in the coming days, they'll be proposing that. And Trump's team has already indicated they want to slow walk this. They want to delay the start of this trial. In addition, Trump and his lawyers are already talking about asking the judge to recuse herself, mostly because she has in the past referenced Trump in cases and sentencing for January 6th defendants. In fact, Trump wrote this in a post over the weekend. He's been posting a lot. He says, there is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge assigned the ridiculous freedom of speech, fair elections case. Everybody knows this, and so does she. We will immediately be asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for venue change out of D.C. So Trump previewing that his legal team might request a change of venue. What's interesting here, Omar, is that, you know, none of the three dozen January 6th defendants who have asked previously for a change of venue out of D.C., saying that the jury pool is biased here, none of those requests have been granted. So it's -- it would be a very big ask for Trump's legal team to actually get this venue change granted when they do ask for it. But as you can see, they are priming for a fight here and they are sort of flooding the zone with all sorts of requests they might be making to this judge to either change venue, ask her to recuse herself all in advance of that deadline at 5:00 p.m. today.

It was over the course of the last year, since she started leading this investigation, that some of those threats, she says, have been credible threats. So much so where she's spoken publicly about having to change her personal security.Of course, the rhetoric coming from the former president has not helped that he's called Willis a racist. He's saying that this investigation is politically motivated. In fact, one person was out here last week protesting, parroting those remarks from the former president. And now we're seeing really huge changes here. The security you see behind me, these metal barricades have gone up. There's also these plastic barricades, which we understand some of them are filled with water to make them harder to move. Streets around Fulton County are closed. And it's one of the several indications that we're seeing around here, around the courthouse, that things could be nearing an end. There's also a letter that was sent by the Fulton County district attorney to law enforcement officials telling them to be ready, to be ready from now until the end of the month, September 1st, really, that an indictment can come at any time. We know that two grand juries are seated in Fulton County. Each of them has 24 jurors plus two alternates. It will take 16 of them for quorum, and 12 of them have to be in agreement for a decision on indictments to be made, which, as I mentioned, could come any day. Kate?",

I think he's trying to spin things politically right now.You could certainly cross Pence if he starts sounding negative towards Trump by saying that he has a bias. I mean, he's trying to run against Trump. He has bad feelings towards him about what happened on the 6th. So there is some good fodder for cross examining Pence.

Come one Tuesday morning, the DA should have stood in front of a camera and said, the grand jury issued an indictment. But this lead up to it, this sort of drip, drip and tease, tease about what may be coming I think is not good. Just like the letter that was published, I think that should have been done privately, talking to the sheriff, the security people and the chief judge. You don't have to write it in a letter that can be leaked out.It almost presumes that the grand jury is going to issue an indictment. And that's not what our system is about. I mean, we all can talk about whether or not a prosecutor can always get an indictment, but certainly in a case like this, you want to at least have the appearance that there's been some impartiality and consideration of the evidence, as opposed to just a presumption that there would be an indictment and we need to close down the city. So I don't know that it's going on much longer. I expect that we'll see an indictment this week. There is a hearing on August the 10th that a senior judge set up to sort of deal with the same issues that we saw last week in the McBurney Order that's specifically dealing with whether or not the DA has some conflict, whether or not they could use the special presentment grand jury and whether or not Judge McBurney should be presiding over the case. Both parties were ordered to brief that and there is a hearing scheduled. So I've always thought the indictment is likely to come after that hearing so that it doesn't muddy the waters anymore.

This is not supposed to be a thing of courage to say what is true, but because Trump's voters are so aligned with the idea that the election was stolen, DeSantis is actually potentially putting himself on the opposite side of them.

And so that's what he's trying to do. That's what he tried to do in this interview. It's not yet clear whether or not he's been able to shift any of the numbers with this new stage of his campaign, but it's very clear that he's trying a new tactic.

And we haven't seen that from a lot of the base Trump voters.And so now a number of DeSantis donors are saying, you need to appeal to some of these moderate voters, some people that we need to win back into the party. Because if you just appeal to the right wing of our party, we're going to find ourselves in a situation that's similar to what we faced in 2020, where we have a high turnout, we have strong vote among the base, but we can't win over the college educated voters and the moderate voters.
