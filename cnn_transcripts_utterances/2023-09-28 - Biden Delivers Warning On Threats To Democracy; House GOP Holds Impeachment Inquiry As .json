But Biden was really amplifying that. If you look at where we are now versus when Trump was running for president the first time or when he was in office, he now has a much smaller platform. He's not on Twitter. He's not having all of his speeches covered.And so, essentially, there's a chance that there's section of Americans who don't actually know what Donald Trump has been saying since he left office. I do want to go through some of these. He called for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, to be executed. He said he wants to bring the Department of Justice underneath the executive wing as part of getting rid of the deep state, but they also allow him to weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies, making you it political. He also said recently if reelected, the media would be -- coverage would be scrutinized, that why should people get to have the airwaves for no reason, that people would pay a big price in the media for their coverage. And he has talked very openly about the fact he wants to reinstate the Schedule F, which would essentially allow him to easily fire government employees, replace them with loyalists. And that last one is very interesting because that's not something that just Donald Trump wants to do. That has become really a platform of the Republican Party. I spoke to someone at Project 2025 who is preparing for Republican administration in 2025, that's one of their key components there to try and get rid of these bureaucratic employees that have these governmental job protections and replace them with loyalists.",

He was talking about the soul of America. We didn't particularly know about the -- how -- the extent to which Donald Trump was going to try to subvert actual democracy at the time. In the 2022 midterms, a lot of people thought there was going to be a red wave. It didn't happen, in part, because of what happened in 2020.

I mean, you probably have to go back to John Calhoun and the Democratic Party in the South before the civil war the last time you can say that.Democracy was a surprising -- it surprised people the extent to which it was a valuable issue for Democrats in '22. I think if you look at the overall ledger of what's changed since Trump and Biden were last on the ballot together, you have more concerns about age and more concerns about inflation that are hurting Biden. You have abortion, and insurrection that are hurting Trump. And when all of those combined, the likely outcome is that Biden's coalition will probably tilt even further upscale as you were talking about before. I mean, inflation and as you saw Trump's message this week is going to make it harder for him to match his 2020 numbers among voters around the median income who are feeling squeezed. But if you look at upscale voters, where the most receptive -- the most concerned about these institutions, about democracy, about abortion rights, he can hope to do even better than he did in 2020.",

He has been paying conservative influencers to bash Gaetz on social media. That's what Gaetz confronted McCarthy over in a closed door meeting this morning. He accused the speaker of being behind this effort. The speaker denied this and said he would not waste his time or money on Matt Gaetz, and also contended he's spending about $5 million he just recently transferred over to the GOP effort to take back the House majority. That's when he was focusing on. Then that's what some members in the room grumbled were overheard by others saying that Gaetz should F-off, calling him a scum bag and the like.

Manu, at this point, the question remains is there anything tying direct evidence that any of this money went to President Biden when he was vice president or when he was private citizen or when he was president and so far there have been allegations, and rumors but I have not seen any evidence like in terms of like a bank statement, in terms of anything other than hearsay?

There have been some -- they've gotten some evidence showing some wire transfers to the Biden family home. It's not clear whether this was actually something that the former -- the current president and former vice president benefited from in any way financially. This was all Hunter Biden himself. Or whether Joe Biden took official action while serving as vice president to help out his son in any of his business dealings. That's been something they have been trying to prove all along throughout this investigation. Something that they act knowledge that they still don't have the definitive evidence of yet. So Jake, there's still even among Republicans questions that they have about whether they can actually prove that Joe Biden acted in any corrupt way. But you can hear from the chairman right there, he believes the president did. He believes -- plans to press ahead, including with subpoenas for Hunter Biden's business records that could potentially end up in court if Hunter Biden does not comply in any way with that issue or if they are not able to get that key information.
