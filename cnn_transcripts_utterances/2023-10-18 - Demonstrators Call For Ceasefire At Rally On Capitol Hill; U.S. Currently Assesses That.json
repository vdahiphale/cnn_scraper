So Brianna, right now we're in the Cannon House Office Building right across from the Capitol and you can see just over from where I'm standing a huge crowd of protesters, organizers from a couple different Jewish American organizations who are here occupying the Rotunda in this building calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.This comes just a few minutes after they were holding a rally on National Mall but as you can see right in front of us right now someone is being arrested. We have seen a lot of people being zip-tied and led away after being told that this was a sealed space that they could not be here. In fact, we were standing about five feet that way just a couple minutes ago and I was told by a police officer, move or you will be arrested and that's exactly what's happening to the people here. And look, these are the same organizers, the same groups who were outside the White House on Monday, 30-plus people arrested outside the White House who are blocking entrances. There was a huge crowd there on Monday and now we're seeing the same thing today. They again are calling for an end to the war, the fighting, the bombings in Gaza. They have put a lot of the blame, listening to the speakers here over the last couple hours that were at that rally just down the National Mall, they put the blame really squarely at the foot of Israel and the IDF. And now, again, we are watching as Capitol Police are arresting people one by one who are seated in this area who are being told they need to leave now and yet they are willing in this case to be zip-tied and to be led away, guys?",

Several people were holding banners along that upper level and that were - those were the first folks who police really grabbed. They ripped the banners out of their hands. Some of them were then zip-tied and arrested.Now we're starting to see that here on the lower level but I can tell you just five, ten minutes ago the crowd was significantly larger.

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, thanks very much. Here in Israel people search for survivors in the rubble in Gaza, that devastating hospital explosion in Gaza City. President Biden was in Israel, as you know, for historic wartime visit. It was an unmistakable show of unity between Israel and the United States, a show of support particularly today for Israel at a time of increasing volatility.Hundreds of civilians were believed to have been killed yesterday - in yesterday's hospital blast. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, Hamas, as you know, blamed Israel - blamed the IDF. Israel says it has extensive evidence and presented that evidence publicly that a failed rocket launched by Islamic Jihad is to blame. The U.S., the National Security Council currently assesses Israel is not responsible. The National Security Council made a statement earlier saying that they had looked at their own evidence, their own intelligence and came to the same conclusion that Israel did. We have regional coverage right now. CNN's Clarissa Ward in Ashkelon in Israel, a few miles from the Gaza border. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon. Let's start with Clarissa. What have you been seeing, first of all, today where you are, Clarissa?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's been remarkably quiet here in Ashkelon, Anderson. Perhaps that's because President Biden has been here, but the situation in Gaza is still dire. We have been hearing strikes throughout the day. There have been reports from one of our own journalists on the ground of explosions near the Rafah Border Crossing. And that is, of course, where everybody is focused now because President Biden did make some news when he said that he had got the Israeli side to agree to allow for aid to pass through Rafah into the southern part of Gaza.The Israelis came out afterwards and confirmed that. They said with the proviso that none of that aid is diverted in any way to Hamas. Now, we haven't yet heard any commentary from the Egyptian side. Up until now, the Egyptians have been saying that the issue with opening up that border and allowing some of those dozens of trucks full of desperately needed aid into - through the Rafah Crossing was because of continued strikes in the area and fears about the security situation. So a growing sense of urgency and also a growing sense that possibly we could see not clear on the timing yet, but at some point the free flow of some of that aid into the Gaza Strip, where it is desperately needed. As we've been talking about, Anderson, for days now, hospitals are really not able to function. No power, no water. One of our journalists on the ground reports that people are having to boil toilet water and give it to their families to drink because the situation with drinking water has become so desperate and some 600,000 people, according to the U.N. have been displaced from their homes in the north, moved to the south with no real refuge or respite. So this is clearly a situation where time is of the essence on President Biden, saying that the Israelis have now given assurance that they will allow it to go forward. But still, a lot of questions and a lot of obstacles that need to be clear before we can expect to see those trucks of aid going through the Rafah Crossing and getting to those people who need it so desperately, Anderson?",

They've put forward detailed map of where they believe the rocket came from, who fired it, the timing of the firing, the intercepts that you mentioned. And as you said, the National Security Council saying that a preliminary assessment, and it is a preliminary assessment, appears to back up Israel's assertion that this was a rocket that essentially misfired.There are still many parties calling for sort of independent investigation. The U.N. today said, of course, that they would like to carry out their own investigation. I think more broadly, though, the issue that you have and that we're seeing playing out on the streets across the region, which I'm sure Ben will touch on a more detail, is that for many people, their mind was made up the second that this blast happened the second that they saw the horrors. This is a highly emotional issue. People have chosen their narratives from the get go, and it is very difficult to see how cooler minds can prevail, how information just presented is capable of changing the minds of so many who feel so emotional, who are often getting this information and snippets from social media and memes and all kinds of inflammatory misinformation that is out there. So this is an information war as well, Anderson, and we all do our best to walk the line.",

But those protesters twice last night and this afternoon tried to break through the barrier. The Lebanese security forces were firing tear gas and water Cannons in their direction, and eventually the protesters were cleared out of that square at the bottom of the hill by the Lebanese army.But, of course, that's just one of many protests across the region. In Amman, Jordan, we saw very large protests in Morocco, Yemen, Istanbul and elsewhere. And this has really sort of sent jitters through, for instance, here in the diplomatic community. The United States is now advising Americans not to travel to Lebanon and has told family members of staff at the embassy and also non emergency personnel that they can leave on a case by case basis. Saudi Arabia put out an advisory to all its nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately. The U.K. and France are telling their nationals don't come to Lebanon at the moment unless it's absolutely necessary. And, of course, we've seen a variety of airlines, Lufthansa and Swiss Air have canceled flights. Even M.E.A., Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese national carrier has sent five of its airplanes to Istanbul as a precautionary measure because, of course, one of the first things that happened at the beginning of the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel was that the airport was struck by Israeli aircraft and taken out of action, Anderson?",

Either it was bombed by Israel or it was targeted by someone else on the Palestinian side. And if it's - if two people come and say one says it's raining outside and the other said it's dry, you don't bring the quotes of both sides. You just goddamn open the window and look whether it's raining or not.That's what we did. And this hospital, in fact, it's a parking lot, was hit definitely a hundred percent by Islamic jihad barrage shot fired at 6:59 PM. We have three different videos from different angles showing it. We have the ballistics. We know that an Israeli bomb would have created a crater, which does not exist. We know that the propellant in the rocket, because it was a long-term rocket targeted for Israel, so a lot of that propellant was still in the rocket, which created a lot of fire. We have two Hamas nicks (ph) talking to each other and saying and admitting that it is from Islamic jihad. So, Anderson, with all due respect, there aren't two sides to this. Not everything is two sides. And I have a feeling that if it wasn't the state of Israel, then I think the global media would have behaved very differently.",

We have all the information. Everything is transparent. For heaven's sakes, to see the headline of The New York Times saying the Palestinians claim that Israel bombarded a hospital, we don't do that. It's the Palestinian who rape young girls. It's the Palestinians who tear apart limbs. It's the Palestinians who burn whole families and shoot five month old babies. It's the Palestinians, for heaven's sake, who kidnapped 84-year-old Holocaust survivors. It's not the Israelis. This is not what Israel does.

You've got the President of the United States saying, you've got the former prime minister, current government of Israel saying what it is. You've got a number of military people who have looked at it and given you our opinions. And to be honest, it's going to take a long time for this to sink in around the world and may never get the kind of correction that we want in the minds of some who're watching Al Jazeera or Al Arabiya or other networks. They just - it - they just won't accept the evidence. So that evidence is going to be presented, needs to be presented at something like a war crimes hearing by the united - at the United Nations, and it possibly could be there. But again, we're in a current information warfare environment and so this strike on the hospital was a big a big strike in favor of Hamas, however it happened.
