Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Washington, which is already being rocked by President-Elect Trump's cabinet picks even before he assumes office. Now, while the current president, Joe Biden, actually lands in Africa, there was another controversial choice over the weekend, Kash Patel for FBI director. And one more swing of the tariff acts, now, Trump threatening 100 percent duties on goods from the BRICS alliance if they don't remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. This could all stoke further tensions with Beijing and concern regional allies like Japan and South Korea, which have shored up their partnership with the U.S. under President Biden. Joining me to discuss all of this is the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. A veteran Democrat, he was also the mayor of Chicago and chief of staff to President Barack Obama. Rahm Emanuel, Ambassador, welcome back to our program. RAHM EMANUEL, U.S AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: Thanks for having me.",

I think we -- but closer to home what we're building, our allies feel right now very reassured about America's posture in Indo-Pacific. They're committed, whether it's on the trilat between the United States, Japan, and Korea, the United States, Japan, the Philippines, the Quad, about our commitment to the region and commitment to their security being politically, economically, strategically engaged. And I think there's -- you know, from where it was in 2020 to where it is today and many voices on the hill, Democrat, Republicans, all agree that we're in a better position. China is isolated in their own neighborhood by their own actions, and we have made the most of that.

You decided that. We're responding to what you've done. You want to figure out how to get along? Let's not steal intellectual property from Google. Let's not steal intellectual property from ASML. Let's not -- when the International Court makes a ruling on behalf of the Philippines, you decide to totally disregard it. So, if you want to have a way in which you say the world is big enough for two big powers, OK, got it. But you're the one that made the change in the concept. I think one of the faults for the United States, we're all responsible for this, those of have been in government, is we held on too long to the belief that China would be a committed country to the rules- based system because they so benefited from the rules, when in fact they have violated those rules in intellectual property theft, economic espionage, coercion on allies, wolf warrior strategy, violating their EEZs, economic zones, is a core piece of their strategic and economic business model, and you can't do that. So, I do think -- you know, look, I don't think the tariffs is the end all and be all. Is it a negotiating strategy? I don't know. They haven't been clear. There's multiple decisions on that. And I want to be careful. I'm still an ambassador. I don't want to take a partisan political position. It depends in service of what end and to what strategic vision. Is it the only -- is it a tool in a toolbox or the toolbox? And so, to me, if it's a tool in the toolbox, to what end does it serve? What are the other tools you're going to use? How are you going to treat allies to be part of a strategy where I still believe conceptually you want to isolate the isolator?",

We're taking a piece of the Indo-Pacific that's been based in Hawaii, the command control center, moving it to Japan. Japan, even before there was a tank on the Ukrainian border, a Russian tank on the Ukrainian border, agreed to go to 2 percent of GDP of defense budget, acquire counterstrike capabilities, align their national security with our national security and our visions in that area, normalized relations with Korea. So, when you look at all that component from a security standpoint, Japan's on the third year of hitting that 2 percent mark way ahead, and it's not a criticism, but an observation of countries in Europe where you have a hot conflict, which you don't have in the Indo-Pacific. And they've done very, very significant things from interoperability and capacity to align closer to the United States. They're going to go from the nineth to the third largest defense budget in the world. We're their number one defense supplier where they purchase weapons from. So, we have an interest there and they have an interest with us. You can sit here and argue about cost of a base, it's an issue, it's not the issue. And the ability to just take -- you said Taiwan, but I happen to think the Philippines is a real event right now in the South China Sea. You don't have to wait to 2027. It's happening right now between what China -- how China is treating the Philippines. But if one of the strategies on Taiwan is a quarantine, the Philippine area in the South Island -- southwest islands of Japan, make a quarantine of Taiwan much more problematic for China to execute. So, again, example A, you want to have a strategy to deal with kind of a deterrence to China. You're not going to do it without allies. Just as one -- just look at the map. Not possible from that scenario. Number two, I do think -- and this is on us, this is where I would think when they say to us, oh -- if we would say to them, oh, you're going to have to pay more for a base, you know, the United States military industrial base, to me, is our number one security risk. They've never met -- none of the big four have ever met a budget timeline or a deadline for producing a major weapon. And so, the idea -- you know, I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to renegotiate a contract, where -- because our companies have not met the deadline or the cost. So, I would say to you is, we have an ally, we're the biggest supplier of defense products. They're the biggest -- one of the biggest purchasers, is going to become the third largest defense budget. They rely on not just our security commitment but also the purchases of weapons from all the major foreign military industrial companies who can't meet a budget, can't meet a deadline. And so, I say -- so, I -- you know, and every one of them are major stock buybacks. I will tell you one lesson I came out of here, we should have a policy in the defense budget, you cannot do stock buybacks if these 10X weapons that you produce aren't on budget and on timeline. Not a lot. I'm saying this both rhetorically, it is so frustrating from a security commitment where you always have to go back and renegotiate with an ally who's purchasing weapons from you.",

And so, those were the tests I would say, what is your substance? What is your character? What is the merit of your appointment? Can you handle the job? And so, each of the individuals will have to go through that vetting process or confirmation process by the United States Senate and the notion that we would skip that, I think would be certainly a threat to what remains of a check and balance type of government. And would allow people to go through the process without having all of those issues vetted before the American people. And so, I would be concerned about that, skipping the confirmation process, having temporary employment appointments or recess appointments that could last for up to a year or so.

And you have to define, what is combat? Are you talking about hand-to-hand combat like the Peloponnesian Wars or you're really man to man in the trenches, or are you talking about the kind of combat that we have today and likely to have tomorrow? Women are flying our high-performance aircraft. They're doing a great job at that. They're flying our helicopters. They're sailing our biggest ships. They are fundamental to our ability to defend this country. And I think that anyone thinks you're going to pull them out, pull them out of what? Pull them out of training as grunts in the marine, so to speak, hand-to- hand combat, or are you talking about, can they manipulate drones as well as men? Can they fly planes as well as men? What are we talking about in terms of defining what combat is today and what's it going to be tomorrow? If we're looking what the Ukrainians are doing with drone technology, far exceeding what many countries far more advanced than they are in terms of their military capability are doing. So, when you say pull women out of combat, you're talking about pulling a major component of our fighting force, and I think it would be a mistake if it can be done. And I think it would be very hard for anyone coming in to say, no more women in combat. We want them in subservient roles. Yes, they can be clear typists and some sort of a -- in the nursing profession as such, but they can't be with us in the fighting of war. I don't think that can take place today. I don't think it would be wise to do it, but that's up to the Senate at this point to say, do you have the capability? So, can you manage a department that has at least 20 percent of our positions filled by women? Secondly, I think an also controversial statement would be that black people are being promoted based on race. I wonder if that applied to the Tuskegee Airmen and what they were able to do against heroic odds during World War II? I wonder if that would apply to Colin Powell? I wonder if that would apply to Benjamin O. Davis Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis Jr., and so many others who have performed at the highest levels? And as far as Chairman Brown, you think he's been promoted based upon the color of his skin, or was it really because of his character and his service to the country? So, I think these are the kinds of issues that have to be explored, whether something is said for political purposes, the one thing we cannot do is allow the military to be politicized and to allow people to come in who are -- and serve in our military, who are not capable, who are not based on merit.

But he has invaded a sovereign country, violating every rule of law that has existed since the World War II. So, he has invaded. I haven't heard the president-elect condemn that invasion. I haven't heard Tulsi Gabbard or others condemn that invasion other than saying, well, the Ukrainians caused it because they wanted to be free. They wanted to be a NATO member. They wanted to be a member of the E.U.

Can you have someone that is to oversee a -- the intelligence of the United States? What we gather in the way of intelligence is critical to our security. The intelligence agents are on the frontline. We have technical capabilities second to none. You have to take that into account. Can someone manage that? With respect to President Putin, President-Elect Trump has said he admires him. He thinks he's done -- he's brilliant.

It's almost like looking at a Rubik's cube trying to match the pieces so you can say, I solved the problem, but you have not only Russia involved, Syria involved, Iraq involved, Iran involved, you have Hezbollah that certainly has an interest, you have Israel that has an interest, you have the Gulf state.

So, Iran certainly has a big interest and all of the other countries do, as does the United States. So, there's no simple answer to it.

Security Council resolution, I think it's 2255, that tries to protect the civilians who now are caught up in more terrorist activity and conflict.

Five to 8 million people who have been moved out of Syria, many of them going to Europe to help destabilize some of the democracies in Europe. It's complicated.

ANGELA MERKEL, FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Well, in the way that he spoke about Putin, the way that he spoke about the North Korean president, obviously apart from critical remarks he made, there was always a kind of fascination at the sheer power of what these people could do. So, my impression always was that he dreamt of actually overriding maybe all those parliamentary bodies that he felt were, in a way, an encumbrance upon him and that he wanted to decide matters on his own and in a democracy. Well, you cannot reconcile that with democratic values. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, you know, one could look at these women as, you know, they just don't have the freedoms of the lives that we women have today and, oh, poor them. Well -- but in the process of really understanding the play and taking on this character and also really enjoying the friendship between Mrs. Webb and Mrs. Gibbs and the joy of these women. And the honor that Mrs. Webb seems to have of nourishing her family and taking care of them and the love language of cooking for them every day and the beauty that -- she's using her hands. She's using her hands to pull those beans to make dinner, to be there, to love. And the journey of her relationship with her children to me is just a part of the overall theme of life.

And it's also some of the most intense silences I've ever heard from a thousand people in an audience before. I think you could pick many things that you think are brutal in this play. The one that comes to me the most is that for two acts, you watch all this daily living and moving and shuffling around that we do. And by the end of the play, part of the message seems to be, all of that was going on was kind of what blinded us to really seeing each other while we are here at the same time. And that's brutal, in my opinion. But I also think that when Emily, the character, asks if anyone ever sees it all, every moment, and the stage manager says, no. The saints and poets, maybe they do some, but no. I don't think that's as brutal as it is forgiving. I think, to me, the message is this is the fact of what it is to be alive, but there's also nothing to be done about it too much. You know, you try and connect, try and love, but forgive yourself for all the ways in which you're going to fail to miss all these human moments because that's what it is to be on this Earth.",

And I think, again, when we start separating people, the successful, the non-successful, there's a gap all of a sudden. But what unites us is we're -- we are in this together, and we all do feel the same things. And this play, I think, reminds people that, yes we're all doing this too. Also, I wanted to bring up what I think what happens with this play is, you know, the moments where there's -- everyone freezes and these characters start to have these feelings. And I think with great plays, this -- there -- you allow for the confusion of the human experience, which is, I don't know what's happening. Or like George, like one minute, he's afraid to get -- he doesn't want to get married and the next minute he's fine. And that confusion starts to seep in. And that is the human experience and human nature. And then by the end, it didn't really matter anyway. You know what I mean?

Nothing changed after election. We're still all really tied together. I'm the grandson of sharecroppers and slaves. And, you know, and we went through civil rights. We went through reconstruction and went through Rodney King. We went through so much and we'll survive this. And when I think about how young this country are and how many millions and millions of years Thornton Wilder talks about compared to this little small bit of time, we still -- we just got further to go. And we're all tied together. And sooner or later, we'll learn from our scholars and our artists and our passionate hearts. We will. So, we are Americans and we had many people before us to fight for us, to live for us, to stand for freedom and democracy. The war has not changed. The war still is freedom and democracy, and every generation has to stand up for it. And by God, I'm standing up for it every night. Every time I direct something, every time I write something, and I'm trying to engage with artists who are thinking the same. And America belongs to the all, not to the one, not to the some.
