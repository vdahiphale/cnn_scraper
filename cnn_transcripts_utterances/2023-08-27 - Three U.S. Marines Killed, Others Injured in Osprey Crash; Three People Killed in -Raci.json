Five of the U.S. personnel were seriously injured, taken to hospital. One of those people required surgery.Now, I must say that we don't yet know why this incident happened. But the Osprey Aircraft has a bad track record of incidents. Just last year, nine U.S. personnel were killed across multiple accidents between California and Norway. So a sad turn of events this morning as this aircraft was going about routine training as a part of the U.S. Marine rotational force, which is based up in Darwin in Australia's northern territory on a semi- permanent base. It's a sad day for Australia and the U.S., very close allies. Of course, the Australian public monitored this very closely today as details began to emerge from the incident. Just weeks ago in a separate case where U.S. and Australian personnel were training together, an Australian helicopter went down in Queensland killing four Australians aboard.

In Boston, at least seven people were injured near a parade celebrating the city's Annual Caribbean -- Carnival in Choctaw, Oklahoma.

According to the authoritative source, the Gun Violence Archive, so far this year the United States has recorded more than 471 mass shootings that compares to more than 640 for all of last year. Now CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot excluding the shooter.

The Prediction Center says those record high temperatures combined with some unusually high humidity will lead to heat indices near record levels over the mid- Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast region. Meanwhile, the heat is starting to pick up in the southwestern part of the U.S. to well over 100-degree temperatures, though some cities are expected to see a drop during the next few days.

It's important to remember that, you know, just maybe two years ago, Prigozhin had almost no public profile at all. In fact, his main usefulness to the state was the fact that he was kind of a deniable asset. So a lot of the activities, whether it was the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections through his network of troll farms or his deployment of mercenaries, whether it be in Syria, in Donbas region, these were all deniable by the Russian state. And that was the main reason that he was useful.Now, that changed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. And Wagner's apparent battlefield successes in places such as Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, Russian State Media began to lionizing the Wagner fighters and Prigozhin himself, engage in a very public feud with Russia's top military brass, essentially saying that he wasn't being provided with the resources that his fighters needed to pursue the -- you know, pursue the fight in Ukraine. So, you know, he was not, I would say, somebody who was widely loved. In many ways, he sort of represented kind of a bogeyman, kind of the sort of was a frightening figure for Russia's elite, despite the fact that, you know, I think some of his fighters may have been loyal to him, Kim.",

President Biden really hoping to stay out of that. The strategy there is twofold. One is to avoid weighing in on the judicial process. The President, a believer in judicial independence, but also a political strategy to avoid giving President Trump a pretext for claiming political persecution. President Biden's strategy has really been to go about the business of the presidency, selling his domestic agenda, conducting foreign policy. You did see that at play this week as well as President Trump was arriving in Atlanta for his surrender. The White House said that President Biden had spoken to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but certainly President Biden will have a balance to strike here. As of now he is not weighing in on the sheer gravity of these charges that President Trump faces. And when it comes down to these issues that are at play here, the issues of democracy, of President Trump's attempts to cling to power will be the animating feature of the upcoming campaign.

The way in which my father fought obviously was through non-violence. He used that as his weapon. And it was -- it was a weapon that enabled people to rally around and really focus their attention on the goal that they were seeking. And so I think those are some of the things that he would be doing today. It's just -- not just challenging it, but really organizing people strategically to address each one of those issues that you just raised. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here she is?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNE RIMOIN, PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, UCLA: I think what we're seeing is something that we expect to see in the fall. You know, we see changing patterns of people going back to school, people getting, being indoors in close proximity to each other. And that is usually what kicks off the respiratory virus season. And that's where we are right now. We have COVID, we have RSV, and we also will have influenza coming. So I think it's not surprising that we're starting to see uptick in respiratory pathogens, COVID included. The way that this works is that the FDA is going to issue an approval for this vaccine, and then it's going to come to the CDC. The CDC is going to determine who should get it and when. So we should be hearing that. I think the date for the CDC meeting is September 12th. So we'll hear soon after that. What we anticipate is that the people that will be on the list to encourage to get it will be people who are older, people who are immunocompromised. Those will be the people that should be first in line to get it. And then we'll learn from CDC who's next on the list. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The 25-year -old from Norway has been cooler than a polar bear's toenails. Entering the weekend, tied for the lead, Hovland turned up the heat, shooting a 4 under 66, tying the second-best round of the day. Hovland has only had three bogeys through the first three rounds. That adds up to a six- shot lead over -- for Hovland over Xander Schauffele heading into Sunday. Here he is.

And obviously it's a, you know, maybe not a marathon, but it feels more like a sprint. Obviously it's a marathon getting into this week. But it's hard to win the FedEx Cup if you haven't played well the last few weeks. You know, it's just a great list of names that's won the tournament.
