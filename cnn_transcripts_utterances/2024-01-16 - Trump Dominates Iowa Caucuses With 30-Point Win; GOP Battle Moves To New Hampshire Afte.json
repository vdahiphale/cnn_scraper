A runaway victory for Donald Trump last night in the Iowa Republican caucuses. Trump's victory, the stronger showing for any non-incumbent in the modern era of the Iowa caucuses since the 1970s, with Trump winning 51 percent of the vote. That is ten points higher than the previous record. George W. Bush won 41 percent in 2000. And turnout for Trump was sweeping. He won every single county in Iowa, except one, that one in yellow, you see there, Johnson County, Nikki Haley won 99 counties, but Johnson county wasn't one. Look at these scenes from last night, democracy in action, hard working election workers, counting votes on pieces of paper tabulating them, putting them in popcorn buckets, all of it on the up and up. Today, no complaints of fraud even if the system frankly looks like it hasn't evolved much since the caucus began in Iowa in 1846. Now, why? Why are there no complaints of fraud today? Well, perhaps because Donald Trump won. You might recall eight years ago when Ted Cruz won the caucuses in 2016, Trump lodged evidence-free complaints of fraud. In fact, he's still claiming he really won in 2016, even though he did not. Here he is before the results last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He won the female vote. He won among all age groups above the age of 30, he won the evangelicals, he won college educated and non-college college-educated among almost every single group of voters, Donald Trump won. And Trump did all this after holding significantly fewer events than his opponents in Iowa. And while facing 91 felony charges in four indictments with the majority of caucusgoers saying they would vote for Trump for president even if he is convicted of a crime, even if he's a convicted felon. Now, whether that's related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election based on election lies or his handling of classified material, it doesn't matter to these voters.

Of course, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis would have a word or two about that. He has headed here to New Hampshire for a town hall this evening at New England College. He, of course, is making the argument that this is not a two-person race. It's, in fact, a three-person race that he got second place in Iowa.

And so, you know, part of this is she is going to be on the ballot in the primary.

So I think -- I think that's an asterisk.Going into to New Hampshire, we've seen all the polling. It's a tight race between Ambassador Haley and Trump. We've got a week before the election. And guess who else thinks this is a two-person race? Donald Trump. All the time, energy, effort and money he's putting in. So, lies and criticizing Nikki Haley I think is a sign that their campaign recognizes her as the threat that that she is. And here -- and the bottom line is this, we need more people to come out to vote. Less than 15 percent of identified Republicans voted last night in Iowa. Yes, Donald Trump won and got about 7 percent of that.

But you have to remember, she was in court today for the first time in decades with Trump in the same room for the first time in years and years. And the thought of her having to talk about this and things so emotional for the first time in front of him that could really be a moment. Now, there's also the possibility that Trump, who could testify, but his lane like what he can actually talk about, given that this is just about damages is incredibly narrow. It's unclear.

Israel's defense minister says the current phase of the war will end soon and will shift toward more targeted operations. This after an elite IDF division exited the Gaza Strip last night, not every Israeli official seems to be on the same page.Far right national security minister Ben-Gvir, an anti-Arab racist who has called for the complete reoccupation of Gaza, insists this is the wrong approach and the decision to remove Israeli troops will, quote, cost human lives. This as suffering for Gazans compounds with a bitter winter. The United Nation says Israel's operation has brought famine with, quote, incredible speed, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are already starving. Joining us now, Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman under Donald Trump. Morgan, thanks for joining us. So Israel shifting war strategy in Gaza comes after pressure by the Biden administration for Israel to conduct more targeted precise operations because of the -- with the goal of saving civilian lives, you just returned from a trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia.

And that would, of course, have to -- have something for the Palestinian people.He -- and most of the Arab world are going to want some sort of, if not a path towards a state for the Palestinian people, if not one in that deal, at least a path towards one. But I think they want a serious things -- series concessions for the Palestinian people. But I think just in and of itself, that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is not dismissing it after everything that we've seen from October 7, after what we've seen, go on in the Arab street shows to me that there is some hope. I mean, someone is going to have to stand up in this region in order to stop all of the fighting, to stop the attacks. And we hear -- I've heard constantly for years behind the scenes whether it's Hamas or al-Qaeda or other Sunni terrorist groups, I lived in Saudi Arabia during the Obama administration when I was his treasury attache. And they're very encouraging behind the scenes for Americans and others to go after terrorists, and it's often a very different picture from what you hear publicly. So, again, I think even the fact that we haven't gotten to a deal yet, but even the fact that MBS is willing to entertain this conversation means somebody in the Arab world is willing to step up and be a leader. I don't know if the Biden team will get there. I was a part of the Abraham accords team in the last administration I worked for President Bush, President Obama, and President Trump.

Of course, you don't want that. But what happened in the three-year since? Iran has had billions of dollars and relief from sanctions not being enforced. They have used that money to build up the capability of the Houthis. And, Jake, we're really seeing the nightmare scenario that you and I and many others talked about after 9/11, which is a terrorist group with ballistic missiles and sophisticated weaponry with the ability to go after U.S. ships and U.S. sailors on a daily basis. That's always what we set after 911 that we don't what and what were seeing now. So the U.S. strikes are incredibly important. I support them.
