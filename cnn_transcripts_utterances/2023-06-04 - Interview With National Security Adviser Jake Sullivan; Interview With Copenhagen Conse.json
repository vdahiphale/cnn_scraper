We talk about Russia's war in Ukraine, threats from China, and America's role in a new world. And it is GPS's birthday. This week we mark 15 years of the GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE. It's astonishing how much has happened in a decade and a half. And we will bring you the highlights. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's about the full range of issues that we are working on together including solving major problems like climate change, future economic growth.And so take India, for example. It's true India hasn't joined the sanctions. At the same time Prime Minister Modi will be coming here to Washington in a couple of weeks for a state visit. And the U.S.-India partnership has actually never been stronger across technology, defense cooperation, and in important terms the ties between our two peoples, of the two democracies. So as far as I'm concerned, the big thing the United States needs to do is not have a debate with each of these countries about Ukraine, but rather meet them where they are in terms of what they're trying to accomplish. And that is to deliver for their citizens, to build infrastructure for clean energy transition, to deal with major debt challenges coming out of COVID. And President Biden has an affirmative agenda to do all of those things. When he was at the G7 in Hiroshima, he was joined there by the leaders of Brazil, India, Indonesia and other developing countries. They had a robust discussion about Ukraine but they also talked about this broader range of issues where I think the United States is now on the front foot in terms of trying to deliver global public goods that help the lives of people among that 60 percent to 70 percent of the world's population.",

Much lower than the set of countries you were describing in your opening statement. Secondly, we're looking to in fact enhance the ability of many countries to invest in the United States, to join clean resilient supply chains as we make this transition -- clean energy transition and deal with the climate crisis.And we're also looking to deliver for them on their needs. As I was saying before, the two biggest things we hear from emerging economies are, one, mobilized public investment through the World Bank, the IMF and directly from the United States, for our infrastructure, our digital infrastructure, our physical infrastructure, our energy infrastructure, and we are doing that at scale. And second, help us deal with our debt burden. Make sure that we are able to get out from under the kind of debt that is holding down our ability to deliver for our people. And the United States is in the lead in trying to provide debt relief to emerging economies. You put those things together and I think the story we can tell about a positive sum approach from the United States, that we are actively trying to look out not just for the needs of the American people, though of course the president is focused on that, but for the needs of people everywhere because we're all in this together. That's at the heart of how Joe Biden looks at his presidency and it's the approach that he's taken and we've really begun to put points on the board. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that comes back to that same principle I was talking about a minute ago. The principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.And in fact if you look at the 12 principles China put forward in its peace formula, the first principle was that. It was about the inviolability of a nation's sovereignty, and the fact that borders should not be changed by force. So it really is up to China to make its determination as to whether it's going to lean in here to support that principle of sovereignty and indicate to Russia that it will stand behind an outcome in which Ukraine gets its sovereignty back. Whether China does that or not is unclear. They've been tentative so far. I think they're still trying to decide how they want to proceed. But we support the PRC playing a role, a constructive role in a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. charter. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I saw two leaders who are actually trying to reach understanding even if we have different points of view and even if we are in a deeply competitive relationship on some of the fundamentals in this dynamic, and the desire on both parts to put a floor under the relationship. To manage the competition responsibly. To ensure that competition does not become conflict.And there are a number of different elements to that. But one of the key ones is that as we have intense competition, we also have intense diplomacy. So I just sat down for two days with my counterpart Wong Yi and talked through all of the strategic issues in our relationships and we will I hope soon see American officials engaging at senior levels with their Chinese counterparts over the coming months to continue that work. And then at some point we will see President Biden and President Xi come back together again. So as far as I'm concerned there is nothing inconsistent with on the one hand competing vigorously in important domains, on economics and technology, and also ensuring that that competition does not veer into conflict or confrontation. That is the firm conviction of President Biden. That is how he will responsibly manage this relationship, and we believe there is nothing inevitable about some kind of conflict or cold war between the U.S. and China.",

I mean it's three things. First, it means that we need secure resilient supply chains in critical goods like clean energy technologies and semiconductors, so that we're not reliant on any one country. Second, it means that we need to protect our most advanced technologies especially those with military applications so those technologies cannot be used to harm our security. And third, it means that we need to fundamentally invest in the sources of our own industrial capacity here at home so that we have the ability to grow and produce some of the critical goods that we are going to need to rely on in the years ahead, whether that's in the field of technology or health or clean energy, and that is what we intend to do.

That is not a Biden administration issue, that has been true from the moment of the Shanghai communique. But the thing is what it lacks in clarity the One China policy has succeeded in actually achieving the practical objective of decades of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
