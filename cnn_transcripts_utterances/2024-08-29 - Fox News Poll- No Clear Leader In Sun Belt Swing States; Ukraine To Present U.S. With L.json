Smart strategists I've talked to say the over under here for Trump is 20 percent. If he is getting 20 percent with Black voters, it becomes very difficult to see how some of these states end up in play for Kamala Harris, 19 is just below that.

I think things like the interview tonight are going to be a big test of whether she can hold her appeal and not lose this excitement thats become so signature to her bid right now. And additionally, whether she defines maybe some of her more policy positions, that could be another tap into some of those demographics that she's hoping to increase turnout. We haven't heard a lot of specifics from her in policy yet. Again, it's a short campaign. She's getting a lot in very quickly, but it'll be interesting to see if that comes out.",

Maybe add a little more meat to the bone when it comes to some of the policies she's already fleshed out without offending someone along the way.

But Ms. Harris is stronger than Mrs. Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Biden were. The former president will have to up his game. And to this point, he's co-headlining a fundraise -- Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia is co headlining a fundraiser for the former president because apparently he was prompted to bury the hatchet there.

So in many ways is seen by the Ukrainians are make or break, and it's another test really of how flexible Washington is on what were red lines that you shouldn't be going into Russia, you shouldn't be attacking within Russia as you that just be defending Ukraine.
