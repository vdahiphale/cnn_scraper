The evolution of it. What stands out in your mind when people ask you, how did hip-hop get to this point? DARRYL \"DMC\" MCDANIELS, MUSICIAN, ARTIST, AND AUTHOR: Well, hip-hop is just basically music. It's a culture. We was inspired by rock, pop, pop, funk, so R&amp;B, jazz. So Grandmaster Caz, probably the greatest rapper ever, he said this, hip-hop didn't invent anything, we reinvented everything. So, we were those kids watching \"Soul Train.\" We were those kids watching \"American Bandstand.\" So we was influenced by rock and roll. And, if you listen to hip-hop before it was recorded, before \"Rapper's Delight,\" and all the early rap songs, when you heard the live performances of the tapes of Grandmaster Flash, the Funky 4 + 1, the Treacherous Three, the Cold Crush Four, the Fantastic Five, every mc, every mc prophesied this is from '73 to '79, before \"Rapper's Delight,\" every rapper said these words, one day my name will be found in the Hall of Fame.

I think the defining moment, besides being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, was 1985 when we was called to participate in Live Aid. Bill Graham said, I will not participate and work with y'all if you don't have Run-DMC here. And a lot of people on the board of Live Aid said, why do you want those guys here? Rap's a fad. They're not even going to be here in three years. But for us to be chosen to participate in Live Aid, where Black Sabbath and Tina Turner, and Mick Jagger, it showed the world that we are a legitimate form of entertainment, like everybody else.",
