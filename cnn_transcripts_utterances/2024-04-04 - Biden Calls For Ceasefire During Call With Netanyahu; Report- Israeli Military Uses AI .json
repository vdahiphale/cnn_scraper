A reality check coming from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, suggesting that if inflation continues to stall, rates this year might not be cut at all. Those are the markets, and these are the main events: President Biden tells Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel must take steps to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza or face consequences. Janet Yellen is in China where she is expected to press China over its generous subsidies for green tech, including solar cells and EV batteries.

It is Thursday, April 4th, I am Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. US President Joe Biden pressed for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during a call today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The White House says Biden made clear that US policy on Gaza will depend on whether Israel takes measurable steps to protect civilians. Biden also emphasized that strikes on humanitarian workers are unacceptable. The call was scheduled after seven workers with World Central Kitchen lots their lives in Gaza. The IDF says it has completed an investigation into that strike and will present it to Netanyahu. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken says Israel must make sure events like these never happen again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He did not -- it is critical to mention -- did not announce consequences today in the wake of this just horrific attack on World Central Kitchen aid workers, but did say if they do not come up with a list and a plan to ensure that this doesn't happen again, then there will be consequences. Now, that will disappoint some in this country who are already calling for consequences inside this country and outside, and it is notable that you're beginning to hear more democratic voices, including close allies of the president saying that the US needs to condition aid to Israel going forward. In other words to say, no more aid will come unless these conditions are met and that is a notable change. We haven't seen that happen, but at least that threat is new and different.",

I am sure you've read the report today. Can you just confirm very briefly that this kind of technology does exist and could be used as such? PAUL SCHARRE, AUTHOR, \"FOUR BATTLEGROUNDS: POWER IN THE AGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\": A hundred percent. The allegations about how the Israel Defense Forces are using AI are very reasonable in terms of the state of the technology, and in fact, the Israeli military for a long time has been a leader in artificial intelligence. And so the way that they are alleged to be using AI to scoop up massive amounts of data from social media, from cellphones, from photographs, tie them together and identify potential militants is certainly something that AI is capable of doing. And in fact, if we are being honest, AI is notoriously unreliable, and so a 10 percent error rate is pretty good for AI.

And I think that's what is really clear to understand what AI, it is not magic and the AI is only as good as the training data or the rules that we put into that system.

So, the law of war still applies. AI doesn't get some escape hatch from the rules under the law of war to not target civilians, to avoid disproportionate amounts of civilian casualties, but there are no special rules which relate to AI. So for example, there is no rule in the law of war saying that a human has to be the one to make this final decision. Now, the reality is, these ai systems are not reliable enough to trust them, but there has been a lot of debate about how much human involvement is actually required.

But I think in terms of long-term opportunities this year, we continue to see surprisingly strong economic data, a surprisingly strong labor market and certainly earnings revisions that are going up and not down. So I think there are more tailwinds than headwinds right now, but it is also important to note that we haven't had a two percent drawdown on a weekly basis going all the way back to the middle of last October. We typically have three to five percent drawdowns every year. So this kind of volatility is the norm, not the exception, but we've been lulled to sleep because markets have gotten unidirectionally higher, up some 25 percent since the lows of October and up 10 percent for two quarters in a row.

What the judge there Aileen Cannon has ruled finally is that she will not dismiss the case based on the former president's claim that he had a right to hold onto these documents under a law called the Presidential Records Act. She says that the indictment against the former president doesn't mention the Presidential Records Act, and so therefore she says the indictment will stand. But what's remarkable about this ruling is that she then uses this to push back against the Special Counsel Jack Smith who had implicitly criticized her for how long she's taken with some of her rulings, also for the fact that he -- that she had ordered the two sides to start coming up with jury instructions. I guess something that is really early in this process when we still don't even have a firm trial date for that case. What we now also have with this ruling in Georgia is also again a state there, Judge McAfee, who is ruling that the former president doesn't get to get out of these -- out of this case there simply because he's claiming that what he was doing was protected by free speech, by the First Amendment and political speech. The judge saying that this defense has not presented and they can't find any proof that the speech or conduct that is alleged is protected political speech. Two very, very strong rulings that are going against the former president, as you pointed out, Julia. The judge in New York is having none of the efforts by the former president to delay his trial.

So we have the growing direct-to-consumer business. You know, Levi's is clearly getting a bump from Beyonce, and also kind of a shift into Western fashion. So these three trends really coming together to bump up Levi's right now. Stocks up about 12 percent. Levi's also has a new CEO, Michelle Gass, and she comes from coals, so another kind of shift from wholesale into direct-to-consumer. Michelle Gass has an interesting background and investors are very high on her at Levi's.",

Butas you mentioned earlier, they're not as profitable. So investors, they really want to see companies really be able to take control of their brands at selling at their own stores and also their own Web sites. And that's what Levi's is doing really well right now. And of course, the help from Beyonce, I think we can't discount kind of how important these cultural moments are for these brands. Certainly when you get an artists like Beyonce, naming a song after your brand, that's going to give you a lot of momentum. And this isn't the first time Levi's has benefited from the kind of the connection with Beyonce, but it is interesting to see how brands can capitalize on these cultural moments.",
