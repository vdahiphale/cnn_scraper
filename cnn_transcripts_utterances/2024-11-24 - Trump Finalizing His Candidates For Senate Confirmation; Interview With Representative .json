He only has a few more names left to announce and now, really, the work is beginning on readying these different candidates for their Senate confirmation hearings.Now, one person in particular that there has been a lot of controversy around is his selection to run the Pentagon, and that is Pete Hegseth. We know that Hegseth was on Capitol Hill last week meeting privately one-on-one with senators alongside the VP-elect J.D. Vance, to really hear what they needed from him and to assuage some of their concerns. Now, one of the key things I would remind you of is that Hegseth was very quickly picked by Donald Trump. He had been called down to Mar-a- Lago. He interviewed with the president-elect, and then shortly thereafter Donald Trump announced that he was going to be his selection for the Department of Defense. In between that time, there really wasn't a lot of time to do deep vetting on him and we know that members of Donald Trump's transition team were caught off guard by what was later released that week, a police report detailing sexual assault allegations against him. Now, this is something we have heard many different members, many different senators weigh in on. I want you to take a listen to what some of them said this morning on the Sunday shows. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): He does not have the experience to run an organization of that size. So just based on those requirements alone, he is unqualified for the position. SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN): Don't let these allegations distract us. What we need is real, significant change. The Pentagon has been more focused on pronouns than they have lethality in the past four years. We need to get back to business, and I think Pete is just the person to do it. SEN. ERICK SCHMITT (R-MO): Ultimately this is a decision that President Trump made to bring in another disrupter, who's not been charged with anything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. intelligence officials and America's top telecom officials meeting at the White House to discuss a Chinese cyber espionage campaign that may have spied on phone calls and text messages from top politicians, including President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance. In a sign of mounting concern an all- senators' classified briefing is scheduled for after Congress returns from recess next month. CNN's cybersecurity reporter Sean Lyngaas joins us now in Washington. Sean, the campaign is considered so severe, the cyber espionage campaign, that President Biden brought it up with Chinese President Xi when the two met in Peru last weekend. And yet, according to his National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan, it doesn't sound like much if any progress was made.",

However, the scale of what we're talking about in this case is really startling. Every major U.S. telecommunications provider, AT&amp;T and Verizon, is believed to be targeted and, you know, certainly Biden is going to raise this with Xi Jinping. But it's more probably in the sense of we see what you're doing and, you know, it's not necessarily off limits, but it's not appreciated because this is -- we're talking about, as you said, potentially spying on the phone calls of President-elect Trump and his vice president-elect, J.D. Vance, as well.And we know from our reporting, Kayla, that the Chinese hackers have also targeted the communications of Senator Schumer's office. So it is a bipartisan threat. And so the incoming administration is going to inherit this immense national security challenge. And it's not going away anytime soon. I mean, we don't even have any confirmation yet, Kayla, that they've actually evicted the hackers from the telecom networks. They're still trying to play a sort of cat and mouse game with getting them out and trying to keep them out. So it's very much an ongoing investigation. I expect to report on more names in the coming weeks that have been targeted. So it's really all hands on deck.

U.S. national security challenges still present themselves, and we will see what, if anything, comes out of this all senators briefing.Sean Lyngaas, we appreciate you staying up late with us tonight. Thank you so much. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Thank you so much for joining us, Congressman. First, I want to ask you about this Chinese cyberattack. I mean, one lawmaker calling it the worst telecom attack in American history. And as we just heard from Sean, these hackers are still in American systems. Why is it so difficult to evict them? And what is the message that the U.S. needs to have for China? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Good evening, Kayla. Thanks for having me on. I agree with Senator Warner. From the high level briefings that I have gotten this is the worst cyberattack against the United States that I am aware of. I think there's a number of reasons why it's so pernicious. The first is the sophistication that the Chinese brought to bear in how they accessed U.S. networks, and how they then used those placements to tap into high level officials' most sensitive conversations. But I think the second is how brazen they were. Generally, when hackers are uncovered, they sort of retreat and my understanding is they have not been willing to do that. Even when they have been uncovered they have been asserting themselves within the networks. And that is unprecedented. So the United States needs to respond forcefully. This is not the only dimension on which the Chinese are being belligerent. They're also exporting fentanyl to the United States. 97 percent of fentanyl precursors come from a few dozen Chinese manufacturers, killing 100,000 Americans every year. So we need real assertive strength at the negotiating table against the Chinese because they are upping the temperature in their belligerence.",

You wrote a blistering op-ed in \"The Boston Globe,\" and you said the Senate must reject Kennedy as health secretary.You go into a litany of reasons why, but I'm wondering why you think the Senate on its own through its advise and consent process would not otherwise come to that conclusion on its own?",

He is not coming in as the dictator of his own realm here. And this is what the founders envisioned.They envisioned that there would be a power hungry president and that they would require Congress to supplicate themselves. And we need congressional Republicans to stand up for the Constitution and the country, not wholesale against every single one of his picks. Some of his picks are qualified. Senator Rubio, Mike Walsh. But some of his picks are manifestly unqualified, like Tulsi Gabbard and of course RFK. And RFK touches the life and the health of all of my constituents. If you take Medicare benefits, if you look at the nutrition label on food that you're buying at the grocery store, if you want your kids to get a vaccine or drink public water, RFK is now your problem, too. And he is a conspiracy theorist and a quack who is trying to mask his dangerous agenda behind this handwaving about holistic health. But just because he believes in healthier school lunches for kids does not make him some oracle of good health advice. What he believes fundamentally is that there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. He does not think that AIDS is caused by a virus. He thinks high speed internet causes leaky vein syndrome. This is a guy who has no business pulling the levers of American health policy.",

Perhaps the linchpin of public health in this country.And I'm wondering what you think has changed in the public discourse that has caused Trump to embrace a person like that after pursuing such vastly different policies during his first term.",

I don't think anybody would accuse Donald Trump of being into the weeds on policy on any given domain. I think he tends to follow what he feels like is the zeitgeist of popular culture and clearly RFK has tapped in to distrust of American institutions and anger against big food and big chemical manufacturers, much of it righteous.And he is trying to now use that to his own advantage. And what I worry about is that RFK is going to fuse this personal brand that he has built around this anger with the organs of state to pump in disinformation to the American public realm. And that's not an academic concern. We saw what happened in Samoa in 2019 when RFK did that. 83 people died from measles, a preventable disease. Most of them were children. Proportionately, there'd be more than 100,000 Americans should that happen here in the United States and we know how to stop that. It's vaccines. But RFK doesn't believe in them. TAUSCHE: Yes.

So limit the alcohol intake if you're expecting this kind of thing at the holiday. Think about who you're sitting next to each other at the table and don't put the people who are most likely to be having opposing views and exploded each other because it's happened before.As I said, you can preempt some of this by deciding what are a couple of topics that I feel like I could bring up with these people that I care about, that feel safe and have them in your mind and have them on hand and ready. And if someone does get attacking, it's really OK to say, hey, you know what, let's wait a minute. I don't think this is going in a good direction for either of us. I really care about you, let's talk about -- I want to hear, how's your family doing? How's work going? Talk about something else. So it is about giving yourself a moment, not reacting in the moment. Not vilifying whoever doesn't agree with you in hopes that they can do the same. And again, prioritizing. You'd like to come out of this, all of you, right, feeling like it was a nice holiday.
