And today a stunning admission from the Israeli military as it investigates the accidental killing of three Israeli hostages. Israel defense forces say the three men were waving a white flag and speaking Hebrew when soldiers mistakenly opened fire on them. The brigade had been operating in a high intensity combat zone inside Gaza on Friday. The IDF says the three hostages had either managed to escape or were abandoned by their Hamas captors. Meantime, another hostage, 27-year-old Inbar Haiman has died while held captive by Hamas, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. Her death means there are now 129 hostages who remain in Gaza. 21 of whom have died. A source tells CNN that the head of Israel's intelligence agency is expected to meet with Qatar's prime minister to discuss getting hostages released. Right now, families of the other hostages who remain in Gaza are holding a rally in Tel Aviv, CNN's Alex Marquardt, is there. Alex, how are people reacting to this accidental killing of three hostages?",

There is a lot of desire for everyone here, for the families, for the friends of the hostages, for the government, to bring those hostages home as soon as possible.We just got the news of Inbar Haiman, a 27-year-old. She was a graffiti artist who died in Hamas captivity. It's still unclear exactly what the -- what the circumstances were of her death. But, of course, this comes just one day after this tragedy of these three hostages who were on the verge of freedom being shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. We just heard from the head of the IDF, who said that it was very much the soldiers' responsibility that they were not following the rules of engagement. He said that the hostages did everything that they could to identify themselves as hostages, they took off their shirts to show that they didn't have explosives. They waved the white flag. And if someone surrenders waving a white flag, you are not supposed to shoot at them, of course. So, we understand that these three men came, were just tens of yards away from the soldiers when they were shot and killed. One of them wasn't killed immediately. He went -- he went back into a building, was shouting in Hebrew, but then, was killed in another burst of gunfire. So, there is still an investigation going on. But the IDF taking full responsibility. And Fred, this is raising all kinds of questions about how precise the Israeli troops are being. We have this awful incident, there have been a number more than a dozen Israeli forces who have been killed by friendly fire. And some of the hostages themselves and their families have accused the Israeli military of not knowing where the hostages are inside Gaza, and continuing to bomb and strike in the areas where they are, which has led to some injuries. Hamas claims that it has led to some deaths. Of course, we can't verify that. But the killing of these hostages yesterday really raising questions about how precise and surgical they actually are being which is what the Biden administration has demanded that they try to be do more.

      "sentences": "Fred, this is just the latest in a series of attacks both on U.S. interests, and on commercial shipping by Houthi militants in the Red Sea and in the Gulf of Aden.Attacks that the group says is in response to -- or in retribution for the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Houthi, the Houthis are a broadly Iran- aligned militant group that the U.S. believes is sort of opportunistically trying to take advantage of this moment to launch attacks on Israeli-linked targets. U.S. targets so that they can show both to their own domestic audiences, and to the broader region that they are defenders of the Palestinian cause. And they're sort of pushing back against this Israeli invasion. The issue for the United States, though, of course, is that the safety of commerce -- they are trying to balance kind of the safety of commercial shipping, which there is -- are concerns that it could impact the global economy against the desire to avoid allowing the Israel-Hamas conflict to spread and potentially suck in the United States and Iran. This is this sort of escalation concern is the big concern for the United States. And that's part of the reason why I think you've seen the U.S. so far act with restraint here and avoid responding to these Houthi attacks directly. In particular, because U.S. officials at this point believe that Iran is largely calibrating its reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza. They are sort of allowing their proxy groups to launch attacks up to a certain threshold, but not to such a high degree that it might result in a direct response by the United States to Iran directly, for example. The U.S. also believes broadly that they're capable of dealing with some of these Houthi attacks. So far, we have seen them obviously shoot down a number of these one-way attack drones. The Houthi sort of homegrown ballistic missiles, not seen as particularly accurate. The homegrown cruise missiles seen as a little more accurate, but not clear that they can actually bring down a ship. In this situation, it's likely that the Houthis, were using something called a swarm tactic, trying to use a number of one-way attack drones to try to kind of overwhelm, confused and ultimately overwhelm U.S. air defenses. Obviously didn't work. So, Fred, I think the big question going forward here is going to be at what point does the Biden administration consider the risk to commercial shipping or the risk to its own forces to be so great that they must respond? And, at this point, not sure that threshold has been reached?",

Of course, there has been pushback both on the world stage and here domestically of the images of destruction and devastation in Gaza. And so, what U.S. officials have conveyed over the last several weeks and especially in the last few days, is that the conversation with Israel is about them moving toward that precise, again, low intensity phase of their fighting. Now, when that happens is still a bit unclear. And when Jake Sullivan was taking part in these meetings and in his news conference this week, he said that he didn't have much to share on that front. But he was also making clear what we have heard repeatedly from U.S. officials, which is that Israel has the right to defend itself, that the U.S. can provide guidance, and there can be communication, but they can't necessarily tell them exactly what to do.

Now, President Biden has repeatedly underscored how important it is to get this aid passed, especially for Ukraine. But he is also said that he's willing to compromise on border policy. Now, sources tell me that there are a few buckets here that are part of these talks that includes for example: expelling migrants at the U.S. southern border; raising the credible fear standard for asylum seekers; mandatory detention of migrants; expanding a fast-track deportation procedure to include more undocumented immigrants. And part of the discussion to is a parole authority, which allows migrants to live in the U.S. temporarily on a case-by-case basis. Those are all complicated issues. And so, negotiators are meeting with White House officials over the course of today and into the weekend to try to hammer out more of the details.

Let's break down really the key bullet points of this fairly lengthy proposal that Alex Jones filed in court just yesterday. According to what his attorneys filed in court, Sandy Hook families would settle, as you mentioned, for about at least $5.5 million a year. Over the next decade, the families would also have the possibility of more depending on Jone's income. They would also receive about 70 percent of any money that Jones makes selling personal property outside of the obligations of bank -- in bankruptcy court. And in exchange, families would give up legal claims against Jones, and it was just last month that families actually had a proposal of their own. Instead of that four -- instead of that $5.5 million a year, they were asking for 8.5 million a year plus ownership stake in Jones's company, also a considerable amount of any sort of income that he generates. And if he would meet them in terms of that proposal, then, the family's suggesting that they -- he would be restored full ownership of his company after a decade.

So it set off really a mad scramble in the final days of the Trump presidency in order to try to declassify these documents and redact them of sensitive information. Donald Trump did issue a declassification order on the final full day of his presidency. It didn't lead to this being released, though. That's because Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, he brought a redacted copy of this to the Justice Department just minutes before Joe Biden was set to be inaugurated in order for the Justice Department to do a final privacy review. Meadows, he thought that would take just days. But years later, the Justice Department still has not released all the documents that were redacted.

He was found unconscious in a jacuzzi in his Malibu home in October. And the autopsy report lists drowning as a contributing cause of death. I want to discuss this more with emergency physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen, good to see you. Help explain this kind of therapy when Ketamine is used. How does it work? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: There are two medical purposes for Ketamine. The most common one that we see is for surgeries, for procedures, where Ketamine is used as an anesthetic. Someone who broke their arm and has it in a cast, for example, they might have Ketamine used as an anesthetic for that procedure. Ketamine has also been used recently for the treatment of depression that is very severe and resistant to other types of medication. So, for example, they might have been tried on oral pills and it didn't work and this person really needs treatment still. And Ketamine can be used for those purposes. It is safe in these supervised medical settings, but it has dangers when used on a recreational non-medical basis.",
