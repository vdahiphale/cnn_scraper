And counting on Kamila, Democrats hoping the Vice President can change the narrative and help Joe Biden deliver a big win in November.And after a New York judge barred him from doing business in the state, Donald Trump has a new gig -- sneaker salesman. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, February 19th. Today is President's Day. This morning, the fallout from the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is being felt around the world. An independent Russian human rights group says that 30,000 people have signed a petition for the immediate release of Navalny's body before the government can conduct an autopsy. That same group, it's called OVD Info says more than 360 people have been detained for attending rallies and vigils in Navalny's memory. About a third of those detained have since been released. In the U.S., former President Trump has still not made a statement mentioning Navalny. His campaign pointed to this vague truth social post. It doesn't name Navalny or Vladimir Putin. In contrast to President Biden, President Biden had this to say on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think this is a major blow because of what it says about the state of this war. That this is now that we're seeing that the stalling of U.S. aid really playing out on the frontlines. President Biden himself has attributed the fall of Avdiivka to that. The lack of manpower Russia is able to bring in a lot of men, whereas Ukraine has this aging force on the frontline, and it is struggling to mobilize more Russian air superiority, of course, F-16s there as yet not in play for Ukraine, and Russia is attacking now in other places along the frontline.

Earlier this month, the U.S. launched airstrikes on a Iranian-backed militants in Yemen, Syria and Iraq.Tehran had earlier threatened a military response to any U.S. threats. CNN's Max Foster joins us now live from London. Max, good morning. This comes as the \"Washington Post\" is reporting -- CNN hasn't confirmed it, Iran has been warning its proxies to avoid provoking the U.S., just to kind of to dial -- to dial it back. And we are reporting that these -- you know, these attacks have not been as aggressive lately. I mean, this kind of lines up with the thinking that we've been discussing mornings as we've talked about this particular issue that while Iran, yes, is doing a lot of saber- rattling, they don't actually want to provoke a wider war with the United States. Is that how you read what's going on here? Or do you think it's that, you know, the actual -- and some of these strikes that the U.S. has made have been directly on say, the Houthi capability to go after ships in the Red Sea for example. What do you think is the balance and what's going on here behind the scenes? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the post reporting does ring true because these groups have -- there have been less reported attacks by them. And Iran is the -- is the one body if you like, linking them all. We're always trying to figure out exactly the relationship these groups have with Iran. If you take the -- you know, what a lot of American sources will tell you is that they are proxy groups representing Iran, Iran has a lot of control over them. If you go to the Iranians, they'll tell you, these are independent groups who, yes, Iran backs, supports, trains, but doesn't control them. They're more like alliances. But we've seen this reduction in attacks on U.S. interests. So, that does suggest the Iranians have got involved here. What do you read it? And so, that tells us something about the amount of control they have. They certainly do have some influence, at least. HUNT:  Leverage --",

Perhaps, they've demonstrated what they're capable of by taking out these U.S. forces in Jordan. And that's enough. It's a warning. They don't want a war at this point. So, they've done their job.
