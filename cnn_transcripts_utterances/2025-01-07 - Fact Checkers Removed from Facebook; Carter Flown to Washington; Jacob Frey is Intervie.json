First, we're going to get rid of fact checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the U.S. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the U.S. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it will rely on these user-generated context labels that will be added to posts called \"community notes.\" This is something that Elon Musk has also done on X.And it was announced by Joel Kaplan, who is one of the company's most prominent Republicans.

All of the people come from across the region to share why they felt compelled to pay their respects to the late president.The gates are closed now because we're entering another chapter in the tributes here with President Carter's body moving to Washington, D.C. At 11:00 a.m. there is going to be a departure ceremony here at the Carter Center in the Circle of Flags. That's primarily going to be for Carter Center employees. Then the late president and his family will proceed to Dobbins Air Reserve Base. And from there they will arrive at Joint Base Andrews. From there, they will travel to the U.S. Navy Memorial. Of course, President Carter was in the United States Navy. And then what happens after that will be quite symbolic. What we will see is the horse drawn casket make the very same journey President Carter did during his inaugural parade decades ago, when he got out on foot, notably, and - and walked that route. That's what we're going to see, his casket make that journey from the - the Navy memorial to the United States Capitol. President Carter started a tradition of sorts with subsequent presidents doing that very same thing in their inaugural parades, and having that connection with the American people. Now, tonight, at the Capitol, there is going to be another ceremony before Americans from across the country will have the opportunity to pay their respects as President Carter lies in state, before ultimately the funeral service on Thursday, where he will be eulogized by President Biden, before finally coming back here to Georgia, his final resting place in his small hometown of Plains.",

The deal is an historic federal agreement in response to that murder. It's set in - to enforce reforms within the city's police department under long term court supervision. The consent decree aims to tackle long standing issues of racial discrimination and deadly police misconduct.Joining me now is Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Thank you so much for being here this morning bright and early your time in Minneapolis. I was there for every twist and turn of this case and saw the despair that unfolded in the neighborhood and in the city where all of this happened. I know this hasn't been made public yet, but can you give me at least one concrete example of what the city has agreed to in this consent decree that you think will make a difference to the citizens, particularly the black and brown residents, when it comes to how police treat them. MAYOR JACOB FREY (D), MINNEAPOLIS: Yes. We are the city where George Floyd was murdered. That's part of our history. But the arc of the story is not over yet. And we're also going to be the city that gets this right. We're going to be an example for so many others to follow. And what this consent decree offers, in concrete form, is a structure that we're all going to be working towards. Everybody knows what the goals are. Everybody knows that we've got to be waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, trying to get that necessary reform in place. The fact that it's in a consent decree right now means that it's in permanent fashion. There's 170 some odd pages in this consent decree worth of - of changes and improvements and reforms, many of which - most of which, in fact, are already underway. We haven't been sitting on our hands these last several years. In fact, we've been doing the work to set up an implementation team to establish a 24 hour a day, seven day a week mental health response. That's, by the way, part of the consent decree. And make sure that pieces like supervision are in place so that officers have both the kind of positive mentorship that they need, but also the accountability metrics in place so that we're making the change so that people on the street feel the difference. And that's the end goal here. The end goal is that we want every interaction with the police officer, even ones that are hard and difficult and even dangerous. We want people to feel that they were treated fairly and with justice. And that's the goal we're pushing towards.",

And at the same time, we all recognize that's part of the trajectory here, that we need to do better.And so, what this consent decree allows for is very concrete steps that we're all signing on to. There's no debate. It doesn't change with political winds or new administration taking office at the federal or city level. It means that we're signing up to make the change. And I'll tell you, our officers are committed to this work. Our chief is committed to this work. Our commissioner, our attorneys, we're all committed to getting the job done here. And, you know, what we're telling people is - is we're going to make sure that every hour of every day that we're doing this work is going to be devoted to meeting these standards and - and making these changes. And I do believe that we're on a positive trajectory right now. If you talk to people in Minneapolis, they'll tell you, we're on a positive trajectory. The work is never going to be over. You know, we don't just want to complete the federal consent decree and call it a day. The idea is that - is that it's long lasting and permanent change. And, yes, I am confident we'll meet the mark.",
