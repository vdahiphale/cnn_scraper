I'm Omar Jimenez in New York.Tonight, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending his condolences and calling a deadly attack on a popular concert hall in Moscow, a barbaric act of terrorism. You see that video. Concert goers running for their lives as attackers go on a shooting rampage inside the popular music hall and shopping center Friday night. Now officials say more than 130 people are dead and dozens others injured. ISIS is claiming responsibility for the massacre. CNN's Matthew Chance is live in St. Petersburg before heading to Moscow with the latest. Now Matthew, what more are you learning? And what more are you seeing on the ground there?",

I have only just entered Russia, but I'm coming back to a country after being away for a few days, that is absolutely shocked and horrified at the appalling scenes that we've all been seeing unfolding at that shopping center and concert venue just outside the Russian capital where, you know, so many people have, have lost their lives.All day, people have been laying flowers at that -- at a memorial that's sprung up outside the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of the Russian capital. And you know, there's a sense that, you know, people have been dealing with the Ukraine war and the casualties from that. But, you know, the problem of terrorism, which has been a longstanding on in Russia has sort of drifted to the back burner. People haven't seen an attack like this in the Russian capital or elsewhere in the country fought for years and years. And they thought it had disappeared and now it has come back with a vengeance. In terms of, you know, the latest on the investigation, well you know, the Russian authorities say they've captured 11 people, detained 11 people in connection with this attack, including the four suspected gunmen who carried out those killings with automatic weapons, dressed in military fatigues as horrific video that was shocked by bystanders as they, as they did that. Some of the video on Russian state television is quite grisly. It's shown those suspects being manhandled by Russian investigators. At one of them is shown to be confessing to carrying out the attacks for money is why he said he was motivated to do it. But as you mentioned, it's ISIS, the sort of global jihadi group that says that it organized this and carried it out. It has said that this is part of its sort of normal war as it calls it, against countries who are against Islam. Russia has, of course been, you know, involved in the fight against ISIS in several locations, but particularly in Syria, where it backs the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has been on television nationally here, vowing revenge, but also linking the attacks -- and this is interesting -- linking it not just to ISIS, but to Ukraine as well, saying the attackers, the suspects, were arrested as they made their way towards Ukraine, where he said they believed they were trying to escape. And so, you know, that's something that's very interesting. Throughout something, of course, Ukrainian officials have categorically denied. One senior official telling me tonight that the linkage with Ukraine is trying to be made by the Kremlin potentially to justify more attacks against Ukrainian towns and cities in the future, Omar. [17:04:46] JIMENEZ: Yes. Matthew Chance in St. Petersburg, Russia. Thank you so much. All right. I want to bring in our panel of experts on this. Joining me now is CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, and CNN national security analyst and former deputy director of National Intelligence, Beth Sanders. So John, what are your -- if you're investigating this, here what are you looking for? And could it mean tighter security in other countries, particularly around large events like these?",

Two people in Moscow and its outskirts saying there is an imminent attack, avoid places -- and this was a message to Americans -- but it was a public message.Avoid places, large crowds, concert venues and not much seemed to happen in terms of security. So first thing is heed the intelligence. Second thing is what they're doing, which is they have a number of suspects, those allegedly, directly involved who were on the ground as the shooters, but also people who are supposed to have been part of a support network. They are dumping their phones, looking for computers, any communications with others. Putin has vowed to track them down around the world as long as it takes to make them pay. But there's also as Matthew told us, you know, some spin going on here to associate this not with ISIS where the tactics, techniques, and procedures fit perfectly, but with Ukraine because that's going to be important in the propaganda piece.",

So just three days before this attack, he came out publicly at a board meeting of the FSB, which is their internal intelligence service. And he totally dismissed our warnings and said it was designed to destabilize the Russian public.Whenever you hear Putin say things like that, it's because that's what he would do. And so he's kind of mirror imaging with us, right. He's kind of saying like, well you know, the United States can't be serious about this because why would they help us, right. And it's -- you know, because he can't possibly see the world in any way other than the way he sees it which is really pathetic because here you have lots of Russian, innocent Russians and we have to feel that about these innocent Russians no matter how we feel about Russian in the world war, I think that these kind of condolences really should be heartfelt.",

And there's the spin that comes out of the information that we're learning from these investigations.And for one, Russian state media says that Kremlin thwarted at least four other attacks planned by ISIS earlier for this month. And John, I think when some people see ISIS, you know, they may think of the days back in 2014 when they were among their most prominent as opposed to being able to carry out something of this scale as we understand right now in 2024. So just explain for our viewers what is ISIS-K and why is ISIS in Russia?",

And maybe what the Kremlin may or may not have been considering during that time period. SANDERS: Yes, it kind of reminds us of how long it took for Putin to respond to the Prigozhin mutiny. And I think that because, you know, it's pretty hard to deny that these folks were Islamist and connected to ISIS K because of these Tajik (ph) passports. Putin has tried to shift the blame. And if you look at the FSB, you know, this internal intelligence service that is supposed to be focused on terrorism, there are more terrorism cases in Russia today than there ever were. But almost none of them are about Islamists. They're all about Ukraine and that is because priorities flow down from the top. And Putin, you know, when he spoke in front of that FSB board the other day and he said, this is a joke about Islamist threats. It's all about Ukraine. And so the FSB has dropped the ball here and they're focused on Ukraine and internal dissent. The United States, you know, we still pay attention to ISIS-K.",

And you do see both sides starting to tick through what they say were their most big accomplishments. For the Republicans, it was 2,000 new border patrol agents; 8,000 more detention beds for migrants. Of course, they are very eager to show themselves. It's tough on the border and trying to secure the southern border in the United States. The Democrats saying they got $1 billion for federal childcare and education, including HeadStart. $120 million for cancer research. But what you do see the president saying in a statement today is that the work isn't done and he is setting up the next big funding fight on Capitol Hill, which will be over more funding for Ukraine. And you'll remember Omara, President Biden has asked for $60 billion in a supplemental request. Congress has stalled on that. They have just gone out for a two-week break for Easter, so we don't expect it to happen before then. But you are hearing more and more urgent calls from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who says there is a real risk of Ukraine losing this war if the American support dries up.

But I do think that with Independent voters and with some voters are more iffy it would it would have an impact and it would also, it could also very well run afoul of campaign laws.

But as we saw with Hillary Clinton, money did not translate to votes or enthusiasm. And so while it's important that the Biden campaign has more money and can outspend and outraise and outspend Donald Trump they have to because they're trailing.

I might be around for another two weeks. It's not a very common thing, and we've now in the last month, in the last few weeks seen it happened twice with Republican congressmen Ken Buck and now Mike Gallagher. It's going to leave them with a very slim majority. Actually, neither the two parties once both Ken Buck and Mike Gallagher leave is going to have the 218, magic number. Republicans are going to be one short. And so if I were Seaker Mike Johnson, if I were a chair of a Republican chair of a committee right now, I wouldn't be sleeping too soundly.

It happens to be happening this year, though, because the commissioner of the SEC, one of the larger conferences, where we have eight teams entering this tournament, made this big fuss before the tournament saying that a lot of these smaller schools didn't deserve to be here. They're here, the smaller schools, in large part, because of automatic bids. When they win their own smaller conference, they get into the tournament, even if they're not a national powerhouse. So he said the tournament was wasting these spots on these smaller schools. Well, guess what? Five of the eight schools in his conference didn't even make it past the first round. So this is really a statement from some of the smaller schools -- as you pointed out, Northwestern, not a smaller school. And we're from the Big 10. But they, too, were an underdog.",
