Matt Egan, thanks so much.All right, later today, a federal appeals court will hear arguments on whether to remove the special master who is still reviewing materials the FBI seized during its search of former President Trump's Mar-a- Lago estate. Many of those items classified. Federal Judge Raymond Dearie was appointed special master, you'll remember, in September, tasked with removing privileged material that may have been seized in that search. Elie Honig, CNN Senior Legal Analyst, former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, joins me now. Elie, he's been there for a couple of months now. I mean, what is taking him so long to go through this? Is there an endgame here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, there are thousands of documents that the special master is in the process of going through. This appeal that will be argued today is actually second appeal. There already was one where DOJ basically argued about one, about the classified documents, the 100 or so classified documents that were seized at Mar-a-Lago. DOJ argued successfully that those should not have to go through the special master.Today's appeal relates to all the rest of the documents, about 22,000 remaining. And as you note, though, timing really matters here because this may be a moot issue. By the time the court of appeals hears today's argument and rules on it, the special master may be almost done or nearly done or entirely with his review. But there is a bigger legal point at issue here for DOJ. SCIUTTO:  All right. So now we have a special counsel, Jack Smith, overseeing all the various criminal investigation into Trump, including not just the Mar-a-Lago documents but also interference with the 2020 election. How do they interact? I mean, how do they work together and does that appointment change any of those ongoing investigations?",

And so that is really our first tangible indicator that the special counsel, Jack Smith, is already getting up to speed.Speed matters here. This special counsel has said up and down he's not going to waste any time. And, look, you're taking this sort driver's wheel away from the attorney general. He's handing it over to Jack Smith. We know Merrick Garland tends to move slowly, and we'll see. It looks like Jack Smith understands the need to be expeditious here.",

The court said you are protected as a sitting senator under what we call the speech and debate clause, meaning you do not have to testify about your legislative work. However, the federal court said, your coordination with the Trump campaign, your efforts to reach out to state and local officials in Georgia, none of those count as, quote/unquote, legislative. So, you do have to testify about those things.So, Lindsey Graham will have to go in front of the grand jury. He will have to answer at least many, perhaps most of the questions that he's asked.

Here, the lawful function of government was the counting of the electoral ballots by Congress. And if you look at the evidence here, most powerfully, the defendant's own words, their own encrypted conversations, clearly, they're planning to use force. They talk about amassing firearms and attack tactics. So, we'll see what the jury does.Just keep an eye on this, Jim.

The only real problem we have today is really Pacific Northwest snow, a couple of thunderstorms across parts of Florida.But this is the snow that is going to come down over the next few days, maybe even down toward the passes, which means getting over to the other side of the cascades could be a little bit tricky at times. But this is the biggest thing for the next couple of days. Then all of a sudden things begin to develop in the plains. Temperatures though for Thanksgiving Day nice and mild, 65 in Atlanta, we haven't seen 65 in seems like weeks. Temperatures across parts of the Midwest, 56 in Chicago, we'll take that. But here is where it all kind of goes downhill. Here is Friday morning. Notice the rain across the parts of the southeast. And I know people aren't traveling on Friday but some airports could be slow here. And then you look around I-40 around Amarillo and parts of New Mexico. That is a potential snowstorm out there. Now, the good news is, for the rest of the country, as the storm progresses to the northeast, it doesn't drag the cold air with it. So, because, remember we said 56 in Chicago, it is going to be a rain event for your Saturday and your Sunday rather than a snowstorm coming in across parts of the great lakes. So, here is Sunday morning, a lot of you probably getting on roads, there will be some wet weather across the northeast, the mid-Atlantic, all the way back to Detroit and Chicago, and then you see the snow still across parts of the Pacific Northwest. So, a few airport delays possible on Sunday, but, really, it is more of a driving delay possibly on Sunday. As we start to work our way into the end of the weekend, things begin to push offshore. And if you're not really flying or doing anything until Monday, I think most of this is completely over. So, heavy rain across the south, mountain snow across parts of the northwest, that's where we're seeing things right now.

It is the first World Cup that's being played in a Muslim country, and the Saudis were not expected to do anything. I was on the train up to the stadium this morning and the Saudi fans were saying, oh, we're going to beat Messi and Argentina 5-0. And I just kind of smiled politely because there was no way that that was going to happen, absolutely no way. The Argentineans took an early lead, a very early Messi penalty. They had a few goals disallowed for offside. And after the break, it was a completely different story. And for the Saudis to pull this off, it is just remarkable. They've only ever won a handful of World Cup games in the history of them playing in this tournament. None of their players play outside of Saudi Arabia. So, just think about that. They play in the first and second divisions in Saudi Arabia. They don't have their players playing in the top leagues all over Europe and Major League Soccer in the United States, they just play in Saudi.
