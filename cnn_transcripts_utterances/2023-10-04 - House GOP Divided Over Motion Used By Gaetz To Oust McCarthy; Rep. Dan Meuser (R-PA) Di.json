CNN has exclusive reporting on where the U.S. will transfer millions of Iranian ammunition and weapons and why the Biden administration spent months weighing whether it was even legal. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.Right now, Republican candidates seeking to be the next House Speaker are facing a divided conference. More moderate Republican members are now calling for a change to the powerful tool that Matt Gaetz used to oust Kevin McCarthy. Currently, the rule allows for a single Republican member to offer up a resolution that would remove the speaker. Now a growing chorus of moderates say they don't want that chaos seen on the House floor yesterday to happen again. Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill with CNN's Manu Raju. And Manu, so far two Republicans have officially thrown their names up for consideration, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan. What are they saying about some of the most divisive issues that they'll need to deal with almost right away if they become Speaker?",

An unprecedented removal of a House Speaker by his own colleagues after Kevin McCarthy lost his job after seeing eight Republicans break ranks, vote with Democrats to push him out of office.Now those members, Jim Jordan who chairs the House Judiciary Committee and also Kevin - and also Steve Scalise who's now the number two Republican in the conference contending that they can try to bridge the divide within the conference between one of the more moderate members, the McCarthy allies and some of those far-right members. But that is much easier said than done. Because you mentioned it, there are a whole wide range of issues that divide them. One is how to deal with that so-called issue of a motion to vacate, pushing out a speaker. A single person can do it under the current rules as Matt Gaetz did. Those hardliners want to preserve that. More moderate members want that gone. Mitch McConnell lent his support, the Senate Republican leader, to the moderate GOP effort. We'll see where that ends up. Those candidates are still not saying what they will do. And then there's policy issues like the issue of Ukraine. Such a central issue right now being pushed hard by Senate GOP leaders and by the White House. But something that has divided House Republicans. Kevin McCarthy, when he was speaker, put the brakes on more Ukraine aid. But what will the next House Speaker do? Such a key question. I put that to Jim Jordan earlier today. And he made clear that he is not in favor of a new aid package for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is flirting with a possible bid for speaker as well. Also taking a more measured approach on how he would deal with Ukraine. Saying he needs to review it first before going ahead.But Jordan's comments there, undoubtedly, already I'm hearing concerns in the hallways from members, people who support Ukraine aid, worried that if he becomes speaker, then perhaps that could cut off all the billions of dollars that are going to Ukraine. Jordan didn't go as far as saying he would never allow any dollar to go to Ukraine. But his comments there certainly are a warning sign about how this issue could be dealt with under Jordan's speakership. But Boris, there's a long way to go before any of these men could be elected speaker at the moment. They have to get nominated by their conference next week on a majority vote. Then, a majority of the full House, 218 members, need to vote to elect the Speaker. Meaning, any five Republicans break ranks, that could be enough to undercut their bid on the House floor, as we saw with Kevin McCarthy back in January.

And I'm wondering what you think about that. Do you support that as well? Do you think that there could be enough votes for that to actually happen? REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Well, the only way you really kick somebody out is if they're doing actions that are unbecoming of a member of Congress. There are ethics issues as well that Matt Gaetz is facing, but I don't think any of that grounds for terminating his tenure here. His district will deal with that. That's who votes for people. That's who sends them here. So I don't think that's the case. I do think he was dead wrong. I do think they weaponized - I do believe they weaponized the use of the vacate the chair because vacate the chair has been in existence for a long time. Nancy Pelosi is the one that removed it.

We need a strong conservative budget that is not just conservative in the interest of the American people. We've got to bring some fiscal sanity.Frankly, we got to deal with the border and I believe actually we need to bring impeachment proceedings on Secretary Mayorkas, not for - not to weaponize impeachment, which I can't stand, but it's because he is derelict in his duties of enforcing the law - our immigration laws and it doesn't seem to be any correction in the near future.

I think they had this vendetta from the very beginning, looking for an opportunity. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker, did a six week CR, so they thought it was a good time to gang up and - eight of them - that's not much of a gang, and remove him.So it shouldn't be weaponized. It should be taken very seriously. And if we can remove it, fine, maybe have a majority to allow a vacate the chair, but it shouldn't be weaponized. It's existed before.

[15:15:05] They knew where the media would be and they seized the opportunity. Another big reason, though, is that this is a trial that personally means a lot to Donald Trump. It's going after his business, his empire, something he ran on in 2016, in 2020 and now again on the campaign trail in 2024. And he wanted to be there for this. He wants to attend and to defend himself and I think that's part of the reason why you're continuing to hear him say that he wants to testify as a witness.

And even though his rhetoric doesn't face a lot of consequences for that on the trail, he is facing those consequences in the legal sense. And I do think you're going to continue to see this play out in other cases as well.
