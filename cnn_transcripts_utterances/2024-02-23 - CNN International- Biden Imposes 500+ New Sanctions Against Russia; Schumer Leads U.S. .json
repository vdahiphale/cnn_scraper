      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, whatwe've got is a meeting, even existence of risk to the holding of which only become apparent really over the last course of -- last 24 hours. It took so many different moving pieces to fall into place that this could happen at all. Gathered in Paris now, not only Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, but his Israeli, from Mossad, counterpart, but also Qatari, Egyptian, all assembled here, these intelligence heads to try and hammer out what possibility there might be for a deal, not a ceasefire. Israel's position remains the same that this is a long-term war against Hamas. But, a pause, that would allow for at least some of the hostages are to be taken out of Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But, this meeting comes even as Israel has, of course, announced finally its long-term plan, what it envisions for a post-war Gaza, and that, of course, includes many things that will already appear difficult, not just for allies, but also for Palestinians. In fact, we've already had response for the Palestinian Authority about this plan, the creation of a buffer zone to the south, the creation of a buffer zone all around the Gaza Strip, which essentially, first of all, makes the strip smaller than it was, but also for a number of other reasons, is likely to prove problematic, not least, Rahel, because essentially, the fact of insisting on local stakeholders to run Gaza, those that had no link to Hamas, for instance, the plan appears to preclude the possibility of the Palestinian Authority taking control politically of the Gaza Strip after the war. And this is at odds not least with the American position on the matter. So, many things remain extremely uncertain. But, the fact that these very many intelligence had been able to gather a tool around the possibility of a plan is, I think, some progress and a dependent, not least on the fact that Israel receive from Cairo in the sense of those talks that were going on with a political head of Hamas, some sense that enough progress had been made. So, the meeting is underway. But, for the time being, very little coming out of it for now, Rahel, about what progress might have been made.",

Thank you, Melissa.I want to go back now to those new sanctions on Russia. David Sanger with me again from Berlin. David, good to have you. I'm glad your shot is back. It's important conversation this morning. I was asking, after having a few hours to digest the sanctions, what your reaction is and how effective you think this round of sanctions maybe. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Rahel, apologies for the bad connection before. The most remarkable thing about these sanctions is they found something in Russia to sanction that they haven't sanctioned already. It's very much like the China problem or the Iran problem, which is, you do so many sanctions. You begin to get diminishing returns. The unimpressive part about it is that so far the United States has not found its way to cut into the two things that would hurt Russia the most. One of those would be seizing and turning over the Ukrainians the $300 billion in Russian assets that were left in the West before the invasion. For two years, they've been trying to come up with legal ways to go seize those. And today, we heard the Treasury Department say they're still working on that problem. The second would be to find a way to cut the Russian oil revenues. It is interesting that revenues right now for Russia are above slightly above what they were before the invasion, which tells you we've done nothing to really hurt them on the largest source of their income.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I don't want to pretend to anticipate what he was about to say. But, look, yes, they have made life more difficult for Russians. And I think one of the hopes was that that would encourage people to sort of rise up against Putin or at least to voice their opposition a bit more. But, as David was mentioning there, it's incredibly difficult in an environment where there is zero tolerance for dissent in Russia to do that. I mean, people, if they protest against the government, can lose a lot. They can go to prison. They can lose their children. They can be taken away, things like that. And so, it's a very hard environment in which to expect people to come out and publicly protest.I think the other thing that sanctions have done is increased the cost for Russia of doing business. I mean, they have to go through third parties. They have to go through middlemen. That sort of eats into the sort of profits that they make generally. And so, I suppose from the sanction imposer point of view, that's a positive, but the big problem with sanctions, which is what we've seeing from the outset, and Russia, remember, is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world with more than 16,000 individual sanctions imposed against it by the United States, by the European Union and others, is that it doesn't seem to have an impact on Russian policy. Two years on, the full scale invasion of Ukraine, what Russia calls it special military operation, is still underway and shows no sign of being diverted, and the crackdown on opposition figures in the country. We've seen this with the death of Alexei Navalny, the most prominent critic in the country recently. That continues as well, despite the fact that the sanctions regime has been ratcheted up time and again. And so, to answer your question to David, yeah, I think there is there is a symbolism to this. But, I mean, the whole point of sanctions is that they are action that you can take as a country or as an organization that stopped short of head-on military confrontation. And so, in that sense, they're valuable.",

They say that they're not going to have an impact on Russia and they're going to find a way around them. And in fact, they have found ways around many of the sanctions that have been put in place. They also say that they're going to respond. They've actually responded to the EU sanctions, not to the American sanctions today. And to the EU sanctions, the Russian Foreign Minister has said, look, we're going to respond proportionately to the fact that these European Union sanctions another round have been imposed.And so, yeah. I mean, that's what's likely to be the responses time when it comes to an eventual reaction by the Kremlin to the American measures.",

I'm wondering, we just heard from U.S. President Joe Biden, truly within the last 10 minutes or so, and some of the things he said is, we, meaning the U.S., can't walk away now. Putin is betting we walk away. History is watching. The clock is ticking. And I'm wondering, from your perspective, if Ukrainians feel in this moment perhaps forgotten at all. Are they concerned that they may be forgotten?",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Intuitive Machines has just made history as the first private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. Its Odysseus lunar lander is standing up right, according to the company, and is successfully transmitting data, although we're still waiting for those first few pictures. Now, this was really a tense, final few moments for this mission. Just a few hours before landing, Intuitive Machines announced that there was an issue with Odysseus's navigation system. It wasn't working. But, in a spectacular example of a public-private partnership, it just so happened that one of Odysseus's or Intuitive Machines' paying customers, NASA, had an experimental piece of equipment that did the exact same thing as this broken piece of navigation software. And so, engineers on Earth were able to patch up a fix and allow Odysseus to safely navigate that treacherous terrain on the south pole of the moon, dodging craters and boulders to find a safe space to land. And so, that is what happened. It took a little bit longer than the company thought to communicate with the spacecraft. But, it is sending back data now. And this is now the first time that any American spacecraft has landed on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So, it's a win for NASA as a sponsor of this mission, but certainly a win for this Texas-based company Intuitive Machines. They were able to do for about $100 million what NASA was able to do with the Apollo program with a much larger budget. So, some big tears from that mission control room when the landing happened. And now, we get to see what Odysseus can do on the surface of the moon for the next week or so. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
