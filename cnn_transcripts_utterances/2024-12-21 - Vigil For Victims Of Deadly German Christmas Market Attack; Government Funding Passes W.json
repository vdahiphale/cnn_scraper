I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And tonight a vigil was held in the German city of Magdeburg, near the site of a deadly attack on a crowded Christmas market. Five people were killed when that car plowed through the crowd Friday night. One of the victims, a nine-year-old. More than 200 others were hurt, including 40 with critical injuries. Officials say the suspect is a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia, who's lived in Germany since 2006 and has a history of making anti- Islam statements. CNN's Matthew Chance is at the scene of that attack. Matthew, what is the scene like tonight?",

But what's so unexpected is the profile of the alleged attacker, not an Islamist, but anti-Islam. Not a recent immigrant to Germany, but settled here for nearly 20 years. Part of the community, a doctor in a nearby clinic. Very few, if any, saw that coming. Now dramatic video has emerged of the suspect's arrest at the scene of the market attack. A U.S. activist group has now identified him as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old originally from Saudi Arabia who once described himself as history's most aggressive critic of Islam, particularly opposed to the Saudi regime. On social media, Abdulmohsen has repeatedly expressed support for the German far right AFD party, also claiming Germany wants to Islamize Europe. And now this horrific attack, allegedly committed by a self-confessed Islamophobe fueling Germany's growing anti-immigration mood. \"Our politicians are responsible for this,\" One local, Barbara, told me. \"I think there should be a clean-up of people who do these things,\" she says. \"Now is time to close our borders,\" says this man, Tom.

An attack like this might well help them get more of a share of government. Could they win? If they would make a major win at the coming elections, it spells a difference in everything from immigration to Germany's Ukraine policy. And it's a really disturbing fallout -- potential fallout from this awful attack. But at this point, you know, if you are in Germany wondering what to make of it, this attacker, he said that he was pro AFD. He was against the Saudi government. He was against Islam. It's going to raise a lot of questions that make it hard to cast him as the typical ISIS-style attacker. It's going to leave people in Germany wondering exactly what spurred him on to do this.",

I'm not suggesting that an ISIS attacker has a good reason either tokill innocent civilians. But at least, you know, in the case of the Berlin market attack in 2016, it was clearly inspired by ISIS and endorsed by ISIS. But just think about some attacks on our own country. It's still not really clear what the motivations were for Thomas Crooks, who tried to assassinate president Donald Trump. Was it an attempt for notoriety or what? We still don't really know the motivations of the largest mass murder carried out by a shooter in Las Vegas, who attacked a group of people attending a concert. And so, you know, we may never know the exact motivations of this guy, except that he probably was having some kind of life crisis. He seems to be shopping for grievances. And most of us have grievances, but we tend to grieve them away. Somebody like the alleged assaulter here is somebody who clearly was not able to get over those grievances and came up with a plan of attack and probably rehearsed it as many attackers do, or scoped out the Christmas market before he did it. And clearly, this was, you know, what the FBI called the pathway to violence. And he went all the way down it.",

The main question that still remained after the police gave a press conference today was how did the doctor manage to access the emergency route into the market, because this market did have concrete barriers called bollards all around, to stop someone from driving in.But there was one area kept clear specifically for emergency vehicles, and German officials haven't figured out. Was there no one on duty there? Or did this guy flash his medical credentials? He was driving normally as he started turning in there. He only picked up speed apparently after he was inside and it was too late to stop him. Just one of the many questions that Germans are left with tonight. But you can guarantee, you know, he was not born in Germany. So I think it's going to fuel those anti-immigrant movements that already exist there and spell a very uncertain future for German politics in the coming years. DEAN: Certainly. And Peter, you have to wonder in these sorts of situations, is there a concern for the possibility of copycat attacks? We know NYPD is beefing up its own security around these kinds of markets here in New York, but just that's something we see a lot of in Europe, for sure.

Democrats stood up and opposed that, and we were able to defeat it. And so in the end, finally, what passed was a stripped-down bill.

We have seen gusts as high as 40. So that's strong enough to -- to ground the planes for just a little while. As we go into Sunday, though, we do see a very tranquil pattern set up briefly, and the emphasis there is briefly, because as we get into Sunday, another quick moving clipper system moves across and that will impact your road travel for sure up there. Now, on the first full day of winter, we have winter coming in with a bang. We're going to see very cold temperatures here across the eastern two-thirds of the country. We're talking wind chills in the single digits in some areas and struggling to get back up to normal during the afternoon. New York City, I believe it's going to take almost until next weekend for you to get back above average. And Jessica, I'll end with this. Tomorrow, going into Monday, overall for air delays looks fairly calm. However, do notice that we have a series of weather makers impacting the west here. So anywhere from northern California up into the Pacific northwest, you could run into some air delays there.",

Now, what the union says is that more stores could join if they don't have a deal by Christmas Eve. And what they're saying is that they're not happy with what Starbucks is putting forward. So they're asking for more negotiations for people to come to the table and also for just better working conditions. Take a listen to what one of the baristas here told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
