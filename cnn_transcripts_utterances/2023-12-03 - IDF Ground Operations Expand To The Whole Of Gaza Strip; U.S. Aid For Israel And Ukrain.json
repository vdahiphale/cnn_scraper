      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. And thanks so much for joining me. I'm Jessica Dean in for Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin in the Middle East. The Israeli military saying it is expanding its ground operations across the whole Gaza Strip. This, as the Israel Defense Forces ordered people today living in southern Gaza to evacuate to areas even farther south. The IDF now says it's destroyed at least 500 Hamas tunnel shafts since entering the enclave. Fighting also heating up on Israel's border today with Lebanon. Iran- backed paramilitary group Hezbollah says it targeted several sites in northern Israel. The IDF says several soldiers were injured by an anti-tank missile. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Israel's forces will not stop in Gaza until Hamas is eradicated. Hamas saying, though, there will be no negotiations for the remaining hostages still being held in Gaza, including women and children, until Israel agrees to a cease-fire. CNN has teams around the region monitoring all these latest developments for you. And we want to start with CNN's Matthew Chance who's in Tel Aviv. Matthew, what more are you learning about the Israeli military's movement there in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, Israel has really been stepping up its military pressure inside Gaza. It says it's trying to destroy Hamas and trying to kind of make sure that the 130 or more hostages that are still being kept inside Gaza are eventually released. It thinks the best way of doing that is through the application of military pressure.And so we have seen them repeatedly strike areas of the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north of the Gaza Strip, and there were more dramatic images today of an Israeli strike or its aftermath on the Jabalya refugee camp, which was also hit yesterday, causing dozens of casualties, according to the Hamas controlled Palestinian Health Ministry. And so there's been more fighting around that area as well. But what's significant is that Israel is now shifting some of its military focus to the south of the Gaza Strip, as well. And that's where hundreds of thousands of people over the course of the past few weeks have evacuated to avoid the intensity of the military operations in the north. And so this is renewed concern about what happens to them, about whether there are going to be even more civilian casualties in the days and in the weeks ahead as this operation continues. As a way of sort of mitigating against that, against more casualties, more civilian casualties, Israel has issued maps, dividing the Gaza Strip up into what it calls evacuation sectors, each with a number, and then sort of ordering Palestinians in that sector to evacuate ahead of any military action. It's not clear how effective that is because there's not quite a deal of internet or communication on the ground in Gaza at the moment because of the war. And so it's not clear how many people that message is getting through to. But nevertheless, it's a concern, Israel says it's acting on that concern. But it's also said that it is going to pursue Hamas as strongly in the south as it did in the north, as well. And so there's no sign here of Israel easing up or backing down.",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, I think what we're seeing is that various Iranian backed armed groups that show sympathy for Hamas and anger and antipathy towards Israel, are demonstrating that even far from the main area of combat right now, in Gaza, that they can inflict harm and they can hurt the Israelis. So you've got the Yemeni forces, the Houthis, that are backed by Iran, and they have for weeks now harassed shipping that they say is linked to Israel, moving to the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden.Most recently, there was an incident where the Houthis, they claimed responsibility for firing a naval missile and a drone they say at cargo ships, the Unity Explorer and Number 9. Meanwhile a U.S. Defense official saying that the USS Cony, a U.S. Navy destroyer, it answered the distress call from this Unity Explorer, and that it was able to help out and I believe intercepted a drone that was fired in that direction. There have been previous incidents just in the past couple of days. Last month, there was a hijacking of the Galaxy Leader cargo ship. I believe it's still in Yemeni custody. And just a couple of days ago, the USS Mason, another U.S. Navy destroyer, it actually captured five people who tried to hijack a ship called the Central Park. That was a tanker ship, a commercial tanker ship. And then there were two ballistic missiles fired in the direction of that U.S. Navy destroyer. So all of this is kind of laying out that on a vital shipping lane, armed forces supporting Hamas, backed by Iran, are trying to harass shipping and the U.S. Navy has been trying to support and protect that shipping. That is kind of a frontline, a maritime frontline, very far away from the raging conflict in Gaza right now -- Jessica.",

And so if you're saying maybe I can package Ukraine and border funding but even conservatives in his conference are pushing back against that, saying that we want anything -- you know, we want border stuff signed into law.

After the NYPD arrived on scene at that home in Queens, that's when police say they were encountered by the suspect now identified as 38- year-old Courtney Gordon with a knife, as you point, attacks these officers. That's when police then shot and killed this 38-year-old from the Bronx. Shortly thereafter they identified an 11-year-old little girl at the scene who had been killed, and the house was on fire. So they had to wait for the fire department to extinguish the flames before investigators went into that home where that 911 call originated.

Here's CNN's Anna Coren. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As a harsh winter begins to set in, Ukraine's war is becoming more difficult, painful and exhausting, as this conflict grinds towards the end of its second year. A stalemate is how this General Zaluzhnyi, Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, labelled the war, making international headlines, while upsetting President Zelenskyy, who projects a far more upbeat assessment. But in a rare interview, his Zaluzhnyi's senior adviser, General Nazarov, tells me his boss stands by those controversial comments.

VIKTOR NAZAROV, SENIOR ADVISER TO COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES: Yes, I agree with you. It was kind -- some kind of message and some kind of alarm signal to -- for western politicians and for western society. But we are ready to fight this -- our enemy. But we need help. We need support. COREN (voice-over): Equipment is what Ukraine desperately needs. Artillery pieces, ammunition, long-range missile systems, specifically attack drones, electronic warfare and air-defense systems. Last weekend, Kyiv experienced how vital those air-defense systems are at protecting the population. When Russia launched what local officials called and unprecedented number of attack drones on the capital. The general fears, if Ukraine doesn't receive advanced weaponry, his country faces a very difficult 2024.

      "sentences": "These tiny anthrobots were created in a lab, but the hope is that they, one day, might have a medical purpose.In the future, they might be able to heal wounds or repair damaged tissue. And to make the bots, the researchers took adult cells from the airways of donors, and they created the right conditions in the lab to encourage these cells to grow and to self-assemble into these so-called anthrobots. And the researchers observed the bots moving around, using these hair- like productions called cilia. But the major finding here is that when the researchers had the bots encounter a human neuron that had a small scratch on it, they saw the bots work to repair that scratch. And that's why the researchers think the bots could be used in the future for healing. You know, one advantage with using the bots in medicine is that they would be made from a patient's own cells. So, that reduces the risk of the body seeing the bots as something foreign and rejecting them. Of course, much more research is needed, before you may see these anthrobots being used in hospitals or doctors' offices. But, for now, this is fascinating science to watch unfold.",

A.I. does boring jobs. You know, working in a factory. Writing a news story. OK. But then, what do we do? And also, fundamental to it all, who controls it? You know, all A.I. could be fantastic.
