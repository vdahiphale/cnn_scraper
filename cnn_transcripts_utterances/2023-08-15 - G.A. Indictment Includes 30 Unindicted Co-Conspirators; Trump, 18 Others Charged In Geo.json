While Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a pretty narrow indictment focused solely on former President Trump, here District Attorney Fani Willis is pursuing this as a RICO case. She is alleging a vast conspiracy by this group, these 19 defendants, to try to overturn the results of the election here in Georgia. And to support this, she has offered up a nearly 100 page indictment that details 161 acts that were part of this conspiracy across these 19 defendants, there were also 30 unindicted conspirators. And these allegations span seven states and the District of Columbia.While this is -- the fourth criminal indictment Trump faces this year, this is by far the most sweeping. Now, RICO cases are notoriously challenging, they tend to get drawn out. And when you have 19 defendants and their attorneys, it's easy to see how things could get drawn out for months, even years. But the district attorney has said, Jake, she wants to try everyone together, and she's hoping, she says, to ask for a trial in the next six months.",

Typically, that surrender is done to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office. And as part of that, there's usually a mugshot and fingerprints. But given the former president's status, his secret service protection, it is likely that they may negotiate something a little bit different for him.

So she did that investigation, and she's led by the evidence to bring the charges that she's brought. And I'm reminded of, you know, many times when I sat in her office, we had cases together, and this is, you know, 10 years ago, eight years ago, nine years ago, these are cases that nobody was going to know the victim, nobody much in the victim's life thought they mattered. But Fani impressed upon me and everybody else that worked with her that they did matter and that the defendants mattered.

It was on that tour that he ran and crossed into North Korea and was then presumably taken into custody by North Korean soldiers who were there. In addition, North Korean state media goes on to say that one of the reasons he decided to run into North Korea, was that he, quote, harbored ill feeling against inhuman, maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. army. That again, according to North Korean state media. And now according to state media there he was expressing his, quote, willingness to seek refuge in North Korea or in a third country.
