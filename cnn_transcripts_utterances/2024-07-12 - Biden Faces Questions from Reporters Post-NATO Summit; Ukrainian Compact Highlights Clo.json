Good morning, Leslie. I mean, we're going to talk -- we are going to talk about policy because obviously it was a NATO summit. This is about international security. But it has unfortunately been hijacked by everyone's obsession with how fit President Biden is to serve. I mean, it was a very -- we've mentioned it was a very long press conference. But there are two key parts that stick out. And that's when he misnamed two key people. How concerned should we be about that? LESLIE VINJAMURI, U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, we've seen that President Biden, for a very long time, has frequently misnamed leaders or individuals or stumbled on words. But again, if you go to the content of that press conference, which, as you say, was long, it was very deep, it was very rich on foreign policy, not only his initial remarks, which, you know, really remarkably, drew the story of America's leadership after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, talked about the United States as an indispensable nation, talked about the significance of NATO, reminded the Americans that the only time the Article Five had ever been invoked was after the 9/11 terror attacks to protect the United States. [03:10:08] So he fielded numerous questions with very rich and great depth. So you know, this is a president really, when it comes to foreign policy at his best, but of course, at some level, the telling comment was when he said, you know, no matter what I do, it's not going to be enough. And we've seen the polling 67 percent of Americans would like to see President Biden step down from that nomination, not run again. So many people in his own party, the polling on the swing states not looking good. And so despite the depth that the press conference really read as a president who's done a remarkable job, not a perfect job, but a remarkable job over many decades in the Senate, in the presidency and foreign policy, prices coming down, jobs growing, unemployment at its lowest in decades. But a president that doesn't appear to have the energy and the vigor, and that still appears to be slowing down and an uproar that feels like it will be very, very difficult to quell, regardless of how strong a single press conference is.",

Because everyone wants to ask them. I mean, you know, the British Prime Minister was the first questions he received were about, how was President Biden?

You know, let's be clear, as we all know, those leaders met, and they had very rigorous and serious discussions. It's when it comes to the public, that that just simply is disintegrating. And that matters unfortunately, in an election year, with only, you know, a handful of months to go, it matters a huge amount. It does make it very difficult for international leaders, and NATO allies have been concerned for a very long time about this election, about the looming threat of Donald Trump.Even before the considerations of President Biden's health became so prominent. There's been deep fear in Europe, endless talk about Trump proofing NATO of Europeans doing more on European security. And that was a focus in this meeting of the NATO leaders. But you're right, it's very difficult to communicate this to the public to have any broader influence, because every single news article, every single question, every single comment is about President Biden's health. And, you know, despite again, a very strong press conference deep on the issues, there is just a real concern about, you know, can the President win? The polling doesn't look good. Can he govern if he does win for four more years? But right now, you know, the short term, the urgent question for leaders around the world, for people around the world, especially in Europe, and especially for Americans, of course, is whether he can actually beat Donald Trump. And that, I think, is a grave concern. It's very sad, you know, for Americans, for people around the world to listen to a president talk about that -- he wants to stay in the race because of the gravity of the situation that he faces. He talked about the need to get legislation through. But in my mind, the saddest part was when he spoke about gun violence in the United States and kids getting killed by guns. And he sort of had that moment. He said that we are the United States of America. And I think we were all taken back to our childhood when, you know, this didn't happen in America. And unfortunately, it sort of framed President Biden as a man who governed, who's led the country in various roles in an era that no longer exists.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he remains committed to a deal. But the Hamas is making demands that contradict the plan.CNN's Scott McLean following developments for us from Istanbul in Turkey. I mean, you've been here many times before, Scott, does it feel different? [03:20:03] SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Yeah, I think whatever optimism there was maybe a week ago has been pretty well diminished. I don't think that anybody is expecting a huge breakthrough here. As you mentioned, two sources have told our colleague Alex Marquardt that there has been some progress made in Doha, but there are still pretty tough issues to resolve and still a long way to go. The Israeli prime minister's office said that Benjamin Netanyahu met with the negotiators yesterday in Israel and then sent them on their way to Cairo. So if there's any good news, it's that the talks are at least continuing there. And you mentioned that speech that Netanyahu gave where he said that, look, he is committed to getting a deal to get the hostages back. But he said that it is Hamas that keeps making demands that contradict the plans that are the plan that's on the table already. And he went back to this point that he has made many times before over the last several months, and that is that it is military pressure and staying firm on the red lines that Israel has already set that made it possible to get a ceasefire deal back in November. And he thinks that the same approach will help this time around. In truth, it is not entirely clear what the sticking points are, how far the parties are apart. But you remember a diplomatic source told CNN that what was unclear is that the Israeli position, because Hamas had said over the weekend that it was willing to forego one of its main demands that any ceasefire deal that's agreed to be a permanent one. And then the very next day, you had Prime Minister Netanyahu seeming to move the goalposts with new demands about Israeli troops preventing the movement of Hamas fighters from south to north and maintaining control over Gaza's border with Egypt, and also continuing to insist that Israel go back to war, be able to go back to war even after a ceasefire, something that Israeli opposition called provocative. Now, you played that clip from President Biden. He was obviously asked about this. His answer was pretty meandering. It covered a lot of different territory and one or two parts. It was a little bit difficult to follow. But he repeated his point that he's made many times that the two-state solution is the only solution. And you also heard him there talking about the plan for post-war Gaza, at least his plan, which is sort of this guarantorship system, for lack of a better term, that would essentially get Arab states on board to keep everyone in line in Gaza to allow Israeli troops to withdraw. Obviously, getting Israel to agree to that, though, is going to be a difficult one. And when it comes to negotiations, the president said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question, did it change any minds among anxious Democrats nervous about his decision to run for reelection? Talking to Democrats after the president's news conference, it is unclear that it did. But one thing was notable. The president spoke with far less defiance and combativeness about his decision to stay in. He said he needed to work to allay the concerns of Democratic voters. And he even said that he was open to his delegates supporting someone else should they choose to do that. But he said again and again, he wants to finish the job. He said he is not worried about his legacy, but he wants to continue working on the accomplishments of his first term. But did this change any minds? There is reason to believe, at least in the early hours after the news conference, that it may not have. We're also learning that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama are playing a role behind the scenes in the future of this Democratic presidential campaign. We have learned that Obama and Pelosi have had conversations this week about where to take the party. Of course, many Democrats are asking them to step in to try and send some type of a signal to the White House. These Democrats, of course, are the ones that would like to see the president step aside. But the president, for his part, has many supporters as well, the Congressional Black Caucus, labor unions and other key pieces of his coalition. So as we end this historic week in Washington, the central question remains the same. Will President Biden keep running for the presidency now less than four months from Election Day? He says he will. But all eyes certainly on the White House today now that the NATO summit is over. Nancy Pelosi, of course, said she wishes everyone would wait until that time.

Now there have been reports that she may have been in a romantic relationship with him, that has been reported by U.K. outlets as well as the BBC which has of course expressed its condolences for its colleague John Hunt but she also shared some posts on social media quite recently reposting something on X, formerly known as Twitter, praising women who leave toxic relationships. One of those posts saying, I admire women who leave. Now Hertfordshire police have not commented or have declined to comment rather on the possible personal relationship between the two but they have said previously that there may have been a personal relationship, that they may have been known to each other. So that will certainly be a line of inquiry as this investigation continues but again that questioning process is yet to have taken place as far as we are aware. Kyle Clifford is still in hospital but as you can imagine those condolences are still coming in.",

The cathedral which is an important example of French medieval architecture currently undergoing restoration work. Firefighters put out the blaze. The damage is now being assessed. It was five years ago that a massive fire broke out in the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris you might remember.A new study highlights the outsized role behavior and lifestyle can play in developing cancer. The study shows that close to half of cancer deaths in the U.S. could be attributed to preventable risk factors. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well this new study from the American Cancer Society looks at cancer cases and deaths among adults age 30 and older and it estimates that 40 percent of cancer cases and 44 percent of cancer deaths could potentially be preventable. They say they're attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors.Now what are those risk factors? Well the leading one probably won't surprise anybody. It's cigarette smoking. They estimate that that contributed to 19 percent of cancer cases and 29 percent of cancer deaths in this study. The next is excess body weight followed by alcohol consumption. Also a big risk factor up there is exposure to U.V. radiation. The risk for skin cancer of course. They also looked at people's diets not eating enough fruits and vegetables or eating a lot of red meat or processed meat as well as cancer causing viruses. Now they found that the cancers that were most linked to these potentially modifiable behaviors, the top one is lung cancer that connection to smoking. The second is female breast cancer. There are links there both to excess body weight and to alcohol consumption. Skin melanoma of course from sun exposure and colorectal cancer. Now the researchers told us that there's actually some good news here which is that folks think maybe it takes a long time to reverse your risk for these kinds of cancers. But actually changing behaviors they say can start to reduce risk pretty quickly. So on a personal basis it's the things we hear about all the time. Don't smoke, maintain a healthy body weight, cut back or stop drinking alcohol, exercise and of course use sun protection. But the researchers here also focused on the importance of things happening from a societal level policy changes that can make it easier for people to live healthier lives. For smoking for example they said the thing that's been the most effective in reducing smoking rates is making it more expensive through excise taxes. They point out that a pack of cigarettes in Missouri costs about half as much as a pack of cigarettes in New York state. And if you look at cancer rates for those two states they are dramatically higher in Missouri than they are in New York for lung cancer. And so the takeaway here is there are things we can do to try to reduce our risks but there are also things that need to be done on a bigger societal level to try to make things healthier for everybody.
