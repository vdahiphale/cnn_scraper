President Biden, though, surprised many Democratic lawmakers when he said he would not veto that GOP-led legislation if it passes in the Senate.

That is a label that Democrats, as we know, do not want to see attached with them, do not want to see attached with President Biden. Walk us through what is happening here, Manu.",

Remember this is being pushed by Republicans, first approved the Republican-led house to overturn D.C.'s new crime law that the Republicans characterized as soft on crime.When that passed the House last month, 173 Democrats voted against it. At that point, the White House put out a statement of administration policy saying that the president had concerns with the Republican-led effort. Saying that D.C. should make its own laws, coming at a time of Democrats pushing for statehood from D.C. But the White House did not explicitly say that the president would sign it or veto it. But it wasn't until last week when President Biden came up to Capitol Hill, met with Senate Democrats and at that time keep (ph) to inform them that he did not plan to veto the Republican-led effort, essentially allowing it to take effect and to rescind the D.C. law. Now, over the weekend, Hakeem Jeffries, a top democratic leader sidestepped questions when asked about President Biden's handling of this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) MINORITY LEADER:  Depending on what the Senate does, the president will have to respond one way or another. I have not had an opportunity to talk to the White House yet about the president's view. So, I'm not going to characterize his position, one way or the other, until we've had a chance to talk --",

Some of them telling me they cannot trust the White House, particularly on thorny political issues like this. And as a president, he tries to position himself heading into a potential 2024 re-election bid, but expect us to pass the Senate.But as soon as Wednesday, I'm told there could be upwards of 70 votes, even more, because a number of Democrats now are siding with the president on this issue, particularly the ones in difficult re- election races themselves in 2024.

Like the country is changing and brown and black people are coming into America and you're not going to be safe. This is what, again, this Republican Party is now.
