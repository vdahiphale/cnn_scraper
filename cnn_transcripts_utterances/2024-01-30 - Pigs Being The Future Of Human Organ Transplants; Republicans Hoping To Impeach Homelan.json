DR. MONTGOMERY: These are the sows that we use to do the embryo transfers in. DR. GUPTA: You know, I never expected to feel like I was immersed in a really scientific sort of place in the middle of a pig barn. DR. MONTGOMERY: There's the equivalent of five or six Nobel Prize discoveries. Cloning is one of them. The discovery of CRISPR is another one. Allotransplantation. All Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. We're integrating all of those to make this a reality. (END VIDEO CLIP) DR. GUPTA (on camera): I got to tell you, I mean, it's just an incredible science and really has the potential to change the way we think about transplantation overall, as you heard, maybe even within the next couple of years. I will say, look, there can be ethical challenges here. How much should we interfering with the genomic sequence of an animal? How much should we be relying on animals to try and preserve and protect human health? Big questions. I mean, we couldn't even show you where we were exactly because of security concerns. But I think what we learned is that this is happening, it's happening quickly, and it's poised to make a big difference in terms of how we look at transplant in the future.",

He's not setting that policy and acting unilaterally.I want to highlight one of them. Jonathan Turley, he's a well-known conservative. He's someone who testified multiple times against the impeachment of Former President Donald Trump. Now, he argues that the border is a mess, but he says you don't really have a case. And he adds that there's a danger to this, that this could potentially lower the bar for future Congresses to impeach cabinet secretaries over actions that do not amount to crimes.

Now, they're making a billion dollars a month on illegal human trafficking.I'm concerned about those migrants that are crossing the border, many of which perish. I'm concerned about the minors that are crossing the border unaccompanied. Many of those are being used for forced child labor or, worse, sex trafficking. I'm concerned about all of that. And I'm also concerned that the secretary -- and yes, I do believe that he's following the orders of the president on violating the law for a means or an end, which I still haven't figured out. But look, I've been saying for a long time that this on purpose. This in not by accident. We've had many people come in front of the committee saying, hey, we've told the secretary exactly what he needs to do in order to get this under control, he refuses to do it. And so, I've said this on purpose. So, he's violating the law on purpose. And if it's at the direction of the president, then he's violating the law also.",

There's three things about it that we really like that you posted on the screen there.The twin vertical stabilizers in the back are very clear on the sonar image, and those were very distinctive of Amelia Earhart's aircraft, and we were very happy to see those. The second thing is the aircraft, the target that we got the sonar image of, was on a very flat sandy surface. So, to see anything protruding up or sitting on the sea floor would have been very unusual. And then thirdly, the size of the target was actually fit very closely to what we'd expect from her aircraft. The technology that we used was a HUGIN 6000. There's only a handful of them in the world. And the 6000 means 6,000 meters. So, it can go all the way down to full ocean depth with the 6,000 meters to the bottom of the ocean, and then basically flies like a drone back and forth, scanning the seafloor for anything interesting.",

We need to go and take a look and put a camera basically on the target. We need different equipment, probably an ROV, to go down there with some arms and some pictures that can take a look at the target, take a look at how it's sitting in the soil, in the mud, on the sand, on the sandy bottom of the seafloor. And then confirm this, in fact, her plane. You know, it could be another plane. But what we're going to be looking for those numbers, the NR16020. Once we see that, we can positively identify the plane. And then the next step would be to curate the site. And -- in other words, take a look at what debris is around the plane, how it's sitting on the seafloor, and we can engineer a solution to possibly bring it up.",
