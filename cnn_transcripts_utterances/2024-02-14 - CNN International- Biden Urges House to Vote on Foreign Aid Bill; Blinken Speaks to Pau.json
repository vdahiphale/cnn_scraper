A Ukrainian defense official says its drones sank a prominent Russian warship in the Black Sea. We're told that the drones damaged the large landing vessel beyond repair. And so far, there's been no word on casualties.But this footage posted on Telegram follows an alleged missile as it approaches the warship. Then we see a fiery explosion. Now, CNN can't confirm the claims and there hasn't been a comment from the Kremlin yet, but we'll keep you updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is now out of the hospital and working from home. He was admitted for a bladder issue on Sunday and treated without surgery. So, he's expected to return to the Pentagon later this week. And one person was killed and at least five others injured after a car slammed into the emergency room of a hospital in Austin, Texas. You can see people running to escape as smoke filled the room and tires continued to spin and screech. Police say it was not an intentional act.",

Some of it's for Israel's military, and other funding is for humanitarian assistance in Gaza and the West Bank. The bill still has to pass the House, where it's not clear if Speaker Mike Johnson will even bring it up for a vote. But Zelenskyy is urging U.S. lawmakers to do the right thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I thank each of the 70 senators who voted in the affirmative. Ukraine appreciates it very much. This was the first step. Next step is the House of Representatives and the vote of the congressmen there. We expect a positive decision. We hope for our principled support. And we believe that America will continue to be a leader. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 60 percent of votes counted, shows that he's won almost 60 percent of the vote.Now, in the last hour, there were reports that Prabowo arrived at the presidential palace, and look, if he has, in fact, won more than 50 percent of the vote, he will be Indonesia's next president. Now, Prabowo is a former general who ruled under the Suharto dictatorship. He's accused of human rights abuses, and at one point wasn't allowed to enter the United States or Australia. He's run in the past two elections and lost to President Joko Widodo. And at the time, falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen, or perhaps, you know, third time is a charm. 72-year-old Prabowo has -- had a dramatic image makeover, thanks in part to a slick PR and social media campaign. And look, just as important to this perceived transformation is the endorsement by President Jokowi, whose eldest son, 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Prabowo running mate. Now, Jokowi had a two-term limit and therefore cannot run again. Prabowo's rivals, Anies Baswedan, he was the former governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, the former governor of Central Java. Look, they're both credible candidates, but clearly not as popular. The main issues of this election, the economy, jobs, education, and eradicating corruption. Look, half of Indonesia's voters, they're under the age of 40. So, this is a very young electorate. And conducting this election, as you mentioned before, a colossal and massive task. We have to remember Indonesia is an archipelago made up of 17,000 islands of which 7,000 are inhabited. So, officials had to go on horseback, helicopter, boats, you know, they even had to trek to some of the remote places to deliver ballots. Now, this election was seen as a referendum on the legacy of Jokowi, whose popularity is very much based on the country's solid economic record under his 10-year reign. And Prabowo -- Prabowo, I should say, he has campaigned as a continuity candidate. But some analysts in Indonesia believe that a deal, in fact, has been done between Prabowo and Jokowi that would allow Jokowi to wield influence behind the scenes once his term ends in October.
