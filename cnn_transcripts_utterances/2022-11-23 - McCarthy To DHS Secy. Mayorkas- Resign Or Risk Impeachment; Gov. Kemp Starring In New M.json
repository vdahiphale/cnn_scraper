The Department of Homeland Security brushing aside that threat saying Secretary Mayorkas has no plans to resign and saying, quote, members of Congress should come to the table and work on solutions.Here in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Maeve Reston, Toluse Olorunnipa of The Washington Post, and Heather Caygle of Punchbowl News. Heather, you heard Kevin McCarthy there, he wants to be speaker, he needs votes. It's quite a different tone than what he told you just about a month ago. And when he said this, I think the country wants to heal. If you spent all that time arguing against using impeachment for political purposes, you got to be able to sustain exactly what you said. His point was the Republicans criticized the Democrats for impeaching Trump. They weren't going to do that. I think the country wants to heal, what happened?",

Right now, he's got at least half a dozen Republicans who have come out and said, I'm a hard, no, or I'm leaning against voting for him. And that doesn't mean everyone else will vote for him either on theRepublican side, so he's doing everything you can right now to tack as far right as he can. And woo some of these conservatives who think that he's not going to be hard enough on the Biden administration.",

She tweeted this, we can show you this morning, video of the border visit, saying this should give conservatives a glimpse of the kind of speaker Kevin McCarthy will be and why I'm supporting him.He's demanding Mayorcas resign or face investigations leading to impeachment, more things like this to come.

They do not want to be focused all on investigations focused on, you know, the president's son trying to impeach people.And it's very interesting to see the difference between what Kevin McCarthy said in his language, which is somewhat nuanced. He said, you know, we'll consider impeachment. And, you know, someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who interpreted Kevin McCarthy statement as we will impeach the Department of Homeland Security Secretary. So it's very clear that McCarthy is going to have some difficulty trying to keep these various wings of his party together, because different people are hearing different things.",

I think the irony here, though, is, the argument on the far right with these hardliners is that he is not conservative enough. And McCarthy will do and say anything just to get the votes. They frankly, don't trust him. And so they look at his comments last month, saying I don't want to do impeachment for political purposes. I don't see it before us right now.And then they look at what he did yesterday. And they're like, which McCarthy is this? So I don't know if this really helps him a ton with the far right nor like to lose that.

In terms of the fact that this happened in 2021 and 2022, after launching his bid, potentially after winning the primary, it just shows sort of the lack of vetting that is in this process on the Republican side in the state of Georgia, in part because former President Donald Trump decided to give Herschel Walker his stamp of approval, and he did not need to be vetted as a result, and voters decided to follow Trump's lead.And now there are a number of Republicans in Georgia who are unhappy with the fact that Herschel Walker is their candidate, he was trailing in the original raise an hour at going to a runoff. And it seems like a lot of the steam is running out of his campaign. Now, we don't know what's going to happen in a couple of weeks when voters vote. But this is not the kind of headline you want to try to motivate voters in Georgia to say that you should represent them. There are already a number of Georgians who say Herschel Walker should not be our representative. The fact that he's claiming a tax break in Texas, does not help that at all.",

But I don't think you're going to see many Republicans and independents who didn't vote for Walker the first time who are incentivized to get out there and vote for him this time, right?We have seen Republicans try to counteract that. Brian Kemp is out there with leaflets their mailing with just his photo Walker's not even on them saying please go support Herschel. And he also cut a direct to T.V. ad but you know, only time will tell, I think. But that's an interesting point, though, about what his camp thinking here in the sense that he campaigned with Walker over the weekend. It did not campaign at all with him before the general election in November. He campaigned with him over the weekend. You mentioned the leaflets. He's kind of deal with Mitch McConnell to turn over essentially his voter file as turnout operation. And the ad you mentioned right here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

You lose a lot of voters when you start getting in the weeds like that. And so this race is not as important as it would have been if it was going to determine who's going to control the Senate.And so there are a number of Republicans who may have been able to cross over and hold their nose and vote for Herschel Walker if it meant control of the Senate and a number of these different rights that Senator Cruz was talking about were more sort of hanging in the in the lurch. But instead, this is going to be, you know, a Democratic controlled Senate no matter what Democrats are going to run the committees no matter what, and some of these inside baseball things that Senator Cruz was talking about loses, is going to lose a lot of voters and it's going to be hard to motivate people based on that.",

This race is about character. It's about competence. Why would you give these powerful tools of the Senate to someone who doesn't stand up for either? That is his message.And then on the other side of things, you have Herschel Walker, who there's just more controversies coming out, the latest being this, you know, Texas residency, right.
