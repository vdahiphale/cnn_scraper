      "sentences": "I'm Boris Sanchez coming to you live from Treasure Island, Florida, the Gulf Coast of Florida badly hit by Hurricane Milton overnight. I'm joined by my colleague Brianna Keilar in the nation's capital.And, Brianna, we are monitoring the return, the slow return to normalcy for Florida's Gulf Coast after Hurricane Milton punished the western side of Florida and the eastern side as well with powerful winds and rain. Here in Treasure Island just two days ago, this was a ghost town still full of debris from Hurricane Helene. Slowly, but surely, you might be able to see behind me folks are returning. There is a law enforcement presence here. Rescue crews are scattered throughout the region helping folks get what they need as neighbors are starting to return and assess the damage. A sigh of relief so far today for Floridians. As Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis put it, this was not the worst-case scenario. Remember, this storm over the weekend went from being a tropical storm to a Category 5. As it made landfall in Florida, it became a Category 3, but it expanded dramatically. So we are seeing huge issues not only here on the west coast, but all the way in Southeast Florida in Broward County and north of that. I do have some video that I want to play for you from search-and-rescue operations that were under way in Clearwater earlier today. I was at the site of an apartment complex where folks had to run out of their homes at about 1:00 a.m. One family telling me that they were inundated and had to get out with the only things that they had on them, their clothes. One woman named Anne lived on the first floor of that apartment complex. Once her room got inundated, she ran upstairs. A neighbor took her in on the second floor. All morning, we were watching crews remove folks from that area. Fortunately, as I heard from officials, no injuries, no serious injuries to report there. The water has receded in that area. But, again, there is severe weather across the Sunshine State. We saw tornadoes, as I alluded to. There was severe weather in Port St. Lucie County, at least five people confirmed dead there from tornadoes that swept through the southeastern part of Florida the east coast of Florida. As Hurricane Milton was making landfall, as it was approaching the state, some of those areas saw the worst property damage from this hurricane, and obviously several fatalities there. We're going to get you a report from Brian Todd, who is on the way there, in just moments. And most notably perhaps, in Tampa, an area that was expected to see massive storm surge. It didn't necessarily accumulate the way that we anticipated that it would in some areas, but we did see extensive wind damage, perhaps most notably in St. Petersburg, to Tropicana Field. That's the home of the Tampa Bay Rays, the baseball team. We have to point out that was actually a facility that was being used to shelter emergency workers. That was a base of operations. It also held a large amount of resources. So seeing that roof torn to shreds just gives you an idea of the power of Hurricane Milton, one that, despite not being the worst-case scenario, presented very difficult and ugly scenarios for Floridians. I want to go live now to CNN's Isabel Rosales who is in Hillsborough County for us. Isabel, earlier this morning, I understand that there was a senior citizens facility that was inundated with water, two to three feet of water. And you were speaking to officials there as rescues were under way. Give us an update. Where do things stand right now? Do we have an understanding of the human toll, whether there were injuries or even lives lost there?",

They listened. They came here, 135 elderly disabled individuals that we rescued earlier.They came here. They were evacuated from Bradenton to stay safe. This is a neighborhood that doesn't have a lot. They have very little and the very little they had, they have lost everything. We have water four feet up into their first floor here. This is a heavily Latino community. Their church is gone. Their cars are gone. Again, they don't live paycheck to paycheck. These are people that live day to day and they have nothing.",

So look up here how high the waters are. You can see on the second floor, folks, they're OK. I have been waving them and giving them a thumbs-up. They're OK for now. But, again, so complex to get out of here without some help or really almost getting to the point of swimming in these portions that are so, so deep -- Boris.",

Obviously, this is more toward the east coast, but there was enormous concern about storm surge.It doesn't appear that it reached some of the higher levels of what had been prognosticated for Hurricane Milton. ROSALES:  Yes, Hillsborough County avoided much of the devastation that we saw over in Pinellas County and certainly down south, Sarasota and below. We were in Plant City. That's another agricultural area, a different part of Hillsborough County, where a hotel had to be evacuated, a similar situation, not quite this bad, but they were flooded out, needed some help. And then we also went to Riverview, to the south of Hillsborough County, where we saw a major sinkhole. That's another thing with all these floodwaters taking away the sediment, cutting off a community. The only way to enter in and out of a community was that road, washed away and turned into a sinkhole. So, still devastating to the people who live in these pockets, not quite as much as Pinellas County. But if you're here, this storm, Milton, has been absolutely devastating.",

Obviously, the roof was devastated, but I'm wondering, the neighborhoods nearby St. Petersburg, what do they look like? LISSET HANEWICZ, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA:  Well, let me tell you, this is just devastating for us and all the communities that were impacted. It's truly heartbreaking. Our community was just recovering from Hurricane Helene that had historic storm surge in our city. There were homes that were damaged from that flooding, and there was still debris on the curb of many homes, and then you have Hurricane Milton come, and with winds in excess of 100 miles per hour. We were in downtown when the Tropicana Field roof was damaged and the crane fell. We were in -- staying in a hotel in downtown. We live in the neighborhood just outside of downtown. We went to the hotel to be safe. We had received words that the crane would potentially fall, but we weren't in the radius. It did fall. And the roof of the Tropicana Field was absolutely damaged from the storm. It's just awful.",

Lots of residents are out today walking around kind of just checking out the devastation here and trying not to -- it's quite slippery and dangerous with that, because there's so much mud that's been deposited here.
