The data file that caused a key flight database to collapse was damaged by personnel who failed to follow procedures. That is how the agency described it. CNN has also learned that the computer system that failed is running on 30-year-old software, and it is at least six years away still from a planned update. We'll see about that.George Santos is facing growing calls from fellow Republicans to resign. He says he will not. But he's also still dodging questions about why he's so obviously lied to voters about who he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's great to see you, guys. Abby, part of this issue is how the White House has handled it up to this point. What are you hearing about that?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, I think that there's clearly a gap in the timeline here from the fact that they disclosed earlier this week that the documents in early November had been found, but they didn't talk about the documents that had been found in mid-December and also that there was an additional document that was later found on Wednesday and disclosed to DOJ on Thursday. The question about what they disclosed and when I think still just remains to be answered.They claimed that this is because they want to be sensitive to the DOJ's investigation. That they don't want to talk about things that are a part of an ongoing probe. But at the same time, it -- the question I have as a -- as a journalist, and a lot of the reporters in the White House press briefing yesterday had the same question, if you could disclose the first batch of documents, why not the second, and was there an effort to try to keep this under wraps at a time -- a fairly sensitive time politically for this White House? I think those remained to be answered.",

For -- on that end, it does seem like they cooperated with the National Archives, that they are cooperating fully with the Justice Department. And so, I think there is this natural tension, Kate, between the transparency that the White House has or has not provided or might want to provide versus the way that they need to be measured in their response and let the Justice Department process work itself out and let the special counsel process now work itself through.",

The -- he is tasked by the attorney general to look at this particular matter now if more documents were discovered in different places if there always is the possibility that an investigation will uncover facts that will take investigators down a separate road.

He was charged in Brazil in a fraud case that the Brazilians are now reopening, so there's some very recent history of George Santos allegedly committing financial crimes elsewhere.
