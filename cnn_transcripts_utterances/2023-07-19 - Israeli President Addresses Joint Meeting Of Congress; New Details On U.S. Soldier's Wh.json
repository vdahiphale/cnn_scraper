And they hope that some other force, whether it's a special counsel or something else will do the work of taking Donald Trump out of the race. And then they'll be there to pick up the pieces. That's a big hope. I mean, presidential races are really not about hoping that a meteor hits your opponent. You have to take out your opponent.

He's trying to navigate a very fine line. So he did invite, not coincidentally, as President Herzog was here, did invite the prime minister to visit the U.S., no menu, no date, and I think sent a pretty strong signal.

      "sentences": "I'm standing less than five miles from the Korean Demilitarized Zone, or the DMZ where that U.S. Army Private made that illegal crossing very unusually from the South to the North. Just beyond that bridge there. The unification bridge.You know, we're still quite a distance away from the DMZ but this is as close as we're allowed to get. And you can see the barricades, the spike strips, we can't even shoot the other side of this road where we saw military vehicles going in. This is a very heavily fortified area. But tour groups with special permission and a lot of paperwork are allowed to go in. And that's what is believed to have happened. This army private, Travis King, 23 years old, who had served almost 50 days in detention here in South Korea after some sort of an assault or a scuffle, whereas described it as a typical kind of potentially drunken confrontation. And yet it ended him not only in custody in -- here in South Korea, but he was being sent back to the United States to be separated disciplinary action from the army. And he would have basically been kicked out of the army. So, instead, what is believed to have happened is that he joined a tour group, crossed the unification bridge, and went into the Joint Security Area. This is an area that might be familiar to you, even if you've never been there because it's where President Trump, the former president, and the North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un met and had an impromptu discussion several years back. And President Trump has stepped over what's known as the military demarcation line. And he became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot on North Korean soil. Now, we don't have security video, which I'm sure exists somewhere, but we don't have it yet to show exactly what steps Mr. King took. But if indeed, he also made the same crossing in the same area, it's very likely his footsteps or perhaps a sprint as he might have had to go pretty quickly before getting taken back by security officers there. He would have taken the same path as the former president, Donald Trump. Mr. King is likely in North Korean detention, perhaps even in isolation right now. It's because he's one of the first outsiders to actually go into North Korea since the start of the pandemic. They've had their borders hermetically sealed. They're very afraid of COVID-19. Most of their population remains unvaccinated. So, after a period of quarantine that could last -- well, who knows how long? Then he'll likely be questioned about his military background. He -- yes, he is active duty, but he does -- has a very limited amount of time in the military according to records about you know maybe less than two years. And so, if the North Koreans decide that his intelligence is not a special value to them, well, then they might basically just kind to try to get him back as quickly as they can, or he could sit around and wait for quite some time. Because right now, the U.S. and North Korea do not have official communications as tensions have been rising here. Ballistic missile launches in the North and a U.S. nuclear submarine now parked just off the coast of the South. Will Ripley, CNN, outside the DMZ in South Korea. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
