      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Donald Trump avoids being sentenced until after the election. In the critical final weeks beforehand, he is lashing out at his sexual assault accusers, and his own attorneys. And the man who was once the embodiment of the Republican Party, Dick Cheney, is casting his vote for Democrat, Kamala Harris. Why the former Vice President says Trump can't be trusted with power again. And the 14-year-old Georgia school shooting suspect, in court, alongside his father, both of them coming face-to-face with the families of the victims. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With fewer than nine weeks to go before the election, Donald Trump secured a pretty big win, today, regarding his New York hush money conviction. Instead of being sentenced, potentially to jail, in two weeks from now, he will now be sentenced after November 5th, and that's only, quote, if necessary. Those two words standing out from Judge Merchan's decision today, and I'll tell you why, in just a moment. But really, this decision overall means there will be no big courtroom drama playing out before voters are going to the polls, at least not in a courtroom, here in New York. Trump was with his attorneys, when he found out this news today. That's because he spent the morning, in another courtroom, for another hearing, actually coming within feet of E. Jean Carroll, the woman that a jury found he sexually abused and defamed, which didn't seem to deter him, judging by the comments that he made afterward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This is a disgraceful case. I have no idea who the woman is, and I never met her. I'm disappointed in my legal talent, I'll be honest with you. They're good. They're good people. They're talented people. Today, at the trial, they didn't mention the dress. I said, Why didn't you mention that? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, Maggie, just, obviously, Trump had just come out of that courtroom, where E. Jean Carroll was, just a few feet away from him, as he's appealing this.

Look, here's what I think about the Cheney endorsement. Are working- class voters, in Pennsylvania, thinking about what Dick Cheney has to say about this? No. And so, I don't think it's going to have a huge amount of impact on movement of people out there. But do I think people in Washington, and sort of elite corridors, are going to talk about it? Yes. Look, I think his statement was a little hyperbolic, to be honest. I mean, there's been a lot of enemies of the United States, over 248 years. I don't think Donald Trump is more villainous than everybody who's wished, for the United States to go away, foreign or domestic, so. But this is, it's a surprising thing, honestly.",

As he was bleeding, on the ground, his students pulled him back into the classroom, and took off their own shirts, to try and stop the bleeding and save him. He died a short time, later, along with the three other victims that day. And that is what led to what we saw, today, the 14-year-old accused shooter, joining his father, in the same Georgia courtroom, today, for separate hearings. As Colt Gray faced the judge, the families of the victims were sitting in the front row. One woman, that you can see here, was seen holding a stuffed animal, of the Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, cradling it in her arms. The suspect is facing four counts of felony murder. And the charges against his father, two counts of second degree murder, four counts of involuntary manslaughter, and eight counts of cruelty to children, are the most severe ever filed against an alleged school shooter's parent. My next source, tonight, had unprecedented access to the first landmark prosecution, of the parents of a school shooter. Washington Post reporter, John Woodrow Cox. And it's great to have you here, John. Because you embedded with the Michigan prosecutors, as they were pursuing those charges, against Jennifer and James Crumbley. It was after their 15-year-old son killed four students, at his school shooting, back in 2021.

It is currently flying toward Earth, after it undocked from the International Space Station, about three hours ago. The capsule took, initially, two astronauts to the Station, nearly three months ago. But they are still stuck on the ISS for another five to six months, because NASA deemed the capsule too risky, to carry the crew back to Earth. CNN's Kristin Fisher is following all of the latest developments. Kristin, I mean, first off, the fact that this is empty and coming back is notable in and of itself.

Then, Boeing is going to be able to say, Hey, NASA, we told you so. But again, from NASA's standpoint, there were major issues with Starliner, even if it does land safely beneath these parachutes in just a few hours.
