That will happen tomorrow. And for the second time in less than two months, he will be placed under arrest, this time on 37 charges related to his handling of classified documents. We're told security in South Florida is intensifying and Trump is stirring up his base, calling supporters to rally there and calling on them to financially support him as he does. A fundraising event is now scheduled right after his arraignment. CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes is in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Donald Trump's team has been strategizing. I understand that's where they were when they got that phone call that he was being indicted. What are you learning this morning?",

So, we've just learned from someone familiar with the president's travel that Walt Nauta, the aide who was indicted alongside Trump, will be traveling, or is expected to travel with the former president down to Florida when he goes for his court appearance. Now, once they get there, it is unclear what that will look like in terms of them leaving their Doral club, that's where Trump will be staying and heading over to the courthouse. But this is very significant for a number of reasons. There have been questions after Nauta was indicted whether or not he would stay by Trump's side, if he would try and cooperate in any way. But as of right now, it appears the two are sticking together. Again, he will be there with him, traveling down to Florida on this important day.And as we have reported, we know that Trump is going to be staying at his Doral Resort. He's going to be meeting with his attorneys and discussing adding a lawyer to his legal team there in Florida. They need another Florida-based attorney. So, unclear where those conversations are, but, obviously, something they are all working on. They have that fundraiser that is coming up on Tuesday after he delivers remarks. They are trying to continue to ride this wave. That's how one aide described it to me. And I do want to note one thing from this weekend. I think it was very important. It was the first time we actually heard this from the former president. He has been out there saying over and over again that this is good for him politically, that it helps his polls, it helps his fundraising. But this weekend, he said in an interview with Politico that he didn't want to be indicted, that he went his whole life without being indicted. And it was a glimpse into his mindset here. This is clearly weighing on him. Even though he is a contender for 2024, even though he tries to put everything into political perspective, it is very clear that these legal battles that continue to mount, and particularly this federal indictment, is weighing on the former president.",

But much of the activity will happen over the course of just a few hours tomorrow afternoon. So, that's when Trump and Walt Nauta are both scheduled. They're summoned to this court to appear before a magistrate judge. So, a judge that will take them through the initial proceedings of defendants after they're charged with a case like this by a grand jury.And what will happen is Trump and Nauta very likely, if they're traveling together, they'll be brought into this federal courthouse without being seen very clearly. They won't have to walk in through the front door. They very likely will be brought in underground, taken up to that courtroom, and then they will appear before the judge. [10:05:05] Now, this is not like the case in New York State where there are cameras and photographs of what happens in the building. We do have a sketch artist who's going to be able to sketch it, but there are no video recordings. There's no photography inside federal court buildings. And when you're in that sort of courtroom, this is a pretty big courtroom, to our understanding, but it still is a pretty confined space. It's a humbling space. It can be a theatrical space. And this is when Donald Trump will be faced with those 37 counts he's indicted under, where he will have to face the judge, where he will learn what those counts are exactly, and then enter his not guilty plea, which is what we're fully expecting him to do tomorrow. Then he'll be processed in the system and will exit the court. It could be quite short, all of this happening tomorrow inside the courthouse, and then the real work kicks off, headed to trial, and the case goes before Judge Aileen Cannon to preside over that for the future.

Now, law enforcement sources tell CNN that a group of FBI special agents have been assigned to a domestic terrorism squad, and their job right now is to identify any possible threats to this building here. We're told that they're also keeping a close eye on the Proud Boys because there was some conversation between some of the members of that group about traveling to Florida. Now, over the weekend, the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, he was asked about some of the preparations going into Tuesday. He talked about some of the issues that he hopes to provide a little bit more information on Fox News Sunday, and here's what he said.

(END VIDEO CLIP) C. SUAREZ:  And as we head into Tuesday, it is still unclear exactly what area of downtown Miami some of these protesters that might come out here will be kept. There is an area to the south of this courthouse that has a bit of a clearing, and it's possible that any groups that might come out here in support of the former president might be kept there.

We've got our case, we have our facts, we're ready to go to trial as soon as possible. Florida is seen as a rocket or Southern Florida is seen as a rocket docket jurisdiction, which means they stick to that and they move through the cases very quickly. They're going to move to discovery.And what's going to happen in discovery is, under Rule 16, the prosecutors will have to turn over all evidence, including exculpatory evidence, meaning evidence that would be good for the defense in this case, over to the defense. That's something that they haven't seen thus far. And I'm sure they're going to look through that. And I think the other thing that you're going to see out of the defense in this case is they're going to try to -- the affidavit of probable cause is what backed up that warrant when they did that search at Mar-a-Lago. I think you're going to see them challenge that affidavit of probable cause. I think it's an uphill battle, without a doubt.
