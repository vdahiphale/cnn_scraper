Plus, team Trump's star witness fails to deliver today, now saying he can't recall when Georgia D.A. Fani Willis began her relationship with her top prosecutor in Trump case. Did he just help Willis stay on that Trump case? And the top Olympic fencer from Russia speaking out after defecting from his country, slamming Putin for the war in Ukraine. He'll be my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, a mystery in Michigan tonight. Polls are just about to close in the crucial swing state. One of just a handful of states that will determine the outcome of the 2024 election. And when it comes to the Republican primary tonight, there's little polling to show where voters stand. When it comes to Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, neither one has spent much time in this state. Nikki Haley only hit the ground on Sunday after South Carolina, her campaign only started running television ads in the state last week. As for Trump, he's not even there tonight. He's actually planning just to call into a GOP victory party. And on the Democratic side, Biden tonight facing an unprecedented uproar over his support for Israel. Biden, the target of a massive campaign urging Democratic Arab Americans and Muslims to cast protest votes against the president tonight. Images like the ones we're about to show you have caused outrage and pain in those communities. People struggling to survive, one of Gaza's only functioning hospitals. A hospital staff calls a, quote, death zone now. People digging with their bare hands in neighborhood after neighborhood, looking for dead children after airstrikes. Organizers of tonight's protest vote in Michigan are hoping it sends a message to Biden that he must change course. And the reality is that Michigan is a must win in November, Biden won the state by just over 150,000 votes in 2020 and Arab Americans were a big part of that. They turned out overwhelmingly for him. In fact, he won by nearly 70 percent in Michigan's most heavily Arab American communities. And that community is expected to pay an even more significant role in 2024. They now make up the majority of residents in the entire city of Dearborn, which is one of the largest cities in the entire state of Michigan. The state's total Middle Eastern population is now over 300,000, twice the margin of victory last time. And then moment, I'm going to speak to John King about what he is watching tonight. In this crucial primary in terms of what it will reveal for both Democrats and Republicans. I want to go first to the ground, Omar Jimenez, who is OUTFRONT live at a polling station in Waterford, Michigan, and Omar. I know you've been there. You've been talking to people coming in, casting their vote all day. What are they telling you?",

In short, Trump supporters, many of them have said that immigration and the economy are tops of minds for them, while Biden supporters have said, the economy and human decency in the White House has been top of mind for them.Then we've heard a few more nuanced opinions. We spoke to one person who actually voted for Marianne Williamson, who announced she was suspending her campaign earlier this month. But really, this was someone who said he previously voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but because of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, he couldn't bring himself to vote for him again. Now, of course, that message has been the central the theme of what we have seen be a major push in this state led by Arab American activists. And as we know, to vote uncommitted over his handling of what has happened with Israel and Gaza and Hamas. Now, as you mentioned before, coming to me, this state here in Michigan has the largest Arab American population of any state in the entire country. No doubt, a crucial voting bloc when we get to the general election. But I want you to take a listen to one Biden supporter we spoke to. Even though this has been billed as not an anti-Biden vote. It's been billed as a protest vote. This voter, this Biden voter, didn't necessarily agree with voting uncommitted because he saw the alternative to Joe Biden as much worse. Take a listen.

Another dynamic we've watched for today is, look, you may notice its not exactly a packed behind me right now, but that doesn't mean people haven't been voting.

He's 4-0, in the states, 5-0 if you had the Virgin Islands. So if you're Nikki Haley, who could be gone from the race a week from tonight after Super Tuesday, you are looking for some proof that Republican voters are listening to you and you say, hey, wake up, we have to stop this. And so, will it come in Michigan tonight? Number one, 55 delegates at stake. Number two, be careful about that. Most of the delegates, a state convention decides where the delegates go. It will be influenced for at least 16 of those delegates by the prime results tonight, but it's not necessarily beholden to the prime results tonight and Trump has the state party pretty wired. But what do you look for? So let's go back to 2016 in the Republican primary. Let's cut 2016, not 2012. There we go. 2012 was interesting too though. Trump won Michigan. Where do you see the Ted Cruz? You see some Ted Cruz and John Kasich in the suburban areas. That's the way you look for tonight. Look, Erin, the math has been pretty clear for Nikki Haley for some time. She says she needs to stay in to try to rattle the party to rally around her. Michigan gives her an opportunity. We'll be looking in the suburbs. I wouldn't run to Vegas and place a bet on that. But as you watch the vote coming tonight, is there any evidence in Michigan tonight that after these four contests, Republican voters are saying, you know, she's right, we need to give boost. If she doesn't get it in Michigan tonight. As I said, next Tuesday night could be the last hurrah.",

That's the box you just heard a voter there telling John King he had checked, right? That that's the box to check for -- to protest Biden's -- Biden in this case. Now, there are always uncommitted votes the primaries in Michigan, as John pointed out, it's been about 20,000 votes in each of the past three Democratic cycles. So with that context, what are you hoping to accomplish tonight? ABRAHAM AIYASH (D), HIGHEST-RANKING MUSLIM AND ARAB AMERICAN LAWMAKER IN MICHIGAN: Look, President Biden has been one of the most consequential presidents in modern American history as it relates to the domestic policy. Well, what we've seen over the last four months is nothing less than an abject moral failure in terms of dignifying the humanity of the Palestinians. And we're seeing in Michigan is a groundswell of support of people that are anti-war and people that want this country to leave with moral clarity, and one, our president to not support an administration in Israel that has killed nearly 30,000 innocent men, women, and children. So, tonight's results will be a reflection of that frustration and folks are going to come out and demand better for our government and for our democracy through the best way possible, which is our vote.",

They go out, they protest, they the lobby their elected officials? They ask for our government to do better. That is inherently democratic. And when we see our leaders not act and react and heed the call of the public, the question then becomes, what is President Biden willing to do to protect and save democracy from Donald Trump? It's not the question that we should be asking the voters. When I ran for office, Erin, I don't get mad at people when I lose my election or people don't resonate with my message, I go back and ask myself, what could I have done better to campaign and what platform and what vision did I not present that should have inspired people? So the question that we need to be asking is that President Biden and he still has time to change course.  Tonight's vote is a way to demonstrate for the president that he can change course and continue to save lives. The vote for uncommitted is a vote to save the innocent men, women, and children that are still alive, that Netanyahu was hell-bent on killing. So I want to close with this, Erin. My uncle was killed three days before Trump signed the travel ban. He was in Yemen, was killed in an airstrike, and we had applied to bring him into the United States ten years prior to that point. So I know the deep pain in the deep impact that Donald Trump's policies have inflicted on our communities. But the question has to be Joe Biden, what is he willing to do to save democracy?
