While touting the fact that Hur decided no criminal charges should be brought, Biden lashed out in the face of newly intensified scrutiny over his mental acuity. Republicans are now seizing on it, some saying it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment. Let's take you now to the White House with CNN's M.J. Lee, who was at last night's heated briefing. M.J., the president's anger was on full display. You had a tense exchange with him, asking him about this public perception that he has lost a step in his older age. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think you're right that the president was clearly fuming and furious last night. And it's interesting. Watching him last night, giving his remarks, taking questions from reporters, it was almost as though the legal headline that Robert Hur was not going to bring forward criminal charges almost became a footnote. There was so much more focus on that description in the report that you referenced, Robert Hur saying that he was an elderly man with a memory problem. We saw the president very much pushing back on those accusations, but there were so many references in this report citing various examples of these alleged memory problems, including the president not knowing when he was vice president and that he didn't know when his late son, Beau, had died. And that line of questioning in particular was clearly what made the president most upset and angry. We are told that, in private yesterday, he was fuming about that and said: \"How would I effing forget that?\" And we also saw him get emotional when he addressed this in the remarks last night. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what I saw that report last night, I believe is -- as a former prosecutor, the comments that were made by that prosecutor gratuitous, inaccurate, and inappropriate. October 7, Israel experienced a horrific attack. And I will tell you, we got the calls, the president and myself, in the hours after that occurred. It was an intense moment for the commander in chief of the United States of America. And I was in almost every meeting with the president in the hours and days that followed, countless hours with the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, the heads of our intelligence community, and the president was in front of and on top of it all, asking questions and requiring that America's military and intelligence community and diplomatic community would figure out and know how many people were dead, how many are Americans, how many hostages. Is the situation stable? He was in front of it all, coordinating and directing leaders who are in charge of America's national security, not to mention our allies around the globe, for days and, up until now, months. So the way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous. And so I will say that, when it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in a situation like that, we should expect that there would be a higher level of integrity than what we saw. Thank you. Thank you for the question. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, they're right that he had -- this has been part of Biden's political profiles from the beginning. He's a guy who speaks freely and sometimes commits gaffes. That wastrue in his 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s. And it's the flip side of authenticity that has served him well. Look, he's older than he -- he was 12 years older than -- or more than when I worked with him, 15 years older than when I worked with him. So, yes, he's not exactly the same. I don't think President Obama was the same at the end of the eighth -- in the eighth year than he was in the first year, but he was -- he had the benefit of experience that offset anything that -- any aging that went on. But, look, let's be honest about this. The reason that that report, and gratuitous or not -- and I think it was gratuitous for the prosecutor to put that language in. It struck a chord, because this has been something that's been plaguing the president throughout this campaign and before, this sense that he has lost a step, that he's not with it. I think that what the vice president described is probably exactly the truth, which is, behind closed doors, he's very competently running the administration. And there are ample -- there's ample evidence of that, the legislation he's passed, the relationship with NATO, and the way he pulled them together and so on. But, having said all that, public perception is formed by how you perform in front of the camera. And, on that, I think the president has lost a step, and it has hurt him, and it has created these questions that are the central challenge for him in this campaign.",

I'm imagining that he's going to try to shake that in the 200-plus days before Election Day. Can he change public perception in that way? How? (CROSSTALK)",

      "sentences": "Stories that are damaging in politics are stories that reinforce an impression.There is this impression of the president out there. It's been relentlessly pushed by Republicans really for four -- more than four years. But these things become -- they become bites on social media, the mistake last night, because they reinforce a theme. And that is a problem that his campaign has to cope with. What -- how do you put him out there to show energy, but then deal with the aftermath if he makes mistakes? I mean, Donald Trump is a gaffe machine himself, I mean, but because he is energetic, these questions are not as profound about him. But he mistakes Nikki Haley for Nancy Pelosi and so on. How you deal with it is a real question, Boris. I mean, obviously they need to be on the offense and they need to make this a comparative race, and they need -- because President Trump has his own major liabilities that are going to play out during the course of this campaign. But the thing that -- less -- more concerning to me about the mistaking the president -- calling the president of Egypt the president of Mexico was the way he reacted to M.J. when she asked a question that was completely legitimate, which is, what are you going to do about the fact that so many people have this question? And he snapped it at her said, well, that's your opinion. Well, no, Mr. President, it's not her opinion. It's the opinion of a lot of Americans who only see you in front of a camera. They don't see you in the Situation Room. They don't see you in these closed-door meetings. And they are drawing their conclusions from what they see. And so that's -- the campaign has to strategize around that and put him in situations. And I'm not sure that a group of hungry reporters shouting at him is necessarily the best way for him to communicate. They need to figure out how to use him, how much to use him, how not to tire him out when -- so that he makes more mistakes. But it's a big problem. And one other point I want to make. Last night, one of the things that I heard that concerned me was the president was disputing elements of the -- of the report, as you guys mentioned. It's very clear there is a transcript of that -- of that -- of those five hours. And so he is now -- he has made a carnivorous House Republican Caucus more so, and they're going to chase them -- they're going to chase this thing relentlessly and keep this story alive. So that was another problem with the press conference last night. And one last thing, Boris. I listened to the vice president, who was very compelling in her testimony. But it made me wonder. If you're the staff, why, in the midst of everything she was describing, do you then have the president sit down for a very consequential deposition? If the president was weary in that deposition, she described why. And I don't know. No matter whether the president is 80 or 50, I'm not sure that you go forward with a deposition in the midst of a global crisis that the president is handling 24/7. That's a little confusing to me.",

So people make these mistakes when they're on television. We all makethem all the time. But when you think about what the campaign has to do next and what the president has to do next, it's a very different world than it was in 2016 or 2012. This is a world where the president has to communicate with people who aren't watching regular television. They're scrolling through Instagram and TikTok. And I think the campaign is very clear that they're going to talk to these folks very directly in those environments. And we just have seen some viral videos that go out when people get to meet the president. I think you will see him doing some -- doing some things where he is speaking very directly with voters, perhaps in maybe smaller groups. And those are going to annoy the press, because he's not -- although he's doing press interviews like he did yesterday, but he's not going to sit down for every media interview, big media interview that gets asked. But he will go out and talk to voters. Those voters will share those images and stories with their friends. And that's how half the country is consuming their news. So I think this campaign is different than ones we have seen in the past. And they're learning those lessons and I think being really creative about how to address it.",

He said Israeli forces will enter that area to root out Hamas from what Netanyahu calls its -- quote -- \"last bastion.\" An estimated 1.3 million people live there, nearly all crammed into makeshift tents, many of them on the verge of starvation. And at least one aid group is fearing that Rafah could turn into -- quote -- \"a zone of bloodshed.\" It's another dire warning about Israel's campaign on Gaza that's killed nearly 28,000 people, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is run by Hamas.
