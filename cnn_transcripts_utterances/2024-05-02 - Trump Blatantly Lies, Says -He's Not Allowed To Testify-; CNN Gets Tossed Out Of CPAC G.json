Among our guests, former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman. And an exclusive OUTFRONT investigations tonight, an event that our reporter got kicked out of when trying to show you inside a world Republicans don't want you to see, a world led by a man who's a model for Trump's second term. And more breaking news. Campus chaos and other university giving protesters a deadline to get out or else. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, what have we done? Four words in one text, a text that could spell big trouble for Trump. During his nearly six hours of testimony, Stormy Daniels' former attorney was asked about this text message that he sent to the former editor of the \"National Enquirer\". That text, \"what have we done?\" was sent on election night in 2016. What have we done in the text goes. So the prosecutor ask the witness, Keith Davidson, what did you mean when you say, what have we done? Davidson responds, I think there was an understanding that this is a text between Dylan Howard, who is obviously the editor of the \"National Enquirer\" and I and this was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way, I should strike that. That our efforts may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. So we thought carefully about his words, was careful with them. And that exchange is crucial context, of course, to the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels because one of the reasons Trump is charged with a felony is for covering up a payment in order to impact an election after that crucial piece of evidence came out in court, Trump went before the cameras to talk about it as he's been doing every day here. But for the first time, something really changed here. He claimed for the first time that he is not allowed to be a witness in the case.
