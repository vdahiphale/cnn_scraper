China brokering talks that have led to another key step in reconciliationbetween longtime regional Middle Eastern rivals. After resuming diplomatic ties just last month, Iran and Saudi Arabia have now signed an agreement to reopen embassies in each other's countries. Now the foreign ministers of both countries have been meeting in Beijing. We'll have more on China's role as mediator in a moment. First, though, France and the European Union hitting a reset button on their relationship with Beijing. It was during a trip to China, where French president Emmanuel Macron met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, earlier today, urging him to, quote, \"reason with Russia\" and help negotiate peace in Ukraine. The two leaders were then being joined by president of the European Commission, Ursula van der Leyen, who is also visiting China. CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley joins us live from Taipei with more. It does seem today dateline Beijing is in vogue; all roads both on the E.U. and Middle Eastern front converging in the Chinese capital today.",

Because the widely held view is that if there's any world leader that could exert influence to try to get Putin to, you know, look at an off ramp that's actually realistic for his unprovoked war in Ukraine, it would be Xi Jinping. I mean, China is the sole reason that Russia remains stable economically at this point, because they are buying. They're not participating in these Western sanctions. So they're buying oil. They're selling microchips. And potentially are supplying not just parts for weapons but U.S. says they might be supplying weapons and perhaps more lethal weapons or at least considering doing that down the road. Even though Xi Jinping, when he met with Putin in Moscow, his first overseas trip after getting this unprecedented third term, noteworthy in it of itself, he did say that he is wanting to be an agent of peace. An agent of peace with a 12 point peace plan that doesn't call it an invasion or condemn Russia's actions and a plan that he will not even publicly discuss or respond to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy., when he wanted to reach out to Xi Jinping directly.

ANDERSON (voice-over):  The two broke off relations in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Saudi Arabia's embassy in Tehran was ransacked. For years, the two have opposed each other on most conflicts in the region, from Yemen to Iraq and Lebanon. Iran accused of being behind a major attack on Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil facilities in 2019, claimed by the Iranian-backed Houthis. And at their lowest point, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman compared Iran's supreme leader to Hitler. MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN, SAUDI CROWN PRINCE (through translator):  Really wants to create his own project in the Middle East, very much like Hitler, who wanted to expand at the time. ANDERSON (voice-over):  The reestablishment of relations comes after multiple rounds of negotiations between the two sides:  Saudi Arabia trying to tone down regional tensions as it seeks to diversify its economy; Iran trying to come out of its international isolation following months of mass protests and years of sanctions. The United States, apparently welcoming the agreement. NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  We support dialogue, we support direct diplomacy, we support anything that would serve to deescalate tensions in the region and potentially help to prevent conflicts.

And these are now becoming very familiar to us, aren't they? Paris time, 4:25 in the afternoon. For many of you who have been to Paris, you'll be aware of the tree-lined streets of Paris. This is sadly becoming all too familiar a scene. And we have seen some very aggressive scenes over the last few days, as police and protesters stand off against each other. There have been pockets of agitators, Black Bloc movement on the streets of Paris as well. But it has to be said, you know, these are protests full of people who genuinely have a real grievance with the government, who pushed through that legislation, raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. The French government tried that before and they hadn't got it through before. President Emmanuel Macron absolutely determined that, this time, he would. These reforms come into effect toward the end of the year, unless these unions and these protesters can actually effect a U-turn on this. The streets of Paris, then today, these are the these scenes.

The unions and those who support the unions not prepared to stand down in the face of what they believe is inadequate action taken by the government that represents them in the face of these pension reforms.
