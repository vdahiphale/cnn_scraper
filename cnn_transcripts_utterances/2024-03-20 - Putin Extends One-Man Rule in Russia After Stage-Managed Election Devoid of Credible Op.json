And yet, a surprising show of defiance, with protesters targeting dozens of polling stations across the country, setting fire to ballot boxes, pouring dye into others. While in Berlin, Germany, thousands turned up at the Russian embassy following calls from the opposition to swarm polling stations, including Yuliya Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died suddenly in an Arctic Penal Colony last month. Navalnaya said she wrote her husband`s name on the election ballot and has vowed to continue his work. And in his post-election address, Putin uttered Navalny`s name for the first time, claiming he would have agreed to release him in a prisoner swap. Backlash not just from the U.S. and its allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy describing the election as, quote, \"a sham.\" VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): These days, the Russian dictator is simulating another election. There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power. And there is no one in the world who is safe from this.",

The good news is that the measles vaccine is considered one of the most protective. But in other news, vaccination rates in the U.S. have been declining. Earlier this week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, issued a health alert about the increased risk and how best to protect yourself. CNN`s Meg Tirrell explains.

It`s an airborne virus and it can linger in the air for two hours after somebody infected has left the room. And it`s so contagious that if people aren`t vaccinated, nine out of 10 susceptible people will get infected with the virus if they are exposed. Vaccination works incredibly well, 93% effectiveness with one dose of the vaccine, 97% with two doses of the vaccine. Unfortunately, the vaccination rate in the United States among kindergartners has been going down over the past few years. So health officials are worried that more people are susceptible to measles and are emphasizing that vaccination is the safest and best way to be protected from this virus. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Dartmouth Professor John McCarthy is credited with coining the term with three other researchers at a summer workshop in 1956. Some 68 years after the term \"artificial intelligence\" was not much more than a vague concept, AI, as we know, is popping up in our daily lives, everything from schools to the workplace, to the freaking, freaking, freaking -- to the club. That`s right, virtual DJs. And CNN spent the day with a British startup that makes what they call AI integrated digital humans, including a DJ that performs at shows around the world. And we wanted to show you all this new idea because we want to hear from you. Let us know what you think. Are these advancements a good thing, simply fun and harmless? Or as some believe, are they hurting us in the long run and taking away jobs from real life humans? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

General Assemblymarked this day to recognize the importance of happiness and well-being. Meditation can be a key to being happy. According to the Center for Healthy Minds, a study showed that two weeks of daily meditation for 30 minutes a day can help bring more positivity to the brain. Now, maybe this sounds impossible to you, but Dan Harris, who`s the author of the book, \"10% Happier,\" explains why anyone can embrace meditation, even if their mind at times seems like a cacophony of thoughts and sounds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN HARRIS, AUTHOR AND HOST OF THE \"TEN PERCENT HAPPIER\" PODCAST: The whole goal of meditation is just to pick one thing to focus on. Usually it`s the feeling of your breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, which will happen a million times, you just start again and again and again. And this noticing the distraction and starting again, this is like a bicep curl for your brain. And it`s what shows up on the brain scans of people who meditate. And so getting distracted is not proof that you`re failing. It`s proof that you`re doing it correctly. Why? Because the whole goal of this practice is to get more familiar with the wildness of your mind so that it doesn`t own you as much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
