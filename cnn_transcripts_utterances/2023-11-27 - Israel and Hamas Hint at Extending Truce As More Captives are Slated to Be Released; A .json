Plus, more Gaza hostages could walk free in the coming hours. Israel says they have a list of who gets released next.And internal turmoil at the White House. One report says divisions over the Israel-Hamas war have roiled Biden's team like no other issue of his presidency. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, November 27th, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, it's noon in Gaza where the truce between Hamas and Israel is entering its fourth and possibly final day. Overnight, Hamas sent Israel the list of hostages it plans to release today. The militant group released 17 hostages yesterday including 4- year-old American-Israeli Abigail Idan. Israel released 39 Palestinians in return, and both sides are now discussing the possibility of extending the truce, the exchanges and the influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The terms already set grants and extra day's pause in the fighting for every ten hostages that Hamas frees. Israel's war cabinet discussed the possibility last night, and both Qatar and the U.S., key intermediaries have expressed support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Also Qatar is the main interlocutor between Iran and the rest of the world. So, yes, they want to give this pause another four days at least and get more hostages out.But the Qatari prime minister has told the media that it all depends on Hamas being able to find the rest of the women and children who were being held. There's a total of 90 being held. And with the first four days, that means about 50 of them have been released. So another four days or up to ten days, which is what the Israeli cabinet originally approved with this truce deal, that would basically take care of all of the missing women and children. But the question is, are they all alive? Are they all in Hamas' hands? And can they be turned over in time to buy an extension of this truce?",

And why the U.S. has played such an active role, especially the president at this time in taking an active role in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas to strike what -- somewhat of a hostage negotiation agreement, to call for a pause to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.But then also most importantly, the people at the center of this have been taken on, you know, the -- going from that Palestinian prisoners and also the hostages that Hamas has taken. And so, the fact that she's the first one Biden has signaled that he is still going to play an active role in these talks to make sure that the pause is -- can be extended for a period of days, but then also to make sure that there are more release of American hostages, but then overall hostages that Hamas has.",

And so, the fact that, you know, he has given an update saying that she is now safely with her family members. There's been video released of her, you know, embracing her loved ones.And so, I think that is very telling. And it also just kind of puts his message forward, saying that he's optimistic that more negotiations can move forward to release even more hostages in the future. And look, I think the bigger picture here is that President Biden has to move very carefully when it comes to how he responds to this conflict abroad. Especially because there's been mounting frustration within his own administration of how he has not fully supported a ceasefire. And you even have pressure from outside groups having Biden, you know, be more vocal about just some of the international humanitarian laws that some feel that have been violated. So how Biden has -- is going to just kind of proceed in this, and him kind of laminating and talking about the 4-year-old to really talking about the human element --",

They need -- I think what the Qataris are trying to do is get a proper list of exactly who is held hostage and where they are.
