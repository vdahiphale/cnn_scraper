These pleas come from people who deserve everyone's respect and compassion. Families who lost sons and daughters and spouses in the terrorist suicide bombing at Abbey Gate in the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. This happened on August 26, 2021, roughly two years ago. And you may remember, it killed the suicide bombing, 11 U.S. Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one soldier, along with more than 170 Afghan civilians.Forty-five U.S. Service Members, furthermore, were wounded in the attack, some of them grievously. It was the deadliest day for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in roughly a decade, and it came during the frenzied, chaotic U.S. withdrawal as service members were working to evacuate civilians and others at the airport. This week, many of those Gold Star families brought some pointed questions to Washington, D.C. and we wanted to try to help them get some answers. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) MARK SCHMITZ, FATHER OF U.S. MARINE CORPS LANCE CPL. JARED SCHMITZ: Two years has gone by and where are we? To be frank, we're knee deep in bullshit. TAPPER (voice-over): An emotional hearing on Capitol Hill with testimony from Gold Star families of the 13 service member killed in the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul two years ago.

TAPPER (voice-over): Some of the families pointing to previous testimony given by another Marine who was on the same mission, Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas Andrews, who said he and other Marines believe they saw a man who fit the description of the suicide bomber but had been denied permission to engage him. SGT. TYLER VARGAS-ANDREWS, U.S. MARINE CORPS: We asked him for engagement, authority and permission. We asked him if we could shoot. Our battalion commander said and I quote, plain and simple we were ignored. Our expertise was disregarded. No one was held accountable for our safety.

You would go look at the guy and think maybe.\" A third saying, quote, \"It's possible we saw him, but we don't have a solid description of who he was. It's all speculation.\" Marine Tristan Hirsch also told his local newspaper, quote, \"We knew about him two days prior to the attack. We knew what he looked like. The CIA let us know. He looked exactly as they described him.\" CNN could not get in touch with Hirsch. How solid was the US. Intelligence? CNN sought to get some of those answers this week.",

General Frank Mackenzie denied these claims at a Senate Armed Service hearing in September 2021. SEN.

They declined. But minutes ago, the Pentagon did give us an extensive statement, too long to read the whole thing right now. We will put it all on CNN.com.But here's the bottom line, according to the statement on whether snipers could have taken out the suspected bomber, the Pentagon says on the record, quote, we did not have intelligence that identified an individual by description or otherwise of the bomber. The preponderance of the intelligence indicated a complex attack like a car bomb. The statement goes on to say, quote, furthermore, descriptions of the bomber depicted in media included in this recently released book, do not match the actual description of the bomber. So it's possible that if a sniper had taken the shot on this individual whom he claims was the bomber, he very well could have been killing an innocent person. But according to the rules of engagement, any service member can use lethal force if they determine there is a threat to themselves or coalition forces, unquote. On the second question we raised here, the allegation that there was an airstrike denied on a specific ISIS case, staging ground at a hotel not far from the airport. The Pentagon statement says, quote, according to the commanders in Kabul, there were not any vetted strike targets denied. We just never had that precise intelligence. It is accurate that we did ask the Taliban to raid or search several areas. They searched some and did not search others, unquote. We will continue to press for answers on these questions. Let us turn now to Alicia Lopez, her son, U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Hunter Lopez is among the 13 service members who were killed in the bombing. First of all, Ms. Lopez, thank you so much for joining us. Tell us about your son. What do you want our viewers to know about him? ALICIA LOPEZ, MOTHER OF U.S. MARINE CORPS CPL. HUNTER LOPEZ: Thank you, first of all, for having me, Jake, I appreciate your time and in telling our children's story. My son, as well as the other 12 are nothing short but heroes.

A country where women obviously do not have the same rights as men, to say the least, and a country whose questionable human rights record is practically being glazed over through what is called sports washing, lucrative cash grabbing deals being the shiny object thrown at famous athletes and sports organizations from around the world to make the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seem more palatable.

And it's interesting how this has all come about, because this started because the WTA championships were originally being played in China. And then in 2020, of course, a pandemic hit. And then what happened after that? The WTA made the moral decision not to go back to China because of the situation with the tennis player, Peng Shuai, who, as you may remember, accused a high ranking official in the Communist Party of sexual assault. So that started this stance a couple years ago. So what's happened since, Jake, is that the Women's Tour finals have gone to various countries, even here in the U.S., in Mexico. It's on the table. Now, one of the places it could go is Saudi Arabia. But I've just been told by a source very close to the decision making process that is not going to happen this year, but it's still on the table for potentially happening next year and in years down the road.
