The White House says President Biden is still running for a second term despite continuing questions over his fitness for office. Hurricane Beryl hits Jamaica with devastating winds and a life-threatening storm surge. And money makeover. Japan issues its first new banknotes in decades. And yes, Shohei Ohtani impact. The Japanese baseball sensations, celebrity drawing people across the Pacific to Los Angeles. That conversation and much more coming up. But first, it's a critical day for U.S. President Joe Biden as he pushes back on calls to end his bid for re-election. He's expected to hold a meeting, in fact, this hour, with more than 20 Democratic governors. We will speak to one of them shortly. Meantime, the White House is strongly defending the president following his disastrous performance in last week's debate. Press Secretary Karine Jean- Pierre telling reporters Biden will not step aside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president is cleareyed, and he is staying in the race. I don't have anything else beyond that. He is staying.

Well, you know, in my piece today, one of the things that struck me was a belief, a wideningbelief in the party, even among strategists and elected officials who are skeptical that Harris can beat Trump, that if you climb the first mountain of nudging Joe Biden out of the race, it is probably too much to ask to climb the second mountain of bypassing a sitting vice president. And I came away -- even before Jeff's excellent, and I'm sure it's, you know, solid reporting. I came away feeling that the consolidation behind Harris, if Biden steps aside, might be much greater and quicker than anyone could have anticipated, given that one of the reasons he didn't face more pressure to step aside to begin with was that many Democrats felt that they were in an impossible dilemma where they doubted Harris could win, but they also feared that bypassing her would tear apart the party.

Biden has really fall -- the Sunbelt swing states have almost completely fallen out of reach for him in Georgia and North Carolina. Arizona and Nevada are not much more competitive to win. Democrats are likely going to have to sweep our Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And there are a lot of Democrats who worry that she simply can't win enough working-class whites to do that. So, you know, there is an audience in the party that would be open to an alternative. The question is whether the supply side would be met. Would a serious other candidate, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Roy Cooper, Josh Shapiro, really get into the race against the first woman of color to serve as vice president? Again, if Biden steps aside. At the risk of damaging their long-term standing with those key party constituencies. It's not clear to me that there -- maybe there will -- maybe ambition will kind of trump everything else, but it's not clear to me that there will be a full-scale first tier choice or choices available willing to get into the race against her, especially, you know, when someone like Clyburn, despite that quote also said he expected the party to consolidate behind her if -- you know, if Biden steps aside.",

I mean, not only for Democrats, but really, you know, for, you know, a broad range of Americans who view Trump as somethingoutside of our democratic small D traditions, you know, in the history of this country. I mean, Trump has made clear, as I've written, in a variety of ways, he is talking explicitly about deploying federal force into blue states and cities over the objections of their local officials. He is talking about purging the civil service. He's talking about setting up internment camps for migrants. He's talking about openly using the Justice Department to pursue his political enemies. In fact, he said he believes he has the authority to fire a U.S. attorney who refuses an order to investigate or indict a specific person that he targets. And it is at that moment, against that backdrop, that John Roberts and the five other Republican appointed Supreme Court justices chose to write Trump this blank check. I mean, even, you know, in a throwaway line in the decision to give him explicit authority to order the Justice Department to do things. They went beyond what the Trump lawyers were asking for. So, you add all of that up, you know, for -- and you're -- you know, you noted the poll of polls where Biden is now five points behind Trump. Biden's never been five points behind Trump. That \"New York Times\" poll today with him eight points behind Trump, I have to think, is the furthest he has ever trailed him. And certainly, the idea of him trailing in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by margins outside the margin of error, all of this is terrifying to Democrats. I mean, right now, they can look at polling that says their Senate candidates, by and large, are holding up and running well ahead of Biden, but they are defying history if that is to sustain all the way through the election day. Some of them might win, but one out of 66 in the last two cycles, could you really imagine seven out of seven if Biden can't recover to win some of those states?",

But he is definitely consulting with the vice president right now who I have a great deal of respect for. And he is consulting with some of those individuals that would step in if asked. So, I appreciate that. But we have to really think hard about looking at public opinion over an hour and a half- or two-hour debate. When you have 50 years of service -- I hear you. I'm a regular person too. It was a scary thing to watch in the debate. I've seen a lot of scary moments from people who serve in office that would much more easily disqualify them from service in the future. I mean, I'm not trying to be crazy partisan here, but the former president, when we had this disaster, this tragedy in Maui, came over the top with the most caustic nonsense ever, which scared our people, did not help us recover. That's something I would never expect from any, any elected officials. So, I'll be making the case for a good human being to be president going forward. If it's Joe Biden, that's fantastic.

We're told the president has privately acknowledged that the next few days are critical as to whether he can save his re-election bid. MJ Lee joins me now. And, MJ, that was your reporting.

And really, I think the main thing that they are wanting to get out of this is direct interaction with the president. They want to know whether he is doing OK, and certainly, you expect that they are going to want some sense, again, directly from the president on what the path forward here is. And of course, we've seen the president, the White House, the campaign, all really making a concerted effort today to press home that they are not going to be giving up this fight, that despite the panic that we have seen within the Democratic Party, donors that are concerned, two House Democrats, sitting members in Congress have come out now to say the president should drop out, others expressing concern within the party, despite all of that, that the president is in it for the long haul. The president himself joined a campaign call today to let everyone working for his campaign know that he isn't going anywhere. He said that he is in this until the very end. And we've seen this on a staff level too, which I think just goes to show, sort of, the moment we are in of real uncertainty. We've seen senior White House officials and senior campaign officials holding these kinds of calls with their staff to reassure them and at least to try to give them a pep talk and say, look, these are uncertain times, understand the concern, but it's time to just keep our heads down and keep working. And the president is still the nominee. And again, he isn't going anywhere. But we're going to have to see whether a meeting like this and the outreach that the president has been doing to lawmakers in the last 48 hours or so. And then a couple of the other things that the White House has planned for the president, like a big sit-down interview, as well as a press conference with reporters coming next week, whether all of those things really add up to reassure people in the party that are really concerned right now.",

She needs to make sure that she is being a good soldier and being completely publicly supportive of the president, even though, of course, she is the deputy. And as the White House press secretary told me today, she said the president specifically chose Kamala Harris as his running mate back in the 2020 campaign, because he sees her as being the future of this party. But look, contingency plans and all of that, I think there's a lot of talk going on right now about what might happen in the coming weeks. And at this moment in time, we just don't know what is going to happen. But the president certainly is trying to reassure everyone that he's still in this.",
