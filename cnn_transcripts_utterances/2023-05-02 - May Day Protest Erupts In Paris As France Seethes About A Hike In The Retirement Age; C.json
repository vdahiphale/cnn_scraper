      "sentences": "Whether it`s over a million protesters on the streets against pension reform, or demonstrations againstinfrastructure planning, pesticide bans, or the rise in the cost of living, France is no stranger to protests, and strike action. In fact, the country consistently ranks amongst those most affected by industrial action in Europe. And for national rail workers alone, there hasn`t been a single year without some kind of strike action since 1947. So why do the French protest and strike so much? The origins of the spirits of protests here in France go right back to the French Revolution. And we`ve had a reminder of that historical threads, the cacerolada (ph) protests with pots and pans, of which we`ve seen a resurgence that goes right back to medieval times. We saw it again in the 1830s in a revolution that led to the abdication of Charles X. There is also of course, the question of the famous \"Droits acquis\" these are rights that have been acquired hard won, and that the French don`t want to give up. France does seem to protest more readily and often than many other countries. And that goes back to that social pact that was created after World War II. The French are very attached to it and will take to the streets to protect whatever part of it they feel is under assault. There is also a history of very strong trade unions in this country, and the historical facts that protests can have an effect on the politics of the time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Buckingham Palace, Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, or St Paul`s Cathedral? Westminster Abbey has been the coronation location for every single British monarch since the year 1066. It`s a pretty big deal happening in Westminster Abbey this weekend as King Charles III will officially be crowned on Saturday. According to Buckingham Palace and expected 3000 guests will attend the coronation versus the 8000 who gathered for the late Queen Elizabeth crowning. King Charles became king following the death of his mother in September. Queen Elizabeth II reigned for 70 years, having become queen at the age of 25. King Charles is expected to sit upon his coronation chair, which has been used by monarchs for more than 700 years. But listen to this, his crown is estimated to be worth more than $4 million. And it`s all blinged out with gold, rubies, sapphires, garnet and more. It weighs more than five pounds, making the phrase heavy as the head that wears the crown quite literal. Max Foster is in London with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Her coronation was designed to introduce the young queen to the world and give a morale boost to post-war Britain. 70 years on, and amidst a cost-of- living crisis, King Charles` coronation will have many of the same traditions incorporated, albeit slightly toned down.
