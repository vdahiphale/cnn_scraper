But Trump's lawyers have argued that this was unconstitutional, that as a candidate for office, there's a very high bar for restricting his speech. But Judge Chutkan has said, look, your First Amendment yields to the orderly administration of justice. She said in one of the court hearings, she said, look, I have a trial to oversee here and I can't have him attacking people who are just trying to do their jobs or comply with their civic duty.

Of course, many Palestinians in Gaza don't really feel that it's safe to travel the roads right now because there is such a strong presence of ground troops, IDF ground troops in the area. But what this was, the IDF say was specifically targeting Hamas operatives who were hiding inside an ambulance with weapons and they say their strike was successful. The total number now of civilian casualties is over 9,000 according to the Hamas-led Ministry of Health in Gaza and more than 22,000 civilians injured. It's perhaps not the sort of strike that the Israeli Defense Forces would have liked to have happened when Secretary Blinken was delivering a message to the country and the understanding of the White House now that the IDF would try to use less airstrikes and more ground operations. We are listening and standing near northern Gaza and there has been a significant number of strikes -- airstrikes in northern Gaza tonight. In fact, the IDF says the way that it operates there at the moment is for the troops on the ground to call in airstrikes when they locate Hamas targets. It will be a significant and perhaps dangerous for the troops on the ground, changing tactics to minimize the airstrikes. So it's significant, that we're still hearing gun battles and hearing fights behind us at the northern end of Gaza knowing that the IDF has been in there for a week, yet is still fighting battles on the ground with tanks and machine guns. It hasn't taken control of that area yet. It signifies just how big a job they have yet to do in the rest of the Gaza Strip -- John.",

MICHAEL OREN, ISRAEL'S FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: I don't think so, John. I don't think Israel can. Keep in mind we're dealing with enemy here who is using its own population as human shields, that's what Hamas does, it is preventing Palestinian civilians from fleeing to the relative safety of the south, and is particularly concentrating them around their headquarters, which are located under hospitals and under schools. So in order to get at those headquarters, Israel would have no choice but to destroy those buildings and hope the Palestinian civilians will get out, they are still sending tens of thousands of leaflets. We're sending text messages by the hundreds of thousands. We're sending these like non-lethal projectiles onto buildings. It's called knock-knock. It hits the building, let's the people know in the building that the building is about to be hit and hope that Palestinians will get out. Hamas doesn't always let them get out.

There was a moment with Eric Trump's testimony yesterday in particular, where he was confronted with saying something that he had not been involved in a piece of, I believe, it was a certification.And he was -- there were some emails suggesting that he did know that Trump's sons had blamed things they didn't recall on memory lapses. I think that Donald Trump Jr. was generally perceived as fairing better than his brother did. I don't know how much of a difference it makes in a case -- you will have a probably a stronger opinion on this than I do. I don't know how much of a difference it makes in a case where the judge has already done a partial summary judgment and there are just these outstanding claims. And clearly, the judge is already questioning the credibility of all of the Trumps.",

A lot has happened since then.This is going to be a performance. In one on one direct interpersonal confrontation, he tends to back off. I don't see that being the case here. He is so angry. He has had some time to look at how this courtroom is, how this judge is, because he's been sitting in the trial in the courtroom, which he didn't have to do over a couple of days. But who knows? I mean, he has a history of, you know making extemporaneous remarks during depositions that don't always help him. If he gets himself all worked up, we could see him get himself in trouble. I do think you are seeing just one pause here in terms of what he might be attempting to do. He's not good at discipline, but he can be good at theatrics, and they are clearly trying on the Trump team to try to create a trail to accuse the judge of bias and conceivably ask for a mistrial.",

To the extent you see our names on that, that's really essentially just because our role was to sign, but we had no involvement in the valuation and we didn't really review what was in -- substantively what was in these valuations.We relied on the experts for that. That was expected. But the documents which the judge has already relied on in granting partial summary judgment on that really important first cause of action really do link the brothers to these transactions and suggest that they were involved and that they did sign off on them, which would suggest some intent on their part. Now what remains for the judge to decide in the remaining causes of action is whether they actually did intend to defraud as opposed to just have involvement in the creation of statements that were objectively false and fraudulent. So the judge is going to be making a credibility determination in evaluating their denial that they acted with intent to defraud.",
