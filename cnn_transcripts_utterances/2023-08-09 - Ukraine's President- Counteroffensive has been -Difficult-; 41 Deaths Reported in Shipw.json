In Sudan, hospitals and malls have reached a breaking point. I'll speak to an aid worker on the ground in the country. Welcome back. This is the second hour of \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson. Today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is working with his top military brass on ramping up the grinding counteroffensive. He's admitting that the operation so far has been \"Difficult\". His understatement considering what CNN is seeing firsthand. Our team is on the ground as the bodies and the weapons pile up.

First up though, senior diplomats now are telling CNN about the sobering updatesthat they are receiving on Ukraine's progress to take back its territory. And in the United States there are signs that the public's willingness to keep funding multibillion dollar aid packages with American taxpayer money may be faltering. So tonight we ask has Ukraine war reached a stalemate. Well, Senior International Correspondent, Sam Kiley has been reporting from Ukraine even before the start of Russia's invasion. Today he is here with me in the studio, I'm happy to say. So Sam, I'm going to put that question to you very simply. Is this a stalemate at this point and if so, why?",

The key issue, we know Trump's position, if he were to get nominated for the Republicans. He's not in favor of this, we've pulled troops out, he would definitely cut back on funding that is existential, as far as the Ukrainians concerned, they acknowledge that the burden is heavy, not just on the U.S. taxpayer. But on all of the European taxpayers, these figures are pretty astronomical. But their real problem is here in the polling. That was the support, there is the support rather, that they believe that they've done enough. That is the figure, Americans are saying we've just about given up just over half of Americans think that they've done enough. That was the level of support a year ago when the Russians invaded. So there's been a collapse there. Now that is potentially a political opportunity for somebody, I would argue pretty cynical in terms of international affairs, where you wouldn't worry -- you might want to make hay with that against the Biden Administration. But I think it's very important to hear from John Kirby, the Spokesman for the National Security Council, because he is the word of caution here. He is pushing the Republican sorry the government's positioning the administration's position. And it's a very important one that the Ukrainians desperately need to hear more and more often take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: I think every ally, every partner, every nation, and there's more than 50 of them, including, of course, the United States, that are involved in supporting Ukraine, feels responsible for helping Ukraine be successful on the battlefield. Nobody wants to see them struggle. And like I said, even they admit that they're struggling and they're not doing as well as they they'd like. So we're all going to be dedicated to continuing to help them get what they need.

There's a program it's a five year program in East Jerusalem aimed at East Jerusalemites. And a part of that is designed to enable East Jerusalemites to learn to improve their Hebrew to the extent that they'd be able to study at Hebrew University. These decisions were not made unilaterally by governments of the day. They were held in discussions with, for example, the security establishment. And it was decided that this was the best way both to help those people of East Jerusalem and also the country as a whole. I should also point out, of course, that although Smotrich refers to the previous government as a left wing government, it was a rainbow coalition involving both parties from the left from the center and from the right as well. The course the big difference was that it was the first ever government to include a party that was an Islamist party. And indeed, one of the reasons that Smotrich sites for freezing both the funds for those East Jerusalemites to learn Hebrew and also for the Arab municipalities, it's designed to kind of level up poor municipalities in the country bring them closer to the kind of socio economic level of richer municipalities. The previous government had Mansour Abbas from the Islamist run party and one of the reasons that Smotrich says he is going to be freezing these funds is because the money was set aside for these Arab municipalities simply to placate Mansour Abbas and his party and, of course, his voters. The other reason, of course, that Smotrich is citing and you mentioned the possibility that the money might, he says the money might end up with criminal or terrorist organizations, as he says it's not fair that the money would go to the Arab municipalities and not to poor Jewish municipalities.

I feel like the gender imbalance in Western Museum is definitely something that we should not be emulating in other parts of the world. And I thought I have the opportunity to take a radical step and say no more from now on, we will only be showing a gender balance displays across our exhibitions.",

There are artworks created by artists who were political artists, such as -- Heideggerian, whois shown behind you in this shot, who was an abstract Egyptian artist active since the 1930s. And Becky, she hosted in her home gatherings of the art and liberty group in Egypt, which was the radical leftist group that stood up for artists in Europe at the height of the Mad Z suppression of artists before World War Two. On the other hand, you have artists who created political depictions in their work such as -- of Syria, many others Mona Hatoum, for example of Palestine and so many other women across the course of the second half of the 20th century, depicting political events that took place in the region through their material and their creations.",

However, with the Middle East, I'm very happy to see contemporary artists, setting records. And so, this, I think is a reflection of the global interest in Middle Eastern Art. And also, I think, a signal to young artists, Becky, that they can make a live and a livelihood out of creating art.",
