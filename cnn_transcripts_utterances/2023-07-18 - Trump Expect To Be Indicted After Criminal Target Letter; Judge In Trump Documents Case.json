We're breaking down the gravity and the timing of the potential criminal charges. And I'll talk to a key grand jury witness, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short.This hour, there's also breaking news in the Trump classified documents case. The judge signaling the trial is likely to be pushed back from the December date proposed by the prosecution. Also breaking, new criminal charges in Michigan against 16 participants in an alleged fake electoral scheme who signed certificates falsely claiming Trump won the state in the 2020 presidential election. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Right now, we're following some major fast-moving developments in the criminal investigation of Donald Trump and January 6th and the criminal prosecution of the former president in the classified documents case. CNN's Paula Reid is standing outside the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, for us. That's where a critical hearing just wrapped up a short while ago. But, first, let's go to CNN Anchor and Chief Correspondent Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, I know you have been talking to your sources, and you have excellent sources. What more are you learning tonight about this target letter and is the former president concerned?",

      "sentences": "I think there is definitely a level of concern here, Wolf. This is a letter that we should note Trump's attorneys, including Todd Blanche, one of his top attorneys on many of these cases, got on Sunday night. So, they have known about this for several days. We only found out about today, of course, when Donald Trump posted, letting the world know that he had gotten a target letter, which, of course, as you were noting, does signal the charges could potentially be imminent here.And what this letter does is essentially offers Trump a chance to come and testify before the grand jury. He has four days to do, so that would mean until Thursday he can go before the grand jury. It is widely expected that he is not going to do so, Wolf. They haven't formally communicated that to Jack Smith. They may never communicate that to Jack Smith's team, but it is widely expected he is not going to go. So, that means we could potentially see charges later this week or early next. What those charges are, we don't know. But we do know there is a charge, at least one, listed in this target letter that they got, warning that that is something that their client could be potentially be charged with. We'll see ultimately what Jack Smith does. But now, Trump's team is working behind the scenes here, Wolf, because they have been expecting charges obviously to come from the January 6th investigation. Truly, many of them thought it was going to focus on those attorneys that you saw around the former president in that period of time before the 2020 election, right after the Sidney Powells, the Rudy Giulianis, the John Eastmans, people who were telling him that there was fraud in the election, that they had proof of it, which they never produced, or essentially that he could do things and that the former vice president could do things that he ultimately couldn't do. But what is clear from this letter, obviously, is that Jack Smith is also focusing on the former president himself. And we had an indication that that is where Jack Smith was going, and so did Trump's attorneys, when we found out that they had spoken to people like Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks, obviously, people who can offer insight into Trump's mindset more than they can, the fake elector scheme or something of that nature, so, certainly a level of concern, Wolf. And I should note, Trump is on the campaign trail today. He's going to Iowa. So, we will likely hear from him in his response to this target letter, beyond putting up a defense like he has already on Truth Social.",

It also means that the attorney general, Merrick Garland, who has been briefed all along the way, also thinks that they have a very strong case.

Because of the actions that happened on January 6th, it got in the way of Congress.Conspiracy to defraud the United States is another one because of the fact that the former president, or at least as evidence seems to be indicating, might have been aware that he lost the election and yet still proceeded with acts and formal statements and documents being filed and so on, that could be evidence for conspiracy to defraud the United States.

He joined in early April, I believe it was. And then Chris Kise, who is the former solicitor general in Florida, is also someone who has been on the legal team and has been appearing in court for Trump's appearances. But as we noted, last month, when Trump got indicted in the documents case, the next day, you saw John Reilly and Jim Trusty depart the team. Those are two people, one who is working closely on the January 6th investigation, and the other was working closely on the documents investigation. So, two people who kind of had this wealth of knowledge, I guess you would say, going back to as this investigation has been going on and now these new attorneys are going to be balancing this. It's been six weeks since Trump was indicted in Florida and he has yet to formally announce who his new attorney in the documents investigation is going to be.

And Mr. Trump has until Thursday to report to the grand jury. If Jack Smith has evidence of criminality, should Donald Trump be held accountable?GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): So, here's the problem. This country is going down the road of criminalizing political differences. And I think that's wrong. Alvin Bragg stretched the statute in Manhattan to be able to try to target Donald Trump. Most people, even people on the left acknowledge that if that wasn't Trump, that case would not have likely been brought against a normal civilian. And so you have a situation where the Department of Justice and FBI have been weaponized against people they don't like and the number one example of that happened to be against Donald Trump with the Russia collusion. That was not a legitimate investigation. That was being done to try to drive Trump out of office. And so what I've said, as president, my job is to restore a single standard of justice to end weaponization of these agencies. We're going to have a new FBI on director on day one. We're going to have big changes at the Department of Justice. Americans across the political spectrum need to have confidence that what is going on is based on the rule of law, not based on what political tribe you're in. And then the second thing I would say it this country needs to have a debate about the country's future. If I'm the nominee, we'll be able to focus on President Biden's failures and I'll be able to articulate a positive vision for the future. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened four years ago in January. And so I want to focus on looking forward. I don't want to look back. I do not want to see him. I hope he doesn't get charged. I don't think it will be good for the country. But at the same time, I've got to focus on looking forward and that's what we're going to do.

He was aware of 59 of the 60 lawsuits he brought that they had failed, including in front of Trump judges.I think he'd been advised by his own White House lawyers that the vice president did not have any such authority to overturn the election. And I have yet to hear any Republicans suggest that Kamala Harris should have that authority in 2024. So, I think it's more than that. But whether or not it crosses a threshold and to -- I think there has to be some sort of discretion by the Department of Justice, the threshold of prosecuting a former president of the United States is a very serious thing.

And I think the administration is doing that. I would also, wolf, get rid of the travel ban that President Trump put in. And, by the way, I think President Trump meeting with a North Korean, that was the right thing to do. It didn't lead to much, but that was the right thing to do. But we put a travel ban that prevents NGOs, groups like mine and others from going into North Korea and helping with humanitarian issues. We were trying to get the remains of our American soldiers from the Korean War. We were able to get seven several years ago. And you were there with me, and you know that dealing with the North Koreans, they're very unpredictable. They're very sensitive. Everything comes from Kim Jong Un, every direction.
