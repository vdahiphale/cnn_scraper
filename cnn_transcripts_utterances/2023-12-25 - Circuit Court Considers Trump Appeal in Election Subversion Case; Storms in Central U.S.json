Right now, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing former President Trump's requests Saturday to drop the charges in his federal election subversion case. Trump is urging the panel to overturn a lower court ruling, rejecting his argument that he's protected under presidential immunity. Joining me now is CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson.

And what that looks like is it looks like it's going to be seen, Danny, on a fast-track basis. Oral arguments are expected to happen in a couple of weeks. That's January 9th. Briefing has been done. And so the D.C. Circuit Court will evaluate that question. It's an intermediate court. And then I would anticipate that whoever wins or loses, there will be a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which as you know, has rejected at least the immediate, right, skipping the intermediate D.C. Court. They've rejected that for now. But I suspect that they will get their hands involved in the very near future.",

Trump is no different from anybody else. But the critical question becomes whether or not he can be tried prior to the election, given the fact that now we have another court, right, the D.C. appellate court, evaluating the decision. In the event that they make a quick decision, does that mean that this March date that's set for trial will go forward? Highly unlikely. And if it's moved back, what time period will it be moved back? And if the Supreme Court gets it, when will they evaluate it, and will they make a decision prior to the election? So to your question, I think it's an open question as to whether the voters will have the ability to evaluate the guilt or innocence of the person they're voting for.

There's not that many in airplanes, and there's only about 94 that have been canceled so far, maybe a little bit higher, according to Flight Aware. But we'll see. Even some of those cancellations are in Phoenix, which are likely not even weather-related. But the rain is what we're talking about here. Driving today, getting to the next place in your location, in your little itinerary. New Orleans had two inches of rainfall yesterday, and in some spots there around Louisiana, it is still raining. Now, don't get me wrong, Louisiana has been in a horrible drought. They will take two inches of rain any time that they'll let them. But there are blizzard warnings across parts of the upper Midwest: Nebraska, South Dakota, even parts of Kansas. And there's going to be a little bit of ice to the West of Minneapolis in those areas there where people go to the lakes and do their ice fishing. Unfortunately, it hasn't been nearly cold enough for that. There's your rainfall, though, for the next couple of days. Could be an inch or two in some spots. So not so worried about airport travel today. Not that many people flying in and out of Omaha, or Lincoln, or Sioux Falls, or all those areas up there. But it's the rainfall that's going to hit the East Coast Tuesday night and into Wednesday. If you are flying on Wednesday, it would be a great idea to get that app and look what your plane would do -- really, your plane is doing. Because there's so much weather out here: low clouds, rainfall, and even some winds to 20. Airplanes don't like to fly very close to each other when you get in that kind of weather -- Danny.",

Economic sentiment in the tank, you know, which feels like the last couple of years of inflation. And so 2024, is it more to be, like, more of this?

So some of these more competitive congressional races and swing seats, including in New York where there are about six competitive seats, could go either way. Same for California. That's really going to be where the money is spent, where the attention is directed. But take a look also at the legal calendar that Donald Trump has, versus the primary calendar. And I just really wish I could see what that Google setup looked like, the colors. Because you know, you have -- you have the Iowa caucuses, but then he has the jury deciding what the damages are in the defamation case. You have New Hampshire. And then another civil trial begins. And then you have South Carolina. And that's the start of this big federal criminal trial into whether he interfered in the 2020 elections.
