And the top U.S. diplomat is heading to the region to try to calm things down.For some graphic video, ISIS is claiming responsibility for a pair of explosions in the southern part of Iran that killed more than 80 people. It happened at a memorial for slain Iranian General Qasem Soleimani on Wednesday. In Iraq, militias also says a top commander of a pro-Iranian proxy group was killed in a strike in Baghdad. The U.S. would only say that a member of the group was targeted. Between Lebanon, mourning the death of a senior Hamas official who was killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike on Tuesday. All of this going on amid the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war. The IDF reported intense battles Thursday in and around Khan Yunis in Gaza. The Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched another unsuccessful attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea. U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is on his way to the region, hoping to keep the conflict from getting worse. He's expected to visit eight countries and the West Bank in the next few days. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following the developments from Abu Dhabi, and joins us now live. Good to have you there for us, Paula. So, ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly twin bombing attack in Iran. This the latest outbreak of violence in the Middle East. What does it mean for the risk of it spreading?",

But they said that two suicide bombers, brothers, carried out the attack. Now that does differ from what we heard from the interior minister who said they believed that the first blast was actually a suitcase bomb planted in a car and detonated remotely. But what does is it does put more pressure on Iran and it does, of course, raise once again the tensions in the region when you consider what has happened just in recent days. The U.S. carrying out a strike here in Baghdad to target a pro-Iranian militia group. And of course, they're coming under almost daily attacks from those militia groups, the U.S. troops in both Iraq and Syria. You have these skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah on the Lebanese border. A top Hamas official just earlier this week being killed in Lebanon which was widely attributed to Israel. And then of course the commercial shipping which is coming under attack from Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. All of this combined layer upon layer of tensions does raise concerns that there could be a miscalculation in any one of these elements that could spread the violence further. Lynda?",

And still be able to conduct, you know, an on-the-street terror attack.I'm also not that convinced that it would contribute all that much to the concerns we all have that the current war between Israel and Hamas would spread. This seems to be more of an internal issue, as ISIS has always been between Sunni and Shiites. Of course, the Iranian first instinct was to blame Israel and the United States.

And whether or not you could put together some kind of pause in fighting. The U.S. does not want to call it a ceasefire to resume the kind of hostage exchanges that we saw a month ago. That would be a big step.The visits elsewhere in the region are to try to get everybody to calm the proxies down. Because, you know, the biggest risk when you're in a situation like this is one of either acts or miscalculation. An action perhaps in the Red Sea, for example, that is intended to be one kind of attack and turned into something more severe. For example, one of the things that Secretary Blinken I'm sure is concerned about is what happens if the Houthis actually managed to sink one of these ships that they've been attacking. What happens if they open up again on American forces coming to the aid of one of those ships, which happened last weekend, and led to the U.S. Navy sinking three of these Houthi fast boats. So, they're sort of right on the edge here between reestablishing some deterrence.

Almost like the demilitarized zone but in the water. Now the artillery that was fired by the North into the South only stayed in the northern border, it did not enter southern territory. No one was hurt, no one was injured, but it's yet another affliction of this back and forth we have seen between North and South Korea.

It's yet another possible setback for Trump's hopes of reclaiming the White House.The latest, voters group in Illinois and Massachusetts have filed motions to remove him from the 2024 election ballots in their states. They cite his role in the January 6 attack and the insurrectionist ban in the U.S Constitution's 14th amendment. It's unclear how and when these new challenges will be adjudicated. They come as the U.S. Supreme Court is widely expected to review a state court ruling in Colorado. A decision in that case could settle his eligibility for the entire nation. Well, a new report from the U.S. House Democrats says foreign governments spent millions of dollars to Donald Trump's businesses and properties while he was in office. Trump did not step away from his business holdings before assuming the presidency, meaning he could still profit with little transparency. CNN's Jessica Schneider has the details.

(END VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the start of Donald Trump's presidency, he promised to hand over control of his companies to his two sons, but he refused to divest his assets and he retained ownership. Now, a report released by House Democrats reveals how Trump and his business raked in at least $7.8 million from foreign governments during his time in the White House. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): He not only lied his own pockets, but he repeatedly sold out the American public interests in favor of the interests of these foreign governments.",

Meanwhile, Republicans continue to make the so far unproven allegations that President Biden had benefited from his son's business dealings in China and Ukraine. But in response to the report about Trump's businesses, Republican House oversight chair James Comer, who is leading the investigation into the Bidens saying, it's beyond parity that Democrats continue their obsession with former President Trump. Former President Trump has legitimate business but the Bidens do not. And congressional Democrats are releasing this report now because they want people to be aware of Trump's business entanglements with foreign governments going into 2024. And Congressman Raskin tells me he is working on legislation that would mandate reporting to Congress for any president or official who takes in foreign money.

You can see from the video here from northern France, again roadways, fields, underwater. And it's been that way for a few days now.Now the next system that is really starting to shift from northern Europe down into towards the Mediterranean, so the focus of the rainfall over the next few days is really going to be across portions of Italy, Greece and right the along the Adriatic Sea. And that's where you are going to have the highest totals for rain as well as snow. Here you can see across the alps, still looking at areas about 30 to 40 centimeters, but the heaviest rain is going to be focused along Italy, as well as Greece where we could pick up 50 to 100 millimeters total as we head through the weekend. The other big story has been the extreme cold temperatures. Take a look at some of these numbers. All of these locations are in the Arctic circle. But even for these areas, this is extremely cold. All of these locations bumming below minus 40 degrees, even places further south, say like Oslo and Helsinki, not quite as cold but still much colder than they normally would be for this particular time of year. Now the good news is we are going to finally start to see that frigid air begin to shift off to the east and get some relief, but it's very slow to do so. So, for a lot of these locations, it's still likely going to take several more days before we see those temperatures climbing back to normal. Take Oslo, for example, still temperatures well below average until at least Monday of next week before we finally start to see them rebound, getting closer to where they should be this time of year. Stockholm very similar conditions. Those temperatures well below average until Monday of next week. Finally, by the time we get to Tuesday and Wednesday, we see them rebound back to at least seasonal averages this time of year.",
