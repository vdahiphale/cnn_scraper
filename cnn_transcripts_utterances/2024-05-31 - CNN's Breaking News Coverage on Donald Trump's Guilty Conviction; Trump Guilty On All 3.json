I'm Kim Brunhuber, joining you live from Atlanta with breaking news on the conviction of Donald Trump.It marks a massive, volatile moment in American and legal history that's unfolding in the midst of a U.S. presidential race. After about 12 hours of deliberations over two days, a New York jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to former adult film star Stormy Daniels in an effort to influence the 2016 election. Trump has now the distinction of being the first former U.S. president to become a convicted felon. He's expected to hold a news conference at Trump Tower in the day ahead. After leaving the courthouse, Trump recycled some familiar complaints and blasted the entire legal process areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people. And they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here. You have a sole respect D.A. and the whole thing. We didn't do a thing wrong. I'm a very innocent man. And it's okay. I'm fighting for our country. I'm fighting for our Constitution. I'm fighting for our people. And we'll keep fighting. We'll fight till the end and we'll win. Because our country's gone to hell. We don't have the same country anymore. We have a divided mess. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They were laughing. They were smiling. It seemed like they expected that this meant no verdict. They were going to go home and come back the next day. The judge comes back on the bench at 4:36 and he says, I have a note signed by the jury at 4:20. He says they have a verdict. The entire mood changed. Trump crossed his arms. The room was still. No one was speaking or talking. It was extremely quiet and everyone was just sitting there waiting. Then the judge came back on the bench. He said that the jury needed 30 minutes to fill out the form. Then they came back. He brought them in. The jurors walked to the seats in the jury box. They didn't look at Donald Trump. They normally don't, but they didn't today either. They went. They sat down in their seats and then the judge asked them, is this true? You have a verdict. The foreman said yes, that they do. Then the judge's clerk had said to the foreman, going through each of these counts one by one with the foreman saying guilty, guilty 34 times. While the jury is reading the verdict, Trump was sitting in his seat looking straight ahead. Then after that, the judge had asked, had the clerk asked the jury, did everyone unanimously agree that this was their verdict? The jurors audibly said yes. And then he asked if anybody wanted the jury polled individually. Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, said that he did. [02:04:58] And so the clerk then went through each of the jurors to poll them. At that point, Trump had turned to look at them. And when the jurors answered the questions, most of them were looking directly at the judge. I saw some look down. None seemed, again, to look at Donald Trump. Then the judge had said to the jurors he wanted to thank them for their service. He asked them if they could stay behind because he wanted to talk to them individually once he finished up with what the business was still in the courtroom. So that's when the jurors left. He also thanked the alternate jurors. He had them brought into the courtroom and to sit in the front row while the jury was delivering the verdict. I've never seen that. Usually the alternate jurors are excused. Sometimes they're asked to stay on. But they're not ever brought back in to sit and witness the verdict in the case that they were so diligently paying attention to over the past seven weeks. So after the jury left, then the judge Merchant spoke to Trump's lawyers. They moved for an appeal saying they thought, based on Michael Cohen's testimony that he lied on the stand. The judge rejected that. And then they set the sentencing date for July 11. There'll be some motions due before then. So then as Donald Trump was leaving the courtroom, he stood up. He had a frown on his face. His face was red. He walked to the divider. And that is when his son, Eric Trump, is sitting right behind him. He reached out to Eric Trump's hand, shook it vigorously. And then as he was walking past Eric Trump, Eric patted his father on the back. And then Trump walked out the center aisle of the courtroom and headed to the cameras where he spoke. Certainly a dramatic day. I talked to someone in Trump's camp who was telling me afterwards, he said that Trump was in good spirits and ready to fight. That was not the expression as he was walking out of the courtroom. He looked a bit wounded. And I don't want to speak for him, but he looked a bit upset when he was walking out of that courtroom with a frown on his face and his face red in an appearance. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So I didn't think that there would be any decision other than guilty on all counts. The defense put on by Donald Trump's team was really about Michael Cohen.

On the other hand, plenty of aggravating factors as well, including the number of counts, the lack of remorse. I mean, which side do you think the judge will land on here? MARTINDonald Trump's team is going to come into court and do what a typical defense team would do, provide those factors that you just identified as mitigating factors, talking about his age, talking about this being a first-time offense for him. I think their arrogance and their hubris, they're probably going to come in and continue to argue that this was a sham trial, that Michael Cohen was a liar that this verdict should be thrown out because it was based on Michael Cohen's testimony. I don't see them making the standard mitigating arguments that you would expect from your typical defendant. And as you indicated, there are multiple, multiple aggregating factors. The fact that he has not shown any remorse, that he's not accepted any responsibility that he continues to violate the gag order, that there are at least ten documented violations of that gag order. He left court today and, again, attacked the whole process, attacked the judicial system, attacked the judge. He didn't come out and accept any personal responsibility. So I think it would be almost impossible for this judge not to sentence him to some jail time, even if it's on the lower end of the four years.",

Those are things that normal defendants get to do without facing very, very significant penalties for their conduct.And I think this judge has proven that he's not going to treat Donald Trump any other way than any other defendant that is in his courtroom. He's going to hold him to account and he's going to treat him in the same way any other defendant would be treated.

They will make arguments about Michael Cohen and the fact that the jury relying on in their estimation, any testimony from Michael Cohen automatically nullifies the decision by this jury and renders its decision null and void. But I don't think that's going to be a winnable argument at the appellate level. It wasn't a winnable argument with this judge.And I think the reality is Donald Trump has to, like anyone else that commits a crime in the state of New York or any state, he has to be held accountable and he is not above the law.

And he's going to have to grapple with the fallout of that. However, having said that, I think the -- the recognition of that won't last very long. We seem to be in a very similar situation to the one we were in after the 2020 election. Privately, he was able to concede that he had lost. But very quickly after that, the humiliation sort of overwhelmed him. And we ended up with the big lie, which led to stop the steal, which led to the insurrection. So unfortunately, I do think we need to be braced for a pivot to his attempts, at least, to create another alternate reality in which he can protect himself from what is unquestionably a devastating loss in court today. He's incapable of accepting what happened. And he's certainly incapable of admitting that he'd done anything wrong. So that's just going to complicate things for him going forward. I said this in 2020, before the election, that because we know that Donald was already saying that he wasn't going to accept the results unless he won. He was already saying that it was rigged in case that he lost. So we are in similar territory, except, of course, things are worse and more dangerous than they were four years ago. And we saw this yesterday. Michael Fanone, Capitol Police officer who laid his life on the line to protect the Capitol, to protect all of the people in that building and to protect American democracy, went to the courthouse in New York City and he spoke his mind. Not long after that, his mother's house was swatted. So Donald has long been engaging in stochastic terrorism. He uses his power, his platform and his influence to get his followers to commit acts of violence on his behalf. That's something we desperately need to look out for. There is nothing this man will not stoop to. If he feels like he's going down, he will absolutely take the rest of us with him. That was true four years ago. It's even more true now. It's especially true now that he has finally faced justice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden is traveling in Delaware and aides traveling with him declined to share additional details with CNN and the traveling pool about how President Biden learned of the historic decision, who relayed the news to him and where he was when he received it.

So it's a big question of where those voters will go. Those voters who have said, we're done with Trump, we saw January 6. We're done with that messaging. It's time to move on.

He had brought up so many issues around whether or not there were people who weren't supposed to be on the roles at all and even on his own panels that investigated it, they found no evidence as such. He has used it following the 2020 election.And, of course, we saw that there was again, no evidence that this -- that the election was rigged. And yet we continue good to see people who believe this, this messaging. So when Donald Trump says something is rigged, so many Americans tend to believe that that is true even if the evidence holds -- holds counter to that, and political violence is absolutely a concern even before this verdict today, political violence was a real concern. We saw it after the 2020 election. And regardless of the outcome of the 2024 election, it's absolutely a concern and a concern for the status and wellbeing of our democracy.",
