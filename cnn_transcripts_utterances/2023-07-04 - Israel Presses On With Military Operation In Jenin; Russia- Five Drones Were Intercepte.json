U.N. aid agencies are expressing alarm at the scale of the operation.CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now live in Tel Aviv. Hadas? HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Hey Max, I'm actually just arrived at the scene of this car. I mean, police have already cordoned off several blocks here. This is a neighborhood, I would say it's in northeast Tel Aviv. And according to police in the last hour, two hours is when this ramming attack took place, it took place just outside a shopping center. I spoke to a witness who says that they saw the car come up and hit what looked to be pedestrian standing outside the shopping center, potentially at a bus stops. They say that the bus stop, and we can see it is completely destroyed. Police say that the driver then got out and tried to stab people. It was shot dead by an armed civilian who was on the scene. We know that at least eight people are injured. At least one of them is critical. And police are calling this a terror attack.

The task, the news agency reports that 17, or rather 14 flights were diverted from one of Moscow's four airports.We heard Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Press for the Foreign Ministry, saying that the target was an area that included civilian infrastructure, as well as that airport. Now, the Ukrainians, as is the case, as it's always the case, have not claimed responsibility for this. But we did get a statement from an adviser to the Ukrainian President basically saying it's rather ironic that a country that has spent almost 16 months pummeling civilian infrastructure. And just last week hitting a pizzeria in Kramatorsk, killing 13 people, that they are complaining about some targeting, alleged targeting of civilian infrastructure in Moscow. Now, this isn't the first time that drones have been sighted and perhaps brought down over Moscow. Last in May, there was a similar incident in which one drone allegedly exploded above the Kremlin. Russian officials claimed it was an attempt to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin. And in that instance as well, the Ukrainians did not comment. Max?",

With some 50,000 troops near Bakhmut, the fighting is fierce and tricky, with the same position changing hands several times a day.Ben Wedeman brings us the latest from inside Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Ukraine's much anticipated counteroffensive now well into its fourth week. The front lines ever more intense. But the gains so far are small and incremental. Ukrainian forces are pushing forward in the south liberating just over 150 kilometers, that's only 60 square miles. But as Ukraine advances, the country's deputy defense minister says Russia is stepping up attacks in the east. The enemy is trying to force our troops out of their positions, but is receiving a worthy rebuff, she said in her latest update. On several front, Russian forces are managing to move forward now on the offensive in the town of Svatove in the Luhansk region. Back in Moscow, Russia's military leaders continued to project strength even after the recent mutiny by Wagner mercenaries.",

Last night, we have documented that two of our ambulances were stopped and the EMTs that are working on those ambulances were took out of the cars. And the Israel occupation soldiers took the keys of the ambulances and the phone -- the mobile points that were wells with our medical teams. At the same time, we were delayed access in other occasions or complete denied access to certain locations inside the refugee camp. The humanitarian case is very hard for people, civilians who are inside the refugee camps. Yesterday, we received tens of calls of families asking us to help in evacuating them. We were able to evacuate some humanitarian cases for elderly people, sick people, families who have children to outside the camp. Until now, we are still monitoring the situation, coordinating with our partners in international organizations to coordinate our response, humanitarian response in Jenin. We're still assessing the number of people who are now inside the shelter and what are the basic needs for those family who were evacuated outside of the refugee camp. Taken into consideration that most of the families were evacuated outside the camp to houses of family, relatives or friends. However, there is a number of families. They are in a shelf right now.",
