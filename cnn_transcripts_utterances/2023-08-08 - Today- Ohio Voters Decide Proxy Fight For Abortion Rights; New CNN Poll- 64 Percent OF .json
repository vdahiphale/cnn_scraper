Just about a year ago, we saw the amendment in Kansas pass to enshrine abortion rights there, just shy of 60 percent. In Kentucky, another red state, just shy of 60 percent as well. So we asked the Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who's a leading proponent of issue one, why something like this is constitutional or even appropriate. This is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRANK LAROSE, (R) OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE: I think that that's a silly idea. I mean, it's a -- this is democracy at work. Asking the people, do they want to have the same kind of common sense protections in place that many other states have? Many other states around the country, many states don't even allow a citizen initiated constitutional amendment. Again, the political rhetoric from the no side is going to be what it's going to be. But this is a common sense thing for Ohioans to say that we own our Constitution and it shouldn't be for sale to out of state special interests. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, this is crossing more than just normal party lines, but Democrats, if you look at it that way, are spending more on television ads than Republican aligned groups. There's been an ad war in television campaigns as well. And this is all going to culminate.The polls are still open. People have been walking in fairly slowly. But going into Election Day here, more than 700,000 people had already voted. So, the polls close at 7:30 tonight. And Ohio counts their ballots fairly quickly, so we are expecting a result tonight on issue one. And then, of course, regardless, it goes on to November. So abortion will be front and center here in Ohio, really the biggest argument of anywhere in the country for the next several months, of course, going into the next campaign as well. Jake.",

And actually, to his point about -- of course it's about abortion, and there's no way around it. Now, I believe that there should be a 60 percent threshold, but I would have liked to have seen it a year ago or two years ago put into place, not now. But to the point about the polls showing support for abortion, I think what you're going to find is that if this loses today, if Prop One loses and then the abortion question is -- wins in November, then it's not really an issue next year. And so, I don't know what you're fighting for next year. Now, if it wins today, then you could then surmise, all right, then we'll try again next year and get the 88 counties the votes there and then really put it on the ballot in the Senate race. So in a way, I think losing now for the abortion rights folks helps them next year because then they can come back stronger and make it an issue in the Senate campaign.

But behind the scenes, a lot of Republicans believe that this is a foregone conclusion, that Republicans are marching toward opening this impeachment inquiry. But the huge question is, would the votes exist on the House floor to actually open this inquiry? It is true that normally when you would open an investigation of impeachment, you have to have a vote in the House of Representatives.And we know that Kevin McCarthy has a slim majority. Just a handful of Republicans could really block this from moving forward. I think that's why you're seeing the speaker be so careful in how he talks about this, arguing that he believes they could get more evidence potentially if they open the impeachment inquiry, but again, stopping short of saying when he would open it.",

The committees need to do more digging to clarify this. There's tons of smoke, but let's verify what's beneath it all.\"You're picking up there that there are a lot of Republicans who might still have questions about whether this is the best path forward, both because they are not sure the evidence exists and also because electorally it could be problematic for them, Jake.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, you know, when talking about overdiagnosis, it's not saying that they found things that weren't there. They found these specific breast cancers. But what this study is really saying is that they found breast cancers in older women that may not have likely ever caused a problem in their lifetime, breast cancers that would not grow significantly or that the woman simply would not live long enough for that breast cancer to be a problem.And here's what they found. As you got older, the over diagnosis became more common, ages 70 to 74, 31 percent, 75 to 84, 47 percent, 85 plus, Jake, 54 percent. So this is one of those things. On one hand, we hear we've heard recently that earlier screening may beneficial, but this is really looking at women who are older and the benefit of screening at that age, it's still an open question. But again, those numbers are worth paying attention to.",

The task force says women 40 and older should be screened. Right now, the official recommendation is until age 50, talk to your doctor if you have a family history, if there's some other concern that increases your risk, probably getting those breast cancer screenings earlier, 50 to 74, that's the clear evidence. That's when you should be getting one every couple of years, more often if there's obviously concerns.And then again, it's the 75 plus, Jake, for all the reasons were just talking about, which is still a little bit of an open question, if you've had breast cancer in the past. And now you're 74, 75 years older, you should still be getting screened, obviously. But if you've never had a positive mammogram, never had a concern, no family history, when you get to 75, I think that's what this study shows is you run into the real risk of over diagnosis at that point. So, as always, talk to your doctor about that.",

Moments ago, Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for Friday where both sides will discuss what restrictions, if any, should be placed on Mr. Trump's ability to publicly share evidence with the public in that 2020 election case. Trump's team has tried to push that hearing to next week, but Judge Chutkan was not willing to delay it. She did say, however, that Trump himself is not required to be at the hearing in person. The mayor of Tampa, Florida, reeling in quite a catch, we'll explain next on the lead. But first, here's CNN's Wolf Blitzer to tell us what's next in this Situation Room. Wolf?",
