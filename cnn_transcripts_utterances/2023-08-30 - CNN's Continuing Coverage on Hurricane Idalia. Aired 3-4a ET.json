I'm Omar Jimenez, live in New York, but we are following breaking news out of Florida.Hurricane Idalia is barreling toward Florida's Big Bend coast and is expected to make landfall in the coming hours. Forecasters say it will be a once-in-a-lifetime event for the residents of the Gulf Coast. Idalia is currently a Category 3 storm, forecast to become a Category 4 when it makes landfall. That means maximum sustained winds of at least 130 miles an hour. Authorities warn the storm surge could reach 12 to 16 feet in some areas and will likely not be survivable. Low-lying areas are already seeing flooding further down Florida's west coast, including Pinellas County. More than seven million people are also under tornado watches. Cedar Key is an island city in the Big Bend area, which could be completely cut off by flooding. Officials have been going door to door there to make sure residents evacuate, but not everyone is heeding the warnings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): This is crunch time right now. We're going to get hit with a major hurricane. It'll be sometime the eye will arrive on shore sometime tomorrow morning most likely. And it is going to have major impacts. So it's likely to cause a lot of damage. And that's just the reality. So be prepared for that. Be prepared to lose power and just know that there's a lot of folks that are going to be there to help you get back on your feet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Gloria, I mean, we've been seeing?e've seen rain come in. We've seen winds pick up at different hours. What are you seeing right now? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Omar, in the last hour or so, it has been all about the wind here in Clearwater. The wind has significantly picked up. The rain has let up for at least the past hour or so. It kind of comes in and out and trickles. But as you heard, we are expecting this hurricane to continue to gather strength and speed as it hovers over the Gulf of Mexico. And it is approaching the west coast of Florida. And it's not far from Cedar Key. I believe we have a live look at what conditions look like there. We're starting to see a lot of the waves incoming into the area. Now just a little bit about Cedar Key. This is a small community. This is a small area mostly known for its fishing and it is an area that is under mandatory evacuation orders. As you mentioned at the beginning, law enforcement went door to door earlier today, trying to make sure that people made it out of there. We do know from officials there in the area that there are about 100 people who stayed behind. And that is going to be troubling because at some point it is possible that Cedar Key is cut off from the rest of the mainland. This is a tiny, tiny island there that is going to be in the direct path of that hurricane, Hurricane Idalia continuing to gather strength. So the situation there is going to be dire. Here, where we are, in Clearwater beach, part of Pinellas County. There's also a mandatory evacuation order and the concern here is the storm surge. We are about from where I'm standing about a quarter of a mile, I would say to the edge of the beach in that direction. And we watched earlier today as hotel workers here in the area kind of line the area with sandbags trying to prevent that water from coming in. So far it stayed away but if the storm surge does start to move inland to where we are right now, we are expecting to see anywhere from four to seven feet of  water moving in this direction. There are other parts of the county here in Pinellas that are already seeing some flooding from that water coming in from the beach. So the next critical hours will determine whether or not that water starts moving inland, and that is going to potentially cause a lot of problems as Idalia continues its path headed to the western coast of Florida.

And it feels like the hand of death. And I've never been an alarmist about hurricanes. I always think it's going to be just fine. But I'm concerned about this place that I love so much. We haven't had anything like this since the Great Cedar Key Hurricane of 1896. And I think it's going to be three times as bad as that. So this island that we all love, I have great concerns, will largely not be here as we know it 48 hours from now. There's just a certain quality of folks that live and make their living here on the water. We're an individualistic type people and there's just a certain amount of folks that just aren't going to leave. And I mean I'm on my high horse preaching about leaving but yet here I sit. So there's just some percentage of the folks in an island community that are going to ride it out with the island. And to the extent that I can try to be as safe as I can and help my neighbors.

We are about 10 miles inland off the Gulf of Mexico, but last night it was quite still very hot and humid. I was seeing flashes of lightning in the distance as we had a tornado watch here in effect.

But you, like me sometimes, I covered Hurricane Michael, I covered Irma, you name it, you go down the list there. What is something that you see while a storm is coming in like this that you hope residents don't see, that you hope that they've gotten far away from? Is there anything that comes to mind that when you see it you're like, wow, that's the reason they're telling people to evacuate?JAYJACK (on the phone): Well, the biggest concern with these hurricanes and for people needing to evacuate is that storm surge. Storm surge is by far the deadliest part of a hurricane. This one's expected to get up to 15, 16 feet of storm surge. Here in Perry, Florida, fortunately we're about 46 feet above sea level. So we're not gonna really have that storm surge effect here, but as you get closer to the coast, the elevation goes down to coastal marshes and forest land. You know, it's gonna be, you can't even hardly see the Gulf of Mexico when you drive along the coast here. There's only a few spots where you can see it. So if you stay along the coast here in the Big Bend region where this hurricane is coming across, this is a deadly storm surge. You're likely not gonna survive 16 foot of storm surge coming across the land along the coast. But you know, the wind can be dangerous too. There is going to be flying debris, sheet metal. You know, this area does not see a lot of major hurricanes. I think the last one was in the 1800s, perhaps. There was a Category 2 in 1968 that hit around Cedar Key area. So this area is not familiar with these major hurricanes. There's going to be a lot of buildings here that are not built with modern technology to be able to withstand the full force of a cat four hurricane. So now there's going to be a lot of debris flying around. Power is going to be knocked out. So if you didn't evacuate and you are in the area, you should expect to have no power for the next two to three, maybe four days, maybe for a week. There'll probably be no power here in the hardest areas.",

They're 45 to about 60 miles per hour. That doesn't really speak of the whole story. It's a storm surge, deadly. The number one deadly aspect of a hurricane, a category four with a storm surge of 8 feet, 10 feet, 12, 15 feet is unimaginable. This should probably make landfall probably around 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. My colleague meteorologist Alison Chinchar will be here at the top of the hour to continue to update you throughout the day. Here we go, and then by Wednesday evening, could it still possibly be at hurricane strength in South Georgia or right along the border with South Carolina and Georgia? Certainly can and the projection is that it will, under a state of emergency North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida as you can well imagine. But there could be severe flooding in these low lying areas. It's all low lying areas. I've checked the elevation of numerous cities across the panhandle in the Big Bend area. Well we go through time and here we see some of those bands still moving on shore for Tampa Gainesville still affecting St. Mark's, Apalachicola, Tallahassee, Gainesville. We will see widespread trees down already, some 40,000 customers without power across Florida. That number is going to go exponentially.

Now it's around 10 due to the heat trapping pollution that comes from, from burning fossil fuels.

And it feels like the summer of 2023, we saw these numbers where people went, wow, this is off the charts faster than we anticipated.And it just creates more storm energy. It's more energy for these hurricanes, it's steroids, whatever metaphor you want to use. One degree of warming, Fahrenheit, can lead to a 10 percent greater intensity of the storm. There's other factors involved, wind shear and El Nino and all that stuff. But, this is coming at a time when you've got a lot of folks who know these waters, who have known the hurricanes of years past, and are sort of setting their risk management around the world that really no longer exists. One guy is Mike Baker, a captain here who's ferried presidents out on fishing trips down here. He knows these waters better than most. He's deciding to stay, and I asked him why. (on-camera): Talk about the decision to stay when something like this seems so obvious.",

You know, part of the appeal for a lot of people who's moving here is that no one's going to tell you what to do. Well, now you've got authorities telling you what to do. That is, get out of these low- lying areas for your own sake. Nobody's coming back to help you until it's too late. The cautionary tale from a year ago, less than a year ago, Hurricane Ian. And when it hit Lee County, most of the dust came from storm surge. That is just not survivable if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Coastal regions could experience storm surges up to 16 feet, which officials say will be unsurvivable in some areas. More now on the big concern here, the storm surge.
