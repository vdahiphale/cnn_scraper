And the day after the debate I reached out to several House Democrats. They're all up, right? They're all up this year. And I asked, off the record, does he need to step down? They all, to a person, just said yes. Yes. Because of those down ballot races that they're all worried about. They're worried about their own survival. They're also worried about the health of the party. And I don't know if you guys saw John King the other night, but he's talking about a path to 330 for Donald Trump. That is an overwhelming mandate. If Donald Trump gets to 330, Democrats don't get to say he eked it out but we won the Electoral College. You know, this is a referendum on Joe Biden.
