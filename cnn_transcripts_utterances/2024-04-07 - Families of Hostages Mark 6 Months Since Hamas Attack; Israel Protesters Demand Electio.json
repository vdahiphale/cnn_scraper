I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong.Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" Hamas unleashed a deadly assault six months ago, igniting the war between Israel and Gaza. I'll speak to the brother of one of the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th from the Nova Music Festival. Plus, one mischievous black squirrel trying to eat the sun and the community rallying to scare it away. We'll look at the legend an indigenous American nation has for Monday's total solar eclipse. And we're hours away from the NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament final. CNN Sports' Andy Scholes joins me live to see if Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark has what it takes to win it all. Well, today is a milestone in the Israel-Hamas war. It's been six months since the Hamas attack that led to the war. In Tel Aviv today, these family members of hostages taken by Hamas staged a performance to mark the anniversary. Meanwhile, Hamas says it's sending a delegation to Cairo on Sunday for ceasefire and hostage talks. Sources tell CNN that directors of the CIA and Israeli's intelligence services will also be there. Six months ago today, Hamas staged a surprise attack in Israel, including at the Nova Musical Festival. Hamas killed more than a thousand people and took more than 200 hostages. Israel then ordered a complete siege of Gaza. On this map, you can see just how much of Gaza the Israeli military has covered. It's led to more than 30,000 Palestinian deaths. That's according to Gaza's health ministry, including 12,000 children, as well as a humanitarian crisis and fears of famine. There's also been severe destruction to Gaza's infrastructure. This is what's left of the Al-Shifa Hospital, once Gaza's largest. It was destroyed during a two-week IDF siege. In a statement, the United Nations humanitarian chief says, \"We have arrived at a terrible milestone. Rarely has there been such global outrage at the toll of conflict, with seemingly so little done to end it, and instead so much impunity.\" He called it a betrayal of humanity. Well, meanwhile, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid will meet next week with Senior U.S. government officials in Washington. Lapid's office posted on social media that he will meet with the U.S. National Security Advisor and Secretary of State. His office says he's also going to meet with senior U.S. senators. Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz visited Washington last month. In Israel, anti-Netanyahu protesters called for new elections and for Hamas to release its hostages. Well, these protesters were in Haifa, Israel. They were calling Netanyahu guilty and chanting criminal government and evil government. In Cicero, protesters changed his legacy as disgrace and the government is a failure. They're calling for Israel's government to put all efforts into bringing home hostages held in Gaza. Well, CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman, joins us live from Beirut. And Ben, let's start with those anti-government protests. This groundswell against Netanyahu and his right-wing government certainly appears to be growing. Tell us more.",

So there's pressure on both sides, and certainly as referring back to those protests in Israel, there's pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to change his position. For months, he was saying that his priority, first priority, was to destroy Hamas. His second priority was to get the release of the hostages. And now what we've seen in the past, for instance, that in late November of last year, the only time when a significant number of Israeli hostages were released, it wasn't the result of military pressure, but it was the result of negotiations and a brief truce between Hamas and Israel. And what we've seen is, for instance, there's this news of this latest Israeli hostage who's believed to have been killed somehow in January. His body was found yesterday. This underscores that perhaps the military option for the resolution of the hostage situation is not working, and that negotiations is really the only way to bring those who are still alive home.

And it also hosts many of the leaders of Hamas who are in exile in Qatar.Egypt, of course, also is in direct contact with Hamas. The relationship between Egypt and Hamas is a little more delicate, given that Hamas is essentially a wing or an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was crushed by the regime of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Nonetheless, because Egypt shares a land border with Gaza, essentially can control who comes in and who comes out of Gaza. It has a lot of leverage as well. So, both sides have leverage. The question is, to what extent do they want to help the United States in that regard? At the end of the day, the decision is up to Hamas and Israel, whether they're going to come to some sort of agreement. But what we have seen is, clearly, there is growing pressure on both of them to come to some sort of agreement, to at least temporarily halt the bloodshed and make some sort of progress. Anna?",

And this UConn bunch are looking to really cement themselves as an all-time great team.Only two teams in the past 50 years have been able to win back-to-back titles. That was Duke in the 90s and Florida in the 2000s. And UConn, once again, really having no problem last night. They pulled away in the second half to beat Alabama 86-72. This was their 11th straight win now in the tournament by double digits. And the Clingan versus Edey match-up in tomorrow's title game, it's going to be the first between 7-foot starting center since Ewing versus Olajuwon back in 1983. And it's the first one ever between two guys 7-foot-2 or taller. And Clingan is certainly pumped up for it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
