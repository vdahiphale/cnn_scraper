Ukraine has announced that it has used a U.S. made Patriot air defense system like this to bring down a Russian hypersonic missile. If true, it would be the first time Ukraine was able to intercept a missile that travels at 10 times the speed of sound. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us from Kyiv with the latest.

First of all, it's kind of proving the need for highly sophisticated weapons such as the Patriot missile that the Ukrainians have been asking for effectively since 2014 when they were first invaded by the Russians.But then on a technological level, Paula, this is a very significant development because Patriot was never designed for hypersonic missiles because they didn't exist when Patriot was designed. This is a missile that can travel up to 10 times the speed of sound. The Patriot missile is not designed to catch something moving that fast. There had been an assumption that there was no missile in the world that was the Russian boast that could bring it down. Now, if the Ukrainians are telling the truth and there's every reason to suppose that they are, that is proven to be incorrect. So that will be a piece of information and the American arms manufacturers and technologists working on future weapons will be studying this in very great detail -- Paula.",

And that has been absorbing a huge amount of Russian fire power and manpower. In many ways the Ukrainians have seen that as an effective killing ground. They've been using it when they are feeling confident. They'll boast about that being an area of no strategic advantage where they're happy to kill Russians.And they want to kill as many as they can and absorb as much of that energy as they can before they prosecute this offensive that they've been talking about now for some time, possibly in the south of the country. But the developments there have been very dramatic with the leader of thing Wagner Group who are offering among the most men in the battle for Bakhmut. Prigozhin has said that because he's not getting enough ammunition from the Kremlin, from the Russian Ministry of Defense, he's pulling his men out on May 10th. And he's going to done a deal or got the agreement of the Chechen leader Kadyrov to replace the Wagner mercenaries with Chechens on May 10th. Now he has been very vocal in his criticism of the Kremlin and criticism of the prosecution of this war by Russia's generals, and this might well be part of that kind of ongoing political soap opera. He does love the attention. But if there is a switch from Wagner to Chechen fighters, that would provide an opportunity inevitably for the Ukrainians to try to regain the initiative in the battle for Bakhmut ahead of this anticipated offensive -- Paula.",

You may remember, in 2021, Democrats walked out of the state legislature in Texas to prevent a voter -- voter suppression law from being enacted. This is one step further, though. This says that after the ballots have been cast, after the election has been done, a single officer -- and just to be clear, that single officer is an appointee of the Republican governor -- can decide to overturn the election results. But only in one county, and that one county is Harris County where Houston is, which happens to be a stronghold for Democrats. So voter suppression is a problem. Election subversion, though, is a whole other level of problem. It's what we saw Donald Trump tried to do after the 2020 election. I represented the president and the Democratic Party in 60 plus victories. We saw the state of Texas try to go to the Supreme Court after the 2020 election.

They needed to prevent college students from having polling places on campus. They needed to suppress young voters. And that's because honestly young voters tend to vote Democratic. And the 26th Amendment says you don't get to fence young voters out of the political process. And you know, to the extent Republicans try to do that, it is both unconstitutional.
