I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington.Happening this hour, over at the White House, President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida are sitting down for a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office. And that will be followed by a joint news conference early this afternoon. Officials say the two leaders will announce a list of defense and diplomatic agreements to strengthen ties. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us live from the White House right now. Arlette, what does President Biden want to achieve during this important summit?",

And, also, they both delivered remarks, President Biden hailing the partnership with Japan as a monumental alliance, saying that their strength has really been a highlight of their alliance-building in the region. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the president and Kishida right now are meeting, a bilateral meeting. And they're expected to outline a host of announcements on several fronts, including really trying to deepen the defense and security ties between the two countries, announcing new steps when it comes to space, as Japan has signaled that they would like to land an astronaut on the moon. There's also people-to-people ties, deepening of semiconductor production together, all of this really encapsulating the view that the U.S. views Japan as one of its strongest allies. Now, there are some areas of differences. We know that the president has opposed the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan. Officials say that they don't expect that to come up in discussions, that this relationship is much larger than one commercial deal. But I also want to note one significant symbolic announcement that was made by President Biden and Kishida. Japan provided cherry blossom trees to the United States back in the 20th century. Some of those trees, which many visitors come to Washington, D.C., to visit in the springtime, some of those trees have to be cut down. And Japan has offered to provide new saplings of those trees, really stressing the symbolism between the two countries, Kishida saying that the cherry blossom-like relationship of the United States is on display. So we are expecting to see them in just a few hours, again, in that meeting, but also at a joint news conference. And then, tonight, the White House is hosting that lavish state dinner, as they're trying to honor one of their closest allies.",

So, this move is really an expansion of that. The senior government official also tells me that Kishida and Biden will announce a joint operations command in Japan, which, of course, is a move that the United States has long pursued. Right now, joint operations of U.S. personnel in Japan are directed by INDOPACOM, which is headquartered in Hawaii. So, with this move, it would make it much, much easier to coordinate military operations at a real-time pace, Wolf. And, of course, this will all culminate in Japan becoming more of a global partner, rather than just a regional player.",

Our chief national security analyst, Jim Sciutto, is joining me right now. He's got an important, very important new book that has just come out. It broaches this very subject. It's called -- there you see the cover -- \"The Return of Great Powers: Russia, China, and the Next World War.\" It's a \"New York Times\" bestseller right now, important reading for all of us. Give us some perspective on this summit that's taking place at the White House right now. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  This is all about China, a rising China, also North Korea, to some degree, and the shared U.S. and Japanese concern about that threat, and a strategic decision by the U.S. and Japan and also other U.S. allies in the region, South Korea, Australia, to bring their alliance closer, in military terms, in military industrial terms, building up supplies and so on, defense terms. Look at it this way. You have got China that is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, its missile arsenal. North Korea is also a nuclear power, also expanding that. Japan is very close to that threat. It sees a direct threat. And it calculates it needs more U.S. support to defend itself against those threats.",

It's not just a show of force of them together, but it's also expanding the U.S. defense agreement, making very clear to Japan that the U.S. will continue to defend it against Chinese and Japanese missiles, in the event of conflict here, but also the U.S. showing influence in the region.You saw Hanako mention the threat to the South China Sea and the East China Sea, because China has already been active there. It's already made a huge land grab in the South China Sea with these manmade islands. So, all those things are a threat to Japan's security and its trade as well.

The U.S. has had a decades-long mutual defense agreement with Japan, as has South Korea. The U.S, of course, has troops based in Japan, as it does in South Korea. But it is also expanding those alliances now. And China sees that as a direct response to its rise and a direct threats to its interest in the region. By the way, it's interesting. It's not just the U.S. that is improving relations with Japan and alliances. You see a lot of European nations that have been creating agreements and so on, which is interesting, because Europe, though it's further away, looks at China as a threat as well.",

So, North Korea will look at this as further antagonism from the West and its allies and as a challenge to its leadership, but, again, one that is, let's be frank, decades-old.

This is important to their trade. It's, of course, important to U.S. trade. The U.S. frequently makes the argument it's important to China's trade as well to have those sea lanes open. So, they see a dual threat, military and trade. And they're trying to message that the U.S. and Japan are very close. The trouble is, a new president in the fall, just based on Trump's vision of the world, would have a very different view of that alliance. He's said this publicly. He attempted to reduce U.S. troops, for instance, in South Korea during his last term. I will just tell you what John Kelly, his former chief of staff, told me in the book. He said, \"The point is he,\" speaking of Trump, \"saw no point in NATO. He was just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force.\" That would be a remarkable switch for a U.S. president to reduce or even eliminate those alliances, whereas you have Biden expanding them.",

After that moment, the court officials came up to him, handcuffed him behind his back, and led him out of the courtroom, where he will be processed and begin serving this five-month sentence. It is the second guilty plea for Allen Weisselberg. He previously pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges, also in a deal with prosecutors, was sentenced to five months in jail, ended up serving about 100 days in Rikers Island here in Manhattan. This is, of course, the second time Weisselberg is pleading guilty, but neither -- in neither case is he cooperating against Donald Trump. He will not be a witness at the trial expected to start next week, even though he was involved in the financial paperwork involving the hush money payments, which is central to this case.

But, first of all, there's a procedural problem, which is, as Kara said, too late. He was supposed to make this motion months ago. And, second of all, if you look at the substance of it, remember, the crime here relates to hush money that was paid to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. So, Donald Trump wasn't even president yet. Now, some of the reimbursements spilled over into the first weeks and months while Trump was president.

I don't think Trump has any merit to these arguments. Again, he has missed his opportunity. There was a time to make these arguments. The fact that they're coming so late and so far after the deadlines, and they're all in this sort of emergency procedural stance, I think does speak to a certain level of desperation. I don't think it's taking hold. We haven't seen any of these last- minute motions get any traction with either Judge Merchan or the appellate court.
