Robert Costello will be back on the stand. His testimony was unexpectedly heated. Just 14 minutes into his time on the stand yesterday, an eye roll, an audible sigh prompted the judge to clear the courtroom. Also, he could issue a warning to Costello, who, as an attorney, should clearly know better about, quote, proper decorum in the courtroom.Prosecutors say they have just 30 minutes left in his cross. After the that, the defense has signaled it is ready to rest its case today, meaning, not surprisingly, not likely Donald Trump will be taking the stand, but standby to standby. Twelve New Yorkers will soon decide his fate on 34 criminal charges. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside court once more for us.

I want the audience to see what the judge actually said after their resolve, it's back-and-forth between him and the first defense witness Robert Costello who was a legal adviser to Cohen. Here is the exchange that sort of cleared the courtroom, and we'll pull this up. Judge Merchan says, look, he was very annoyed. He cleared the court. He says, \"I'm putting you on notice that your conduct is contemptuous. If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand.\" Costello responds, \"Can I say something, please?\" Judge Merchan, \"No. No. This is not a conversation.\" What do you make that?

We see what it is on the page, but for those people in the room, it must have been really contemptuous. That's obviously not an adjective that is used lightly. That's purposefully saying, I will hold you in contempt.Listen, Bob Costello had one job. His one job was to get on the stand and say Michael Cohen told me that Donald Trump did nothing wrong. And now that is all mucked up in this really insolent behavior to the judge, his combative behavior with prosecutors. I think it has completely backfired because it really appears that Bob Costello has an axe to grind, and he's there with a strong bias towards the defendant. So I think actually jurors are now more likely to say, well, I think what Michael Cohen said about this relationship that he didn't trust Costello and he didn't tell Costello anything for that reason is much more likely to be believed.",

He comes in. He very clearly doesn't like Cohen. He's testifying for Trump. I think he's testifying for Trump in a way. And I think the jury sees that, so they're like, well, who do we believe Michael Cohen's explanation, which makes a lot of sense in the timeframe that he's trying to get information out of Cohen -- out of Costello, right? What is the Trump-world doing? What do you know about, what can you tell me about my case? Thats what Michael Cohen wants to know. And he's not going to give up any information. Remember, he doesn't pay Costello. He never signs an agreement with Costello. This whole time, I think it's very believable that he's trying to get information and not give information.

As we have been reporting, basically a whole army, a whole fleet of ambulances have converged on that airport in Bangkok. There are emergency responders there. We are still trying to find out the extent of the injuries, but it is very safe to say that they are serious.This was a very big aircraft, a Boeing 777 300. It flies a lot of the long-haul routes between Asia, between Europe, as well as across both of the oceans. This particular flight had 211 people on board, a crew of 18. When based off of our calculations, looking at some online flight logs, around 29,000 feet, about halfway into this 13 hour flight is when this turbulence occurred. And the pilots then made this very rapid descent to the airport in Bangkok to get assistance. Here's the thing about turbulence. Despite all of the tools, despite all of the technology, despite all of that, it can still be very difficult to predict. You could have the most gorgeous, perfect view out the airline window -- out of the airplane window, yet it can suddenly occur. Hence, this term, \"sudden air turbulence.\" We are hoping to hear from authorities in the hours ahead. This jet has been on the ground for about four hours or so to learn just how badly people had been injured. Again, one person died. And to have someone get killed because of turbulence, it does happen, but it's something that's very rare because pilots typically do have some kind of warning this happened. Let's also consider about how long this flight was. A 13-hour flight, about halfway through. Even though the seatbelt sign may have been turned on, it would not be unusual for crew members to be walking about or for people to stand in line to use the lavatories. These are some of the questions that we are asking, hopefully hearing from passengers in the hours ahead about exactly how this all took place. But Kate, based off of the images that we are seeing from the airport in Thailand, there's no question this is a very serious situation and these injuries are quite extensive.",
