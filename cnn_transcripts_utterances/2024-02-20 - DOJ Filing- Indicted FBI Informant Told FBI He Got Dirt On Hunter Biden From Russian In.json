The White House - the witness, House Republicans, have for months been saying holds the key to what they call the Biden crime family, now says he got his dirt on Hunter Biden from Russian intelligence.Also tonight, House Speaker Mike Johnson turns up in Mar-a-Lago. With the House in recess, Ukraine funding in limbo, Russian troops retaking territory in Ukraine and Trump comparing himself to Navalny. We're keeping him honest. And later, an 11-year-old Texas girl missing since she left for school on Thursday has been found. The news is tragic and an arrest may be imminent. Good evening. Thanks for being with us. We begin with the breaking news, which, if allegations in a new court filing are true, suggests that Russia is again tampering with the presidential election. The indicted ex-FBI informant at the center of the House Republican Biden probe saying that the made-up dirt he got on Hunter Biden came from Russian intelligence. Now, keep in mind, this is the person who Republicans have been using to largely justify their investigation into the Biden family. Details now from CNN's Evan Perez, who starts us off tonight.   So, Evan, explain, this all stems from a new court filing from the special counsel, David Weiss. What exactly is he saying about this informant and Russian intelligence?",

This is a filing from David Weiss, the special counsel. He says that during his custodial interview when he was arrested in Las Vegas last week, Anderson, Smirnov admitted that officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story about Hunter Biden, that's businessperson one, who's identified there in the - in that court filing. Now, Smirnov is the guy who has been telling people since 2020 that there was this scheme by Burisma, people associated with Burisma, which is a Ukrainian energy company, to pay bribes, $5 million apiece, to Hunter Biden and to Joe Biden in exchange for getting favors from the U.S. government. At the time, Joe Biden was vice president during the Obama administration. According to the FBI, none of that is true, Anderson.",

And so the question, Anderson, tonight is for David Weiss, who certainly has had some of this information since 2020, and the FBI is what did they do to assess that, to figure out whether what he was saying was bunk or whether it was true.

Matthew Chance is in Moscow tonight with more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Captured on camera in Russia's freezing north, what could be the prison motorcade carrying Alexey Navalny's body from the Arctic penal colony where he died. Independent investigative journalists believe these traffic images show the late Russian opposition leader's remains have been removed. Although there's still no official confirmation of where they're being held. Even Navalny's elderly mother, who traveled nearly 2,000 miles from Moscow to see her dead son, has been denied. And is now asking the Russian president for mercy. LYUDMILA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S MOTHER (through translator): They won't give me his body. They don't even tell me where he is. I'm addressing you, Vladimir Putin. The solution to the issue depends only on you. Let me finally see my son. I demand that Alexey's body be immediately handed over so that I can bury him humanely. CHANCE (voice-over): It is an emotional appeal with Russian public support. It's hard to ignore.",

What do we know about it?CHANCE (on-camera): Yes. Well, we don't know what Navalny's brother, his younger brother Oleg is suspected of doing, why they want to question him. But in the past, you know, critics have often accused the Kremlin of sort of targeting his brother for prosecution in sort of retaliation for the anti-corruption work that Alexey Navalny has done. Now, of course, Alexey Navalny is now -- he's now dead, but this announcement that Oleg Navalny is on the wanted list came just a few hours after, well, we heard his mother there appealing to Vladimir Putin to release the body of Alexey Navalny. It also came after his wife Yulia Navalnaya, said that she would pick up the reins and carry the mantle and carry on the work of her husband. So it seems that that pressure on the Navalny family from the Russian authorities shows no sign of letting up, Anderson.",

Do any of the women you spoke with believe Hailey has a chance of becoming the nominee?KAYE (on-camera): Well, Anderson, of the three Hailey supporters in our group, two of them do strongly believe she still has a chance of becoming the nominee. One of them said she doesn't believe based on the polls that Nikki Haley has a chance of being the nominee, but she's voting her conscience, and that's why she's still supporting her. I also, Anderson, asked the Haley supporters in our group if they would consider supporting Donald Trump if he becomes the nominee in the general election. One of them said, absolutely, she will support him. Another told me, it's very unlikely, she will likely go with either a third party candidate or the Democratic nominee. And the third Haley supporter in our group said that she just does not buy Donald Trump's election lies, she never did, and she also would consider the Democratic nominee. So Anderson, you have two Haley supporters, two Republican women in our group who say it's very unlikely they will support Donald Trump in the general election if he is the nominee.",
