Let's see how it goes. And then let's try to broaden that and get more trucks in and ideally set up, you know, they had talked about setting up this so called humanitarian zone in the southern part of Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people could potentially take refuge. The hat requires a huge amount of material and personnel to make that happen. So, I think the idea with the 20 was that it was just a starting point. But the U.N. when I was with them yesterday at Rafah Border Crossing, they really underscored it can't be a one off, not just because of the dire situation inside Gaza, which let's be clear, is at a critical, critical stage. But also, just more generally speaking, the worry is if you have this drip, drip approach, whenever U.N. trucks then go in, or any aid trucks go in, you're going to have frenzied scenes, you're going to have mobs, you're going to have panics and crushes and chaos, because everyone is worried that the next truck could be the last.

First off, why just 20 trucks and do you expect a sustained humanitarian corridor to be opened? And of course, the logistics surrounding that is just going to be huge. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, it certainly will, Amara. Good morning to you. I think the reason for the 20 trucks is this was an initial foray that they wanted to make sure they could do this and that they had the logistical capability that the roads were open a in the sense that they were able to handle the volume of trucks, the weight of the trucks a some of that may be just to road construction issues, based on the strikes that the Israelis, you know, had done the airstrikes that they had done in that area.

I don't think though, that the Hamas calculation on that is going to hold in terms of inspiring enmity between the two, but it could delay some sort of invasion.

But remember that, she certainly had access to the president in terms of the White House, a number of meetings after the election, and that's important because that breach is, as we know, the inner circle of the president.So what were those meetings about? What was she plotting? What was the president's state of mind at that time? What did he know? What did he not? Pivoting to the issue of Mr. Chesebro and with respect to the fake electors, right? Getting these fake electors, trying to decertify the election process, certainly trying to disrupt it, and his plea to indictment count 15 implicates Giuliani, implicates another lawyer, Mr. Eastman, implicates the president himself. And so when prosecutors try a case, it's never in isolation. It's about the collective weight of the testimony. So, when you have two presidential lawyers who were advising him, one, Mr. Eastman drafting memos with regard to the fake elector plot, and now they're trying to breach the security system, I think both in tandem certainly spelled very much trouble for the president himself who as we know was charged in this and three other cases.
