We're going to start with new warning signs, of the Kremlin, considering the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. Now, U.S. Intelligence believes that senior Russian generals have discussed how and when to deploy one. This classified report, was described to CNN, by multiple sources who have read it. There is debate on how seriously to take this Intelligence. Is it further sign of Russian desperation and cause for real concern? Or are these discussions being taken out of context? On CNN, earlier tonight, top White House National Security Official, John Kirby, reacted to the latest U.S. Intelligence Report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, no one can forget those sorts of images. And they are heavily involved in the fighting that is taking place in eastern Ukraine, right now.

Now, it's not clear that that would have any real impact, on the operations of the group, because there's no indication that they have any funding, coming out of the United Kingdom.

We have agreed not to name the village, or show her face, to protect her identity. She takes us to her brother's house, where she says she was raped, by a Russian soldier, on August 26th. TATIANA (ph), UKRAINIAN (through translator): He pinned me against the wardrobe, and groped me. He ripped my clothes off. And I was caught in his grip. It was very hard and painful for me. I was crying, begging him to stop, but with no success. WARD (on camera): And did he say anything, when it was over? TATIANA (ph) (through translator): Do not tell anyone anything or it will be worse. That's everything he told me. And then he left. It's very hard for me.

But the way that Ukrainian authorities see this, and the Police, and the prosecutor's office, who are working towards, ultimately, towards getting some accountability, is that they have to start building a case. You have to start from somewhere. So, they'll come back here to Kyiv. Or they're now back here in Kyiv. They will put together what they have. And they will see whether they can start initiating any criminal proceedings. In more than 40 cases of sexual violence, at the hands of Russian forces, across the country, in areas that have been occupied? They have already initiated criminal proceedings.

The host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on ABC tweeted after Musk did this. \"It has been interesting, over the years, to watch you blossom from the electric car guy into a fully-formed piece of shit.\" And Jimmy Kimmel joins me now. Jimmy, good to see you. Interesting tweet, strong words, and it does play right into this national conversation, we've been having, about free speech. How do you see those issues given, free speech on one hand, and yet the dangerous spread of misinformation, and hateful rhetoric that's inciting some of these attacks, on the other?
