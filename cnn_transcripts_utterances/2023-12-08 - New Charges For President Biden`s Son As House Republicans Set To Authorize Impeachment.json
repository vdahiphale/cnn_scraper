      "sentences": "Hunter Biden charged again, federal prosecutors accusing the President`s son of failing to pay over amillion dollars in taxes and spending money on drugs and women instead. What this means for House Republicans anxious to impeach his father. Plus, Donald Trump is expected to testify in his civil fraud trial Monday. The former President chose to attend the proceedings in New York yesterday. He was not required to be there. But, he still called it a witch hunt, and complained that he wasn`t on the campaign trail anyway. And in Texas, a heartbroken pregnant woman facing down State Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is threatening her doctors with prosecution if they follow a court order granting her permission to have an abortion, which she and her lawyer say is at stake, ahead. Good day, everyone. I`m Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It`s 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, December 8, just 38 days until the Iowa caucuses, 332 days until Election Day. This is today`s State of the Race. Welcome in. We begin with nine new criminal charges against Hunter Biden in the federal tax case against him. The President`s son was already facing gun charges as part of Special Counsel David Weiss` investigation. But, this latest indictment includes salacious details from the period when he was addicted to drugs, as Hunter Biden details in his book. Prosecutors alleged that he failed to pay more than a million dollars in taxes, instead spending lavishly on things like escorts and exotic cars. Hunter Biden`s defenders say these charges are politically motivated. His lawyer saying this, \"Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter`s last name were anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought.\" The indictment comes as House Republicans pushed to formalize their impeachment inquiry into President Biden. It`s important to underscore that so far they`ve not been able to find any incriminating evidence tying President Biden to any wrongdoing. Let`s dive into all of this with today`s panel. Karen Finney is a CNN Political Commentator. She was a Senior Spokesperson for Democrat Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign; Doug Heye, Republican Strategist and former Communications Director at the RNC, Gloria Borger, a CNN Senior Political Analyst, and Carrie Cordero is a CNN Legal Analyst who previously served at the Department of Justice. Very grateful to have all of you on board today. I`d like to start, Karen, kind of with the politics of this. KAREN FINNEY, FMR. SR. SPOKESPERSON, HILLARY FOR AMERICA, &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah.",

There seems to be a lot of leeway. And how do political considerations play into these decisions behind the scenes? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; FMR. U.S. DEPT. OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY: So, the bottom line is they`re actually not supposed to play a role at all in the prosecutor`s decision. So, Justice Department prosecutors, which includes the special counsel in this case, is a U.S. attorney and appointed as a special counsel by the Attorney General to try to lessen the appearance of any kind of political influence, is supposed to make decisions based on the facts, on the law, whether the facts of this particular case, only as they pertain to Hunter Biden accord with an appropriate reason to charge the case, and is in accordance with Justice Department guidelines, and how they normally would bring a case in this type of circumstance. So, Hunter Biden, even though he is the President`s son, shouldn`t be treated any better or any worse than any other American who commits -- who is alleged to have committed this type of crime. I will say the amounts, if we think about some other high-profile cases that our viewers might be familiar with, some people might remember like the Wesley Snipes case, which was a big tax case, which was 20 some million dollars of unpaid taxes, this is a little over $1 million of unpaid taxes, which is glorious that he has reportedly has paid back. So, the Justice Department shouldn`t take politics into play. But, the fact that there is even a special counsel in a little tax case like this, indicates that there is a political overlap to it.",

They weren`t sure if that would last. But, it has. And so, because of that, his campaign has really thought we can merge the legal jeopardy, really, and kind of turn it into a campaign slogan. And that`s exactly what they`ve been doing. And I also think that`s why you`re seeing Donald Trump show up in court so much. They recognize that even more than when he is on the campaign trail and holding rallies, he is getting wall-to-wall media coverage. He is soaking up all of the oxygen when he is attending court, especially when he is going to be on the stand. And so, I think that`s where a lot of this comes in. And I do think he was on the stand last month as well. That time, he was being grilled by prosecutors. This time, he is going to be answering carefully crafted questions, I`m told, from his defense attorneys. But, I do think you`re going to see similar to what he did last month, which is trying to make this and treat it like another campaign stop, kind of give speeches while on the stand, using the rhetoric we`ve heard him use time and time again, which is to criticize the judge in the case, criticize the Attorney General, call this political persecution.",

But, the reality remains that the people on that stage are still in a race against each other for second place against Trump. And Jonathan Martin, who I`m sure you know from your time in Washington, has a column out in POLITICO this morning and he writes this. \"The Stop Trump effort has been abysmal. It`s just under a month until the Iowa caucuses and there is a striking lack of urgency among Republicans who do not want to see Trump re-nominated. There is resignation, rationalization, despair, and even denial. Yet there is little action.\" And I will say it does seem to me it feels here like we`ve seen this movie before from Republicans.

I guess my sort of question for you is, is there actually a reality in which Republican base voters would be willing to believe other leaders? Or -- I mean, the track record seems to be they simply turn on those leaders, because if they`re attacking Donald Trump, and it must mean that they inherently cannot be trusted.

They get denigrated. They get pushed aside. The problem is, if all these cult leaders, all these second tier cult leaders said, this is enough, we`re done, they could bring people with them. But, if it`s just one or two people at a time, yeah, it`s easy to isolate, to push aside, to call them an aberration, and to say, unless you want treated like they got treated, you need to stay within the confines of the cult. That`s what we`re dealing with. So, is it possible now?

So, he made a decision to embrace it. When he made the decision to embrace Donald Trump, his fundraising and his people, most members of Congress followed him, at least within the next few months. And then, that sends a message to the base voter that`s out there looking for leadership. I mean, what is leading? Well, we know what leading is, and the word leaders, actually, that`s what you have to do. You have to lead. When the people are there seeing all these leaders say, yes, Donald Trump was a victim.
