The Biden administration announces a massive military package for Taiwan, even as it attempts to reset diplomatic relations with China.

Then, Russia hits back with another strike on civilians after Ukraine's drone attack on Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says every inch matters as Ukraine doubles down on busting through Russia's defenses. Also, ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And few or more acutely aware of the impact of climate change than the incredible sea diving women of the South Korean province of Haenyeo. They tell Hari Sreenivasan about the devastation they're seeing on the ecosystem they depend on. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in for Christiane Amanpour in New York. We begin with one of the world's most complicated and consequential geopolitical relationships. Two great superpowers with the fate of an island between them which stands to shape the course of our immediate history. Despite a recent diplomatic push to reset relations with China, the Biden administration has now announced a weapons package worth as much as $345 million for Taiwan's self-defense. The United States has allowed Taiwan to buy its weapons before, but this deal delivers equipment directly from existing U.S. inventories for the first time, making its transfer and deployment much quicker. Beijing has repeatedly demanded that the U.S., which is Taiwan's most important arms supply, stop the sale of weapons to the island. Which all begs the question, what is the administration's strategy on China? And how will the dispute over Taiwan's sovereignty play out? Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi is a top-ranking Democrat on the house China -- committee on China. And he was with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she controversially visited Taiwan last August, causing a major rupture in what was already the tense U.S.-China relations. Representative Krishnamoorthi, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for your time. So, you welcomed this move by the White House for the first time, providing military aid to Taiwan through its stockpiles as opposed to just selling the weapons. Why did you do this? Why do you approve of it? And what do you make of the announcement on a Friday afternoon seemingly under the radar? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Well, I think that is very important that we deter conflict across the Taiwan Strait between the Chinese Communist Party and Taiwan. And the only way to deter that conflict is to make sure that we supply Taiwan with enough articles of defense to build-up its deterrence. Taiwan has already acquired roughly $19 billion worth of weapons that have yet to be delivered, mainly because of issues in our military supply -- industrial supply base. And so, using presidential drawdown authority to basically give them articles of defense from our supplies and then backfill later feels appropriate right now.",

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy went on to say, U.S., stop selling arms to Taiwan. Stop creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop posing risks to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

They have sent dozens of airplanes, naval ships, even missiles across the Taiwan Strait in recent months and years. And therefore, this type of military aggressive behavior would naturally cause the Taiwan people to want to defend themselves with even more vigor. And so, that's why we are providing them with more equipment to do so. We are indeed obligated to do so under the Taiwan Relations Act, even at the same time that we observe the One-China policy. I would just close by saying, let's make sure that if there are distance between the CCP and the Taiwan government, that they are resolved peacefully.

Roughly 67 percent of cyber hacks, according to the FBI, that are committed in the United States are launched from the PRC, People's Republic of China. So, they are very concerned about that militaristically and aggressive behavior. At the same time, we don't want an open conflict. That's something that they expressed to me.

Barrier wants you, you get stuck then you're vulnerable to all sorts of fire raining down you, and that's what they found. So, they have to shift tactics to working into smaller groups, to relying much more on attrition, attacking Russian logistics, a couple ammunition dumps, attacking whatever targets they can find, really, in the hope that this would wear down the Russians. And also, attacking in a number of different areas, hoping to draw the Russian reserves in. So that if they do make breakthroughs, there's less to get through. They've been starting to push again. And they seem to have made some progress. But again, it's very hard work.

So, I -- it's -- I don't think it's going to be a stalemate in the sense that the two lines of trenches looking at each other and no movements. There will be movement.

So, it really is about staying in the war, because as soon as he turns this, I reckon, they will -- either we fight this war, what did we gain? So, this is why I think we're looking for forms of pressure. So that -- the sense of the reckoning is with the Russian elite already.

The difficulty here for Putin is he really works to appease this group last September when he both upped the anti-Biden (ph), including four new provinces of Ukraine, and saying they were now part of the Russian Federation in addition to Crimea and went to mass mobilization. So, other than carrying on letting Ukraine, with this -- beyond these airstrikes, you mentioned in the introduction, which he'll carry on doing, then the attack on the agricultural sector by ending the grain deal.

It means giving up your life and your last breath for your family. When you walk around the Jeju villages, you hear the sounds of Sumbi-sori - breathing sounds. They're the sounds of Haenyeos coming up for air after diving and gathering sea life. The breathing sounds are strong and carrying, so the Haenyeos diving together can recognize each other's breathing sounds. If the breath sound doesn't come out, there's been an accident. If you swallow the water, you will die. All the Haenyeos immediately recognize the troubled sounds and go together as one to rescue the diver. So, being a Haenyeo is a profession where you give your life to save your family. You take in a deep breath and then expel the air before you dive in. This exhale is called Jus-Sseung - The World Beyond. After holding your breath while gathering the seafood, you come up for air, this first breath signifies being alive, it's called Yi-Sseung - heaven. Navigating these two worlds of heal and heaven is the job of a Haenyeo.",

And what she saw in the sea is not there anymore. HYUM BOK-RYE, WOLJEONG-RI HAENYEO ASSOCIATION, JEJU ISLAND (through translator): From my grandmother, she was a Haenyeo, and my mother was a Haenyeo. And I'm a Haenyeo. We are three generations of Haenyeos. Yes, I still go out to the sea to dive. But I'm thinking of retiring this year. In the past, there was plenty of abalone, cockles, and seaweed even near the shore. Now, there isn't much sea life and seaweed anymore, so Haenyeos don't go into the ocean. There is nothing left for us to gather. It's different from even two to three years ago. In my 50s, the environment was very different, there were so many clams and conch. Sea life was very abundant. But now there's nothing, nothing. The sea is dying. There's nothing for the Haenyeos. The Jeju Sea is dying. My grandmother was able to provide for her family as a Haenyeo, because of the abundance of sea life that she was able to see in the markets. You ask, will it get better? It has to get better, or the Haenyeos will die off. It has to get better soon, but I don't have much hope. KIM (through translator): The ocean is no longer abundant. The water is getting dirtier and starting to rot. The Haenyeos are saying the sea is dying. Haenyeos feel that something dangerous is looming and they don't see the future. And Haenyeos fell that if the sea dies, their life will also die. They anticipate this every day. The ocean surrounding Woljeong village and all of the Jeju Island was very abundant. Now it smells putrid, it's full of trash. And with the increase of tourism and the development of tall buildings and sewage treatment plants, we are witnessing the devastation of the ocean and feel the quick rate of change on a daily basis.",

JEONG (through translator): Before COVID, you couldn't breathe because of the pollution, the sky was covered in fumes from the airplanes, to the point that you couldn't see the sky. As soon as COVID started, the airplanes stopped flying, tourism stopped. We could breathe again, the sky cleared up, we could see the stars and we felt like we were human again. If people can course correct a little, we can create a world where we can live and let nature live as well. I felt this way up to last year. But stating this year, as COVID ended, we're back to where we were before, we see the same problems in the ocean returning. Before the military base was constructed, you could see abundant sea life in the water, even 10 years ago. When I was younger, we could predict what sea life products we would collect by the basket during the four seasons each year. We knew what type of sea life we could collect in the winter and in the spring. We always brought up a basket full of sea life. Now there's nothing, absolutely nothing. Eerily nothing. If by chance, we do catch a little something in the sea and eat it, we immediately get sick. There's no plant life or sea life in the ocean, and the whole Jeju Sea is decaying. We wish for less people to visit, to stop the very cheap flights to Jeju, but rather offer more expensive flights, that match and reflect the value we place in nurturing the natural resources of Jeju Island.",
