Key race alert in Nevada, where the incumbent Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt are in an incredibly tight race.Right now, Adam Laxalt is maintaining his lead, 49.9 percent. His margin right now, 22,595 votes ahead of the incumbent, Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democrat. But the key, only 80 percent of the estimated vote is in. And so much of that outstanding vote is in Clark County, Las Vegas, an area Biden won handily and where Catherine Cortez Masto, of course, had been running ahead of Adam Laxalt. So this is why we are waiting and waiting for more numbers to come in. Our Rosa Flores is in Las Vegas with new reporting on the vote count coming in. What do you know, Rosa?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erin, the new information that we're getting into the CNN NEWSROOM is out of Washoe County. This is in northwest Nevada.And the reason why this is important is, you just mentioned that Laxalt was ahead of Catherine Cortez Masto by about 22,000 votes. Well, there's a batch of 20,000 votes that are being counted now in Washoe County. These are mail-in ballots and also drop box ballots that were not counted yesterday. They are being counted today. So those numbers are not in the tally. We're just learning here at CNN that everything is going smooth sailing in Washoe County. They're expecting to finish that batch of 20,000 votes today. And so we should see that reflected at some point today. Now, once they receive the mail-in ballots from Wednesday, they're going to start processing those, as well. So there are more. The big question, of course, is how many more mail-in ballots are out there? And the answer is, nobody really knows, because this is the first midterm election in which Nevada has this new policy where every registered voter gets a ballot in the mail unless they opt out. And so, so long as that ballot is postmarked by yesterday, which is Election Day, it can be counted so long as it comes into the registrar's office by Saturday. And so, Erin, that is the big question, in a race like this where the margins are razor thin, this batch of 20,000 ballots is so important because we could see that margin slim down. We could see it widen for one candidate or another. We just don't know at this point.",

If the margins such as they have been historically hold, Catherine Cortez Masto would really end up being able to pull this out.But you don't know how things have changed necessarily, to your point, right, now that rules have changed. It's easier to vote earlier, earlier to mail in. Do more Republicans avail themselves of that? Do you think we will know the results in Nevada before Saturday when every one of those postmarked mail-ins would have to be received?",

When I was out at ballot -- or when I was out at polling locates yesterday, I spoke with Republicans who were emphasizing that the economy was the top issue for them, as well as inflation and high housing costs.And spoke with a voter outside the Sparks Library here in Washoe County, and, you know, just down the street you have Siegel Suites and they're talking about how rent is going too high and they don't know how to deal with it and what happens if you can't make minimum wage to afford that? On the other hand, I spoke with a lot of younger voters at UNR and sort of people that identified as Democrats and their top issues were abortion as well as civil rights.

In Pennsylvania, bringing Mehmet Oz on stage with Doug Mastriano, a candidate who was very much struggling and had been, you know, pretty well defined by his rival in ads, I don't think that helped Oz. And I think people are going to really be scrutinizing where Trump is helpful and if it's not in purple and swing states, that's a problem.",

No question about it.It also, by the way, was not a great day for Kevin McCarthy, who it looks like he's going Republicans are going to take the House. But if it is a slim margin, he's going to have a tricky path navigating it with the Freedom Caucus. But to go back to Donald Trump, look, what does this mean to him? He is never going to take the blame. He's going to say, oh, they were weak candidates, not my fault. He'll always take the credit. He'll look at his polls, his ratings, as he likes to call them, but Trump never admits defeat. I do not think, talking to my sources, that this will in any way change. We assume that in the next week or two, maybe the 15th, he is going to announce that he's running. Everybody I spoke to in Trump world, and Republican sources, say they expect him to go ahead full steam. I will say it does change, I think, the dynamics for GOP presidential hopefuls, people who might not have gotten in the race are going to take a second look, especially since they are seeing that there are Republican voters out there across the country who want to move on from Donald Trump.",

We are seeing the Republican establishment coalesce very quickly behind Walker.And, of course, you would expect that to happen but perhaps even quicker, given what's at stake right now. which is potentially control of the Senate and what little of Joe Biden's agenda may or may not get through in the next couple of years/ But told Ted Cruz will be the first Senator we'll see tomorrow and arrive and campaign for Walker. He'll be one of many over the next month, see a lot of Republican Senators down there. What was interesting with the Walker campaign and what they told me a short time ago, they said it was smart that Joe Biden didn't come into Georgia. It was a very smart move on the Warnock campaign because they weren't able to tie him as tight as they wanted to. What we should expect in the next three or four weeks is we'll see an incredible amount of exposure just on Warnock himself and how control of the Senate, the control of the Republican conservative agenda or the establishment of one is going to rest on this race. One thing about DeSantis, because I do think it's interesting and, in some ways sad. DeSantis a huge winner, but DeSantis has a hurricane coming into Florida right now, which is awful. But you can -- he can use this as an opportunity to show leadership skills coming off of just an amazing night that he had.",
