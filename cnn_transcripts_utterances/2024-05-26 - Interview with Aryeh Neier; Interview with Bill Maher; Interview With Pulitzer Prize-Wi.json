Fox News literally uses Russian talking points. I mean, Tucker Carlson went over there and did the whole dog and pony show backing up Putin basically. And on the left, you see them marching for Hamas, a terrorist organization. This is a terrible place to be and it can happen here.

Bill Moyers calls Dick one day in March, to just come there, he had been brought over as a speech writer for LBJ having worked for JFK. And he said, the president wants to talk to us about a Johnson program, not something that he's just doing to finish for Kennedy. He had gotten the tax cut too which was Kennedy's. Civil rights was moving through.So, he said -- Dick said, are we going to the Oval Office? He said, no, we're going to the White House's swimming pool. They get to the swimming pool and Johnson swimming naked in the pool. Dick said he looked like a whale going side stroking up and down. The two of them are standing there in their suits and ties, and Johnson says, well, come on in, guys. And they have nothing to do but strip, and they go in. Now, you suddenly have three guys swimming in the pool.",

That vision was in his head already, had been there for a long time really.And then they had to figure out a name for it. So, there was debate in the White House. Some wanted to call it the glorious society. Some wanted to call it a better deal instead of a new deal. But Dick just tried out the great society in a number of small speeches.

Johnson decided on a Sunday night he was going to give a speech to a joint session on Monday night to call for voting because the Selma demonstrations have taken place.And again, the country's sentiment was fired conscience by watching what the Alabama troopers did to the peaceful marchers. So, he knew, I have to act now. And so, as he was working on the speech that day, he took a break outside and he heard some kids in a distance singing, we shall overcome. And he, of course, had also been on the march on Washington. So, when he got to that moment in the speech that even -- it starts out so beautifully. He said, I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. Every now and then history and fate meet at a certain time, in a certain place. So, it was in Lexington and Concord, so it was in Appomattox, so it was in Selma, Alabama. Then he goes on to say, but even if we get this voting rights act, it's still going to be a big battle to overcome prejudice and bigotry that we need to do. But if we work together then the full blessings will be given to Negro-Americans. And if we do that, and he paused, we shall overcome. The audience was silent for a moment and then they realized the banner of the civil rights movement, the outside movement was being brought into the highest councils of government, to the highest power, and something would be done.

It was everybody listening at the same time and he was able to make people feel he was talking in their living rooms, that he was fighting for them. And I think for Biden, right now, more important than telling what he has done, people know that or they might not know that, the ads can do that, but he has to make people feel he's fighting for them. That's what FDR said. It's very simple. They have to feel you're on their side. And he has to make them feel there's still a battle to be -- there are so many battles still to be fought way beyond what the legislation has. There's the battle for women to have the right to choose. There's a battle for climate change. There's a battle for gun safety. All those are out there. Majority of people want those things done.
