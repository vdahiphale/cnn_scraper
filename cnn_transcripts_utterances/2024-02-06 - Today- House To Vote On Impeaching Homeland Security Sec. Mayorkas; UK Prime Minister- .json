Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the southern border. It's an effort that the White House is calling, quote, \"an unprecedented and unconstitutional act of political retribution.\" This comes as Speaker Johnson also hopes to bring a standalone Israel aid bill to the House floor for a vote sometime this week. That is a direct rebuke to the major border deal and foreign aid package that the Senate released on Sunday, the contents of which Sec. Mayorkas himself helped negotiate. That bipartisan proposal looking increasingly likely to fail in the very chamber that produced it with 23 senators already coming out against it. Let's bring in congressional reporter for The Hill, Mychael Schnell. Mychael, good morning. It's always good to have you. Let's start with the impeachment vote on Sec. Mayorkas. What do we expect? Is this going to pass?",

Democratic whip Katherine Clark, last week, telling reporters she expects Democratic unity against impeachment Mayorkas. And now, that means that Republicans are going to have very little wiggle room here in their quest to impeach Mayorkas. And depending on absences they can only afford to lose a handful of votes -- perhaps even two or three. One Republican has already come out against this effort. Congressman Ken Buck, retiring Republican from Colorado, saying he will not vote to impeach Mayorkas. He doesn't see any impeachable offenses there. And there are a number of other Republicans who have kept their cards very close to their chest. I'm talking about Congressman Tom McClintock and Dave Joyce, both of whom say that they will announce how they're going to vote before today's vote, but they haven't yet said. So right now, it is very up in the air because a lot of lawmakers just haven't said where they stand.",

And that especially comes as lawmakers are trying to work through this supplemental, which we can get to at another portion, but that's going to take a lot of time on the floor. So there are a number of options here. A) We could see that Senate trial play out in the upper chamber. We can also -- and I'll tell you what. You know, it seems that House Republicans are preparing for that. There was reporting yesterday on who the impeachment managers from the House would be if the Senate trial did end up happening -- a number of conservative Republicans. Another thing that could happen is that this could be referred to a committee and essentially draw out the process of looking into these claims and essentially delaying when that Senate trial would have to take place. Senate Democratic leaders have not yet said what they would end up doing. I think a lot of folks are waiting to see how today's vote plays out -- again, because it's so up in the air if Republicans even have the votes to impeach Mayorkas. But the expectation is in the Senate that we would either see that Senate trial play out or we'd see a procedural gambit like referring it to committee so that trial could be delayed.",

We are now seeing that. Lawmakers are actually able to come to a consensus but a number of them are turning against it in large part because of the influence that Donald Trump has on the Republican Party. And I think that's key, right? Donald Trump still has a firm grip on the Republican Party. We saw that in Iowa and New Hampshire -- him easily locking down those wins in those early primary and caucus states. But he also has outside influence still over lawmakers on Capitol Hill. And he may have had his break with McConnell after January 6 -- that very public break between the two of them. They still badger each other from time to time in the media -- more Trump than McConnell. But at the end of the day, McConnell is still -- you know, he's going to follow the lead of his conference and what they want to do.
