      "sentences": "Well, Democrats are asking Joe Biden, is being the nominee really your final answer? Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So that tick-tock you're hearing, that's kind of maybe the agita that's forming, because I'm actually frustrated tonight. I don't think we're actually getting straight answers. We're back to the frustration that I often tell you about, the one of having to preface statements with what people are saying in public, but what they're saying in private. Frankly, I absolutely hate that. Say what you mean, when you mean to say. I know it is politics and it's Washington, D.C., but say what you mean, period. You've asked for a chance to lead, say what you think in front of a camera. But instead, it's a waiting game to see, which is the next straw to fall on the proverbial camel's back. And here's the next floating straw. If that 90-minute debate wiped out President Biden's reelection campaign, well, tomorrow, he may get 30 or so minutes to actually try to save it. It either put out the fire in the party or if it goes left, it could fuel it. Arguably, again, the most important press conference of Biden's political career, maybe until the next one, unscripted, taking questions from the press. Right now, though, the fire is still being stoked by a slow trickle of daily, well, maybe I'm being too generous here, almost hourly trickles of news of yet another congressional Democrat telling Biden to say uncle. We're now up to, I think, 10 totals at this point, including the first U.S. senator to come against Biden and say it is time to go, Peter Welch of Vermont, and his reason is the same as the others: Trump is a threat to the nation and they don't think Biden can beat him. But here's my question. Why is there presently, given the number of Democrats who we are not naming who are in office, why is there the refusal, at least publicly, to take Biden at his word that he's not leaving? My question is sincere, really is. It was literally in the first paragraph of a letter that he sent them. And I'm quoting here when I say, \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\" Now, I'm not naive as to why there might not be the convincing, but Democrats just don't seem to believe that his decision is final or maybe, just maybe, they don't want it to be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.",

And when you put that question in front of union leaders or mayorsthat have to look out for their people or people in Hawaii who saw one president care for our people when we had the worst disaster in history versus the other president who threw Molotov cocktails at me on the press and criticized everything about Hawaii, it's an easy choice. I don't think that people realize that when Ronald Reagan was running for a second term, he was not at his best. And by the last two years, Ronald Reagan was very diminished. But people loved him all the same. And his values were what carried the day for his team. And what Joe's values are will carry, you know, the day for our team. And just -- by the way, we do have an awesome backup quarterback in, you know, in the vice president because, you know, he picked her.

If we're going to judge President Biden, we must judge former President Trump with the same kind of assessments.And I am a physician, by the way. Gretchen, you know, she -- she recognizes that people want these answers. If you do cognitive tests of both presidents, you're going to probably get similar results. If you do psychiatric batteries of tests, you will find that you have a very, very solid human being in President Biden, and you will definitely find a malignant narcissistic personality disorder in former President Trump. And when you have that personality trait and disorder, that's when you yank, you know, the reproductive rights away from women. That's when you treat transgender people terribly. That's when you dismiss the value of minorities. That's what you've got from the former president. So, I would be very interested to see what the psychiatric battery of tests would also look like for the two comparative candidates. But, you know, look, I'm just a lowly family physician, and I can only tell you this: The guy was able to answer my questions, he has a great team around him, and he really has the right policies for our country. That's ultimately what should carry the day. I know that people want to make sure that the debate wasn't kind of the baseline now. We're going to have that chance. There'll be another debate. There's going to be many interviews. There's going to be a thousand public events where people are going to stream them live on social media. I think if the president rallies a little, and he has rallied these last 13 days since that debate, then we can really look into their hearts and say, look, the country cannot afford to go back to Donald Trump. And let's rally around and support this president. That's kind of what I would like to see my Democratic colleagues do.

There are those who would be skeptical and say, okay, well, the best polls are Election Day, and I can show you a poll to fit anything. Those numbers show you a great deal of things. Ashley, let me begin with you here, you heard earlier today former Speaker Pelosi, who you've worked for, by the way, sort of leave perhaps a door open or a glimmer of consideration. People are interpreting that she wanted Biden to maybe make decision. He has made decision. Why do you think she said the things she did? Is it being misinterpreted? ASHLEY ETIENNE, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR V.P. KAMALA HARRIS: No, I mean, she also said today that she thinks that he can win in November. But I think what she's trying to do is give the caucus some space to deliberate, for members to make their grievances known, and -- and also give the president some room, too, to also engage those members. And so, the question is whether or not that's actually happening right now. I think the question was, you asked the governor, how do you stop the bleeding?

I'm also hearing that leadership is coming together, rallying, thinking through alternatives. And if he doesn't have a good performance on Thursday, is planning to actually stage some level of an intervention with the president by the weekend. I'm also hearing from the White House that they feel like they just need to make it to Friday. He needs to have a solid performance on Thursday.

I mean, you've heard a little bit from both just even tonight, the prosecution side, the defense side. The prosecution arguing that Baldwin used the gun irresponsibly. The defense saying he's just an actor. He had no way of knowing it was loaded. Who gave the more convincing opening statements?",

That's what the FBI ballistics report says. And Baldwin famously told George Stephanopoulos that he did not.But I think the defense had a compelling argument that there were more culpable people here. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, of course, is the armorer. She was convicted and sentenced to 18 months. But assistant director David Halls, he was the one who said it was a cold gun. And there was a 9-1-1 video that was played -- excuse me, an audio that said that he was the one who was responsible. And the defense was able to get that in. And he, of course, got a no-time misdemeanor deal. So, I think the defense has the edge so far.",

And we don't know if it was this specific firearm, but at least one firearm that had discharged, maybe even more than one.

I speak to millions of people every day on my radio show. And that's the sentiment I hear that is -- that is kind of bantered around. And so, I just think the one thing I can say for sure is the reticence that a lot of young Black men have with the Democratic Party is the cowardice at every turn, the hand-wringing, the fecklessness, and they exhibit it all the time.

When Donald Trump won, it had disastrous consequences for Black people.If you look at who suffered the most under those policies, if you look at his COVID reaction, who died the most? So, this, for me, is not a whimsical conversation. For me, it's not a conversation about what is -- what is uncomfortable. It is what is necessary. Look at Project 2025 and tell me, for sure, I watch the mass media, and no one has interviewed anybody seriously with the fervor about Biden's age that they do about Project 2025. No one. No one. And who does it affect? If they disband or absolve the Department of Education, who does it affect primarily? Environmental rollbacks, who does it affect primarily? All the things that are geared (ph). If they DEI or if they Black history, who does it affect? Because the truth of the matter is in 2020, it was Black and brown people that fired Donald Trump. More white people voted for him in 2020 than voted for him in 2016. Black and brown people fired him. And as a result of this, we have these draconian measures than Project 2025. And more -- rather than Democrats focusing on that, they're focusing on the age of a man. By the time this is over, one thing is for certain, Joe Biden will be older, and Project 2025 will still be the platform that is running behind all of this.",

She has been an attorney general of the largest, most populous, most wealthy state in the country. So, there is this notion. More -- more -- America has been more damaged by GCI than DEI. The greedy, corrupt, incompetent white men have caused more damage to the United States of America than diversity, equity, inclusion.Who caused Boeing? Who caused the mortgage crisis? Who caused our reaction and our lack of reaction to COVID? It wasn't -- because what people do is blame the things they can't control. Kamala Harris is more than qualified to accept the presidency of the United States of America, which is interesting because her chance to be president wasn't fealty. It wasn't much like Donald Trump's -- whoever his select will be. It is her -- it is her professionalism and her, actually, ability to run the country. And another point is, if Joe Biden, as a lot of people worry, can't complete his term, who's better qualified than to complete his term than Vice President Harris? So, you have a twofer. You have both the power of the incumbency and somebody who's more than willing, capable, and able to run the presidency should he cede or should he not be able to complete his thing. So what men do, what mediocre white men do, is blame things. They have no excuse for their failures. The reason that Donald Trump did not get a second term is because he so mishandled COVID that he was fired by the American people. And only their ability to hold their nose and keep running keeps him in the office. To attack a woman -- we can attack her policies, we can attack the things that you do, but her competence is above -- is above the pale. We don't even have that conversation.
