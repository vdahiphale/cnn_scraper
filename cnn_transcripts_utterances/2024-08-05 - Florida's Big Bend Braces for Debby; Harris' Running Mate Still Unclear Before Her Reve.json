U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will soon decide who will join her on the Democratic ticket as her running mate. And the clock is ticking.Harris is expected to appear with her choice at a Philadelphia rally on Tuesday when they will kick off a campaign blitz across multiple battleground states throughout the week. But a source familiar with the search says Harris is hoping to keep her selection under wraps as close to the rally as possible. Sources say Harris interviewed at least three top V.P. contenders on Sunday. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. There has been a renewed interest in Walz, according to those close to the Harris campaign. Well, meanwhile, new polling shows the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is tight.  Using an average of four recent national polls, a fresh CNN poll of polls shows there is no clear leader between the two candidates. Trump is holding on to 49 percent support, while Harris is at 47 percent. CNN's Eva McKend was outside the vice president's residence on Sunday, and here she is with more on the Harris campaign veepstakes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: As the time nears when Vice President Harris will make her announcement, we know that she is primarily looking for a governing partner and someone who can help her deliver these key battleground states. Having one-on-one conversations with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. We believe that we spotted Governor Shapiro's motorcade. We saw a motorcade with Pennsylvania tags similar to the motorcade that surrounded the governor when he left Pennsylvania early Sunday. Eric Holder also spotted. He, of course, is the former Obama-era attorney general, and he is responsible for overseeing a team of attorneys that are vetting these finalists, giving presentations to the vice president about her options. This all comes as a new CBS poll reveals that Harris and the former president are in a statistical tie with her at 50 percent and Trump at 49 percent. And that really illustrates how dramatically this contest has changed with this Democratic shakeup of their ticket. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign launching Republicans for Harris, that is what they describe as a campaign within a campaign, basically where they will deploy a Republican surrogates, high profile Republicans to try to convince other Republicans to support Vice President Harris. They believe that they have an opening with never-Trumpers and conservatives in key battleground states like Georgia that just do not have an appetite for supporting the former president.

So it's been nearly a decade and the Democrats now have a candidate that they're super excited about. Let's see how long this lasts. But Kamala Harris now has many paths to victory.

We saw protests across cities in the U.K. on Saturday.And it was expected that there would be some more today on Sunday. But they really have degenerated into perhaps even more violence than we saw a day earlier. This is in Tamworth this evening. This is just outside Birmingham, the U.K.'s second city, where, as you say, the mob there tried to and succeeded in setting fire to a Holiday Inn Extra, which has been housing asylum seekers, people that have come to this country to try to get refugee status. And I suppose the timing is perhaps a little embarrassing for the local member of Parliament, who's from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, when just last week she said in Parliament that the local people in Tamworth wanted their Holiday Inn back. They didn't want it to continue housing asylum seekers. And some of those people perhaps may have taken those words and taken matters into their own hands. And this just came a few hours after a mob also managed to set fire to a Holiday Inn Extra in Rotherham in the north of England, where also the fire was put out. Officers there with riot shields seemingly pinned against the wall of the hotel there as the rioters threw projectiles at them. They smashed their way into the hotel. They took out furniture and started hurling that at the officers as well. At least 10 officers have been injured. There have been something like 150 arrests after yesterday's violence. No doubt there have been many more today. And there's even reports that the government is going to have to draft in extra lawyers and have courts working kind of overnight to process the large number of people that are going to have to go through the legal system now after being caught on camera and being found to be in breach of the law.

A decline of 12.4 percent. But sadly, Japan is not alone. We're also seeing very steep losses in South Korea, in Taiwan. Lots of markets in Asia are in the red. As you mentioned, markets in the U.S. closed downward on Friday with a lack of optimistic economic news. And now we're seeing it spread to this part of the world. In particular, in Japan, there's been a lot of concern about interest rates. That these interest rates are going to remain high. That we will see continued hikes.And that did not sit well with traders for the last few days. And now we have all this anxiety in the United States creating really this global concern. In fact, if we look at the markets in Europe, there are indications that it will be another turbulent day as the sun moves around the world, so to speak. In addition to the concerns about the interest rate hikes here in Japan, there are just some global concerns right now, including the tension in the Middle East. Will there be retaliation by Iran toward Israel? Those geopolitical issues obviously create some concern among traders who, quite frankly, want to sell out, get out of the market. We're also seeing some concerns with U.S. companies. It was just last week that we saw Intel announce that it's going to be laying off workers. Amazon, which is another big name in American business, gave forward guidance, as they say, in the industry. They looked ahead and felt that the growth that they will see in the past will not necessarily be happening at that fast of a pace. So there's a lot of reasons for people to feel discouraged, and it seems to be traveling around the globe. In fact, at CNN, we have what's known as the Fear and Greed Index. And what we do is look at all of these different factors, seven different factors that go into stock trading. And right now, that index is at a 27 in the fear category, and it's hovering over extreme fear. So what people are seeing in the markets is also being reflected in this index.

So it's no longer the extraordinary bounce back, it's now just the boring, this is what an economy looks like. It grows at a reasonable rate, wages grow at a reasonable rate, inflation is reasonably low. All sorts of things are dull, but there's none of the excitement of the past few years.

So there are a lot of questions about the quality of the Seine River today. Now, we know that Belgium dropped out just yesterday after one of its athletes, Claire Michel, fell ill following her swim in the Seine last week. Now, crucially, we do not know what her illness is and we do not know if it is linked to her swim in the Seine. But the Belgium Olympic Committee did release this statement with some pretty sharp words, Rosemary. So they said they hoped that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games, such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format. Now, meanwhile, Switzerland had to change up its lineup as well after one of its athletes got a gastrointestinal infection. But again, we don't know if that infection is indeed linked to his swim in the Seine last week. Now, you know, organizers have kept stressing that they are testing the Seine every day and they say that it was safe for the athletes to get in it last week and indeed today. Rosemary.",
