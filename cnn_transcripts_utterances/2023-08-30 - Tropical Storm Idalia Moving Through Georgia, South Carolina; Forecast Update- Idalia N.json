No longer a hurricane, now a tropical storm after lashing Florida as a devastating category three hurricane earlier today. Landfall this morning was in Keaton Beach, which is right along the so called Big Bend of Florida. The Big Bend is where the Panhandle meets Florida's west coast, the west coast of the peninsula. The National Hurricane Center's very first for action back on Saturday came within just 10 miles of that, about 20 miles north. A woman in the town of Perry, Florida, captured a tree falling right on her home as Idalia moved through. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Governor's wife, Casey DeSantis, posted this picture on social media.CNN is covering this from Florida to Georgia where the storm is right now.

As long as this keeps on moving, we are in good shape.I just saw a live shot there from Tallahassee, and it was sunny already. And the days after a hurricane, it can get very, very hot in that sun. But now 70 miles per hour, no more number four. The storm itself, no -- nothing to worry about at this point in time other than some rain and a little bit of wind and the potential for a land falling tornado or so. The wind issue -- I mean, really, we're not going to see gusts of 100 miles per hour. That is done. It's been over land long enough. There is the threat though, of the tornado still. And we have two tornado warnings in effect. They're not large tornadoes and they may not even be on the ground, but you may -- they have a way of getting these warnings to your phone. Make sure you know how to do that. Even though they're small and really not small if they're near your house, are they? Five hundred thousand without power now with the power outages stretching up into parts of South Carolina. So, yes, you mentioned how quickly it's moving, spreading the rainfall out a little bit, but still the potential in the Piedmont here of four to six inches of rainfall, and that's enough to cause some of those more topographic areas to fall off and into creeks and streams and get into some river flooding there possible later on today, Jake.",

And one of the reasons why I want to show this, they are taking extra precautions here. The port has been shut down, and as I mentioned in the last hour, the large bridges throughout this area have also been closed off because they're worried about the wind. The other thing that we've been monitoring is the power outages throughout the area. Georgia Power has been staying on top of that. You can go on an app and look at it digitally and see how it's spiking up and down. And the winds in the area at Hunter Army Airfield, which is nearby, they've been gusting around 45 miles per hour. So not the heavy wind gusts that we've seen in other places. If you did know that this was a normal day around here, you would not know a hurricane is coming, but the streets are empty because this coastal community is not taking any chances. As we've been driving around just a little bit, we've noticed the streets have been clear, emergency operations are standing by just in case anything else happens. But right now, Jake, we're told it's the next two hours where we should see the heavy rain and wind coming into this area.

And then we have U.S. 1927.These are all very good highways once you get them cleared to move up and down and get in these areas.
