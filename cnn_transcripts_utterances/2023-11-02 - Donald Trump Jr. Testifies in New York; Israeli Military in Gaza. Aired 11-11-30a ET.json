To hear something that I haven't heard before, it was moving. And then, look, you know they're not going to produce more music, obviously, but when you hear Paul McCartney say it's their final song, that's poignant.

What we had heard up until now is that troops were moving toward Gaza City, they were at the gates of Gaza City. This is kind of the first confirmation they are within the city itself.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, the live-fire exercise ended a short time ago, but, as we weredriving back to where we're staying, we heard two consecutive booms in the sky just above me here. It's the reason I got my gear on now. And that was Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system engaging incoming rockets coming from Lebanon. North, due north, is just here to my left. And we have since here from the IDF that 25 rockets were fired in from Southern Lebanon, most of them, as far as we know now, landing in open areas, but those two big booms, again, it engaged some of them. So, it was able to destroy the missile system defense system in the air. That is a higher pace of rocket fire than at least I have experienced here in the last several days of being up north. It's been a daily event, sporadic fire, some rockets, some artillery, some attempted ground incursions. But that pace is higher. And that's notable because, as you and I, all of us were talking earlier, the concern is that Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, might order his forces to enter this conflict in a more aggressive way with the attention focused on his speech tomorrow. This is a little sample of that. It's also a sample, I should say, that it's been a low-grade, I think sort of a slow-boil kind of threat up here for these couple of weeks since October 7, over three weeks now. But that is enough to have really emptied out large parts of the northern part of this country, because folks make the calculation, understandably, they don't want their family living under this threat, right? We heard this happen. We threw our kit on, made sure we knew whether the threat was over. You don't want to have to do that every day. And that's why big portions of the northern part of the country have decided to move south.",

And that means getting in there, clearing all the way up, if it's a high-rise, up to the roof, and then digging down into the basement and clearing every room, and then getting into this awful tunnel complex that is built. We have read, heard reports that just now that Israelis will be in the fight, and, all of a sudden, Hamas fighters will pop up behind them coming out of tunnels and cellars in buildings that they thought they'd cleared. So this is methodical. It takes manpower. There's no easy, clean way to do it. The heavy vehicles are generally there to provide backup and firepower when the infantry hit a structure. The infantry also protects the tanks and armor personnel carriers that if they get out too far in front, they become very, very vulnerable. Also, remember, we have got IEDs, we have got drones. I mean, it is -- there is a lot going on, and the only way to do it is slow and methodically. And I think that's what the IDF is doing on several fronts.",
