The Biden Administration and we heard this from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. They appear confident the Israelis will agree to the proposal that's on the table, that despite the fact that some far-right members of Netanyahu's own government have said they will torpedo the government and the deal if Netanyahu agrees to it. And he has also said he won't agree to a permanent end of hostilities.Still the U.S., at least on the Israeli side remains confident. Hamas has made positive noises and seems to have given an initial positive response for the ceasefire on the table. But now, it comes down to the details and that is where this has fallen apart repeatedly in the past. That is Blinken's concern right now, as he goes through shuttle diplomacy here in the Middle East. He started in Egypt a couple of days ago. He held meetings in Israel with the prime minister, the defense minister, the head of the opposition, Benny Gantz who just left the war cabinet after stepping down. These are all of the players you'd need to have on your side to get it over the line on the Israeli side. And now he's focused in seeing if you can pressure the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the Qataris, to try to get Hamas to agree to it and to get to a point where we are there, where there is a ceasefire, not waiting for the final details to be hammered out. It is a -- even if we are closer than we've been in months, the process isn't over the line yet and Blinken knows that very well.",

Meanwhile, on the Israeli side, the four rescued hostages are out of the hospital, so they continue their recovery, but they were brought here suffering from some malnutrition, but doctors said in fairly good condition, able to go home or at least able to be released from the hospital within a matter of days. All that is positive, but the unity you would have expected from an operation like that, though it was certainly there in the country celebrated, it quickly led to the divisions we have seen for so long now with anti- government protests calling for the ceasefire that will bring the remaining hostages home. In fact, as Blinken left earlier today, before he flew out, there was a small protest for that same anti-government pro-ceasefire message right outside of his hotel.",

So certainly, talking about rebuilding all the things that have been destroyed in that country, in the not-too- distant future. The Ukrainians, of course, hope that is something that's really key here. But I think also that bit of sound that we just listened to from Volodymyr Zelenskyy about him calling for more air defense system is also something that's absolutely key to the Ukrainian president.In fact, in that very same speech, he was calling for Ukraine to get seven Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. Those are, of course, by far the most capable surface-to-air missile systems that the Ukrainians have. Now, the Germans have just OK-ed sending a third system to the Ukrainians. That in itself is a big deal and certainly, also something that the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz talked about as well. So, those definitely the key principles for the Ukrainians. And we just had a press conference here a couple of minutes ago by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and also with the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And I was able to ask both of them, first of all, Olaf Scholz, whether or not those bad results that his party got in the EU elections and then, of course, also pro-Kremlin parties doing very well in those elections in France and in Germany, whether that could hamper his efforts to try and support Ukraine in the future. He said absolutely not, Germany well continue to support Ukraine as will other European countries. And then Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his part, also said that he believes that Ukraine with the military assistance that it's getting and they obviously hope to get a lot more that he believes that they will not only be able to hold the Russian military up, but possibly even turn the tides on the battlefield. But of course, that is something for the Ukrainians that has been very difficult, continues to be very difficult. Another big touchy point also for the Ukrainians is the mobilization of people to actually go to the frontlines and use some of those western weapons that are being supplied.

PLEITGENThe Ukrainians apparently have now managed to hold them up and there were a couple of things that were key to do that, one of them was the fact that the Ukrainians have a lot more ammunition, a lot more artillery shells than they did before. They also put some of their most capable troops on that part of the frontline. But of course, also Amara, the fact that the U.S. and other allies have now allowed Ukraine to strike Russian troops inside Russian territory in that part of Russia, close to the frontline, the Ukrainians saying that, for instance, those HIMARS artillery rocket systems already making a big difference on the battlefield. Now, the Ukrainians say that they are holding the Russians up to a certain extent, they believe they've reversed the momentum there. But of course, they are still up against a very big force that also has a lot more manpower and the Ukrainians right now are saying, and this is something that Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said just a couple of minutes at the press conference, they are saying that mobilization is really kicking in, in Ukraine now. But of course, it's going to take time to train those troops up, get them battle ready, and then of course, also train them up on the western weapons that they might soon receive and that they have been receiving for a while, to be able to make them a capable fighting force, Amara.",

On the other hand, some of their own witnesses, some of the same prosecution witnesses said, well, we didn't see a gun. We knew that he was using drugs at time, but he went to rehab three or four times, and didn't really consider himself an addict when he came out, that he was on his way to recovery.

We saw a similar thing with his conviction, Trump's campaign says $70 million of that $141 million was raised in the days after the verdict came down, that he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. So, they are trying to use that to continue to boost his numbers. What's still unclear though, Amara, is how this is going to play out in the long run.

But realistically -- ELLIOT WILLIAMS, FORMER DEPUTY U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's unlikely that someone convicted of this type of felony in New York with no prior criminal history would see much, if any, prison time. TODD (voice-over): Trump's advanced age experts say would also be a factor in not sending him to prison. He turns 78 this week. Another sentencing option, probation -- analysts say, while that might be a more realistic choice, it would come with a host of inconveniences and indignities for the former president.",

Hundreds of families who live on this small island off the coast of Panama have started their new journey, leaving their flooded homeland behind. Alberto Lopez is one of many who call this place home. ALBERTO LOPEZ, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (through translator): We feel sadness because if this island disappears, part of our heart, part of our culture disappears. ROMO (voice-over): Panamanian authorities say this is the first case of human displacement in Latin America caused by climate change. This week, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said the planet had endured 12 consecutive months of unprecedented heat, causing sea levels to rise. ATILIO MARTINEZ, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (through translator): In recent decades, global warming has started very strongly. Some sardines, lobsters, and everything we consume are disappearing. Now, they have realized that global warming is one of the factors in the situation, so they have been forced to relocate us. ROMO (voice-over): The islanders are relocating to newly built homes on the mainland that where, Panama's housing minister says, they won't have to worry about costs. ROGELIO PAREDES, PANAMA HOUSING MINISTER (through translator): We have invested $12.2 million in this. All the islands have the same problem, so we hope the necessary resources will be set aside to anticipate these problems. ROMO (voice-over): The United Nation's Population Fund assessed 41 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean who live in coastal areas are threatened by the severe weather brought by the climate emergency. LOPEZ (through translator): I thought of my grandmother, my grandfather, my aunt who died here. It will never be the same but we have to move forward because life goes on.
