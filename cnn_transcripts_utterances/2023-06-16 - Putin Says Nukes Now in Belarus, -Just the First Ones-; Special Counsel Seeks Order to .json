I'm Brianna Keilar in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin surrounding Ukraine with nuclear weapons. The Russian president declaring today he now has nukes on standby in Belarus, which is where Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine from more than one year ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The first nuclear warheads have been delivered to the territory of Belarus, but just the first ones. This is the first batch. The use of nuclear weapons undoubtedly is theoretically possible for Russia. For Russians, it is possible if there is a threat to our territorial integrity, independents, and sovereignty to the existence of the Russian state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hundreds more armored vehicles of all descriptions he said had also been taken out. Soon, the country will be only using western military equipment, and you can't fight long -- you can't fight long like that, Putin said. He also referred, Vladimir Putin, to the recent cross border attacks that have been taking place inside Russia, and seem to suggest that Russia's response to those attacks had been somewhat restrained. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translator): These attempts to do damage to the Kremlin, to the presidential residence, the attacks on the Belgorod region, and the neighboring regions. It is on attempt to provoke Russia into retaliatory powerful actions. Look, if we destroyed five Patriot missile complexes in Kyiv, and then we easily can destroy any building in the center of Kyiv.

GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Brianna, you know, one thing that I think all of us has come to understand since this war started is a thing that is becoming universal truth. Mr. Putin has proven himself to be a lying liar, who lies a lot -- gaslighting, misinformation, what the Russians call maskirovka. It accompanies every type of their operation. When you look at the troops on the ground, no, Ukrainian forces have not lost ten times as much as Russia. We already know that to be true.

Or that we can hit anything in Kyiv anytime we want to. We know that to be garbage. Unfortunately, inside of Russia where Putin controls 90 percent of, you know, what most Russians see, you know, he finds an easier audience for that. But the interesting thing for me and all this, Brianna, it's like Mark said. We see all of this layer of, layer upon layer of propaganda. Every once in a while, you will see a blip, you'll see Putin say something like, well you know, our army could've done better. We could have improvements. And whenever you see a blip like that, it is different, it is worth watching, and it is worth wondering why he says those things.

Lukashenko says, oh, no, no, I get to use them whenever I want when I put them on my airplanes, and these things will be hugely dangerous for all of NATO.So you're seeing this kind of confusion, or perhaps planed confusion to attempt to make the West blink again. Now, we can't say they're not going to use nuclear weapons, but we haven't show them to they want to do that because they're fearful of the repercussions. But this most recent issue of transfer to Belarusian, I think might give the Russians and Mr. Putin a little bit of plausible deniability of what might happen in the future.

But really, I think that the most successful use of these nuclear weapons, and by the way, we don't know how many them still work. We thought it was a great army before I went to the Ukraine, it didn't end up so well. So who knows how many of these things work, that said it doesn't take many.

He is also accused in this case of tampering with witnesses, and encouraging witnesses to lie. So, one of the things, of course, to see what this relates to is the idea that the special counsel as you just pointed out in that section of the order, that the special counsel is still doing an investigation. There's other part of this case that could be charged, there is also parts of the January 6th investigation which Jack Smith, the special counsel, still investigating there. Some witnesses, Brianna, who testified in this part with the Mar-a- Lago documents, and also our witnesses in the January 6th case.

ANDREW KACZYNSKI, SENIOR EDITOR OF CNN'S KFILE: Yeah, this has become a hugely volatile issue in Republican politics, and where was Donald Trump a decade ago? He was on the complete opposite side of this issue. Now, you heard those comments he made earlier in the year. The context for these comments in 2012 is there was a transgender Miss Universe contestant in Canada. The existing policy for the Miss Universe pageant was that there was a ban. She threatens legal action and Donald Trump personally says that he overturned the ban. He celebrates the buzz around it. He calls it modernizing the pageant. And what does he do to use as his rationale for changing the pageant? He cites the Olympics allowing transgender athletes. Now, we know we just heard him ranting against transgender women in sports. Fast forward just a few months at the Miss Universe pageant, the eventual winner, Olivia Culpo, gets asked whether she agrees with transgender women competing with the pageant. She gives an answer where she says that she does. She cites them having sex reassignment surgery. And Donald Trump was very enthusiastic about this. He approved of it. And in a couple of instances on \"Fox and Friends\", he even praised her for it. Take a listen to these. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
