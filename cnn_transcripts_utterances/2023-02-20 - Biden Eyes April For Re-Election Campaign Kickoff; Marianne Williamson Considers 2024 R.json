I think it's more than 70 percent of Democratic voters have said they don't want the President to run again. They want the party to nominate someone else.So if he runs against Ron DeSantis, who's 44, Nikki Haley, who's 51, then his age, I think, becomes much more of a liability, whereas him and Donald Trump are both pretty up there in age.",

And that's also why their hair isn't on fire right now. When you look at some of the polling in terms of the President's approval rating, in terms of these recent numbers, that a lot of Americans don't think Biden has accomplished much, they are going to spend this next year focusing on the implementation of that infrastructure bill, the chips bill, other pieces of legislation, and showing over this coming year what they've accomplished.",

We're hearing reports in the area of Daphne, in Hatay, which is still a while away, and we still felt that quake here.And I have to say, we were sitting inside at this hotel and there was a real sense of urgency, a real sense of fear and uncertainty. Of course, at the time, nobody knew how long this would last, how big the quake would be, but that immediate feeling of the ground shaking caused everyone to evacuate the building immediately. Families pulling their children out of the building, a real sense of fear. And we are now hearing unconfirmed reports of collapsed buildings in parts of the southeast of the country, in particular in the Hatay province, which was the hardest -- among the hardest hit provinces during last -- the earthquake of two weeks ago. So this is a real sense of concern. We're already hearing reports that this was felt in northern Syria. Reports there of collapsed buildings already as well. So there is a sense of urgency and a sense of concern around this and the possibility that this may have a terrible impact, of course, on those in the southeast of the country. And as you can imagine, those who experienced the earthquake two, three weeks ago now they are going through an immense amount of emotional trauma. The fear here is incredible and there is a real sense of urgency. Now, the Turkish government, of course, will be sending an update. We are still waiting to learn more information about this latest earthquake. But at this stage, reported by the authorities here 6.4 at center in Hatay. Abby?",

This is Neil Gorsuch's arguments don't exist today, and it's time for reconsideration.
