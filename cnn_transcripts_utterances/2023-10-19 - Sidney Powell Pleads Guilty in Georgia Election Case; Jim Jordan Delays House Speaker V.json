That's according to the Interior Ministry in Gaza. A spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces said he did not have information, but he said the military was looking into it. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Ashkelon, has been tracking all of this. We're going to begin with CNN's Nic Robertson, who is in Sderot, Israel, which is near the Gaza border.

Rockets aimed at Sderot, they camein, at least one impact that we're aware of here, no casualties associated with that. There has been -- it has been this northern end of Gaza, relatively quiet. I say relatively because we have heard amounts of small-arms fire, heavy machine gunfire. And we're hearing a helicopter. We have heard jets and the occasional missile strike into Gaza. But, in those terms, it has been relatively quiet. That strike on Khan Yunis further south from here, as you say, the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry saying a number of people injured, number of people killed, dozens of people there injured. It is kind of symptomatic of the many, many Israeli missile strikes that have gone into Gaza targeting Hamas, targeting their infrastructure, targeting their tunnels. I have been speaking with at least -- I have been speaking with two government ministers today. Both of them say Israel is not targeting civilians, both of them rejecting the pressure that's coming from the international community for a humanitarian pause to alleviate -- to alleviate the civilian suffering at this time. Both of them, though, expecting that humanitarian aid that right now is that the Rafah Crossing on the Egyptian side, expecting that to come in to Gaza in the coming days.",

About 25 percent of all the rockets that have been fired from Gaza have targeted this very city.That amounts to about 1,200 rockets. And while the Iron Dome does intercept the overwhelming majority of those rockets, about 200 of them have made direct hits here in the city, displacing families, causing casualties, even some fatalities. And what we visited today was the command center, where city officials coordinate the emergency response to these rockets, sometimes tracking the trajectory of these rockets before they even make impact, figuring out where they are going to land, if, indeed, they get through that Iron Dome missile defense system. Now, what we saw today was a city that is really calm, a city that has really come to a standstill in many ways. About 25 percent of the city's population has already left. The population that remains, though, many of them are resilient and determined to stay, despite the barrage. We were in a supermarket today when an air raid siren went off. And what you saw was some people in fear running inside the store, while others really just continued to go about their day, continuing to do their shopping, as they saw it. But 90 percent of businesses in this city are indeed closed. What is open, though, grocery stores, pharmacies, et cetera. But everything else is pretty much shuttered.",

And we heard from the defense minister, saying that troops, Israeli forces, will soon see Gaza, the quote was, from the inside. I think the question is, once that does happen, once those forces are inside Gaza, how long they're there and what that looks like and what it means for the civilians who are still in Northern Gaza.",

That is something the defense minister said very clearly today. Whenever it does happen, though, there is, as you said, still significant uncertainty about how long that mission actually lasts. Israeli officials have made very clear that this will be a different kind of ground operation than anything that has happened before. The last time that they went in, in any significant numbers was in 2014. This will be a much wider-scale campaign. The question is, will they be able to achieve the objective of eliminating Hamas, as Israeli officials, including the Israeli prime minister, have made clear that that is the objective. And, also, what happens next? I mean, who -- if not the Israeli military, who takes control of Gaza? And will Hamas indeed be able to actually be eliminated, when it is a militant force that can embed with the population, that can blend in with the civilian population? Is that actually an achievable goal? And what happens after?",

Kayla, we know that, obviously, Biden, he previewed here that he is going to be asking for a massive aid package from the U.S. Congress.

That's who he's making this ask to. And I just want to let you know what I have been hearing from sources here on the ground about -- President Biden was not here for very long. It was just really a matter of hours that he was here in Tel Aviv yesterday. But even during those conversations that he was having with this newly formed wartime cabinet, what they're dealing with, of course, is, as Jeremy was noting, with when this ground invasion is going to happen, how long it's going to last, the drama that is happening on Capitol Hill came up during those conversations, I'm told, where President Biden was telling these Israeli senior government officials that he was going to be making this big ask of Congress, about $10 billion we're expecting for Israel itself. But during those conversations, he was lamenting what was happening almost at the same time. Jim Jordan was failing again to secure enough votes to become the Republican House speaker, because, of course, officials here are fully aware of how that affects them, the fact that no matter what President Biden asked Congress for, there is no Congress that can actually act if there's not a House speaker to allow that legislation to pass through the House. And so this is something that it certainly is of a concern here. They don't seem to be deeply worried, because the president offered them assurances that they did believe it would be taken care of. But it is remarkable that that drama that is playing out in the Republican Conference is something that was being discussed in the basement of a hotel here in Tel Aviv, as the president was meeting with the Israeli prime minister and other officials who are dealing with a war on their hands.",

So things are very heated right now, very emotional. And so it's unclear whether there is a path forward for this resolution, whether Jordan is going to stick by it. The other wrinkle here is that it's going to take some Democratic votes to put up this resolution. They had their own meeting this morning, still weighing their options.
