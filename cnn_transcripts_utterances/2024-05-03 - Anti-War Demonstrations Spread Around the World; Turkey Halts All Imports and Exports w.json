It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Well motivating these global protests, of course, outrage over what is happening in Gaza. The U.S. Defense Secretary has just issued a new warning on Rafah. And this is the scene outside the court where Donald Trump will appear in about 30 minutes. My colleague, Paula Newton will have all the details from New York. Plus, just hours ago, China made its latest move in the modern day space race, aiming for the dark side of the moon. Well, the stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. This is the picture on the futures, the U.S. jobs report is out. The economy added just 175,000 jobs last month that are weaker than expected and possibly could mean that the feds anti-inflation efforts are working. That is something that we will explore later this hour. Right now the U.S. is dealing with newly revealed deep divisions after weeks of protests scenes of violence. Dramatic arrests in a little more than two weeks some 2000 people in the U.S. have been arrested at protests on college campuses. The latest came just last night. Well, that video from Portland State University in Oregon, police moved in and removed pro-Palestinian protesters from the library that they had occupied since Monday. At last check there, 30 people have been arrested. Well, it's not just in the United States. As I said students in Paris are rallying at this hour in support of Palestinians in Gaza. The protest is outside the Pantheon not far from prestigious Paris universities like the Sorbonne. Well after weeks of what critics have called dithering, the White House ramping up its criticism of the campus protests. We learned a short time ago, the Biden's education secretary sent a letter to college presidents in it she condemns what she calls Abhorrent anti-Semitic incidents on campus. It comes just a day after Biden made his first in depth comments on the protests. Forcefully saying that dissent is necessary disorder, he said is not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A grandmother kisses her young grandchildren. Their small bodies share just one body bag a 4 year old Kareem and his 2 year old sister Mona were killed on Tuesday by an Israeli airstrike. Their aunt says they are innocent. The babies went to bed last night and never woke up. Our hearts are broken forever. The doctors tried to save Mona, but could not. The children's parents were seriously injured in the same strike. But Rafah was not home for these children. The grandmother says the family was displaced multiple times by the Israeli military, ending up in a tent on the southern border alongside hundreds of thousands of others who have nowhere else to go. Speaking of the Israeli military, she says this is all they want. This is their goal. The IDF referred to a previous statement when asked about this strike, saying they are operating to dismantle Hamas, adding quote, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. But despite months of threatening and major ground offensive in Rafah, the military has not told civilians to evacuate. For many here, there is no other option. At the start of this week in Rafah, 22 people were killed and in Israeli airstrike including at least one infant and a toddler. A one year old killed is carried in the uncle's arms. He says this is who they are targeting. This is the safe Rafah they talk about. It is the area the Israeli military has pushed civilians towards for months. An area well over 1 million Palestinians are barely surviving in. Food, water, shelter, a scarce disease is rising. But amid such misery, some adults are trying to remind children of their previous life. Just seven months ago, where they could play and learn safely. This volunteer teacher says the children's mental state is distressed. They have no stability, they're distracted and they lose focus. So we work twice as hard to try and grab their attention and help them learn. Muhammad says he's happy he can play and study here. He says we lost our schools. We lost everything. A tent school may not see much. But even this pretense of normality for these children will be lost if they're forced to move yet again. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Abu Dhabi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New details from a key witness the ex-attorney of an adult film star and Playboy model who brokered hush money deals at the center of Former President Donald Trump's criminal case. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Getting ready to spend another day in the courthouse which is bogus trial. SCANNELL (voice-over): Keith Davidson back on the stand on day 10 of Trump's trial cross examined by Trump's attorney who attempted to discredit Davidson by painting him as a shady lawyer. Meanwhile, prosecutors tried to show how Davidson's arrangement with a tabloid and Trump's ex lawyer Michael Cohen to kill two bombshell stories about Trump's alleged affairs directly impacted the 2016 election. Trump denies both affairs. In his testimony, Davidson recalled texting National Enquirer Editor Dylan Howard on election night in 2016 as results came in, in favor of Trump. Davidson, said he texts Howard, what have we done? Oh, my God, Howard replied. Davidson testified there was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way strike that our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Prosecutors played an audio recording of Cohen saying Trump hates that they paid off adult film star Stormy Daniels. Cohen was heard saying, I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, I hate the fact that we did it. And my comment to him was but every person that you've spoken to tells you it was the right move. The payment and conspiracy of Trump's involvement in Daniels' hush money deal is the crux of the prosecution's case. Prosecutors also questioned Davidson about Daniels sitting down with Jimmy Kimmel in January 2018. Before the interview Daniels and her attorney released a statement denying an alleged affair with Trump. But hours later she told Kimmel it didn't look like her signature.",

We shouldn't say he's speaking if he says anything of important we'll bring it to you. Brynn, those audio recordings must have gotten the jury's attention at this -- BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I really think someone earlier said they had to digest that because there was so much played for them. And this is not only just for the prosecution, but the defense was playing those audio recordings as well. And on the prosecution side, remember, they have to tie Donald Trump to knowing about these hush money payments. And that's what they were trying to do with at least one of them. Now, we're aware of these audio recordings, because actually one came out on CNN years ago, but one of those that was played, was between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump essentially talking about the payment to Karen McDougal and sort of the negotiations that were around it. Now that's important for jurists are here if they want to kind of realize did Donald Trump know about it or not. Now has to do with Karen McDougal and -- Stormy Daniels, but still an important audio recording. And then there was another one that was played now this is when Keith Davidson was actually on the stand. And it was between the conversation of Cohen and Davidson. And essentially, Cohen, as you saw on -- said that he Donald Trump hated the fact that they did it in regards to the Stormy Daniels' non-disclosure agreement. So they're right. If you're a juror might think, you know, he didn't know about that. But that not you know that hush money payment. So these are so important. But again, the defense was using them as well, as Karen was pointing out, in one case. Cohen talked about leverage with Davidson saying that they had to get this payment done prior to the election because they would lose their leverage if they didn't. So they're being used on both sides. And it really, you know, I would think as a jury or ping pong game, trying to figure out which one you believe or which one's important to you.",

It's not subject that oh, that somebody plans to the day you have an actual recording of whatever is recorded on that recording itself. So makes it difficult for the defense to try to argue otherwise. I mean, the question would be is, how will you argue this? Would you argue with that you can consider it in some other way? Are you going to argue that no, this is not what it meant to say. This is what he meant to say.

And so the prosecutor should have followed up and did the same thing doing the cross examination. Because if the jury, I think the jury is now confused, I think the defense did leave an idea in this jury that way, this was a shakedown, Donald Trump was a victim here, he was being forced to give this money whether this story was true or not, because he needed to protect his family or he needed to protect his image. And not for the purposes of interfering with the campaign, which is huge, because you need to tie this Conspiracy, you need to tie this pavement to having to deal with the campaign. So hopefully, I think quite honestly, when Michael Cohen does come forth and testify. The prosecution is going to be able to clean that up. They expected that to happen.

Wall Street was anxiously awaiting these numbers. Well here is how stocks are reacting. Clearly there is some buying going on. Let's bring in Matt Egan question on, you know in anticipation of these numbers, of course Matt was what these numbers would mean for the Fed and for interest rates.

Historically, this would be looked at as strong. It's only because the market has been so hot. The jobs market has been so hot, that we're talking about this as a slowdown. Joe Biden can also talk about the historic nature here, right? This is another consecutive month, where the economy is adding jobs. And it's now the 27th month in a row where the unemployment rate is below 4 percent. That is tied for the longest streak in American history tied with the other streak that happened between 1967 and 1970. So historically, this is really, really positive. Joe -- we could hear from Donald Trump though, say, look, inflation remains a problem in this economy. And so I think that if you're in the White House, you're happy to see strong job numbers. You're happy to hear more talk about interest rate cuts, but at the end of the day, I do think what they really need is more help on the inflation front. And we're going to be getting new numbers on inflation in the coming weeks and that's really where I think we're going to see more of an impact politically.",

Why did President Joe Biden lump Japan a close ally of theU.S. in with Russia, China and India as countries that he considers xenophobic? Well, he made the remarks on Wednesday at a fundraiser in Washington. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Arlette, what did exactly the Biden say?

      "sentences": "Yeah, Becky President Biden made these comments in a fundraiser with Asian American and Pacific Islandersupporters here in Washington on Wednesday evening. And in his comments, he was trying to talk about how immigration is foundational to the United States' thinking? And what he was saying was that he loved India and China in the category as being xenophobic, lumping them in with countries that are more adversarial to the U.S. like China and Russia. I want to read you specifically what President Biden said. He said, quote, you know, one of the reasons why our economy is growing is because of you and many others. Why? Because we welcome immigrants, we look to the -- look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India because they're xenophobic, they don't want immigrants. Now the White House yesterday sought to clarify the president's comments a bit saying that what he was trying to stress was that immigration was important here in the United States. But these comments certainly could set off some diplomatic anxiety with two countries that are key partners and allies to the United States. You'll remember Japan's Prime Minister Kishida was just here a few weeks ago for a state visit where the president touted the shared values for democracy between the two countries. But it also comes at a time when Japan has been facing a demographic crisis with an aging population. And new data from last year had shown that new births had actually declined in the country for an eighth consecutive year. Now, this really has broader implications for the workforce and economy in Japan. And it comes at a time when they have had more limited immigration. Japan and East Asian countries have not embraced immigration in the same way that places like the United States have to try to bolster their populations. Now this all comes as President Biden is also facing significant pressure back here at home when it relates to migrations. There have been strained resources at the U.S. southern border. The president had OK -- a bill that would have enacted some of the strictest immigration standards in quite some time. But what he has also been trying to stress is that this is a country of immigrants. And so that is where he was trying to present this argument as he spoke at that fundraiser earlier in the week.",

And it'salso about reminding his allies and supporters particularly those at the RNC, that he needs their checks. He needs them to be out there helping him they he needs to have them as surrogates to help campaign for him and boost his messaging. But again, a lot of this is about money. And that's where this fundraiser is happening this weekend, to try and do that and try to help him especially as he's trying to catch up to Joe Biden, in the money game. We've seen Joe Biden raise a lot more than Donald Trump. And so it's something that the Trump campaign is very much aware of. Now, I also just want to note something that's also interesting around this weekend, and that's that many of Donald Trump's potential vice presidential contenders are also going to be at this Republican National Committee Retreat. And also on the sidelines of this big event on Saturday featuring the former president that includes people like North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. There are others like JD Vance, the Senator from Ohio, a lot of names that we've been hearing Donald Trump tout privately about who he might want to pick for a potential vice presidential contender. Now, I just also want to point out, though, that he's not expected to make that announcement anytime soon. He says he'll be announcing that closer to the Republican National Convention in July. But I definitely think there'll be some conversations here on the sidelines that can give us some more insight into how he's thinking about this Becky.",
