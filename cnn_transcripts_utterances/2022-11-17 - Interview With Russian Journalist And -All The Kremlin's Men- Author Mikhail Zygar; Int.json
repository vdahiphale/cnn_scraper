I'm Christian Amanpour in London. Not Ukraine's fault, that is how the NATO's secretary general described Tuesday's explosion in Poland near the border with Ukraine where a missile fell and killed two people. NATO's view that this was a misfire by Ukrainian air defenses against Russia's cruise missiles means that Moscow bears full responsibility. It was the first time a NATO country was directly hit during this conflict. It's a reminder of the potential risks of spillover. My first guest tonight is following developments in the war very closely. He is the Russian author and journalist Mikhail Zygar. Now, in exile, he's also the founding editor of the independent television station TV Rain. Resistance against Putin takes many forms. And we spoke here in the studio about why going public with his own gay marriage was an act of protest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As you know several times, he's obliquely threatened it. And then he says no, no, no. This is neither militarily nor politically, you know, useful to us. We would never use a tactical nuke. And you wrote, though, in a recent column which was titled, \"The Russians Already Become Accustomed to the Bomb\", which frankly shocks me. You wrote, Russians Ukrainians, and Europeans have come a long way in their stance on nuclear war. At first the rest panic, then came the denial of danger, and finally the horror of the idea that it could come to this. Now, there is fatalistic indifference. Do you really think that?

The World Bank -- the head of the World Bank is a position that has traditionally been filled by the U.S. That is aninformal agreement, since World War II, and every administration has been reluctant to lose that privilege. And so, they are reluctant to change course -- to change heads in the middle of a term, but nothing could jeopardize the U.S. hold on that position more than having climate denial policies in the World Bank. The votes of the shareholders are necessary, and the U.S. can't do it unilaterally, but Germany has come out in favor of changing the World Bank head, the Australia has as well, several other countries. We have the votes, and I'm hopeful that they will get rid of this current head of the World Bank, put a new person in. And more important than the head of the World Bank is to broaden the mandate, to give them more leverage, that is to come up with terms that allow them to loan money in a way that brings them lots more private capital along with it. That's, again, what it should be during. And the problem is -- well, look at this way. If you look -- I mention all of those electricity plants installed worldwide, 90 percent of them are renewable last year. But if you look where they went? Mostly to the rich countries. And if you look at the ones in the U.S. and Canada, 96 percent of the money to build them came from the private sector. In Africa, only 14 percent of the money comes from the private sector, because they don't have access to these markets. And when they depend on government money, it makes them more vulnerable to these state-owned enterprises that are in the pockets of the fossil fuel companies and there are sometimes corrupt relationships, and they can keep going forward with fossil fuels and there is a so-called Dash for Gas in Africa now, and its fossil fuel colonialism because the resources that are developed are intended to go straight to Europe and straight to Asia. They don't benefit. The people of Africa, they leave them with what will become stranded assets, because the fossil fuel facilities are no longer competitive now, and as years go by, they are going to be less and less competitive. And it leaves them with climate chaos. So, yes, it's fossil fuel colonialism. One LNG export terminal in Africa would cost about $25 billion.

And we started the show, whatever, just over 10 years ago. So, she was still a senior citizen even then, and most people -- or most sensible people have probably hung up their boots by then. But, no. She is a proper workaholic, a proper lady of the industry. And she has this ability to be utterly hilarious and unique, and to take a line and make it -- give it an extra layer of wit and comedy. And then, to be able to turn on a sixpence and create great emotion and pathos within a scene. And something like \"Downton,\" that was absolutely perfect. And, you know, she is wonderful to watch and incredibly talented to be around and to watch the way she works. And, you know, in the final moments of our last encounter together, I really did reflect on the fact that I was so lucky to call her mom for the last 10 years or so.",

And so, she got a bit of a pen and paper, and I'm going to diluted a bit, but she said fancy a snog, a kiss? And scrunched it up.

So, I haven't read reviews. I will in time, when I finish publicizing the book and I can relax at Christmas time perhaps. But I like to reflect after the event. So, well, I'm very flattered that there's been a reaction like that. I found it a really fun experience. I don't take myself too seriously.

My father -- I'm very fortunate, he was in a benign place throughout. I know so many people don't have that good fortune. And he remained the twinkly kind man right to very, very end.

And I know, you know, there aren't many -- you know, many -- hundreds of thousands of people who would go through a terrible pain, trying to cope. But it's a shared experience.
