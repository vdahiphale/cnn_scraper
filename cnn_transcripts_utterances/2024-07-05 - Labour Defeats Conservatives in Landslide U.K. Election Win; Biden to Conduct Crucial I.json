In the United Kingdon, a resounding Labour victory after 14 years of Conservative rule, but the win for the center left is an anomaly in Europe right now. France will go back to the polls this weekend and the far-right are on the front. CNN's chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour sat down with National Rally Party leader, Marine Le Pen. In the Middle East, voting is wrapping up in Iran's presidential elections with two starkly different candidates. We're live in Tehran. And in the United States, the Biden campaign has a new strategy but will anything be enough to shake off last week's debate disaster? Where a new political era is beginning in the past few hours, Keir Starmer has been formally appointed as the new British prime minister. It follows a landslide win by his Labour Party. In his first address as prime minister, Mr. Starmer said his priority is bringing about meaningful change for the whole of the U.K. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And over my shoulder, you can see 11 Downing Street. That's the home of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We expect a new Chancellor of the Exchequer to be announced very soon. And it's expected that the former shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer for Keir Starmer in their Shadow Cabinet, Rachel Reeves, who was trained at the Bank of England and is well-respected in the city and among the markets here as a very safe and competent pair of hands, is expected to be appointed and she might actually appear at that door in the next few minutes. That is perhaps the first and shortest answer to how does Keir Starmer do it. He works with his Chancellor of the Exchequer. Their fear to see what they have, where they can find additional funds, where they can potentially move money around. But as Keir Starmer said earlier today in his speech, he said the ambition that he has looks lofty. He sort of moved the delivery point expected to -- it was expected to do this closer to the horizon, talking about the building of schools, to building of houses and homes. But that this would take time, and the expectations have been set. They are ambitious, the Labour Party, to deliver a huge number of new homes in their first term in office. But not get the maximum number per year in the first year because it takes time to organize. So I think that's what we're going to see from the prime minister. Turn to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, see what they've got, and then plan. This is a prime minister we're told is not flashy. You know, some people sort of call him no drama Starmer. He's not flashy. He sets a path and he works at it carefully. But the key question will be, does the chancellor find where they can get the money to deliver on these ambitions? And maybe we'll get a hint to that in a few minutes.",

This was the party that was once the party that pushed for Brexit and it's significant that Nigel Farage, its leader, who's tried eight times but now succeeded to get a seat in parliament, will have a voice in the chamber and he is a loud voice who make sure that his points get heard. So I think in that way, the conservatives are going to find themselves heckled from the right-wing, those who are demanding more change or higher standards, if you will, and turn reducing immigration. That has been a significant part of their platform. Obviously, the Conservatives not in power. And the other place where they're going to find the party that will be pulled apart. You know, people that they might have turned to for leadership like Penny Mordaunt, the former defense secretary, who was expected to maybe put a hat in the ring to challenge the leadership. Now Rishi Sunak has said he's going to step down as leader of the party. She was seen as a sort of a moderate within the Conservatives. And of course she's not in that position now. But some of the former ministers who have survived on the right wing of the party thinking Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, you know, is likely to challenge for leadership of the party. So you can see there's a real potential for the party to be pulled to the right. The difference now, of course, is for the Conservatives that they're not in government, they're not pulling the party apart center versus right while they were in government, and having those impacts on the country and the economy that they've had. They'll now be doing it from opposition, safer if you will for the country. But nevertheless, it's going to be a massive challenge, an attack certainly on their right flank as well from the Reform Party.",

We'll, of course, keep a close watch on all the latest developments. Thanks so much. An aggressive travel schedule with unscripted events. That's part of the strategy the White House is putting forward to try and shift the narrative away from President Joe Biden's poor debate performance last week. Now the campaign is planning to send the president and vice president and their spouses to every battleground state this month. And tonight Mr. Biden hopes to blunt calls for him to exit the presidential race by sitting down for what will be a closely watched interview with ABC News. CNN senior reporter Isaac Dovere joins us now to give us an update. Good to see you. Look, this interview happening tonight will be absolutely critical. But I want to talk about the strategy and whether it's risky given the strain it'll put on the president. Is there any way they can salvage the campaign? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: There is certainly a way and I think that one of the things that is true at this moment is that there are both more people who are going public, who want Biden to leave the race, and more people were going public that would like Biden to stay and would like to move forward with him as the candidate. A lot of eyes on that interview today, seeing how he does. He will also be out on the campaign trail in Wisconsin today, and he will be trying to show that he is vibrant and up to the job of campaigning. That's going to continue into the days ahead and he is leaving a lot of people with big question marks that he is hoping to answer with what he does, and what he says in these crucial days.",

It is as I report reaching the point where a lot of Democrats, a lot of leading Democrats, officials, operatives, and others are saying they're not waiting for Biden anymore. They've already even gotten to the point where they're starting to think of who Kamala Harris' running mate would be. And that's what this is at this point for many leading Democrats.

      "sentences": "You're absolutely right that Masoud Pezeshkian, the moderate candidate, he didcome in first place in the first round of elections where there were still six candidates. Over a million votes ahead of Saeed Jalili, the conservative who came in second place and who says that he wants his politics to be like those of the president who was killed on May 19th, Ebrahim Raisi, when of course Raisi and the Foreign Minister Hossein Amir- Abdollahian died in a chopper crash. However, one of the things that we do have to mention, Eleni, is that while Mr. Pezeshkian came in first in the first round of voting, there were more people in that round who voted conservative than those who voted moderate. So Jalili got a lot of votes, but there was also a third place candidate named Mohammad Ghalibaf who has now called on his supporters to vote for Saeed Jalili. So certainly Jalili has a chance of winning this round in the election. A lot of it once again will depend on voter turnout. Usually the moderates believe that the more people come to the ballot box is the better their chances are of pulling off a victory. Going to wait and see how that evolves. Voting set to carry on for a little over an hour, but we do expect that to get extended. As far as what all of this could mean, the president of course in Iran does have very broad powers to shape policies, to shape foreign policies. But all of that of course happens within the framework of the Islamic Republic and its power structure. In the end, anything that happens in the Islamic Republic needs to get signed off and OKed by the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. And then of course the whole military complex as far as the defense and the foreign policy is concerned also has a pretty large say. Of course, first and foremost, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. So all that are factors, nevertheless, there are things that the president does influence and policies that the president can set. We saw that during the course of Hassan Rouhani's term when he mentioned negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement. That was later or out of which President Trump of the United States later pulled the U.S. out of. So it's going to certainly be an election that a lot of people in Iran believe could be very important. And I think the interesting thing that we're going to be looking at is to what extent that is going to translate into voter turnout. You mentioned it in the first round. The voter turnout was not very high. However, now that you will directly have a moderate running against the conservative, the turnout could be a lot higher -- Eleni.",

I think the people of Iran are actually voting for the reformers, saying no to the radical views, to the conservative views that have been running the country for the past three years. Of course, the supreme leader has expressed that he wants the Raisi's path, the late president Ebrahim Raisi's path to be continued but the people of Iran I think have never been more united to discontinue this path and actually vote for change that would ease restrictions like restrictions on internet or crackdowns on hijab, and stuff that actually matters to them.",

And the week after he's hosting here in Britain a big European summit with all the leaders of Europe. That will be his sort of first step onto the European stage.

Ever since Brexit, it's like when you eat a big meal. All the blood goes to the stomach and you find yourself just focusing internally. We're going to have to look out again now, we have to get engaged again, make ourselves relevant. And he's got a chance to do this but it's going to be very difficult without sources. For example, if he needs to spend 2.5 percent of GDP on defense, remember we spend 2 percent, that's going to require finding the money from somewhere. So it will be difficult for him. In terms of Gaza, it's politically very difficult. He's lost a number of seats in the election because of the stances taken on Gaza. Independent candidates running on the Gaza issue are one seat away from Labour. So it'd be very difficult issue for him.

Now, I suspectthat Prime Minister Keir Starmer would have extremely good relationship with Joe Biden when he meets him next week. But he'll have to also be prepared for the possibility that Americans vote for Trump in November. Interestingly, his foreign minister David Lammy, shadow foreign secretary, has already been to Washington, meeting people close to Trump like J.D. Vance, et cetera. So they are trying to reach out to Trump in case they need to work with Trump as opposed to Biden. So I imagined that they will -- because the Trans-Atlantic relationship is so important to Britain, they will try and make sure that even if it's Trump, they have good relations. But like all European, they're nervous. And I want to reassure themselves by having closer relations in Europe, too. Cooperation on defense and security there, which is something anyway that Trump would want.",

A firewall, so to speak, to stop you becoming the majority in parliament. What does it feel like to be considered so dangerous? How does it feel? MARINE LE PEN, NATIONAL RALLY LEADER (through translator): We don't represent any danger apart from making him lose power. In reality, all the energy that he puts into fighting us it's simply because he knows that we are the alternative movement. We are the ones who can secure an absolute majority. The far-left does not have that option so the danger of which he's talking is a threat to his own power but what's paradoxical is that he called for a dissolution by saying that the people should have their say again, but by strategizing between the two rounds, by withdrawing his candidates, asking people to vote for the far-left, he's actually refusing to let French people express themselves freely. It's rather paradoxical.",

He just said you don't represent the kind of country that he would want to play for? LE PEN (through translator): Yes. And we know exactly why he did it and what the purpose of his statement was. But then again, these are people who are lucky enough to be living comfortably, very comfortably to be protected from insecurity. Poverty, unemployment and everything else that affects and hurts our compatriots. I think that at a time when the population is preparing to vote they should show a bit of restraints. Let me give you an example. A left-wing mayor came to see me and said, I've never voted for the National Rally but I can't stand hearing anymore lectures from people who know nothing about how the French are suffering.

A few minutes ago, Rachel Reeves, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, came out, literally stood on the doorstep there for some photographs and a little bit of video to be taken. And I said, Chancellor, does it feel good to be called chancellor, and she said it does. So clearly for these ministers able to get a moment to enjoy the fact after all this hard work, they've finally arrived and with it, the responsibility of delivering in government, a government that Keir Starmer has laid out what he wants to achieve. One that's going to deliver a better economy, that's going to deliver a better health service, better on crime and justice, more jobs in the green sector. A lot of different things he expects to deliver on. But the names of the people who is picking in the Cabinet, of people who have had those portfolios in opposition like John Healey, defense for a long time, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. People, names who are familiar for the people of the U.K. who will have seen them on TV multiple times in the campaign, who will have heard their comments over the years, experienced politicians. It is an experienced Cabinet that the prime minister is pulling together. Of course, experience in opposition for most of them. Ed Miliband was in there as well going in. We saw going in David Lammy, the former shadow foreign secretary. He now the actual foreign secretary. So these people all stepping into portfolios that they should be very familiar with. Now, of course rather than faulting the government on what the government is doing wrong, they are the government. And it would be them making the policy and acting on it.",

That is essentially a cognitive test, which is, you know, frankly what a lot of other presidents and candidates have said in the past as well. But that was not included. What they did sort of put as part of that was about a six-page assessment based on interaction with 20 different medical specialists including a neurologist and they ruled out things primarily, Eleni. They said, look, there's no evidence of stroke. There's no evidence of multiple sclerosis. Theres no evidence of Parkinson's disease, for example. What is important, though, is that take Parkinson's disease, for example. That is the most common cause of Parkinsonism but there are other things that could cause Parkinsonism as well. There was no mention made that those things were investigated or ruled out. And that's why you need more detailed cognitive testing and more detailed movement disorder testing to really figure out what's going on there. And I think, again, most importantly, because it might benefit the person now, if any of those test results come back positive. You could do something about it.",
