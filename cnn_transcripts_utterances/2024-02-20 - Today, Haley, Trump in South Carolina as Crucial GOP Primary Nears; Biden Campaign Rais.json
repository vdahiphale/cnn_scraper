And there is a reason for that.I actually want to pull up those poll numbers just so we can actually see what we're talking about here. This is the most recent CBS News poll that shows Trump receiving 65 percent from likely GOP voters. That is compared to 30 percent for Nikki Haley. That is setting up for quite the shellacking if those poll numbers hold for Nikki Haley in her home state. Now, when it comes to Donald Trump's actual campaign strategy, it's been much less extensive than what we saw in New Hampshire or Iowa. One, it's been largely trying to create scenarios that embarrass Nikki Haley, bringing in South Carolina lawmakers to speak out against Nikki Haley, people who she worked with in the past. But aside from that, it's been relatively low key. Trump himself has only visited the state once since New Hampshire. He does have events tonight as well as Friday and Saturday leading up to the primary. You've also seen no expensive ad buys in the state. Now, I am told that they have extensive ground game there, grassroots movement, people going and knocking on doors, sending out mailers, but, again, much less extensive than the kind of ramped up situation we saw in Iowa and New Hampshire. And part of this is why you're seeing Donald Trump so visibly annoyed and angry at Nikki Haley for staying in the race. But, Sara, it's a Democratic process. She can stay in as long as she can stay in.",

That's what we're hoping for. I look at back in the late 70s, when I was a kid, the country was in a malaise, and even our president admitted that. And then along came someone who everyone thought was going to start World War Three and ended up cutting a lot of deals with Tip O'Neill, that being Ronald Reagan. We will have another great leader come by like a Nikki Haley that will change the dynamic. And that's what I'm hoping for. And that's what she's hoping for.

      "sentences": "Sara, I think this is how we're going to spend much of 2024 watching and waiting for the Supreme Court to make decisions that could have an enormous impact on the election in November.Let's start with the first of these two cases we're watching for this question of immunity. Today we already saw some orders from the Supreme Court. Now, they can act on immunity anytime they want. We know the former president has asked the justices to intervene here, to pause a lower court decision that said that he does not have presidential immunity that would protect him from the federal election subversion case brought by Jack Smith. Now, Sara, if you talk to sources in and around his legal team, legal experts, most of them agree that Trump is unlikely to win on the merits of that issue, even if the Supreme Court took it up. But much of their strategy is actually just focused on delay, trying to push this entire case back far enough in the year or so that the former president does not go to trial before the November election, because if he's re-elected, he can make that case go away. Now, we're also in this really interesting moment where they are juggling two massive political questions. The other one is, of course, ballot eligibility. About two weeks ago, they held oral arguments on that case out of Colorado. The question is whether states can ban former President Trump from appearing on the ballot. And during that oral argument things, did appear to be going quite well for Trump and it looked like there were perhaps enough justices to rule in his favor, but a lot of questions about exactly what that ruling would look like. So, it would be a little soon now to get a decision on that case. We're less than two weeks out from those oral arguments. There is a lot of hope out there that they will get us a decision before Super Tuesday on March 5th. But, Sara, I think it's going to take as long as Chief Justice John Roberts need to build a coalition behind the scenes, try to build something that has bipartisan support. Because, remember, the Supreme Court, while they're juggling all these hot button political issues, they are under an enormous amount of scrutiny, questions about ethics and of course, a lot of concerns about partisanship. So, I'll be here watching and waiting and bring you any news if we get it.",

All right, great to see you, Elie. So, the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in potentially on two Trump campaign-related cases. Let's look at the 14th Amendment Colorado case, in which the state Supreme Court ruled to take action against keeping Trump's name off the ballot. So, the justices heard the arguments. Now, what are they considering?",

As Paula said, we don't know when that's going to come.It's important to understand, though, when we see this ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court is not going to make some grand pronouncement on whether Donald Trump did or did not engage in insurrection. That was very clear in the oral argument. There was only one question about that in the entire time. Instead, what they're looking at really is a procedural question here, which boils down to this. Do the individual states have the right and the power to imply and enforce the 14th Amendment on their own? And there seemed to be an awful lot of skepticism around that from justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum. So, I think it's clear, I agree with Paula. I think it's clear that Donald Trump will win this argument. Colorado will lose. The big question now is, really, will it be nine nothing or will we see more of an ideological split or something in the middle?",

They want to consider whether or not the 14th amendment applies in their cases and the clock is moving very fast given the primary election season, isn't it? Yes, so Colorado itself votes on March 5th, which is Super Tuesday. I would assume the Supreme Court understands that the voters in Colorado and elsewhere need to know before they cast their ballots whether the person they may be voting for is or is not disqualified.And, Fred, it's also important to keep in mind the broader national context here. Colorado is one of several dozen challenges that have been made to Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment. No others have succeeded. The Maine secretary of state has ruled that Trump should be barred from the ballot in that state, but that hasn't even gone into the courts yet. But there are various other states, Illinois, Maine, California, that have said, we're going to wait and see what the Supreme Court does. So, in all likelihood, their ruling on Colorado probably will set the tone and set the precedent for the entire country.",

That's the best outcome for Jack Smith.The best outcome for Donald Trump is the Supreme Court says, we are taking this case, we're keeping the pause on in the trial court and we're going to schedule this on the normal schedule of briefing, which would take several months and quite possibly push it out until after the election. There's also a middle ground, potentially, where the Supreme Court says, we are going to take this case but we're going to expedite. We're going to speed up the briefing here, which would still allow some chance for the case to be tried before the election.",

That's when he thought that would be the speedier route to trial. And I think it's important to understand any criminal defendant has a right to stand up for his rights, to bring motions. I think any criminal defense lawyer will tell you they would bring this motion.
