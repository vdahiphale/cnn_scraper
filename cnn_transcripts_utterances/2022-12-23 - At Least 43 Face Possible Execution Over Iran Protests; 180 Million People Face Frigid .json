We'll have the details just ahead. Plus, the January 6th Committee releases its final report on the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, laying out the case against former president Donald Trump. And since China lifted its strict COVID policies, cases are surging. So just how bad are things getting? We have a special report. Hello, I'm Linda Kinkade, at the CNN Center. Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Good to have you with us. Well, dozens of people in Iran could be facing execution over the recent wave of protests. CNN has learned that authorities are charging at least 43 people with crimes punishable by death. The actual number could be much higher. Among them is this high-profile football player. A witness telling CNN that an execution platform has been installed in a town square in his home city. Responding to our investigation, the U.S. State Department denounced the charges. At least two people have already been executed over the demonstrations, which began after a young woman died in custody. For the families of those charged, it is an excruciating time. Parents are begging officials to spare their children's lives. CNN's Nima Elbagir spoke with some of those families as part of this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): My son has been sentenced execution. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Mohammed (INAUDIBLE) is only 22. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): My son is innocent. For the love of God, help him. NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Desperate families in Iran, risking it all with pleas to the world to save their loved ones from execution. Fearing that detainees in Iran are set to face a wave of executions, in an accelerated judicial process, while holiday celebrations have the world's attention elsewhere. (On camera): In collaboration with Iranian activists from 1500Tasvir, we worked to verify court documents which show that dozens of Iranians including high-profile Iranian athlete face execution. We also work to verify video pleas like this one. From this 81-year-old mother of one of the detainees. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We don't know his whereabouts. No information about him nor do we even know where he is. ELBAGIR (voice-over): This document from inside the Isfahan regional court shows that at least 10 people have been charged with Moharabe, war against God, spreading corruption on earth, and other charges, all which carry the possibility of the death penalty. (On camera): Through obtaining and verifying court documents and witness testimony, we have evidence which supports a rushed through judicial process. Defendants having court appointed counsel forced upon. Many defendants having their right to appeal refused. Some defendants faced with charges which could carry the death sentence, being handed down in a single setting. Terrified Iranian families believe that while the world is busy celebrating the holiday season, busy with their families, that they in Iran face imminent execution of their loved ones. (Voice-over): CNN has confirmed that Iranian footballer Amir Nasr-Azadani is among those facing execution. Here is training ahead of match day, now he's on death row waiting. This is social media video from the night of his arrest. CNN made contact with someone close to Nasr-Azadani inside Iran. We are not disclosing their identity. They told us that in the days after his arrest, they were unable to get word from him or about him from authorities. Even as the Iranian authorities denied his arrest. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It was one month and 19 days. I think maybe even perhaps longer since the security forces came and wanted to see Amir's home.",

Now sources close to Amir Nasr-Azadani say he and four others have had their charges upgraded by the Isfahan court to Baghi, a charge punishable only by execution. There's more. In the regional courts of Khuzestan, west of Isfahan, CNN has confirmed with 150Tasvir through court documents that 23 more people have been charged with the same crime, punishable by death. We are redacting their names out of fears for their safety. There is still more. In Karaj, CNN and 1500Tasvir have confirmed that at least five more Iranians are facing execution, including 21-year-old Iranian Kurdish karate champion, Mohammad Mehdi Karami whose parents have also gone public with their plea.

(Voice-over): Just this week 27-year-old Iranian Kurdish rapper Saman Yasin attempted suicide whilst in detention, according to a source from the prison. Yasin tried to end his life, sources say, with pills after injuring extreme psychological torture in the harsh prison conditions in northern Iran.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This bad weather is really coming at a bad time for travelers who are trying to make this exodus on what was supposed to be one of the busiest pre-Christmas travel days. FlightAware says the number of cancellations in the U.S. has already dwarfed the number we saw yesterday, 2600 in the U.S. according to FlightAware. That's going to have a nationwide and a worldwide ripple effect because this storm is really hitting some major hubs for the airlines. And now as it's moving east, there will be more and more cancellations at places that were not affected on Thursday. LaGuardia tops the list as well as Detroit, which is a major hub for Delta Airlines. More than 40 percent of flights have been canceled there. Here at Chicago O'Hare, it's the biggest hub for United Airlines. United Airlines tells me that the big issue is not necessarily the snow, but really the biting cold. On Friday, the forecast high temperature here is one degree Fahrenheit. That's not taking into account the wind chill that makes it especially hard, United says, for ground crews to work, to marshal the plane, to load bags, to move the gate. It's going to be really tough for them. I want you to listen now to Joe Heins, United's VP of Network Operations, who says that will really drive delays. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE HEINS.

In fact, this could end up going down as one of the coldest Christmas Eves on record here in Atlanta. Take a look at this, this is a towel, frozen solid because of how cold it was and how it quickly froze overnight. The big concern there is that the same thing, the same freezing effect is also taking place on some of the roadways, not just here in Georgia, but across the country. Take a look at this map, just going to show you how widespread this incredibly cold air is. You have roughly 60 percent of the U.S. population under some type of wind chill alert. Again, just going to show you how many people there. But it's also the wind, wind gusts, 40 to 60 miles per hour, in some places even higher. And the concern there is not only does that make it cold, but it takes any of the snow that's on the ground and will blow it across roadways and things, making visibility even lower, perhaps down to about just less than a quarter of a mile. That creates even more dangerous conditions on the roadways. Then you also have the snow. The bulk of the snow for today will be limited across most of the northeast, but even a few portions of the Midwest, right there along the Great Lakes could also see some additional snow. Most areas, we're not talking tremendous amounts, but again even any additional snow on top of what we already have is going to make those travel conditions very difficult, Linda.

Of course, we've heard from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken just yesterday as well saying that Russia has not presented itself as being open to diplomacy in the sense of working towards a resolution to this conflict. But we also heard a message from President Putin yesterday with regards to transfer of that Patriot air defense missile system from the United States to Ukraine. And he said this was an old system, but he also said that while Ukraine may see this as a key source of defense now, Russia will find the antidote.

It's saying the central cause of January 6th was one man, who many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would've happened without him. Now in support of this conclusion, they lay out all of the evidence that they collected over the past year and a half that led them to come to this choice. Now the committee starts even before the election happened. They start before the election, they start to build their case arguing that this was not a spontaneous decision by the president. That this was a premeditated act. They show e-mails from a conservative group urging the president to in fact declare victory even if he lost. You know, it's so interesting to see how they lay out their case using phone records, e-mails, witness interviews, to really support how this played out from the time before the election to January 6th. And they support this idea that the former president continued to push these baseless claims, rallying his supporters, many of whom wound up at the Capitol on January 6th where this violence ensued. Now a key tenet to the former president's defense is arguing that he was just relying on the advice of his lawyers. But you see the committee taking direct aim at that. In fact, in this report, there are new details about conversations that he had with his attorney, John Eastman. Eastman is a conservative attorney, the one who drafted that memo laying out the theory that Trump really clung to for how his vice president could potentially try to block the counting of electoral votes. What's so interesting in this new report is they reveal that on December 23rd, the day that memo was written, Eastman reached out to the White House, asked a Trump aide that he wanted to talk to the president about, quote, \"our strategy.\" And this new evidence revealed that he spoke to someone at the White House through the switchboard for 23 minutes. So it's really interesting how they laid out their case here, and again, they made a deliberate choice to really focus on the role and the responsibility of former President Trump.",

(on camera): He says it was a strong blow to be sent back to Mexico, but that he doesn't want to give up and that he wants to do whatever is necessary to give his wife and children a better life. As Title 42 remains in legal limbo at the U.S. Supreme Court, many families like Jason, Zulema and their two children will face a similar fate. So the question becomes, what will they all do when they have a greater sense of desperation of reaching the United States? Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a chatbot that can provide thoughtful andhumanlike, if sometimes inaccurate responses to questions. It already has more than a million users after debuting just a few weeks ago. Tom Foreman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Allowing cars to drive themselves, composing songs that mimic popular artists, and producing this digital painting that took the top award at a Colorado art show. This is all the work of artificial intelligence, computers that don't just do what they're told, but in a sense think, learn, and create. And right now, ChatGPT is rattling the A.I. world, turning out stunningly humanoid writing. Just ask Douglas Rushkoff, a renowned author and professor of media culture.",

Imagine the biggest library you can, thenprogrammed and trained by humans to process and spit it out in conversational phrases. So as for 1,000 words on the early days of automobiles and in seconds, it responds. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, automobiles were relatively primitive by today's standards and were primarily used by wealthy individuals or businesses. Ask it to write a sonnet in the style of Jerry Seinfeld. I'm just standup comic telling jokes on stage, I make them laugh, and that's all I do. But sometimes, life is a joke. It hits me low and then I take the mic and say, who knew? It's not perfect, but it can debate, compose essays, solve math problems. (On camera): Well, that looks right. (voice-over): Write computer code, answer follow-up questions, even admit mistakes. And all that means, ChatGPT or more advanced AI like it, could replace people in all sorts of positions.",
