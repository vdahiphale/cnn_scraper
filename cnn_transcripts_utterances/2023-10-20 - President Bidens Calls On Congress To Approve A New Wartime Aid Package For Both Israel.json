U.S. President Joe Biden is set to meet with European leaders at the White House any moment now. We will bring you that live when it happens. It's all in an attempt to present a united front against the Israel Hamas war and the war in Ukraine. It's a message he's also delivered to the American public in a rare address last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common. They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy. American alliance is what keeps us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk, if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it's just not worth it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.N. tried to pass a resolution in the Security Council. The U.S. vetoed it. And so, there is desperation within the U.N. to try to get that back on the books and see if they can try again to pass it through. But there's also an acknowledgment that they have to just keep trying, keep doing whatever they can with the full knowledge that it's not going to be easy.

Well, back here in the U.S., all eyes are on the Capitol, Capitol Hill specifically, where the U.S. House of Representatives remains in serious limbo.

Arlette, you know, the President laid out his case in another impassioned speech. It's his third that he's delivered specifically related to Israel, but this time he expanded it to include aid to Ukraine. Without a speaker, where do things stand?

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden is hoping that Congress can eventually push through with that aid for Israeland Ukraine. But at the moment, things really remain at a standstill with the House really paralyzed, unable to act without a speaker of the House. But President Biden last night made that sales pitch not just to lawmakers, but also to the American people. He used the backdrop of that Oval Office, a very rare Oval Office address to make the case for what's at stake in both the wars in Israel and Ukraine. The President directly linking those two very different conflicts, saying that it's a matter of national security interest to the United States, but also the need to preserve democracy at large. And that speech came on the heels of the President today, requesting that official national security package from lawmakers up on Capitol Hill. The total for that request is about $105 billion, and it includes over $61 billion for Ukraine and about $14 billion for Israel. There's also funding for humanitarian assistance. The border security at the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as Indo-Pacific countries like Taiwan. But while the White House believes that they have bipartisan support to get this across the finish line, the reality is that it's much more complicated dynamics up on Capitol Hill. First, you have an American public who's skeptical of providing more aid to Ukraine. You've seen the majority of Americans, at this point, don't think Congress should authorize more aid. There is some belief within the hardline conservative wing of the Republican Party that also doesn't want to see that aid go into Ukraine. And then there's the issue of Israel, where Americans are still unsure about what U.S. involvement and assistance should look like. We've seen some Republicans express frustration with the White House trying to tie Ukraine and Israel together. But that issue of the speaker and the lack of a speaker in the House of Representatives really proposes the immediate complicating factor to this. There is no end in sight, as you saw with that latest vote where Jim Jordan was unable to secure the necessary votes to become House Speaker. So, that package that the President is requesting is really in jeopardy. It's unknown when exactly something could get passed through Congress, which could complicate the ways that the U.S. is able to support both Ukraine and Israel going forward.",

Some protestors in Cairo called for more attacks against Israel crying out where is the Arab army? The protests broke out following the rocket attack on a Gaza hospital earlier this week which Israel blames on a misfire by Palestinian militants. America is supporting Israel's finding. Well, several global leaders will be converging in Cairo on Saturday for Egypt's international peace summit. Their mission couldn't be more serious. They want to find a way to protect civilians in Gaza and de-escalate the conflict between Isarael and Hamas. Missing from the summit are leaders from the U.S. and Israel. For his party, Egyptian President Fattah El-Sisi is declaring that Israel has exceeded the limit of self-defense. My next guest writes that Cairo is, quote, \"a prime player in the effort to address the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza\". And we're joined now by Daniel Kurtzer who was the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001 and Ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005. He is now Professor at Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. Can you lay out some of the challenges and pressures that Sisi faces right now in terms -- specifically, let's start with the just at Rafah crossing enabled to gate aid cross that crossing and any Palestinians who at this point -- he is weary about allowing into Egypt. DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL AND EGYPT:  Sure, look. The summit is I think driven by at least three factors. One of them is the domestic upheaval throughout the Arab world and in Egypt itself. Leaders want to show that they are on top of the situation in trying to resolve it. I think, second of all, there is an immediate concern about spill over. How much will this conflict escalate and perhaps engage other Arab countries willy nilly. And third, as you noted, Egypt's particular role in overseeing the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, and that's a problem for Egypt. It's not a problem for humanitarian aid going in, but Egypt does not want the Palestinians coming into Egypt for fear that they might be a permanent presence. Palestinians don't want that either. And therefore, there's a lot of delicate diplomacy going on about how you get the aid in but keep the border closed for Palestinians wanting to exit.",

Behind the scenes, there are few Arab leaders who have anything but contempt for Hamas. And most of them in their heart of hearts would want to see Hamas dealt a very serious blow, including, as you noted, the Egyptians, who have their own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood and the more radical extremists. They have an insurgency that's been underway in the Sinai Peninsula for more than 10 years. But today, apparently, they believe this is not a time when they can talk about that in public.

The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza said the death toll was 471. Preliminary U.S. intelligence, however, suggested it's between 100 and 300. Both sides blamed each other, with the Gaza authorities blaming an Israeli airstrike in Israel and the United States claiming the explosion was caused by a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket. CNN cannot independently verify the cause. On Wednesday in Tel Aviv, President Biden echoed the Israeli explanation. The bombardment of Gaza sparked protests across the Middle East, heightening fears the war could spiral into a larger regional conflict. Palestinian officials say more than 4000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the families of those abducted by Hamas fighters, terrorists, are still waiting for answers.

Very, very few missiles coming out of Gaza, very, very few artillery shells, and if any missile strikes going into Gaza, it feels like we're at the moment where there could be any number of possibilities about what could happen now. There could be some kind of breakthrough, potentially for some of the hostages, that some of the 219 U.N. food and humanitarian aid trucks that are at the border with Egypt could be allowed in, that there could be a compromise, that Israel may listen to its friends and allies that are saying, yes, you have every right to strike back, but think about the long- term, think about how you're going to deal with Palestinians going forward and deal with the bigger issues. You have a right to strike back but think about the next day and the day after that. It feels like a moment where all these things are possibilities, yet I think we stand at the moment where there are the probability of what's going to happen. It comes down to a couple of things. Maybe an aid truck or 20, as is hoped, may get into Gaza. I think the incursion looks incredibly likely to happen. But these events haven't happened yet, so that leaves open the possibilities. But the reality of where we stand, despite this being a relatively quiet day, which speaks to the possibility of some behind-the- scenes diplomacy and discussions, positions are really entrenched, and there's a real desire and hunger to take the fight to Hamas and stop them bringing any fight back to Israeli citizens again.

International support should be for peace. International support should not be for aggression. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (on-camera):  And look, he was absolutely clear that Hamas, the militant wing of Hamas, is absolutely not representative of the Palestinian people. The problem for the Palestinian Authority, of which he is Prime Minister, which runs the occupied West Bank, it runs that under a sort of loose security arrangement with Israel. And he's absolutely determined that Israel is not playing anything like an honest broker in trying to find a solution for the plight of the Palestinians. And really, you know, was very insistent in this interview that if this isn't treated as an inflection point, what is going on now in Gaza and the settler violence and the Israeli security violence that is being waged against Palestinians in the West Bank isn't brought under control, than we are facing, you know, real problems, not just but around this region. He hopes the President Mahmoud Abbas is at the Cairo summit tomorrow with regional leaders plus a number of countries from the West. And he hopes that what will come out of that is a unified voice about this being a point at which the Palestinian issue is back in focus for all of the most awful reasons, this obviously on the back of October the 7th, but that there has to be a solution out of all of this, otherwise, you know, this cycle of violence will just continue.
