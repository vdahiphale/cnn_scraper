The idea that they put magnetometers there, the idea that they would go to any Republican member, that they had been co- sponsors of bills, and they no longer could be a co-sponsor. That they would fine members $5,000.00 if the magnetometers went on, but when Nancy went around it, or Clyburn that was supposed to be fined, it all got waived. The idea that bills didn't have to go through committee, the ideas that created a select committee on January 6, and they wouldn't let the minority appoint who to do it. Look, I'm trying to change all of that, and bring the body back so they can work together. But I think they did a lot of damage to us yesterday. Yes, sir?",

I do believe at the end of the day, we could find common ground and do something about the border. I don't know if this has caused problems. I was doing squawk today and had the other TV on MSNBC. The first time I saw MSNBC running a whole story about the border with people just walking across. You know, Pritzker sent a letter yesterday about the immigration. Massachusetts governor, state of emergency. Connecticut -- everybody -- it is becoming the number one -- they cannot ignore it. And I had told my members all before, I heard Gaetz say on the floor that, oh my God, Kevin asked for a stopgap measure, we came back. The whole plan was because those eight and a few more had held up passing any of these approp bills all summer, I was going to do just what we did Saturday, a stopgap measure with disaster. I had gone out to Hawaii, we look what happened in Florida. Those people shouldn't be held back, and we could finish doing it all individually, but somehow they think that's a dirty word. Yes?",

Questions too about Tom Emmer, who's the Republican Whip, although Emmer suggested that he potentially could get behind Steve Scalise, and another name, too, Kevin Hearn, who is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, which is the largest conservative group in the House has indicated privately that he's open to running for speaker. So, Anderson, this decision by McCarthy in this historic day opens up a chaotic series of days as the Republicans try to figure out their way forward, try to figure out a new speaker of the House, and that has huge implications for the agenda, trying to avoid a government shutdown in a month, and also their efforts to take back that House as the speaker of course, is a key driver of their message, their strategy, their tactics, their fundraising.

He -- I'm sure they would have wanted it in writing based on their feelings about his trustworthiness, but he could have made some sort of deal. They would have wanted some sort of power sharing. Obviously, it would have been negotiated, but the idea of that was such poison to him that he would rather lose his job -- we still don't even know if he's going to stay in Congress -- he would rather go out than even remotely try to work in a bipartisan way. Remember, the job is speaker of the House, not speaker of the majority. But that's where we are, like -- and the next speaker, I'm sure, is going to try to do the same thing. Try to run this caucus, this conference, even with these unruly six to eight that are make it all but ungovernable because the idea of even remotely getting into bed with the Democrats is so horrifying, that it's -- they just can't even entertain the notion. AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: I think one interesting thing is every few years in Washington, I feel like we sort of say farewell to a certain kind of Republican. And with Kevin McCarthy, it's the young gun. Those people who came in in 2010, your Paul Ryans and your Eric Cantors. And if you're too young to remember those names, then that's part of the problem because they didn't make it, right? They didn't become the next generation of leaders, they became the next generation of ousted leaders. And Kevin McCarthy is the final one of that group to effectively get up and say, I didn't get the job done. Now, as that speech gets longer, and he tries to massage what his political legacy in write up will be, we heard a lot of other ramblings. We heard about his mom, the Treaty of Versailles, I think Nazis came up, it was a lot. But I think it's that desperation to try and hold onto a narrative that isn't a narrative of failure.

They think it's tragic and they look at the failures that MAGA GOP has put upon us, and they see this bucket of crabs that keeps trying to pull the rest of the country down into the chaos that they crave. And they see that although Republicans are the majority party in the House, they're working as an opposition party. They're opposed within themselves and then they're opposed to just getting things. And so when I think of, you know, what do we have to do next as Democrats, we have to keep showing competence, keep showing community, and contrast it with chaos on their side.
