Three American soldiers were killed, more than 30 other service members injured in a drone attack in Jordan at an outpost known as Tower 22.That small military base is located near the border with Syria. The attack marking the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr. Biden is blaming Iran backed militant groups for the attack, while in Iran, state media reports Iran's permanent mission to the U.N. denies the country had any involvement. The U.S. president vowing to hold those responsible to account. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We had a tough day and last night in the Middle East.

Always good to see you, sir.Now, the U.S. has, I think, by and large responded in a fairly measured way to these sorts of attacks militarily. But now troops are dead and wounded. How does that attack change the calculus for the U.S. in terms of its options? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, it certainly crossed the president's red line. What he said would cause some additional retaliation. So I think what's going to happen, Michael, is we will see additional strikes, probably a lot more kinetic activity on some major bases that belong to the popular mobilization forces that are the puppets of the Iranian government. Don't know how difficult that's going to because, as you know, in this kind of environment, you can go after some forces, but it's difficult to hit all of those that are trying to harm the United States citizens, soldiers in the area. So, there will be some more kinetic activity. And I would guess there might be some covert action, too, against not just the PMS and the al Quds Force, but also possibly even some elements within Iran itself because they know, they have intelligence that Iran is behind this or so that's what the NSC has stated.",

Years of popular mobilization forces, the proxies of the Iranian government have been conducting multiple strikes against not only the U.S., but also the Iraqi government. They have been fighting hard not just against ISIS in Syria, but also against the, of the United States and anyone else that's trying to tamp down ISIS. So this is an opportunity for Iran to use their proxy forces. And by the way, let me state for the record, Iran could care less about any casualties that occur with the Houthis or the PMFs or Hezbollah or Hamas. They just know this is an opportunity to continue to conduct strikes against the west, against the United States because they don't want the U.S. forces in any of these Middle Eastern countries.

And when she announced this ruling this morning about 9Now, shares in Evergrande, they were trading down by as much as 20 percent before today's hearing, but trading was halted in China Evergrande and its listed subsidiaries. Now, for years, this company has been the posterchild of China's nationwide property debt crisis. It was back in 2021. It triggered this market panic when it defaulted on its offshore debt. Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer. It has more than $328 billion worth of liabilities. And in addition to that, analysts say that, oh, we also want to mention this. In September, its founder and its chairman, Xu Jiayin, was suspected of crimes. He was detained by police. Now, analysts, they say that this decision to liquidate the company is good news long term for the economy of China. But this is going to be a very, very painful process. We heard from Andrew Collier of Orient Capital Research. Let's bring up the quote for you. He said this, quote, Evergrande's liquidation is a sign that China is willing to go to extreme ends to quell the property bubble. This is good for the economy in the long term, but very difficult in the short term, unquote. We also heard from Gary Ng, analyst with Natixis, and he says this, quote, it is not an end but the beginning of the prolonged process of liquidation, which will make Evergrande's daily operations even harder. He goes on to say, investors will be concerned about whether there will be a snowball effect on other developers as the queue to liquidation is long. Now, this process will be complicated given just the sheer number of authorities, of players involved here. Earlier, there were questions about whether authorities inside China would uphold a ruling from a judge here in Hong Kong. But ahead of the decision, China Supreme Court, as well as the Department of Justice in Hong Kong signed an arrangement to enforce this judgment.

Robinson, 31 years old, is from Colombia just one of the more than 170,000 migrants who have arrived here in New York City since the spring of last year. More than 68,000 of them are still in the care of the city and space is running out. For now Robinson counts himself among the lucky ones. He says he's at a shelter in the Bronx that's safe, a hotel where there are cameras and security. But it's different here on Randall's Island. The massive facility has security, but no metal detectors. Two weeks ago, a 24 year-old man was stabbed in the neck during a fight that resulted in 18 arrests according to police. And earlier this month, a man was stabbed and killed after a fight broke out inside the tent cafeteria.
