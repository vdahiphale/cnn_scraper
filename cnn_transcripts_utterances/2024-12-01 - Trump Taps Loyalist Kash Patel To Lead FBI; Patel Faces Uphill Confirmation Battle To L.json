So that it really goes beyond any one presidential term. And really any -- beyond any one president, since it goes for more than eight years.And so, the idea is that it's supposed to be independent. We now have a president-elect who is determined to undermine that. He clearly has made no secret that he wants an FBI director that's loyal to him personally, who will carry out personal vendettas on behalf of a president which is a power that the FBI has scrupulously tried to avoid in the post-Watergate generation.

And this is -- this is -- you know, this is what happened.He was convicted of witness tampering. He served time in federal prison, and he was pardoned by Donald Trump, who now, I believe, is you know basically trolling the political and diplomatic establishment by giving this highly coveted position, this assignment to Charles Kushner. I mean, there's no other way to put it. I can imagine the kind of fun that the French press and the French leadership will have with this. This is not somebody who's going to walk into an easy situation, but that's the kind of mood, I think, that Donald Trump is in as president-elect. He's settling a lot of old scores, in this case against Chris Christie, who at the time was the U.S. attorney who prosecuted Charles Kushner. And Chris Christie, of course, was summarily expelled from Trump circles and indeed ended up running against him and working against him politically.

We want to warn you that the video you're about to see is disturbing.The Hamas propaganda video here shows Edan Alexander pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President-elect Donald Trump to not forget him and to do everything they can to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. CNN's Nada Bashir has been following this story closely. Nada, tell us more about this video and how it has been received. NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this has certainly sparked concern, of course, and much fear, of course for Edan Alexander's family. We've been hearing from the White House who have said that officials in the U.S. have been in touch with Edan Alexander's family, that the U.S. will continue to push for an immediate release of the hostages still held captive in Gaza. But as you mentioned, we've heard from Edan Alexander's mother as well who spoke at hostage square in Tel Aviv in front of thousands, saying that she was shaken by the video. But also said that she had been assured by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the conditions right now are ripe for a hostage release and ceasefire deal. And, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure both at home in Israel and more broadly across the globe to push and secure a cease fire agreement that would not only secure the release of hostages but, of course, for many secure an end to the war in Gaza as well. So mounting pressure there. And, of course, the fear right now for many is that we've seen over 400 days of war now in Gaza. This video, of course, has struck the family members of Edan Alexander, but also representatives and family members of other hostages still held captive in Gaza, who continue to push for a ceasefire deal. And of course, this comes as the situation in Gaza for civilians there also continues to deteriorate. We've just been hearing about the situation in northern Gaza. More than 200 killed in an Israeli airstrike on Saturday. There weather conditions, the winter months, of course, very difficult for civilians who are already facing a deteriorating humanitarian situation. But hopes for a ceasefire have been faltered. Of course, time and time again there had been some suggestion that perhaps the ceasefire struck between Hezbollah and Israel may allow for conditions to push forward with negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Whether that is the case that remains to be seen. We've heard previous conditions put forward by the Israeli government deemed nonstarters by officials in the U.S. And, of course, Netanyahu continues to face pressure from more right-wing elements of his cabinet not to secure a ceasefire.",

So, the prosecutor's case is that Daniel Penny taking Jordan Neely down initially is justified. However, he held him down too long. And during that time period, Daniel Penny should have known and actually ignored a risk that Jordan Neely would and ultimately did -- ultimately caused his death.

And hearing that from the defendant, from Daniel Penny, and specifically explaining why he held Jordan Neely down for that six-minute period of time is pretty critical to the defense.That being said, putting the defendant on the stand is always incredibly risky. So presumably, his defense attorneys weighed that risk. And also, Daniel Penny was on body cam footage. He also had a police interrogation video. So, the jury was actually able to hear from him without putting him on the stand.
