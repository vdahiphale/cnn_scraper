      "sentences": "But it does reflect how strongly he feels about it. I think it actually reflects how strongly a lot of Americans feel about -- about Donald Trump. So, I thought this was a speech where Biden, you know, really did an effective job of laying out the stakes, dialing up the urgency, making, you know, no bones about the fact that if Trump is back in office, he is going to bring to bear some of these -- he's going to incite some of these political violence again which we know people are afraid of the trend, the way that's moving in the country.The other thing I wanted to touch on actually which you were talking about, David, this all out war thing. I do think that there's all out war within the context of a campaign and there is doing hand to hand combat of campaigning every day and not allowing Trump's lies to go unchallenged, and that sort of thing. But I -- what I actually heard, I think what Biden was saying is, you know, people don't actually want the state of their politics to be a constant battle. They don't want to feel like it's my team versus your team, and we can never find common ground. And that's an argument that doesn't always get as much traction amongst, you know, folks talking about it on cable, or folks who are motivated on Twitter or X or whatever the heck we call it now, to talk about politics. But the average voter does actually want to see their elected officials work together. And so I thought it was interesting for Biden to inject that into a speech that was a largely very aggressive and vocal. But I think that was an important piece and I think that will be an important piece of how you'll hear him talk as the campaign moves forward. CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, PENNSYLVANIA:  This was a speech about Trump the barbarians are coming over the gate speech, that this would be the end of the republic if Trump is successful. That's what I got out of it. But to take, to your point, Kate, though, you know, I do think a lot of Americans are tired of the politics of this moment. They think one of these candidates, Donald Trump, is too crazy, and I think the other one is too old. They are looking for something else. I truly believe that. I talked about the No Labels movement before and they are trying to put forward a fusion ticket. People want something different. They are tired of the extremism in this.",

And it is something, I thought it was interesting how he connected those threats to election workers who are really just government employees who are trying to do their jobs. He connected that to this moment. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTORthat he was uplifting those election workers as real patriots, but also saying that he pointed to them as the very people that helped the country pass that test.

So what you've heard there puts a little bit of that perspective out there, and, you know, talking about the guns that were found that day.You heard from Republicans who tried to pretend like there was not any fire arms found, or there were no weapons and this was not an insurrection, what you are hearing from both Graves and the attorney general in those two clips is a bit of a rebuttal of what you will hear in the coming months from the political campaign -- Jake.",
