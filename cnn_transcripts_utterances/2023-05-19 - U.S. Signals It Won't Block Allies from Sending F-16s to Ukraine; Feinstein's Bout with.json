The White House has been under increasing pressure from allies and members of Congress to help Ukraine secure the planes as Russia's aerial attacks have only continued to intensify, especially this month alone. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is live at the Pentagon. Natasha, obviously, we've seen the U.S. initially say, you know, we're not going to send tanks. We're not going to send rocket launchers. We're not going to send these air defense missiles, only to later relent. And so the question is, is that what think is going to happen here?",

Of course, the U.S. has a large stockpile of those. Instead, they are telling us, officials are telling us that they will not block European allies who have these supply of F-16 fighter jets from exporting them to Ukraine themselves if that is what they want to do. And this is really significant, because the U.S. has to approve any transfer of these F-16 jets to Ukraine or to any third country at all because of sensitive U.S. technology that is in those jets. So previously, it was unclear whether the administration would approve the export of these fighter jets. Now we are hearing that they have signaled to the allies that, if that is what they want to do with their jets, then the U.S. is not going to stand in their way. And this is really significant also, because the Ukrainians, without these fighter jets, they've had to improvise. We are told that the Ukrainians have used a Patriot missile at least once to shoot down a Russian fighter jet, which is not necessarily what they're designed to do. So with these jets, the administration and officials argue it will be a lot easier for them to counter the Russian jets, potentially gain superiority in their skies. Now all of this comes as the administration is telling us that there's actually an accounting error in the military aid funding over the last couple months that they have just discovered that actually frees up an additional $3 billion they can draw down authorities. So the Ukrainians really anticipate a boom to U.S. aid so the Ukrainians could be coming quite soon.",

Her office confirmed she suffered several complications in relation to her shingles diagnosis. I want to read you what her statement told us. They said, \"The senator previously disclosed that she had several complications related to her shingles diagnosis. Those complications included Ramsey Hunt Syndrome and encephalitis. The encephalitis resolved itself shortly after released from the hospital in March. She continues to have complications from Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.\" Now, since returning to the Senate, we have seen her in a wheelchair. There's been a number of aides and other people helping her, including actually Nancy Pelosi's daughter. But, you know, she also has really taken on a lighter work schedule. She hasn't been attending caucus meetings. Really only attending votes where her vote is needed.

Now it is official next week.According to \"The New York Times,\" the Florida governor told donors on a call yesterday he sees that there are only three credible candidates in this 2024 race. I'm quoting Governor DeSantis now: \"Biden, Trump and me.\" He added, quote, \"I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president. Biden and me. Based on all the data in the swing states, which is not great for the former president and probably insurmountable, because people aren't going to change their view of him.\" Sources tell CNN that Governor DeSantis will file the presidential campaign paperwork next week. That is something he must do in order to solicit those campaign donations. His plan to defeat former President Trump: running to the right of the former president when it comes to abortion, guns, and transgender rights. Joining us now with his reporting on all this is CNN's chief national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, I noticed that, in the reporting from this call when DeSantis was speaking with donors, he didn't really talk about these Disney, these culture wars, of course, that he's been talking about when he's on the trail otherwise. [06:20:08] JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: He didn't. And that, of course, complicates his entire argument. So the reality is the message that he was making yesterday to donors privately, that he is the only one who can win on the Republican side, in fact, is a message that his advisors and his team has been making, really, for several months. They believe that his strength in some of these states where voters have already sort of given their opinion on the former president, that that's a place he can win. But the reality is everything that he has done that has strengthened him in the Republican primary presents a complication for him in a general election if he ever gets there. So, no, he did not mention Disney. But Kaitlan, of course, one person who did mention Disney was Donald Trump. He was out yesterday with a series of messages on social media. And look for the potential television ads and other things on this, as well, really going after the Florida governor for potentially losing all these jobs in the state. So we should point out, this is the very beginning of the process with -- with Ron DeSantis versus Donald Trump. So he can say that he wins. But the Republican voters will have the final say on that. And everything that has strengthened him with this Florida blueprint, as he calls it, all these laws that he has signed in Florida, certainly makes a challenge for him if he ever makes it to a general election.",
