I thought that was supposed to happen in secret. HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  It is not great. And she -- it's not as if she is breaking the law, but she could really have the judge come down on her hard. She could raise arguments that Trump will eventually raise as to tainting the jury poor bad. But the headline here, you know, let's just take a step back.
