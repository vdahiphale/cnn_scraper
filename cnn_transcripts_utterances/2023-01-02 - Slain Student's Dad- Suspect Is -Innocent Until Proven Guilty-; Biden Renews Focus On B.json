Well, the father of one of the murdered college students in Idaho is responding to the arrest of his daughter's accused killer. You will be hearing from Steve Goncalves in just moments. But the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, is expected to waive extradition at a hearing tomorrow in Pennsylvania, his home state. He was arrested there Friday. Kohberger, a graduate student in criminology attends Washington State University in Pullman, which is a 15-minute drive from Moscow, Idaho. That's where on November 13th police found the bloody bodies of 20-year-old Ethan Chapin, his girlfriend, Zanna Kernodle, 21-year-old Madison Mogen and her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves. Investigators have not given any motive for the stabbings which terrified the university town. Many students were living in fear ever since. CNN Correspondent Veronica Miracle is in Moscow, Idaho. Veronica, so Kohberger's two sisters and parents say they will attend his extradition hearing tomorrow. What more are we learning about him?",

They said it was very disruptive.They said when they did see him, he was cordial, but definitely exhibited some strange behavior. They also noted that he had a white Hyundai Elantra, but they at the time did not put two and two together that he could possibly be the suspect. I also mentioned that he's a teaching assistant and one of his students telling CNN that his behavior was off as of late. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm told that he is speaking with some of those hardliners, some of those detractors at this moment making phone calls and in negotiations. I'm told that all sides are currently talking whether they get there remains to be seen. What additional concessions McCarthy makes also a major question as they decide to move forward. But I'm told that Kevin McCarthy has no plans of dropping out. He says if he doesn't get 218 votes, he will stay in this race and it will go on to multiple ballots. Now, he has already, Bianna, made a number of concessions, including on one key issue, giving Republican members more power to seek the ouster of a sitting speaker. That is known on Capitol Hill as a \"motion to vacate.\" Now, he would allow under this package that McCarthy has proposed five members to essentially call for that vote to seek the ouster of a speaker. Right now, about half of his conference would be able to call for that vote. So that is a significant concession, but that is still not far enough for a number of members who wanted to have one individual member call for that vote and also to seek for other provisions that McCarthy has yet to agree to. And those members are signaling that they are not budging, there are five members of those hard no, the so called \"never Kevin movement.\" And that is enough to deny him the speakership. He can only afford to lose four votes in the House floor tomorrow. There are an additional nine members who have other concerns, who are still not yet sold on supporting McCarthy or willing to talk to him further. But right now, it is very clear he has a math problem and he needs to figure out how to resolve that. Otherwise, the House can see something we have not seen since 1923 when the speaker was elected after nine ballots, something that took multiple days. Can that happen again tomorrow?

He'll be constantly living under a piano hanging by a very, very weak wire. And so I think it was a weak move to have to do this. I hope he makes it, he deserves it. But it's a little bit chaotic.

But nothing's typical about what's going on right now, as we've heard we haven't seen something like this in a century.So Ron, give us a preview if he does get the speakership, he will be a much weaker speaker, especially coming on the heels of Nancy Pelosi. Talk about what legislating will look like and governing will look like under his leadership.",

The far right vanguard, conservative vanguard of the party has demonstrated that it has the leverage to drive the caucus and that it is willing to use that leverage.We just had an election where Republicans in the national exit poll lost independent voters on a national basis, something that has almost never happened for the party out of the White House, and had really disappointing results in the key statewide races in the states that are likely to pick the president in 2024: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia. And in all of those places, Republicans were hurt by an image of extremism, by an image of being still in thrall to Donald Trump and what I think the right of the caucus has signaled very clearly is that they intend to double down on those kinds of politics over the next two years. Republicans have lots of legitimate oversight targets, for example, but McCarthy is agreeing to establish a select committee on the weaponization of the federal government, right? I mean, that seems like it is aimed directly at a ton of a - almost Fox programming and that is the problem they are going to face over and over again, thus can he impose any constraints on the members of the caucus who want to lead them down a path that proved very politically perilous and 2022.",

They want to be able to say we took out someone that we consider to be part of the Washington swamp, the establishment, whatever you want to call it and erase the name of someone that I think bears conversation, and that's Donald Trump.Donald Trump supports Kevin McCarthy. He has asked these people to vote for Kevin McCarthy and yet they will not. Which begs the question, what good is Donald Trump if he can't convince the Trumpiest members of the House Republican Conference to do what he wants them to do? So ultimately, Bianna, I think they don't want anything other than to say we killed off somebody that we consider to be too far inside the Washington establishment. That's it. Beyond that, I don't think they really have any outcomes that they desire.",
