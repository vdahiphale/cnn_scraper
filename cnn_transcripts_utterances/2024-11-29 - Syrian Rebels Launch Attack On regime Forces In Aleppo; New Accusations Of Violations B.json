You are watching ONE WORLD.We begin with major developments in Syria, where a largely dormant conflict is in fact, reigniting. Armed Syrian rebels entered the country's second largest city for the first time in years, just days after launching a surprise attack. A video geolocated by CNN shows a rebel fighter recording as he drives through Aleppo. A newly formed rebel umbrella coalition launched a major attack this week. Analysts say that Syria's opposition forces appear to be exploiting a power vacuum left by a weakened Hezbollah. The rebels in Bashar al-Assad's regime had agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Russia and Turkey back in March 2020. Now, the Kremlin is calling on Syria to restore order. CNN's Ben Wedeman has spent a considerable amount of time on the ground in Syria, covering the civil war. He joins us live now. So, Ben, Aleppo's, of course, serious second largest city. It is a major industrial hub. This would be a major win for the opposition forces, if indeed they were able to retake it. What more can you tell us?",

And we understand from rebels -- the rebelsclaim that, for instance, there was an air raid on the city of Idlib, which is adjacent as to the east of, rather, the west of Aleppo, that they do have, for instance, air power that the rebels don't have. And they have significant artillery resources, which they've been using as well. But it does appear that the Syrian government forces are struggling to try to deal with this surprise attack, which really just came out of the blue. It took the Syrian government forces completely by surprise. And until now, we're not seeing any significant counter-offensive by the Syrian government forces or by the Russians or anyone else. So we'll have to see how this plays out, whether the entirety of the city of Aleppo is going to fall to the rebels. That would be a serious blow to a Syrian regime that already is struggling to try to maintain control over parts of Syria. Keeping in mind, of course, that you have Turkish forces, American forces. You have remnants of ISIS in Syria. You have the Kurdish autonomous region in the northeast. So this is a government that, even in the best of times in recent years, has been fragile. And, of course, now it's facing pressure it hasn't seen in quite some time. Zain.",

The Kremlin saying that that big attack was a direct response to the Biden administration, allowing the Ukrainians to use those U.S. supplied ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles, to strike targets deep inside Russia. Of course, both the Russians and the Ukrainians have confirmed that targets were struck in the western regions of Russia using attack ATACMS surface- to-surface missiles. At the same time, the Russians definitely ramping up their aerial campaign against targets within Ukraine. The Ukrainian saying that in the early morning hours of Friday, the Russians launched about 130 strike drones towards Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians are saying they managed to take a lot of those drones down. At the same time, they do acknowledge that there was damage caused, especially in the town of Odessa, but also in Kyiv as well. However, the big thing that the Russians are talking about, that Russian state media is talking about, that the Kremlin is talking about is Russia's new gigantic intermediate range multiple warhead ballistic missile called Oreshnik. In fact, Vladimir Putin came out and said that that missile could have a devastating effect on any sort of positions that the Ukrainians would have on the ground. And he said several of those weapons paired together could actually cause an explosion that is almost the size of a nuclear weapon. So the Russians definitely very much threatening. The Ukrainians, of course, trying to dissuade them from continuing to use those U.S. and U.K. supplied weapons to strike deep into Russia. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And today, it is literally back from the ashes after a catastrophic fire that engulfed it in 2019.

Will, thank you so much for being with us.

And, yes, it was surreal and kind of something I would never have dared to dream to be part of the team that was rebuilding such an iconic building, iconic around the world, iconic among carpenters and all who are involved in the restoration trades. And thanks to being part of Charpentiers sans Frontieres, Carpenters without Borders, for some years, a kind of group of folks in France and around the world who are very passionate about these heritage kind of ancient techniques for carpentry, really got involved in the years following the fire with some of the architects and decision-makers in France and doing demonstration projects to help prove to the public as well as the French government and other decision-makers that these techniques and tools and skills were still alive and still available and could be re- employed to rebuild the cathedral much as it had been built in the -- in the 12th and 13th centuries.",

Everything has been -- you know, the last major restoration had taken place in the middle of the 19th century around 1850. And so it had been quite some time before a major restoration was undertaken. So, you know, much less rebuilding from ashes, everything from the roof line up as well as major smoke damage. But even before that, things had somewhat fallen into a little disrepair or were dirty, et cetera.

All four members of the House, Joe Courtney, Jim Himes, John Larson, and Jahana Hayes, all saying that they were notified by law enforcement of a bomb threat. Law enforcement ultimately did investigate those threats and determine that there wasn't any evidence of a bomb, but still this does underscore what is a growing concern for law enforcement officials about various threatening activities, including bomb threats, including these swatting incidents that we've seen where law enforcement is essentially -- the goal is to get law enforcement to show up to a particular location. But all of these are an effort to try to intimidate government officials, but also try to inhibit government operations, including Election Day voting. We saw several bomb threats at polling locations on election day here in the U.S. just earlier this month, and that raised similar concerns. Now, these threats against lawmakers in Connecticut, specifically, are coming as the federal law enforcement are also dealing with similar threats that were sent to several members of Trump's would-be cabinet, cabinet- level nominees, people like at very high-ranking national security jobs even who received similar bomb threats just one day prior to this latest batch.
