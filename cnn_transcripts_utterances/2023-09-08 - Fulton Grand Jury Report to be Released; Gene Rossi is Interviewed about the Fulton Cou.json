Next hour we expect to see the full and final unredacted report from the Fulton County special grand jury.Now, this was the grand jury that was brought together for the initial investigation that ultimately led to then the separate grand jury handing up indictments against former President Trump and 18 other co- defendants. Back in February, nine pages of this report were released to the public. You probably remember this. But a lot was missing, including who the jury thought should be charged with crimes. The judge overseeing that case held back portions of the report over due process concerns. Now, obviously, that charges have been filed, those concerns are no longer. And this full report can definitely give a fuller picture of everything that jury saw in this seven months of investigating what happened in Georgia. Did they recommend more people should have been charged? We will soon see. CNN's Nick Valencia outside the court in Atlanta. Paula Reid and Evan Perez also standing by. Nick, let's start with you. What's expected? How is this expected to play out today?",

The public will be given insight for the first time into how closely the indictments issued by Fulton County district attorney track with the panel's recommendations that were issued back in December.And we've been waiting for this report, as you mention in part, since February. And it was then that Judge McBurney, who has been presiding -- or who presided over this special purpose grand jury process, he had released parts of this report. But now we're expected to get the full report. He had not issued -- or not released the panel's recommendations on who to charge because he said he wanted to protect the rights of due process. But with these charges now filed in a ruling that he issued just about -- over a week ago, he had said that the due process concerns are now a moot point. So now we wait to this full report. And the special purpose grand jury, remember, they worked tirelessly for months, about seven months, and heard from 75 witnesses. And unlike a regular grand jury, they were singularly focused and they had subpoena power, which Fani Willis needed to compel some of these witnesses to testify. Today will be the final word from the grand jury. And we expect to see just how closely their recommendations tracked with ultimately the decision that was made by Fani Willis and potentially there could be some big surprises in this report, which is expected to be released in just under an hour.

They spoke to so many different witnesses over the course of seven months.But what I'm really looking for here today, Kate, is, was there any differentiation between what Fani Willis eventually did, who she indicted and who she listed as co-conspirators, and what was recommended by the grand jury, because if you look at the list of unindicted co-conspirators, particularly people like Boris Epshteyn, Thomas Fitton of Judicial Watch, also people like Phil Waldron, he's a GOP operative, I'm going to be really looking to see what the grand jury recommended about these people specifically. Were any of them recommended to be charged and then they decided to do them as an unindicted co-conspirator? That's one of the really key things I'm looking for today.",

And look, some of what this special grand jury found is going to - is going to find its way perhaps into some of the arguments you see from the district attorney as she tries to try to make sure this case stays on the rails, stays on course to be tried in state court. That's one of the things she's trying to do. She's also asked for all 19 defendants to be brought to trial as soon as October, which is something that the judge overseeing this, Scott McAfee, has already thrown a lot of doubt over.But then, of course, the other part of this, Kate, is that you have Mark Meadows, who has asked a federal judge to move the entire case, or at least his case, to federal court. And what that ruling - how that ruling comes down really has an impact -- will have an impact on the other defendants. It is possible that they decide -- the judge decides to move all of the defendants to federal court. And, of course, the former president has already said in his - in his court filing this week that he may be filing his own requests to move the case to federal court, which, of course, is a precursor to another request, which is to dismiss all of it because he believes he's immune. So, again, what we - what we see in this special grand jury report, all of the things that this grand jury found I think will be an interesting look -- a window into how the DA approaches some of these questions over the next couple of months of litigation.",

You have 30 defendants. You throw it at the wall and hope one of them sticks, including Trump. So, that's a positive sign if the number in the report is greater than the number in the indictment.And the other thing that's important here is, for evidentiary purposes, if they gave immunity to people, that will probably come out of the report, but also the defense is take advantage of that because conspirator statements, even if they're not in the indictment, their statements come in and that's an evidentiary hurdle that the defense could fight. And the last point I want to make on this is, you're going to see if there are transcripts in that report. And transcripts for a defense attorney -- I was a prosecutor for 30 years and a defense attorney for seven -- transcripts are golden for cross-examination.",

So, Sara, you're absolutely right, if they have people that have testified in the grand jury, referenced in the grand jury, did or did not get immunity, whether it's (INAUDIBLE) or transactional, they have probably likely flipped or are about ready to flip.

We're tracking that. Big issues are on the agenda, of course, like climate change and debt relief among them, and also the war in Ukraine. Notably, two people not attending the summit this year, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following the president in New Delhi. He's joining us now.

The two leaders last met at the G-20 Summit last year in Bali, Indonesia.But privately U.S. officials say that Xi's absence really does provide an opening for President Biden to make the pitch that he came here to make, and that is to try and prove to the developing world that the United States is here for them and that the United States is the most reliable partner for them in the future. The president is coming here not just with empty words but with direct commitments, commitments to reforming those multilateral banks, including the World Bank, and to try and boost funding for the world Bank by tens of billions of dollars. Those are some things that those developing countries have been looking for. And the G-20, unlike the G-7, does include many of those developing countries such as India, for example, which is why we're seeing such a big focus here on those issues. But there's no question that regardless of whether Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are here, we will, nonetheless, see a fractured, a very divided G-20 on some of the core issues to be discussed here, including climate change, but perhaps most notably on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It was that issue that prevented a joint communique from being issued last year from all of the leaders of the G-20. And that is in part because Russia is part of it, because China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine is part of the G-20, but also India, which is this year's host, has refused to sign on to some of those western-lead sanctions and has also declined to condemn Russia for this invasion. But there's no question that President Biden will have a packed G-20 Summit. And the question is whether or not at the end of it there will be some kind of a joint communique or if they have to once again resort to that leaders statement, which will note the major differences among those countries.
