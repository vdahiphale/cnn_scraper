So what does it mean? And more breaking news this hour, Kamala Harris sitting down what the popular radio host Charlamagne Tha God. Is her message directly to Black voters with Charlamagne tonight working? And Geraldo Rivera is my guest. He's called Trump a friend. He said he's done great things. But tonight, Geraldo is throwing his support behind Harris. I'll tell you why. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news -- polls just closing in Georgia and it was a record-breaking day on the first day of early voting in that crucial state. So the Georgia Secretary of State, Gabriel Sterling, just telling OUTFRONT that more than 300,000 people cast a ballot today which crushes the previous record set four years ago of 136,000. Now this video we'll show you here shows -- going the other direction so our producer is driving this way, the long line of cars waiting to pull into an early voting site. Tonight, both campaigns are trying to read the tea leaves here because it is a crucial battleground state. The road to the White House runs through Georgia for both Harris and Trump, which is why Trump is there tonight holding an event in Atlanta. Harris is going on Saturday for a rally one of her top surrogates has already been there, former President Bill Clinton this week. Her campaign and supporters have now booked $31 million in ads in Georgia, $7.1 million more than Trump, all in. It's an incredibly huge amount of money in these final days where every vote will matter. I mean, you remember, 10,770 votes, right? I mean, but when you look at how tight the race is already projected to be this time, the latest poll has Harris at 46 percent, 45 percent for Trump. CNN was at a polling station in Buckhead, a neighborhood outside Atlanta which is traditionally been a conservative area. And here's what our producers and reporters saw today, is that abortion and immigration were some of the key issues that had people coming out could go either way. Here is what one voter told our Nick Valencia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So when you look at early voting -- I mean, we're in it. And I know we've been saying this that election day is three weeks away, but yet -- well here's the but yet, so far, more than five million ballots have been cast across 39 states. I mean, that's really incredible. Kristen Holmes is OUTFRONT live in Atlanta where Trump is about to speak. And, Kristen, Trump has made no secret that Georgia is one and perhaps the most important state so this first day of early voting is very, very crucial. What do they see in these numbers?",

They have implored the people in the audience, if you have not gotten out today, show up tomorrow. We need people to show up and vote. Now the other interesting thing spent about the last minutes in the lobby here talking to people, so many people wearing early voting stickers I asked people, did you do this in 2020? They said no, that they didn't believe in it in 2020, interesting change obviously between then. [19:05:07] And you just heard this behind me, the speaker who just took the stage said that she just cast her ballot for Donald J. Trump. There is such an emphasis on this early voting now. The Republicans and that is something that behind the scenes, behind Donald Trump's rhetoric we know has been going on, we know that Republicans have been having a ground campaign in all of these various states to get people to show up and to cast their ballot. That is something that is very clear tonight. Very interesting to see because it feels like a real difference -- at least talking to the people who are here today who said they early voted than 2020.",

So, David, when you look at this, record smashed and you know maybe some people who would have cast a mail in four years ago now are choosing to vote early. No matter how you look at it though, those -- these are huge numbers. These are big numbers. These are people turning out. These were lines.

It means one thing if it's concentrated in the Atlanta area, probably another. But, generally, even with this new emphasis on early voting, Trump had so conditioned Republican voters to vote on election day that he's -- they're trying to rip out the wiring now and get them to behave differently.So I think there will be a greater participation of Republicans in early voting but the degree of it, I don't know.

And so, you know, to me, this is a statement on the part of people across the state that, hey, we're coming, we're going to vote. We're not going to be discouraged. And that I think is great.Look, I want everybody to vote in an election. I think this is a sacred process that distinguishes democracies from dictatorships and this is the way we grab the wheel of history and turn it in the direction we think is right. So I'm happy to see people come out. One thing I want to note about this Erin though, a lot of the people who you saw today are people who voted last time. Some of them may have voted early. Some of them may have voted on Election Day. What is going to be interesting is were there people who voted today who didn't vote at all last time and what motivated them to vote and what is their persuasion in this race. So, you know, there is a -- there is a possibility that these Republican voters are coming out early were people who would have come out anyway and the same with Democrats and we just don't know what is -- but I'd say it's mildly encouraging for Democrats and certainly it's encouraging for democracy that a record is being broken, and it suggests -- you know, we'll see whether it has auguring for the turnout in the fall but it looks like we're headed for another big election.",

Polls have closed on the first day of early voting, but Georgia matters so much. I mean, how it goes is an indicator of where the entire race is going. So that's why so much attention is on these early numbers. HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Erin. I mean, I should point out that Georgia is not even part of Kamala Harris's easiest path to 270 electoral votes. Donald Trump really needs to win the state. I mean, look, Kamala Harris's best path moves through the Great Lakes, right? She wins up there, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, gets her to 270. We can also potentially give her Nevada where she's been polling pretty decently. That gets her to 276. Now, let's just say we give her the state of Georgia, right? That gets her to 292. This gives her a major margin for error because she could lose in Pennsylvania and she would still get 273 electoral votes. If let's say we give that back to her, she could lose in Michigan again she's north of electoral votes. Let's say we give that back to her. She could lose in Wisconsin, and she still gets over 270 electoral votes, Erin. And so the bottom line is this, Georgia is so pivotal to Donald Trump's path to 270 if Kamala Harris can win there, it throws his entire path off. It gives her a much larger room for error, Erin.",

Of course, remember, four years ago, Joe Biden won that state.Why at this particular point does Donald Trump perhaps have the slightest advantage in the state of Georgia? Well, I think it comes down to Black voters. That's what it comes down to, because take a look here, if you look at the average among Black voters in the state of Georgia, you see that four years ago, Joe Biden won that vote by 82 points. Look where Kamala Harris is today, she's only up by 72 points. So, 10- point drop off, something that is very consistent with what we see nationwide and the bottom line is if Georgia is consistent with what we see nationwide in terms of the drop off in Black voters, it has felt more in Georgia than any other state because swing states with the most Black voters, look at this, Erin, Georgia comes in number one at 30 percent. If Kamala Harris can win over more black voters, she's likely to win the state of Georgia and make Donald Trump's path to 270 electoral votes seem like a pretty gosh darn long shot.",

Not perfect, they did a lot of things that were awful like paying no attention whatsoever to the southern border. It's come back to haunt them. The withdrawal from Afghanistan, that was awful, 13 lives lost unnecessarily.But generally speaking, the economy, the relationship with the world, the functioning of our own government, things went along pretty well under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and I have every expectation that she will continue his good work. Bidenomics, they don't use that term very much anymore, but the fact of the matter is that inflation has been almost stopped. There's been, you know, the employment situation has improved. Things are pretty good under Biden, they'll be hopefully pretty good under Kamala Harris. On the other hand, I think Donald Trump really represents -- I really do think that in Kamala Harris's words today that he is unfit. I mean the fact that he made liars out of millions and millions of people, I ask my Republican friends and, of course, I'm still a Republican, I ask people, you know, how in the world can you pretend to believe that the election was stolen when there's no evidence of that whatsoever? How can you delude yourself, you make believe you're -- you should choke on this. It is absolutely so false.
