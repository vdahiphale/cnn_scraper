They are targeting working-class voters in crucial blue wall swing states.And any moment, we expect to see the vice president taking the stage to speak at a Labor Day event in Detroit appearing alongside members and leaders of some of the largest unions in the country. Hours later, she will be joined by President Joe Biden at a local union hall in Pittsburgh. And this will mark their first joint campaign appearance since Harris took over the top of the ticket. Seeing a national politics correspondent Eva McKend is in Detroit for us. So, Eva, what are the Harris campaign's goals today as they are holding these events with union members?",

And while Republicans have made gains with rank-and-file members really through cultural appeals, she will argue that it is Democrats and, by extension, her that support the most pro-union policies like the PRO Act that would extend legal protections for employees. Michigan Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, who is running for Senate, she was just up on stage. And she told these union workers, listen, don't be bamboozled. Republicans might be trying to court your vote, but Democrats are the ones that actually support pro-union policies. Now, this just illustrates, Brianna, that Democrats can't afford to leave any coalition on the table. They are leaning on every conceivable voter in this battleground state. President Biden only won Michigan in 2020 by about 154,000 votes. So, bottom line, the message today from the vice president to this audience -- and the signs read as such -- is that she is union strong -- Brianna.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's so crazy that my poll numbers go up.

He constantly says the same exact thing, which is they are accusing me of interfering with the election, which I would have had every right to do to question that election, because there were some inconsistencies in his mind. He says that anyone has the right to question that. Obviously, in that clip, he was lacking the word accused there, just said that he was indicted for interfering with the election, which he had every right to do. Now, in terms of what this means legally for Donald Trump, I will let Carrie answer that, but what this means politically is that his team just doesn't want to deal with this. They have already pointed to the fact that he has said this before. We know that on Thursday of last week, they held a big legal call with all their surrogates, trying to brief them on how exactly to stay on message. It was led by some of his lawyers, by Boris Epshteyn, his legal adviser. They are trying to get ahead of all these legal issues.

What's going to matter is what evidence the court now allows to get into this case. The special counsel has made a decision about where it thinks, where the Justice Department thinks the lines should be drawn in terms of what evidence should come in and should come out. But it's going to go back to the district court.

I don't -- my own view is that they're not going to give a lot of credence to things that he says publicly because he says things all over the -- in terms of the full spectrum. Some things he says publicly are true. Some things are not true. Many things are not true or blur the lines of truth.",

And one of the things that we have heard this time around that we didn't hear before was this idea of -- quote, unquote -- \"too big to rig,\" which is Donald Trump's way of trying to get people out to vote by saying they're going to try everything that they can, them being Democrats.But what we need to do is all show up to vote, because if we show up to vote, then it will be so big that they can't rig the election. Well, that was really what we saw during the Biden -- when he was running against Biden at the top of the ticket. Now it's kind of turned back into this idea that Democrats are going to try and steal the election, because there's no way that they could possibly win unless they're trying to do some dirty tricks, which is something that we heard back in 2020. Now, we will see what happens as we move forward. We obviously have been at a time where Donald Trump has had a very hard time finding footing against Kamala Harris. None of his lines seem to be landing the way that he wants them to, which might be why he's talking about what was going to happen in 2024 at that election. That might -- he might -- why he might be insinuating that things could be unfair, because he feels unsure in his own footing at the election. So we will see what happens moving forward. But, of course, this is something we have heard from Donald Trump time and time again since 2020, again, when he was running against Biden and now against Kamala Harris.",

And if he does not win this election, then, presumably, a Harris administration would allow the Justice Department and the special counsel to continue this case.And then I think we have months, if not years, of potentially protracted litigation in this case, because each time the court considers whether or not certain evidence accords with the Supreme Court's decision, then the former president's team would presumably appeal. And so we could see this case drag out for a very, very long time. Where I do think it could potentially have actually a practical and positive from the perspective of democracy impact on the current election is the fact that this case could serve as a deterrent to individuals out in the states who in the past and part of this case were wrapped up in false electors and engaging in signing documents that have been brought into this case. Individuals out in the states might think differently about behaving and taking actions in the same way in 2024 as they did in 2020.",

ROB D'AMICO, FORMER FBI HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM MEMBER:  Yes, it's one of those things that I saw coming. As things get more desperate in the negotiations and they start looking at rescue attempts, I always thought that Hamas was going to kill before they allowed the Israelis to get and rescue them. One, it's a P.R. thing that the Israelis are doing. Well, two, it's their negotiating chip. And I really think right now they're using the information war better than Israel is, because they see the pressure on Netanyahu to do something. Here, Hamas murdered six people and people are now protesting against Netanyahu. So the information war, they have an advantage. They have been winning it since October 7.",

D'AMICO:  I see it's getting to a point, it's coming up to that critical point. Netanyahu obviously has something larger that he's looking at with the negotiations. There's something in there, and if it's a plot of land that he refuses to pull Israeli troops out of, I think there's a national security reason, and I think he doesn't want to do that. But, then again, the pressure is building up so much, then his future political ambitions may go away because he just isn't able to get voted back in. So I think for him it's coming up to, which is more important? Do you take the short term? Do you give into it and then figure out a way to make that secure and get the hostages home and deal with all the other things after that? Or do you keep holding out for that one? And I think that's probably what Biden was looking at. What truly is his holding point and how can he use his leverage to get Israel to equate to that and say, OK, let's figure out later, let's get the hostages home? It's one of those -- this is the most public negotiations for hostages the world's ever seen. So it's very, very dynamic in how each is using the power of the press to get the word across.",
