Giuliani is expected to travel to Georgia along with his long time friend, former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Now Kerik is not an attorney but he is an unindicted co-conspirator in this Fulton County case. Kerik has been helping Giuliani in his search for an attorney, something has proven challenging given that Giuliani currently has seven figures worth of unpaid legal bills.But it does appear that they have someone with a Georgia law license who will at least help them through the bond phase of this process. It's unclear though if he has retained someone who has agreed to represent him in this case. It is an open question about whether Giuliani can even afford a lawyer to represent him in this case. Now I'm also told by one source, that Giuliani would like to get through the bond negotiations and his surrender before former President Trump shows up on Thursday. As CNN has previously reported, Rudy has gone to former President Trump pleading with him to give him some help with his legal bills. And as of now, Giuliani has only received a small portion of what he owes and that was from a Trump affiliated political action committee, not from Trump himself.

So, yes, there's a lot of criticism about why children need to move from cable cars from one point of the valley to the other in that part of northwest Pakistan. There were about eight people in that cable car. The cable snapped which led to the dangling about 900 feet above the ground for many, many hours. We were told by one of the children who was in that cable car that two of the children had vomited, another two were slipping in and out of consciousness. There was an attempt by commandos via helicopter to rescue them. One of the children was rescued by a sling team which went and actually grabbed that child directly from the cable car, while being hanging from a helicopter, and then came down. But then again, night fell. It got incredibly dark. They couldn't bring those helicopters up. Which were also causing a lot of movement of that one remaining fragile cable. And so eventually they had to call in zip lining experts which went in and climbed up and through the use of rope and pulleys and various mechanics, they managed to get the remaining seven down. So this lasted late into the night and around 11:00 p.m., in the night again. It's a very remote part of the country. There is again, the Prime Minister had tweeted out saying that he is relieved. But again, according to tweets by both the Prime Minister and the president, there has been a call for oversight with these cable cars and these chair lifts which are really made because there is a lack of infrastructure. And people want to send their kids to school. So they put together these homemade, almost hokey cable cars using auto mobile crafts as well as leftover bits from heavy machinery. So they aren't very safe. There have been accidents like this in the past, but none that have lasted so very long and have needed such a long and measured safety response. So a lot of relief and a lot of joy that this ended well -- Bianca.",
