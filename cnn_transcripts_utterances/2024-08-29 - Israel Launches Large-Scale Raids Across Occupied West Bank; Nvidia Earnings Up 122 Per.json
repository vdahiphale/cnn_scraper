The frequency and number of Israeli military operations in the West Bank have increased in recent months. And IDF officials described the latest offensive as a counter-terror operation, but Israeli forces rarely target multiple Palestinian cities simultaneously.According to Palestinian officials, at least 11 people were killed during the raid, which involved airstrikes as well as attack drones and helicopters. Bulldozers were used to dig up streets. Israel says it was targeting a terrorist infrastructure, as well as weapons smuggled in via Iran into the West Bank. Palestinian officials condemn the operation, accusing Israel of blocking access to hospitals and obstructing ambulances. CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, begins our coverage reporting in from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Before dawn, the biggest Israeli raid into the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began October 7th. Airstrikes near a cluster of northern towns, Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas, backed by hundreds of troops and border police on the ground. The IDF says it's a counter terrorism operation, intended to thwart what they claim is a systematic strategy in Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank. Outside Jenin, a drone strike killing three men in a vehicle whom the IDF claimed were terrorists and seriously wounding another. Near Tubas, the IDF says another airstrike killed four terrorists. This resident caught in a blast. MASOUD NAAJA, TWO CHILDREN KILLED (through translator): In seconds, very fast. We felt like something came down on us from the sky, and there was an explosion.

BARGHOUTI: Absolutely.

The Democrat strategy is to shave down the Republican lead in its traditional strongholds in rural Georgia while winning big in Georgia's largest city, Atlanta.

And we'll replay the interview Friday at 7 a.m. Eastern in London, 10 a.m. in Abu Dhabi. You'll see it only here. You're right, CNN. Well, several European fashion influencers have become the faces of some fake pro-Trump accounts on X. Not because the influencers actually support Trump, or have anything to do with him, but their images were stolen and then reposted to promote pro-Trump agenda and some conspiracy theories along the way. As CNN's Katie Polglase reports, some of those influencers are now really outraged. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Debbie is heading home from work in Luxembourg, Northern Europe. Crossing the border into Germany, she races back to her son. DEBBIE NEDERLOF, MODEL &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER: Hello. POLGLASE (voice-over): And of course, Lou (ph). But Debbie's day doesn't end there. She's also a professional model. Her image, not only her identity, but her source of income, helping support her and her son. But it's been stolen, used in a pro-Trump account on X, attracting nearly 30,000 followers in less than six months.",

In partnership with the Centre for Information Resilience, CNN found nearly 60 fake Trump-supporting accounts.And from these, we identified nearly a dozen women, real women from across Europe -- from Denmark to the Netherlands and as far away as Russia -- whose identities are being used in accounts telling voters, American voters, to vote for Trump in the upcoming U.S. election.

Certain patterns emerged. The fake accounts repost each other. It's a sign of a coordinated campaign. Here, several of the fake accounts post the exact same wording: \"If you're voting for the man who survived an assassination attempt, I want to follow you.\" It's another sign the accounts are linked. And that's not all. Some of the accounts manipulated the images of these women. Have a look at Debbie's post -- the original on Instagram, and now the fake one on X. Her hat now reads \"Make America Great Again.\" Look at this T-shirt before, and then \"Trump 2024.\" For now, we don't know who is behind all these accounts, but the former U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, who also used to investigate fake accounts for Twitter, told us this. EMILY HORNE, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I don't think it's unreasonable to ask questions about could there be a state actor involved? We know that there are multiple state actors who have been using social media to try to sow disinformation campaigns in the run-up to the 2024 election. POLGLASE (voice-over): But regardless, the accounts are reaching influential politicians. Doug Mastriano, a Republican state senator for Pennsylvania, follows Debbie's fake account. CNN contacted the senator about the account but has not heard back. Back in Germany, Debbie is shocked and upset that her image is being used in this way. With President Trump now back on X and Elon Musk, the owner of X, throwing his weight behind him, fake pro-Trump content appears to be flourishing, silencing the real women affected. Once again, women's rights at the very heart of this presidential election. Katie Polglase, CNN, Trier, Germany. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
