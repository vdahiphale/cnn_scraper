Now, it's unclear what the specific charges are against him or what they might be, but he has been the subject of a federal investigation into sex trafficking for months which, of course, led to a high-profile search of his homes in L.A. and also in Miami.He has also been facing multiple civil lawsuits, nine directly accusing him of sexual assault. One was from his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, who he settled with in November. And back in May, federal investigators were preparing to bring some of his accusers before a federal grand jury for testimony. These lawyers say the rapper moved to New York last week in anticipation of being charged and said in a statement -- quote -- \"We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\" I want to bring in John Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, and Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president and co-founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. John, let me begin with you here. Diddy apparently relocated to New York (INAUDIBLE) actual arrest. What are you hearing about how all this went down?",

So, it's racketeering, sex trafficking and others that we can expect. But I think part of the argument will be that Cassie Ventura, one of the key people behind the civil suits and one of the people who is expected to be a witness in this case as a victim, was with P Diddy for 11 years.

We do know from the search warrants that they took a tremendous amount of digital evidence, videos and other things from security cameras, to corroborate some of the things that were stated by these witnesses, whether they occurred, where they said, on the dates and times and so on.

Now, an arrest officially made. Thank you all.We also know a single assassination attempt on a presidential candidate would be enough to shake a whole nation to its very core. But we now in the United States are dealing with two in the very same election. And we're learning more about the moments right before Secret Service engaged with an alleged would-be assassin, a man by the name of Ryan Wesley Routh, who is the suspect, and how he may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours at Trump's own golf course. Here's how it went down. Around 1:30 Sunday afternoon, Trump was moving across the fairway of the fifth hole. Routh was on the public side of the fence near the sixth green. Now, about 300 to 500 yards away from Trump, that's where he apparently was. And a Secret Service agent who was visually sweeping the area of the sixth green saw the suspect, and then opened fire on him. Now, Routh, he did not get off any shots at that point. He actually fled. And tonight, we actually have new bodycam videos showing his arrest moments later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He got cell phone data that showed he could have been there for nearly 12 hours. And when he fled, he left behind a trove of evidence --(END VIDEO CLIP) -- including a SKS-style rifle with a scope, a backpack, a digital camera, and a plastic bag with food. Now, as for that rifle, he shouldn't have had it in the first place. He has an extensive rap sheet, including a felony conviction back in 2002. And federal law prohibits a convicted felon from having a firearm. On top of that, the rifle serial number was actually unreadable, obliterated. Both of those facts weigh to the two federal charges that he is now facing, revealed during his court appearance today. Possessing a firearm as a felon, it actually brings a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. And having a firearm with an obliterated serial number? That has a max sentence of five years. But that may not be the end of any of this because police are getting search warrants for his car, for his phone, for any devices he may have, and also interviewing family members and people who knew him. And that means that, potentially, more charges could come, depending, of course, on what they find. Now, as for Trump, he's giving his first account of the apparent assassination attempt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (voice-over):  All of a sudden, we heard shots being fired in the air and I guess, probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets, but what do I know about that, but the Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets. And they grabbed me. We got into the carts, and we moved along pretty good. I was with an agent and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course.

CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR BERNIE SANDERS'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS:  You know, I've been thinking about this a long time. And this morning, when I woke up, I was reflecting back on -- I've been doing this a long time. And I've always made attack ads against Republicans. And I've said some pretty ugly things that are on me as a guy who makes ads. That's what I do for a living. But what has really started to see something change was the internet. I'm not blaming the internet. I'm just saying misinformation and ugliness. Everybody has got a little ugly in them. And when you put them on the internet, it just exposed a lot of things that a lot of people are saying. Maybe not tied to Donald Trump or even tied to the vice president, but just for folks that are just going through their regular day lives, who are just kind of getting off the edges of the internet and just seeing enough until their baby starts crying again. They may believe some of this stuff that's really, really ugly that's out there.

I don't blame Donald Trump for that action either. Those people, they're grown men and women. They're responsible for their actions. They're responsible for breaking windows and knocking police in the head. The same way that these people are responsible for their actions, laying on a rooftop in Butler, hide in the bushes in West Palm, you know.
