      "sentences": "Hello, Dana. The Justice Department has unsealed charges against three hackers who are associated with the Iranian government. And according to the Justice Department, these are three hackers that have been for months, targeting people associated with the Trump campaign.They were able to get documents from inside the Trump campaign essentially by targeting people around it. They were targeting journalists. They were targeting anyone associated with the campaign as part of an operation to influenced the 2024 U.S. presidential election. And one of the interesting things about this, obviously, these three hackers that work for the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, one of the things that we know is that they're not under arrest. But the Justice Department has pictures of these three men who are believed to be behind this hack and leak operation. They also have a lot of detail in this 50-page plus indictment, including a map showing exactly where in Tehran these hackers were operating from. Even a picture of the front door of the office, a nameplate showing where these hackers were operating. Clearly, the FBI and the U.S. intelligence agencies have a lot of information and know a lot about what this operation involved. Now, keep in mind, beginning in May, we know from our own reporting previously that these hackers started attacking people or targeting people around the Trump campaign. Eventually, by June, they started sending some of the documents that they were able to get from inside the Trump campaign, things that we've now heard about, including documents related to J.D. Vance and some of the vetting of potential vice presidential candidates, those people, all of those documents were leaked to journalists as part of a replay of the playbook we saw the Russians use so effectively, Dana, back in 2016. And so, right now, we don't -- again, we don't have any of these people in U.S. custody, but what the government is doing clearly now, compared to what they did in 2016, is they're telling the American public ahead of time what exactly this operation entailed so that voters can keep that in mind --",

Same prosecutors, same theory, but the spectacle of this so exciting to them that they wanted to bring another one of these cases. This case isn't even a real case. This is the airline upgrade corruption case.The third thing we said is that we demand that they bring exculpatory information and the discovery to court on Wednesday. As you know from looking at the indictment and from what happened in court, there are no e-mails, text messages, or any corroboration whatsoever that the mayor knew about anything having to do with these campaign donations. The entire body of evidence is one staffer. One staffer that says there was a conversation. What you have not learned is that, that staffer has lied and the government is in possession of that lie. When that staffer was first interviewed, that staffer said that Mayor Adams knew nothing about this. He was not involved in this and that he is innocent. They have that information. They have not turned that over to us. They have not turned that over to you. And so it sort of does not surprise us that they did not answer any questions at that press conference. Their little press conference the other day. They have no answer for any of these questions. And they didn't want to stick around from questions either. Questions like, why are they doing this? Why are they targeting him? The questions you all started to ask as they were leaving. They normally answer questions. They didn't want to stay for questions in this case. And they left and they made this assertion of this. They implied that somehow he's disappointing people or that people ought to be disappointed in him. It's not him doing this.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. Let me address a couple of things that we just heard from the defense lawyer, Alex Spiro. So first of all, he called this the quote, \"airline upgrade corruption case.\" I don't think that's an accurate take on the indictment. That's certainly a part of it.But the indictment alleges that Eric Adams took free travel, free hotels and yes, upgrades worth over $120,000. So I think there's an attempt to downplay that. Also, the indictment charges something else that was not addressed at all there by the defense lawyer, which is that Adams allegedly took illegal foreign campaign contributions through fake straw donors. So that's another element of the case that was unaddressed. The defense lawyer also said, as you just mentioned, Dana, that the entire evidence here is from one staffer who has lied. First of all, we certainly don't know that. It reads to me in the indictment like they have more than one person on the inside giving information. If somebody has lied to the government, to investigators, that happens sometimes. And as the defense lawyer correctly said, the defense is entitled to know that and the prosecution has a duty to turn that over. And finally, the lawyer just said, well, there's no e-mails or text. I don't know where he's getting that. I mean, the indictment is filled with direct quotes from text, some of which are quite inculpatory, meaning showing Eric Adams potential guilt here. So, look, that's what defense lawyers do. He's doing his job. Alex Spiro is a very good defense lawyer, but I think his characterization of the indictment was lacking in some respects.",

That, now, as you noted, Dana, if indeed that's what the results look like on election night, all Kamala Harris needs to win the White House, if she has that electoral vote in Nebraska, is repeating the blue wall victories of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she seems to be running a bit better than in the Sun Belt.I want to say one other thing about the Nebraska poll. We asked a question, do you, who live in the 2nd congressional district, the Omaha area of Nebraska, want to change the rules? 60-40 opposed to it. 60 percent of people say in the poll, keep it as it is. Award our votes by congressional district. 40 percent not. Of course, Democrats and Independents, hugely in favor of keeping it as is. Seven in 10 Republicans want to change the rules.",
