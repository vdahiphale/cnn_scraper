I think, perhaps even more importantly, there has been new security measures imposed on areas of the Russian Federation, just across the border in Crimea as well, in various areas in the south bordering and northeast bordering Ukraine. There have been very tight measures announced there as well, imposing travel restrictions in the area, allowing local officials and the military authorities to, you know, kind of defend the area a bit more, a bit more, sort of easily by bypassing various civil liberties that have up until now, been enforced there. And then additionally, across much of the rest of the country, as well, certainly in Moscow, and in the surrounding provinces, regional governors are being given some undisclosed as yet powers to impose certain restrictions to tighten their control over those areas as well. And so look, I don't know what impact yet no one does, it's going to have on the ground in terms of the civil liberties of individuals inside Russia.

China's military must be ready to take Taiwan by 2027. But he's still deciding if he'll do it. President Joe Biden said repeatedly, the U.S. military would defend Taiwan. He's authorized more than $1 billion in ARM sales to Taipei, Taiwan taking cues from Ukraine, focusing on asymmetric unconventional warfare. TZU-YUN: That can give Taiwan more opportunity to defeat such a huge force.

And they try and leverage her behind the scenes to recognize that she simply has no road left. She doesn't come on the competence of her party. She can't pass legislation. She has been buffeted by different priorities of MPs and interest groups, and she simply can't lead. And you mentioned earlier, Becky, the fact that there seems to be an absence of governing, and of leadership, clearly, and that's what we're witnessing today. There's rumblings in Westminster at the moment that we might be starting to see resignations, I've been speaking to MPs on what's happened in the last few minutes. And they're just as confused as we are. So I think this all underscores just how febrile the atmosphere is how anything could change the current predicament of Liz Truss, will she last a little longer, will there be an urgent appeal to oust her, even just hours after she declared to the House of Commons that she was a fighter and not a quitter. We've since had reported that she has canceled the event that she was supposed to be out visiting a British company and also speaking to the media, that's now not happening. So it's just so difficult to get a sense of whether the ship is studying and stabilizing somewhat or if actually it's all just spinning out of control, Becky.",

And the decision for Britain to leave the European Union that surprised allies all around the world to then the turbulent years of Boris Johnson in office. And now to have this prime minister, who has not got the mandate of a general election victory behind her who is proceeding with radical agendas and then having to U-turn on them the next day. Obviously, it's going to unsettle Britain's allies on the continent, the USA, we've heard Biden make veiled remarks as well about Liz Truss's recent actions. So all in all, we can definitely say that it's unsettling Britain's relationship with allies and undermining any form of position that Britain is trying to project for itself internationally.",

      "sentences": "Well, the big figure Becky is 15 million. That's the number of barrels per oil. The President Bidenintends to announce today that he is releasing from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves that comes on top of 165 million barrels altogether, that he's released since last spring. That puts the total at 180 billion barrels sorry, million barrels of oil that the president will have released. All of this intended to try and stabilize oil markets and of course, try and curb rising gas prices here in the United States. Of course, this is all coming at it, as you mentioned that a critical time period less than three weeks to go until the midterm elections. Gas prices right now are about 20 cents higher than they were a month ago. They have started to come down a little bit over the last week. But there are still enormous concerns about the potential for future rises, in particular, because of what we heard from OPEC and Russia earlier this month announcing a combined 2 million barrels of oil per day production cut. Now what we're going to hear from the president today is not only this plan to release these 15 million barrels, also talking about the possibility of releasing additional barrels of oil beyond that 180 million pledge, should conditions require it in the months to come. And he's also going to be announcing plans to replenish that strategic petroleum reserve, which is at a 40 year low right now at about 400 million barrels compared to its total capacity of over 700 million barrels. But that will only happen once crude oil prices come down to somewhere in the range of 67 to $72 per barrel. But to be clear, you know, when you look at 15 million barrels that are going to be released, that's compared to a total U.S. consumption per day of about 20 million barrels. So a big part of today is not necessarily the big impact that this is going to have. But it's also of course, about messaging, political messaging ahead of those crucial midterm elections, Becky.",

Now the State Department for its part says that it has raised its concerns with senior levels of the Saudi government repeatedly. And as recently as this weekend it is working to determine whether it should be labeled a wrongful detention.
