(END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD: All right. I want to bring in now Dr. Kenneth Remy. He is a critical care physician at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. Dr. Remy, good to see you. So we just heard there that, you know, that more children are filling hospital beds than they have in the last two years. So why do you think this disease seems to be spreading so much right now? DR. KENNETH REMY, CRITICAL CARE PHYSICIAN, UH RAINBOW BABIES AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, CLEVELAND: Well thank you, Fredricka, for having me today. You know, I think first and foremost we are seeing a lot of children who weren't exposed to these viruses over the last two years because of good social distancing and stay at home practices. And that immunity gap, if you will, is sort of catching up with us in that respect. And then we are just seeing a huge uptick, you know, in time where we are just going to RSV season. We saw a first year out of the pandemic, we saw that in June where we don't see RSV, we saw an uptick. And so this is a continuation of that and certainly filling our hospital beds.",

It usually comes a little bit later. But what kind of accommodations are you having to make?DR. REMY: So trying to keep children in emergency room and other spaces outside of the intensive care unit or in-patient beds is a common place now. You're seeing some institutions putting up tents to actually care for this excess load of patients that previously they were unable to take care of due to this capacity. You know, and I think the big fundamental question is when is influenza or some of the other viruses going to hit and if they hit on top of this RSV that certainly is going to be devastating to capacity and it means that we'll likely have to continue to cancel surgeries and elective procedures as we try to face this sort of pandemic we are seeing with nursing shortages, respiratory therapists, et cetera.",

So things are acting differently than previously pre-pandemic. And so the fact that RSV came in June of last year and is now rearing its ugly head here in September means that we may have a prolonged period of time for RSV, but we may have influenza and (INAUDIBLE) virus and influenza all on the heels of this and that's what makes this complicating to at least predict.",

      "sentences": "What do you recommend parents need to look out for, caregivers? I mean look, my twins, they are now 10, but they got RSV when they were just 1-month-old and it was really serious. One of my kids was in ICU for ten days. I mean he barely made it through.I didn't know what it was at the time. But if not for the keen, you know, watchful eye of a good friend who said you need to take them to the ER, I wouldn't have known. So what do people look for? DR. REMY: That was a great question. First and foremost I want to put people at ease. So even though we see 2.1 million cases of out-patient cases of RSV for children under 5 years and this accounts for about 60,000 children younger than 5 with hospitalizations annually, we only see 1 to 300, thankfully, of deaths. So most far and away children will survive this. So as you point out, it's a disease of really newborns, those under the age of 2. And so if your child is having respiratory distress or increased work of breathing or is a premature child or has other comorbidities or problems, these are children that when they start to exhibit those symptoms, you want to bring them to the emergency room as soon as possible. Furthermore, protect those that are above age 65. About 14,000 Americans that are over age 65 will die of RSV as well. And so we've got to be cognizant to wash our surfaces and wash our hands more frequently in the season.",

      "sentences": "Wow. And while you talk about the at-risk children who are usually under 2, in that piece we saw a 5-year-old. Can it really, you know, impact kids of all ages?DR. REMY: Absolutely. So by age 2, before the pandemic, almost every child has been exposed to RSV that lives here in the United States. But now certainly with the pandemic and the influence that's had on that immune gap that we've just talked about, certainly we can see the symptoms now for first exposure to the virus rearing its head for those that are 3, 4, 5 years of age now that are having actual symptoms that may not have been sick previously. And then if you've got other conditions like asthma or other comorbidities, certainly any RSV at any point in your timeframe as a child may actually have deleterious effects that bring you to a hospital.",

A federal appeals court put a temporary hold on his student debt relief program.The plan would forgive up to $10,000 in debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year and couples making below $250,000. Borrowers who received Pell Grants could see their student debt shrink by as much as $20,000. CNN's Jasmine Wright is live for us in Washington.

So last night when responding to this new order -- excuse me, this hold, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in addition to telling people to continue to apply, she said in a statement, we will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations and compliance with this order. And the administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families.

They'll go through those double doors, they'll make their way inside to vote in person or to drop off those absentee ballots. And if you take a look at those numbers that just released from the secretary of state's office, we're talking about more than 660,000 people all across the state of Georgia who have already voted. The majority of them, of course, in Fulton County, more than 85,000. And then if you look at the day alone, Friday, just yesterday, that's when we saw the majority of the ballots being cast, the highest number more than 140,000 on Friday alone. That's up 51 percent from the same time period back in 2018, our last midterm election. So we are seeing record voter turnout that started on Monday and continued through the week.

But where the strikes have been hitting and heavily damaging the sort of power-generating equipment, those repairs take a lot longer.The impact today, according to Ukraine's energy company, has been worse than that Monday about two weeks ago when Russia first started targeting the energy infrastructure, critical infrastructure. Remember that day? There was a huge barrage of missiles and drone strikes. Well, the Ukrainians have upped their game in terms of air defenses. It's not perfect. They are protecting the city of Kyiv here. There were a number of missiles fired here. Those were all taken out. Lviv in the west of the country, seven missiles fired at that city. The air force took all those out. Odesa in the south, several missiles fired there. Most of those were taken out although a power-generating station was hit there. But where the Russians are finding weaknesses are some of the outlying towns and villages. So you have about five towns in the west of the country, about four or five hours from the capital here, and then towns headed south, about an hour away, two hours away, five and six hours away -- excuse me -- several towns have had their energy infrastructure hit. 11 regions in this country now having rolling blackouts. 1.5 million Internet subscribers have not been able to get on the Internet today because of outages. But it's worse. It's getting to really critical infrastructure for the government in Rivne, a town to the west of here. There buses have been taking water to the local hospital because the hospital can't get water because the electricity has been taken out. The air-raid siren warning system in the town has been taken out by these strikes as well because it's taken out the electricity. So the police are having to drive around with loud speakers and tell the population when there is an air raid happening. So it's easing into the country's ability to function normally. And just think, two weeks ago none of this was happening. Now you have 11 regions across the country that are significantly and seriously affected despite the fact that the Ukrainians have been able to up the air defenses 50 percent takeout on cruise missiles, about two-thirds of all drones taken out. But those that are getting through, they are still damaging.",

There is only a few people actually left in the town. We know that the Ukrainian military wouldn't target us. But what's worrying the Ukrainian government at the moment, and Russia denies this, the Ukrainian government saying that there is a hydroelectric power generating station on a dam just up the big Dnipro River from Kherson and the Russians, the Ukrainians, are going to blow it up. They have got trucks full of explosives on it. They've been mining some of the (INAUDIBLE) ways. There would be this downstream effect that could flood out towns and villages. Kill people there. But upstream -- the upstream effect could be even more dangerous because the river, and it's a huge river down there behind the dam provides the cooling water for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

What to me is of more interest is the surrounding Oblast, the surrounding regions around the war zone in Ukraine, but on the Russian side of the border where martial law has been declared because to me what that states is that Russians are very concerned about sabotage and paramilitary operations that the Ukrainians might be able to conduct on the Russian side of the border in response to Russian military action inside of Ukraine.

It says that Trump enacted a wide ranging pressure campaign across our government from the Department of justice to state officials to even former Vice President Mike Pence to try and get his help in this plan.The letter references Trump's efforts to insert fake electors, oversee the fake elector plan, where states submitted fake electors to Congress on his behalf. And the letter says that Trump summoned the violent mob to the Capitol on January 6th because Trump knew that some of the protesters were armed in the crowd and yet he did not call off the rioters for hours as he watched it unfold on television. So in addition to laying all that out, the committee is asking Trump for a wide range of documents to hand over, including all of his conversations on January 6th and whether or not he has spoken to any of the other committee witnesses as part of its investigation. And the committee is asking Trump to hand over all of those documents by November 4th, and sit for a deposition either in person or virtually November 14th.",
