Moments away from what is expected to be the most contentious testimony in the hush money criminal trial of former President Donald Trump. I'm Kaitlan Collins outside that courthouse in New York along with Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And when court resumes shortly, the defense attorneys, specifically Todd Blanche, Trump's lead attorney on this case, will begin to cross- examine the prosecution's star witness. That is Trump's former fixer and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen and Wolf it promises to be interesting, to say the least.",

I can't even imagine what this lunch break is like for Michael Cohen or for Todd Blanche, really, for that matter, as they're both preparing for a pivotal moment for both of them, Paula. The other thing that Michael Cohen was really getting into as he was finishing his time with the prosecution was the pressure campaign that he faced in those days after he had had everything, his home, his apartment, his hotel room raided. And he was attached to this, introduced to Bob Costello, who was this attorney that was allied with Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. And we were seeing the emails from Bob Costello to Michael Cohen that were really notable. He kept saying that he could be a back channel, basically, to Donald Trump. He kept saying, my friend, referring to Rudy Giuliani, my friend's client. I mean, it was very clear what Bob Costello was trying to communicate to Michael Cohen.",

And Rob Costello, longtime attorney of Rudy Giuliani, a Trump-aligned attorney, is just one of these Trump world characters that just keeps showing up in every story. And it was just about a year ago, right before Trump was indicted, that the defense surprised a lot of people by calling Rob Costello to try to undercut the credibility of Michael Cohen because he was testifying about his time representing Cohen. And he said that, look, Cohen told me that the whole hush money scheme was his idea. Notably, Costello is not being called to testify for the defense. Costello told me he was quite surprised not being called to once again undercut Michael Cohen's credibility here in the trial since he was their sole witness during the grand jury proceedings. But a lot has transpired in the last year, including Costello and Rudy Giuliani, specifically asking Trump to help pay Costello for some of the legal work that he had done for Rudy Giuliani. That hasn't happened yet. And that is one theory about why he's not here. I think the other theory is Joe Tacopino is the defense lawyer. He was leading things back when Costello was called. Now it's Todd Blanche, and he just doesn't seem to think that Costello is necessary for their case.",

And in that moment, we've now learned from the transcript what the prosecution was saying to Justice Merchan, the judge here, was that Michael Cohen is their last witness.

They've gone through his podcast, his social media posts. We saw a little bit of a preview with this, with Stormy Daniels talking about, do you hate Donald Trump? Those are going to be the kinds of questions that they ask of Michael Cohen. The other part of this is going to be whether or not he financially benefited in the last seven years from his dislike of Donald Trump or from taking Donald Trump on. One of the things that we know is he appeared to be making money even just off of his TikToks during this trial. The little button that said you can donate here if you want to help me, while he was delivering these kind of speeches, ranting about various things. This has been a core part of Michael Cohen's brand.

It was always expected that they wouldn't end with Cohen, that he would come three quarters of the way in. So the fact that prosecutors are not even going to call their summary witness after Cohen, that is a surprise. It speaks to their confidence in Cohen's performance here. But they also, there is no other witness lined up to call. It's a decision. Will it pay dividends? We'll see after the verdict.",

I think what's been interesting is that Donald Trump has really tried to keep his composure during this testimony in a way that he wasn't able to with Stormy Daniels, in a way that he's been briefed is critically important during this testimony. His lawyers have told him they do not want it to look as though Michael Cohen is getting underneath his skin because they believe that that will empower him. They want to rattle Michael Cohen. If Michael Cohen is getting under Donald Trump's skin, that doesn't rattle Michael Cohen. That would just encourage him. So this is something they have told him. Now, it seems up until this point, he's actually listened to them, keeping his eyes closed, keeping disengaged, not cursing under his breath and elbowing his attorneys.(CROSSTALK)",

That doesn't even come close to how he feels about Michael Cohen, and it's fine. It's funny because when the prosecution was delivering their case, particularly earlier today, they gave a hint as to the state of mind that Trump was in based on the message that Robert Castello, who was Giuliani's attorney, sent and other people. And also the tweet that Donald Trump sent, warning about how Trump would feel about Michael Cohen if Cohen turned on Trump. So now we have, not that we actually needed to see what happened real time and Trumps feeling real time.

So it's all going to come down to credibility, and I'm sort of eagerly watching our feed here to see how they open up the cross-examination of Michael Cohen.

And that's why, you know, it doesn't help solve the issue with China. It doesn't help solve the issue with the wars that are the proxy wars we're in with Russia and Iran. And those are the issues that people are really mad about. They're mad about it, they care about it and the voters who are voting in these polls are showing that. And yet the world's attention is on a paperwork trial that at its best, you know, in the world where I came from business, you know, this would have been a non-material classification error. At best, it might have been, you know, tried at a misdemeanor. But even still today, there's been no real connection to a crime that's happened.
