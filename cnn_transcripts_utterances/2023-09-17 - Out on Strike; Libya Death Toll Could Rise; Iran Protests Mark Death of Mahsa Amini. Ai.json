I'm Laila Harrak.Out on strike, autoworkers in the U.S. still don't have a deal with automakers in the first strike against all of the big three. And the death toll from floods in Libya will likely keep rising as the search goes on. We'll talk to a former health official about how recovery efforts are going. And an increased police presence as protests break out across Iran. It's all to mark the anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini in morality police custody. No breakthrough, but reasonably productive discussions, at least with Ford. That's how the United Auto Workers are describing labor talks on day two of the union strike against three top U.S. automakers. While striking union workers picketed outside the Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, Ford has responded to the walkout by temporarily laying off some 600 non-striking workers at that plant, saying the strike is causing a lack of parts. And G.M. is threatening to lay off 2,000 more. The union and Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are far apart on wages and benefits. The union is essentially demanding double the wage increases the automakers are offering along with other enhancements. While hundreds of striking UAW members out on picket lines Saturday, said they are prepared to wait to get an agreement that suits them. CNN's Gabe Cohen reports.",

Reasonably productive, certainly no deal, but a big step in the right direction after days of hostile back and forth between the sides. Ford saying in a statement that they are committed to reaching an agreement with UAW that rewards our workers and allows Ford to invest in the future. But we're also starting to see the ripple effect from the strike with Ford and General Motors announcing that the companies will lay off an additional, at least 2,600 workers at two other facilities in the days ahead because those factories can't operate as long as these three are on strike. But still, so many of the workers we have spoken with who are out here on the picket line making $500 a week in strike pay tell me they're ready to stay here for as long as it takes.

According to North Korean state media, Kim held discusses on Saturday with Russia's defense minister. Well, those talks were said to be focused on further cooperation between their two militaries on issues of national security and defense. No arms deals have been announced during Kim's visit, but Ukraine and its allies are closely watching for any potential signs of North Korea aiding Moscow's war effort.The Russian military claims it intercepted five Ukrainian drone attacks early Sunday over Moscow and Crimea. No casualties or damage were reported, but airport operations around Moscow were disrupted. Meanwhile, Russia's defense minister reportedly is disputing that Ukrainian forces have retaken the village of Andriivka,  near Bakhmut. It's been the scene of fierce fighting along the frontlines fighting along the frontlines. Newly released video shows Ukrainian soldiers taking cover after entering the village under constant, incoming Russian fire. For the civilians who once lived in the town, there's nothing to return to. But Ukraine says the territory is strategically important and retaking it has been a key objective of the ongoing counteroffensive. CNN's Clare Sebastian is closely following all of these developments and joins us now live this hour from London. Clare, a very good morning. What is the strategy behind these drone attacks on Russian soil, which have become a feature of this war?",

The counteroffensive not just on the frontlines, as you showed just there, but what some are calling Ukraine's deep battle, these attacks far behind enemy lines.Just this morning, case in point, as you said, five drones, Russia says, were intercepted, some over Crimea, which has become an increasing focus certainly in the last week or so. Just in the last week, Ukraine claims to have damaged several ships in the Port of Sevastopol, claims to have knocked out a sophisticated air defense system in the east of the peninsula as well. But Moscow, I think you have to sort of question what's the military utility here. Yes, I think there are attempts to sort of crack the propaganda facade to remind the Russian people that this is, in fact, a war. There may also be an attempt to keep Russia's air defenses trained on the capital and away from Ukraine itself. But, look, as we see the debate around weapons supplies certainly ahead of President Zelenskyy's expected visit to the U.S. this week, this is a part of this war that Ukraine does not, we understand, rely on western supplies for. They are producing a lot of their own drones. The head of the drone program saying to CNN just recently that they've increased production 100 times since the start of this war. So, this is a way for Ukraine to show that it has its own agency in this war, a war, of course, that Russia is fighting in part to try to essentially delete Ukraine as a sovereign nation. So, I think it's worth viewing these overnight attacks, which are happening increasingly frequently in that context. Laila?",

It was just a year ago the 22-year-old died while in the custody of Iran's morality police after being arrested for allegedly failing to wear her head scarf properly. Her death sparked months of unprecedented protests followed by a brutal crackdown by the government, in which more than 500 people were killed, according to the human rights group, Human Rights Activist News Agency. A year on, there were some daring acts of defiance, like this couple chanting, women, life, freedom, in the streets of Tehran, as drivers honked their horns in support, or these protesters blocking traffic in a Kurdish city just a few hours away from Amini's hometown. But state-affiliated media says security forces were able to quash several protests, and several people referred to as counterrevolutionaries and terrorists were arrested. Iranian journalists and rights groups say Amini's father was also briefly detained, though Iran state media denies this and says it prevented an assassination attempt on his life. Rallies to show solidarity for the people of Iran and commemorate Amini's death were held around the world in cities like Paris, Brussels, London and Berlin.

A persistent drought caused in part by the El Nino water pattern left water levels dangerously depleted. Now, the global supply chain is under threat as their holiday season approaches. The 80-kilometer waterway connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is a vital route for transporting goods, handling an estimated 5 percent of the world trade.

And if a ship carries too much cargo, it risks getting trapped in the canal.Since May, ships have had to reduce their cargo by as much as 25 percent. The Panama Canal Authority has also limited the number of vessels authorized to enter the canal each day, creating a bottleneck with some ships waiting as long as 14 days to get through. As of Tuesday, 116 vessels were waiting to pass. The canal's administrator warns the number of authorized vessels could decrease further if the drought continues into next year.",
