This is not how the organizers wanted it to go.As you rightly mentioned, these stories of these malicious attacks on the railway lines, we're seeing pictures emerging from Paris Montparnasse station with thousands of people stranded, the authorities saying, as you mentioned, these delays likely to impact the next couple of days here in Paris and across France. And this is an opening ceremony, particularly here in Paris, that they've said they wanted to bring in the people.

They say we will just have to sing in the rain. One of the big questions is who will it be singing in the rain? I don't know whether you have seen Celine Dion recently. I haven't managed to set eyes on here in Paris, but lots of suggestions that she and Lady Gaga will be performing at this unique, never seen before Olympic opening ceremony with 100 boats carrying the 206 teams along this six-kilometer journey through the River Seine.

And the irony, really, of that phrase that I said, the talk about being this an opening ceremony that is going to bring the games to the people, the security levels around Paris over the last couple of days really have been unprecedented. We know there's always heightened security around an Olympic Games. But this is the seventh Olympics that I've covered in person. I have never seen security like what we have had to deal with moving around Paris in the last couple of days. An estimated 40,000 security and police officials have been brought into the area to help keep everything safe and secure. That's, of course, the priority.

I expect her to win several gold medals, lead the U.S. to the gymnastics team gold, and Simone herself to be able to come back and win the individual all-around. But lots of pressure on her as well. And then moving to the pool, Katie Ledecky, the great Katie Ledecky, in her fourth Olympic Games. She will be swimming tomorrow morning in the women's 400 freestyle. That is one she probably will not win. But she will, the longer the races go, Kim, the better Katie Ledecky does. And the 800 meters, the 1,500 meters, those are her babies.

Listen to this.(VIDEO PLAYING) Well, that is Beyonce's song, \"Freedom.\" Now, the singer hasn't officially endorsed Harris' candidacy, but she did give the campaign permission to use the song. As our Randi Kaye reports, Kamala Harris is far from the first political candidate to use music to help shape their campaign. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (AUDIO PLAYING) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One of the best known political campaign songs of all time, \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.\" The 1840 hit sang the praises of Whig Party candidates William Henry Harrison and his running mate, John Tyler. The song referenced the site of Harrison's 1811 battle between his Indiana militia and Native Americans. For years, candidates used folk songs and show tunes before that gave way to the popular music of today, all of it setting the tone for a campaign. In 1960, Frank Sinatra changed the lyrics of one of his hit songs, \"High Hopes\", tailoring it to John F. Kennedy, the Democratic candidate for president. (AUDIO PLAYING) This was Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, with a little help from artist Neil Diamond. (VIDEO PLAYING) By 1992, Bill Clinton leaned on a hit song from 1977, \"Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\" by Fleetwood Mac, and turned it into his anthem. (VIDEO PLAYING) For Barack Obama's campaigns, it always came back to Stevie Wonder. (VIDEO PLAYING) And for Mitt Romney. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): So I'm happy to introduce a son of Detroit, a friend, a guy who makes great music, who introduces me by DVD everywhere I go, Kid Rock. KAYE (voice-over): Kid Rock's 2010 hit \"Born Free\" was his go-to song in 2012. (VIDEO PLAYING) In 2016, Rachel Platten's pop anthem, \"Fight Song,\" became the unofficial anthem of Hillary Clinton's campaign. (VIDEO PLAYING) In 2020, then-president-elect Joe Biden celebrated with Coldplay's \"Sky Full of Stars\" after he was declared the winner on November 7th. (VIDEO PLAYING) And at his inauguration, Katy Perry. (VIDEO PLAYING) More recently, President Biden had been using Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\" (VIDEO PLAYING) For years, former President Donald Trump favored songs from the Village People. (VIDEO PLAYING) Until a cease-and-desist letter from the band put an end to that. Trump's preferred entrance song, Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA.\" (VIDEO PLAYING) And at the RNC convention last week, this was Kid Rock warming up the crowd.",
