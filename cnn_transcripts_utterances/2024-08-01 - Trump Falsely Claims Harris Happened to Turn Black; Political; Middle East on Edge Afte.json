And honestly, it's such a privilege to be alive and be here to witness some of the greatest of all time in action and see them at the top of their game, which is what we've got over the last six days of action so far. We use the word legend probably too often in sports, don't we?But let's start with the pool, because Katie Ledecky is definitely one who deserves that title. She'd been disappointed with her performance in the 400m freestyle, she said, but she more than made up for it last night with the 1,500 freestyle. She set a new Olympic record. She beat the time she posted in Tokyo three years ago to claim gold by seven seconds. You almost had to readjust the camera settings to make sure they got the rest of the field in. She finished so far ahead of the rest. But it was an eighth Olympic gold medal for 27-year-old Katie Ledecky, and this is what she had to say afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATIE LEDECKY, U.S. SWIMMER: You know, any gold medal is -- it's not easy to win. So I'm just trying to appreciate it, appreciate the moment, and, I mean, I don't mean to celebrate that much, but it comes out, you know. Just the happiness and the joy, it just comes out.
