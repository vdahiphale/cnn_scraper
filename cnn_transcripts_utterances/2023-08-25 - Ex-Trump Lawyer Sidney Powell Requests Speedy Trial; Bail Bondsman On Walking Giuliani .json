      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.They've all surrendered, 19 new mug shots, for the history books, now to the next phase, trying to clear their names. We have just learned that the Kraken wants to get cracking, Sidney Powell asking for a speedy trial. Plus, the Kremlin says it's all a lie, now strongly denying Putin was behind that plane crash that presumably killed Yevgeny Prigozhin. The authorities now have their hands, on the black boxes, from the flight. We'll see what we learned from them. Also, tonight, Spain's women's soccer team, refusing to play, as the country's soccer chief is refusing to resign, all over that unwanted kiss, at the World Cup. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. All of the mug shots are now in. Now comes the legal maneuvering. Tonight, former Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell, is seeking a speedy trial, according to a new court filing. That makes her the second of the 19 defendants, in the Georgia election interference case, to do so. She of course, is the one, who's promoted those unhinged stolen election conspiracy theories, like the one, about Hugo Chavez, rigging the U.S. election, from his grave. Obviously, this move comes after we just saw another former Trump attorney, Kenneth Chesebro, who also requested a speedy trial. And he might just get it. The judge responded with an October 2023 trial date. As for Donald Trump, his legal team is taking the exact opposite approach. And they want to push the trial, back as far as possible. Meanwhile, Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has served notice, she's prepared to start turning over a trove of evidence to defendants' attorneys, exactly three weeks from now, September 15th. That comes as Willis is really facing her first big test, in this entire case, on Monday, when a hearing is going to be held, over Mark Meadows' request, to move his case, from a state court to a federal one. It is almost certainly going to look like a mini trial, before the real trials get started. Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, has been subpoenaed to testify, along with his former lead investigator, during the 2020 election. Their testimony is likely to center around Trump's infamous find-me-enough-votes phone call, in which he pressured Raffensperger, to help him find votes that didn't exist, so he could stay in power. Meadows, of course, was, Trump's Chief of Staff, at the time. He was on that call. And he is facing charges in part because of his participation in it. I'm joined tonight by Michael Moore, the former U.S. Attorney, for the Middle District of Georgia; and CNN Legal Analyst, Carrie Cordero. Michael, let me start with you. Because, Sidney Powell is now asking for this speedy trial. Trump has been pushing back when others have asked for that. Obviously, they each have a right, to when they want to have those trials happen. But how could this entire case be affected, if Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell both get these speedy trials? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, PARTNER, MOORE HALL IN ATLANTA: I'm glad to be with you, tonight. Georgia has a unique statute. It's called the Speedy Trial Act. And it essentially holds the prosecutor's feet to the fire, when a defendant asks their case be tried, when they're indicted, like the State gets one additional term of court. And in Fulton County, that means that they get an additional two months. So, that would place this trial sometime before October, so that the prosecutor had no choice, but to schedule it, and the court had no choice to schedule, because if the trial is not held by then, then the case is automatically judged an acquittal. So, that's a problem, for the State, in this case. I don't think there's any possible way the other defendants will be ready. I think it's probably smart on Chesebro's behalf, to go ahead and move forward. I don't know how he'll feel about being joined with Ms. Powell. But I imagine there are other defendants, who will be glad, to have those cases move first, so they can watch the case. They'll learn what the witnesses say. They'll see what the evidence is. They'll get to read how a jury reacts to the arguments that are made. They'll get to hear the arguments, surrounding attorney advice, in this case. And so, that's -- those cases will go quick. They will not finish quickly. It'll be a long case. There'll be a ton of issues that come up. But I think what it does it delays everything else. But, of course, all this hinges, frankly, on the hearing that we see, coming forth, on Monday, in federal court, and whether or not the cases are removed. It may make some of this a moot point.",

Some are going to want to go slow.But I do wonder, Kaitlan, the D.A.'s office has other matters to bring, if they're going to have to be doing some of the trials early, some of the trials later. They're going to be stretched thin. And at the same time, they're going to have all of the resources of the former President, and his team, making motions, to try to delay things as long as they can.",

      "sentences": "A much stronger argument. I imagine if Mr. Eastman tries to have his case, transferred, that clip will be played back, at some point, in court.I mean, the statute to remove a case, or transfer a case, to a federal court, is really about having federal executives, federal employees, who have actions brought against them, criminal actions, or civil actions, having a right to have the case moved. And so, talks about their duties, talks about their job, talks about the things they do, in the normal course. It's a pretty low bar. They've got to make a plausible argument and have a plausible claim that they were doing something connected with their employee -- employment. And so, here, you've got Meadows, who said, \"Look, I'm doing the task of a Chief of Staff. I've been asked to make telephone calls. I've been asked to schedule meetings. I've been asked to do whatever the President asked me to do.\" And that is, in fact, what the job of the Chief of Staff is. The President will say, \"I am the President of the United States. I'm the Executive. And under Article II, I'm required to enforce the laws of Congress. And there are things, like the Voting Rights Act. The Federal Election Commission is under my purview. The Department of Justice and enforcing that election laws is under my purview.\" And that gives him a claim. Now, whether or not the judge will agree with that? I don't know. But if there was ever a case, that would be transferred, because the Chief -- because of that Executive, federal employee, could, is there anyone more Executive than the President of the United States? And these counts, 154 of the 157 acts that the prosecutor alleges, in her indictment, were acts committed, during the time that Trump was the sitting President of the United States. And so, there'll be a compelling case to be made to transfer. I don't think it will feel fit to everybody. The question, at the end of the day, we just don't know the answer to this right now, is will there be an inclination, by the court, or even by the prosecutor to ask, that the whole thing can be transferred, if some are successful, so that she can put the case all at one time. COLLINS: I mean, Carrie, given what Michael just laid out, that, Monday seems to be pretty significant, for the future of all of these, potentially, what happens in Mark Meadows' hearing?",

He felt humiliated. I mean, Ivan did the right -- described it well. When Prigozhin mounted that mutiny? That was a direct threat to Putin. That was a direct challenge. Just before the mutiny, Prigozhin said this whole war against Ukraine was a lie that Putin had been lied to, the generals were incompetent, that there were no Nazis hidden, and gave -- there was no threat to Russia, from Ukraine.
