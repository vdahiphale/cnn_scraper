You can see just how many cancellations we're talking about; 63 percent of Southwest flights, that's how many they have canceled just today. Most of it was done last night. We're talking about 2,500 flights. And the bad news is, they have already went ahead and canceled nearly that same number for tomorrow, the airline telling me it could be days of this, where they're only able to fly roughly a third of their flights. And take a look here. This is the reality for thousands of passengers, these long, brutal lines where they are just waiting to get rebooked. For those who are calling the airline, some are sitting on hold for hours just trying to get some answers. But the reality is, many won't be able to be rebooked for days. Now, the airline, Southwest, has blamed largely winter weather for the issue, saying that, after that major storm last week, flight crews ended up stranded in the wrong city all over the country. But the reality is, Southwest is the only major U.S. airline dealing with these mass cancellations. And the head of the pilots union for Southwest says, this is not about winter weather. This is about outdated processes and outdated I.T. at Southwest. And in a note, in a memo from the CEO of Southwest sent out on Christmas obtained by CNN, he actually acknowledged that they're dealing with some of these issues and the need to modernize. So, now the Department of Transportation is getting involved in this, trying to look at whether or not Southwest really needed to make all these cancellations. But, look, in the short term, that is not going to make things any easier for thousands of these passengers who have been stranded. Some are trying to get home. Some are still trying to see their loved ones for the holiday and get at least what days they can with their family members. But the reality is, they're stuck trying to get rebooked without answers -- Abby.",

Lyn Montgomery is the president of the Transportation Workers Union Local 556. Lyn, there is more than weather at play here, despite the fact that Southwest is just telling folks that this is about the storm. Other airlines aren't experiencing the same volume of cancellations. And you have said that this is about management. How have they failed customers and their employees here? LYN MONTGOMERY, PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTATION WORKERS UNION LOCAL 556: This is a deep failure of management not to have supported its I.T. infrastructure.

I think that that's the point that the party has reached right now, in terms of -- we have seen in cases where members have done other things, like they appeared at white nationalist conferences, or they have made repeated racist statements, and Kevin McCarthy has decided not to hold them responsible, has actually said that he would reinstate members like that on their committees when they regain control.
