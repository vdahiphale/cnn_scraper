We're going to see some questions that go to this issue of consent and things that she may have said that they believe could harm Trumps reputation. In the past she has never suggested that this was not a consensual encounter. But during her testimony, she kind of raised that possibility without directly saying it. Also in her recent documentary she raises the possibility that somehow this was not completely consensual. She compares it to sexual abuse that she survived as a nine-year-old. So, this is something that they were a little surprised by and they want to revisit. But the cross- examination you're going to see today, it's not necessarily material to the case, right. She can't speak to the actual charges at the heart of this. Instead, this is sort of focused on the clients and reputational repair. Now, Daniels has walked to the witness stand. Trump did not glance over at her table. But we do expect that she will probably wrap up at some point today.

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, as she gets ready to testify for her second day, let's go through some key takeaways from Stormy Daniels' first day testimony.First of all, on direct examination, Stormy Daniels detailed for the jury how she met Donald Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament, and she testified she ended up having sex with him in his hotel room at a time when he was married. Now, here's how this becomes relevant to the prosecution's charges in this case. Fast-forward ten years, October 2016, we're a month before the election, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape comes out. Hope Hicks testified that that caused the Trump campaign to go into a panic. While they're panicked, Stormy Daniels and her lawyer come forward with the allegations about the 2006 incident. And ultimately what happens is Michael Cohen pays Stormy Daniels $130,000 in exchange for a hush money agreement that she will not speak publicly. Cohen later is reimbursed for that payment by Donald Trump and the Trump Organization. And then, of course, we get to the election a couple weeks later. That's the key timeframe for this trial. Also during Stormy Daniels' testimony we saw some crucial documents, including the actual hush money agreement signed by Peggy Peterson, that's an alias, a fake name that Stormy Daniels used. And then David Dennison actually not signed, but we heard testimony that that's Donald Trump. Now, her cross-examination has already started. The very first question Donald Trump's team asked Stormy Daniels when she began her cross-examination right out of the chute, am I correct that you hate President Trump? Stormy Daniels answered straight up, yes, she does. That will be a continued theme of today's cross-examination. The -- Trump's lawyers also confronted Stormy Daniels with some of her prior tweets, including one where she said, \"I won't walk, I'll dance down the street when he is selected to go to jail.\" Stormy Daniels actually laughed about that in front of the jury. It didn't seem to go over well. Again, they will talk about this type of motivation during today's cross. And, Donald Trump's team today, expect them to confront Stormy Daniels with some of her prior inconsistent statements, including a signed statement from January 2018 when she wrote, \"I am not denying this affair because I was paid hush money. I am denying this affair because it never happened.\" So, Anderson, watch for this continued theme on cross-examination today. They're going to try to suggest Stormy Daniels has bad motives and she's made inconsistent statements in the past. As her testimony resumes, Anderson, we'll throw it back to you and Kaitlan and Paula to tell us what's going on in the court.",

She cannot speak to the falsifying of business records. So, her value to the prosecutors I don't think was really undermined in the cross-examination.But her credibility certainly was. And look, she's not the number one priority for the defense team here, right? The number one priority for this defense team, most of their energy, most of their attention is on the cross-examination of Michael Cohen. And this is the trailer, right?

Remember, she thought at one point she would lose the leverage to actually get paid if he was already in office.

Remember, this is really about the documents. And, of course, Necheles is now challenging Daniels that it was her choice to sign the NDA and brokered that deal with Michael Cohen through her lawyer.

A statement about running out of time and wanting to get out in that deadline of the election is actually quite helpful, frankly, to the prosecution to suggest that there was a timeline in store. But this is what Necheles wants to do. She wants to focus on Stormy asa purported extortionist, that she only had money on the brain.

If the jury believes her, that's crucial to the prosecution's case, that there was this extramarital sex in 2006.

He hasn't had any noticeable reaction to the testimony so far today. Judge Juan Merchan asked to see the transcript of audio. Paula Reid, what have we -- during the commercial break, what -- what -- they've basically been trying to just put dents in Stormy Daniels' story and apply she's in this for the money.",

The case is charged as a felony because they argued Trump wanted to suppress this story to help his odds in the election. So, that is what they're getting at here.

Number one, she lays out there the fact that Donald Trump had a great motivation for keeping her quiet, which she -- by describing her encounter with him. But, of course, the defense has also now established that, a, she hates him, b, she was hurt financially by him, and, c, she did everything she could to monetize their encounter.So, the key is Stormy Daniels, I think, is how either side handles her in cross-examination. If I were the defense, I would be arguing that this woman is purely vindictive. You can't believe a word she says. If I were the prosecution, I would be arguing it doesn't matter what she wanted, what her motivation was. She's not on trial here. Donald Trump is. It's what his motivation was. So, I think good with -- with good lawyering it cuts both ways. And you've got good lawyers here.",

And, quite frankly, you could look at it from another perspective, which is, she -- if she was this determined to monetize this contact with him, then it made it all the more important that Donald Trump shut her down before she could seriously hurt him. Now again, the question becomes, why does he want to shut her down? Is it because -- is it because he's worried about his family, or is it because he's worried he's not going to get elected. That, of course, remains to be seen as to what the jury believes his reason was, if they believe that's what he was trying to do, as opposed to Michael Cohen acting as, you know, on his own to assist his -- his boss.",

She's basically challenging the veracity of what Keith Davidson, in this recorded phone call, is telling Michael Cohen. She's saying, it sounds like Keith Davidson has sort of made this up in order to threaten Michael Cohen and pressure him.Trump is leaning forward, looking at the document on the screen in front of him. The document is the Daniels' settlement agreement from 2016 that Trump's attorney, Necheles, has put up on the screen. So, Trump's now leaning forward, looking at the settlement agreement on the screen in front of him. Judge, how long -- I mean to your point, this doesn't really get to the underlying alleged crime here. How long do you think -- how much detail do you think they really are going to try to go into with Stormy Daniels?

And there's a part of me that wonders how much of this cross- examination is now being fueled by the client. Ad I think that's a -- that's a difficult thing for lawyers who have a difficult client. And there's also a judicial perspective here. How long is Judge Merchan going to let this go on. You know, we're already on day 14. The longer trial goes, the more things that can go wrong. You know, a juror can have a kidney stone. Somebody's father could get ill. You know, there are all kinds of things that could throw a monkey wrench into this.

And in the past, when I've seen him in the civil cases engage in this kind of behavior, it's hard to rein him in. So, it's a credit to his team that they were able to do that on Tuesday. And then here it appears that he's whispering with Todd Blanche, it appears that he's -- he's doing OK, because here he believes he has an advocate, right? You have someone holding up documents to Stormy Daniels and cross-examining her story. So, again, this is not necessarily material to the case, what they are going through line by line here, but it matters to their client. And that is likely a large part of the motivation here.",
