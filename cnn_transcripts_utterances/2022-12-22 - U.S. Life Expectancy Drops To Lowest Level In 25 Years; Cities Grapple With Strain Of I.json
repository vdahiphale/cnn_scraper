So life expectancy, which usually, you know, in recent decades, just goes up, up, up, up with medical advances, with better prevention and diagnostics, instead, is going down.In other words, your life expectancy is lower than it had been the year before. So let's take a look at this report that just came out from the CDC. It looks at life expectancy last year in 2021. So they found that it was 76.4 years, that's a seven-month decrease from 2020. So a seventh month decrease, which is pretty big when you consider you're looking at the whole country. The biggest drop this is the really sad part, was among people ages 35 to 44. So these are young people who are losing their lives. The two big drivers of this decrease on it, you can probably guess it, it was COVID and drug overdoses, nearly one in eight U.S. deaths were due to COVID 19 and nearly 107,000 deaths were from drug overdoses.

So in other words, as the pandemic has been getting less and less severe, things have been getting a little bit better.So I am hoping a year from now to be sitting here saying finally life expectancy went up again.
