Plus, we are learning new details on what Kyiv knew about the strikes. Then Typhoon Mawar makes landfall. The strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory of Guam in decades. We'll have the latest. Plus, just a few hours from now, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis will make it official, throwing his hat into the ring for the Republican presidential nominee. But first, this hour, Russia is warning that it will respond harshly to any further cross-border attacks from Ukraine, calling the incursion into Belgorod a terrorist attack. It is also commenting on reports that U.S.-made military vehicles were used in the raid. Saying it's quote, \"no secret the western countries are becoming more involved in the Ukraine conflict every day.\" Well, the Kremlin blames Ukrainian militants for the incursion into Russia, even though anti-Putin Russian fighters are claiming responsibility. And while Ukraine denies involvement, we're now learning from Ukrainian defense source that Kyiv was tipped off in advance about the attacks. While Belgorod was hit by new drone strikes overnight, the regional governor says nine people were taken to hospital. Let's get more on all these developments, Frederik Pleitgen is in Kyiv for us this hour, Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. And Fred, let me start with you. So talk to us about these overnight strikes in Belgorod and how the Kremlin is responding, saying harshly, what are we expecting here?",

And we're speaking about the night the governor of Belgorod, he came out early this morning, he said it was not a calm night, as he put. Isa, there were several attempted airstrikes by unmanned aerial vehicles by drones in the Belgorod region. In one incident, a grenade was apparently dropped on a roadway late last night, that damaged a car. They said that the damage was not too extensive overnight, but over the course of the past couple of days, nine people have now ended up in hospital, and three of them are actually in ICU, the local authorities said. And you know, the Russians are saying that they are going to respond harshly to all of this into any future incursions, also, if they do happen. But they are certainly also facing a lot of criticism from the folks that are living on the ground. In fact, there were some citizens there who recorded a video message of themselves calling for the Russian authorities to give them arms so they can defend themselves, because clearly, the Russia military can't do that. Then, you have Yevgeny Prigozhin or the Wagner private military company, which of course, has been fighting very fiercely in the Bakhmut area, saying, clearly, the Russian military was not capable of defending Russia's borders. He's of course, had an ongoing feud with the Russian defense minister. And even the governor of Belgorod himself, he also says he has a lot of questions for the Russian military. So they're saying, they will respond harshly in the future, but right now, they are facing some serious questions as well. And that, of course, is something that is happening in Russia, where speaking up can get you into a lot of trouble. Nevertheless, there is a lot of public anger down in that Belgorod region. Isa.",

Had it gone right through it, we'd expect the winds to be coming in this direction. So everybody on the eastern side of the island was preparing. Western portions said, OK, we know we're OK, probably. Will be -- the storm is going to just kind of push us from the West, well, guess, it did. It actually moved farther to the north than any model expected. And now it's actually growing in size. Notice here when it moved north of Guam, there was no eye really. We could see it on radar until the radar went out because the power went out. But now, the eye is re-emerging, which means this storm is really intensifying. Now, the good news is there are miles, kilometers worth of land here, no land of water to the west of Guam for a while. But there will be things that could get in the way as the winds were gusting to 240 KPH. Two hundred and twenty right now, gusting to 270, and moving slowly only 9 kilometers per hour, which means these people were feeling this wind for hours and hours and hours, not just a passing storm that kind of came and went, the winds were just going and going and going all night long, and so was the rain. Over half a meter of rainfall reported already in some of these parts. And it's still raining. As we can tell by the radar, we could have told by the radar if there was power, but we're kind of watching these satellites, realizing where the lightning still is. So obviously, it's still raining in some spots. Flood warnings in effect, still another 100 millimeters of rainfall to go in many spots. But here is where we are now. Winds will start to die off in the overnight hours and by tomorrow morning, we'll start to see temperatures still very warm with the humidity and the storm still really intensifying out here with very warm water out there. I know we talk about the Atlantic hurricane season only starting in June. But the season out here lasts pretty much all year long because the water is so warm. But by tomorrow, the winds are down to 70. But not in the storm itself. We're at 250 here in 72 hours. And notice where this is going?

It will be during a discussion with Twitter's owner, Elon Musk. As of now DeSantis is the biggest contender to the current Republican frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. DeSantis is known for his aggressive conservative agenda on issues like guns, abortion, (INAUDIBLE) as you can see there, LGBTQ rights and education. You are looking at some of the bills that he has signed recently. He is also involved in a legal battle with one of the state's largest employers, a story we have covered here. That employer is Disney. Let's take a closer look with our senior political commentator, Scott Jennings. Scott, great to have you here. I have so many questions on this story. Let's start with what we just outlined. It does show in many ways DeSantis is more conservative than Trump. Does that help him with the Republican base? Does that take away from the Trump base? Your thoughts.",

      "sentences": "Sure. You're right. DeSantis is a proven conservative. His governing record in Florida is as of aconservative and a muscular conservative, meaning that he is using the government to go after cultural institutions that conservatives don't like, such as Disney, as you referenced. It is a new kind of conservatism. One argument he's going to make is not only is he a conservative, not only willing to talk that talk but willing to walk the walk versus Trump, who I think DeSantis will frequently argue gets distracted or isn't willing to go as far as I will. So I think that will be the contrast he will try to set up. I think that he hopes that will help him with conservative voters. Right now Trump is in a dominant position. But DeSantis has a huge war chest, a good record and a pretty good story to tell.",

They thought that he hurt the party's chances in the November midterms, which provided some disappointing results. There was a moment when Republicans were saying, OK, fine. Let's move on. But DeSantis hesitated. He went back to Florida, he did his legislative session. What did Trump do? He launched his campaign and tried to win the nomination and it obviously showed. So I think if DeSantis doesn't get it, we will look back on that and say he might well have missed his opportunity. That being said, he still has an excellent chance. He has a ton of money. This is what campaigns are for. So there is a chance. But certainly Trump is better today than he was in January, just by the polling. That's fairly obvious.",

You're going to see all these non Trump candidates fighting with each other, hoping that one emerges by the time we get to the Iowa caucus or the New Hampshire primary. DeSantis has to do the same thing. He's just in a much more dominant position over the Haleys of the world.

Ron DeSantis also seems to be trying to thumb his nose in the face of Trump. Twitter used to be Trump's platform of choice. So making this announcement here, he seems to be trying to pick up on that. For Twitter, it is also really interesting move in the short term. Certainly, Elon Musk is really happy about this. This is going to draw big eyeballs to Twitter. Musk has been trying to position Twitter as a place for more increasingly right wing characters and for conversations happening outside of mainstream media. Something that Ron DeSantis also probably finds attractive. I think the biggest variable here, perhaps, is whether Twitter's platform can technically handle this many people. We've seen in a number of cases since Musk took over the platform that the actual Twitter infrastructure has a hard time handling it when there are too many eyeballs on it. If the platform struggles to stay functioning, struggles to stay up as this is happening, this is going to be a real big problem for both sides.",
