      "sentences": "-- classified documents case.Plus, four hours a day, Israel has now agreed to humanitarian pauses, in Gaza, to let civilians move, to safer ground, and let aid in. The question is could it also provide a breakthrough on getting hostages out? The CIA Director is having secret meetings, in the Middle East. And a political earthquake, rocking Washington, tonight, as Senator Joe Manchin has announced he is not going to seek re-election, leaving a blue seat open in a deeply red state. Does it also open a door, to run against President Biden? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We start with two exclusives, for you, tonight. We have the first CNN interview, with former President Trump's former lawyer, who quit the classified documents case, over this summer. And it comes on a night, when CNN has learned who could be testifying, against Donald Trump, in that very trial. The potential witness list, according to multiple sources, and what they've told CNN, could include some of the people who were working, at Mar-a-Lago, a plumber, a chauffeur, a maid, a woodworker, other Mar-a-Lago staffers, including some, who still work there. Plus, contract workers, Secret Service agents, former Intelligence officials, as well as people, who were in the room, with Trump, when he was caught on that audio tape, referencing a secret Military document that was about plans, potential plans, to bomb Iran. These potential witnesses have already spoken, to federal investigators. And some, of course, can provide firsthand accounts, of what they saw, at Mar-a-Lago, where we know hundreds of classified documents were found, including dozens that were marked as \"Top Secret.\" They were found in places like Trump's bathroom, his bedroom, a ballroom, and yes, a storage room. There's a woodworker, who installed crown molding in Trump's bedroom, in February 2022. According to three sources, that person noticed papers that may have been classified. There's also the maid, who cleaned at Trump's bedroom suite, one source telling CNN that the former President went quote, \"Ballistic,\" when he learned that she had been asked to speak with investigators. There's also a chauffeur, who drove around visitors, including foreigners and VIP guests, at the club, and many, many others, in this new reporting tonight. Joining me now, on this new reporting, and much more, for his first CNN interview, since he left the Trump legal team, over the summer, in this classified documents case, Jim Trusty. Thank you so much, for being here, Jim. It's good to have you back on the show. I mean, just when you hear this reporting, and what CNN has learned about the potential witnesses, that Jack Smith's team could call, do you have any concerns, about what kind of testimony they could potentially provide?",

I mean, it's just astounding, how when it comes to Mar- a-Lago, and I point towards DOJ, for a lot of this, because it helps them more than it would ever help President Trump, that all of this stuff gets aired publicly. Meanwhile, up in Delaware, it's radio silence.But in terms of the witnesses, look, I will just say this. I got to meet a lot of really nice folks, salt of the earth, good people, hard- working people, down in the Mar-a-Lago scene. They were aggressively, really intimidated by the Department of Justice, and the FBI. We have a decent idea, or I had a decent idea of a lot of what they would have to say, not necessarily across the board. But I'd say it's kind of thing, where Kaitlan, you could drive by Mar- a-Lago, on your way to the beach, and you'd get a subpoena. So, we had people that were literally with almost no information, being told to go to the FBI, threatened to go to Washington --",

I'll certainly be one of the people that calls in sick, on my regular job, so I can watch a lot of it, and see how it plays out. But again, this is kind of unprecedented territory, with not just what they're charging, and the Presidential Records Act, and all the issues that arise, from criminalizing this stuff. But the level of aggressivity, telling witnesses, for instance, this has been publicly reported, \"Give me the password to your computer, or I'm going to drag you up to D.C. in three days, and you'll have to do it in front of the grand jury,\" I mean, this is heavy-handed stuff that's unlike anything, I saw, in my 17 years, at the Department of Justice.",

I mean, Trump employee number four, Yuscil Taveras just recently resigned, we are told, and Trump was not happy when he found out that he was still working at the club. But he was someone, Jim, who had a Trump-paid attorney, and then changed to a non-Trump-paid attorney, and he changed his testimony.

And so, look, paying for attorneys means nothing. The reality, the backstory, the truly horrific, in terms of what this purported conflict was, it revolves around that witness, is that the Department of Justice cannot stand Stanley Woodward, one of the attorneys in this case, because Stanley blew the whistle, on a DOJ official, essentially extorting him, over a pending judgeship, to flip Walt Nauta. I mean, that's been publicly reported. That is a dark moment, in DOJ history, that they want to gloss over, and then go after all the attorneys, saying there's something wrong with attorneys, either representing multiple clients, or sharing information.",

We certainly, as lawyers, would obviously look into questions of whether there's things that happen, after the substantive offenses that could relate to obstruction, or attempted obstruction. It's not something that any lawyer takes lightly. So, I don't want it to sound like I kind of gloss over it. But to me, it's really clear that a political decision was made, by a very politicized department, that the best thing they have going, to try to distinguish President Trump's possession of documents, from then-Vice President Biden's, is to suggest that somehow obstruction is the difference. And that's been a narrative, on this network and others, that somehow \"Well, you know, why they're different? Because of all the obstruction.\" Now, we don't get any leaks out of Delaware. But we get plenty of leaks, down here, that relate to these different witnesses, like the one you're just talking about, or Walt Nauta, all to suggest that somehow there was obstruction.

I don't think that they're scrambling.That they have a map, and they're looking at that map. And they've got some incredible incumbents that they're willing to hold. That's first and foremost, to hold those incumbents. But they're looking to expand them out. They're looking at Texas. They're looking at Florida. Those will be tough races to try to unseat incumbent Republicans. But it's not impossible. We have seen things happen before. So, I don't think anybody's scrambling. I think they're just going to double down on their efforts, especially to protect their incumbents that they've got that are going to be in tough races. But the elections, this week, and the elections in 2022, I think, give everybody hope that the Senate will remain in control of the Democrats.",

The numbers are just not there.You can get out, and you can try to mobilize, and you can get people talking in the middle. But the middle is going to be in the Democratic Party. It is certainly not going to be in the Republican Party. But look, what's happened. Look at the elections just the other night, with Andy Beshear, in Kentucky. Look what happened in Virginia. Those are middle-of-the-road voters. That's where the Democratic Party is. Maybe a little center-left for sure, and we've got certainly people in the far-left in our party. But you know if he wants to really have an effect, he could help Democrats, across this country, bring the moderates, back into the fold, and do some things. At the end of the day, Joe Manchin doesn't want to lose.

KATE PHILLIPS-BARRASSO, GLOBAL VP OF POLICY &amp; ADVOCACY, MERCY CORPS: Yes, we do have 70 staff, inside Gaza. And the situation that my colleagues are facing there is unfathomable. As you heard, in those audio clips, they are facing everything, from fear, of being hit by aerial bombardment, to extreme situations, in trying to procure water, and food, which is dwindling down to almost nothing, to facing medical situations. One of my colleagues has an epileptic brother, and he only has eight days of pills left. And they're rationing those, because they just don't know where this is all going to end. So, what I can say is, they have all been displaced, all 70 of them. Several of them have had immediate family members killed. And some of them have been injured. So, it's an extremely difficult situation to hear about. And we fear for the worst, for our colleagues, and Gaza.",
