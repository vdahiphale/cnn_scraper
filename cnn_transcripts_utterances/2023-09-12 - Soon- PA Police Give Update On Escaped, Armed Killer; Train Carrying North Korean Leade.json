Police now say to Danelo Cavalcante, the inmate who escaped from a Pennsylvania prison two weeks ago, is now armed. Sources tell CNN affiliate that a man who fits the description of Cavalcante stole a gun and that shots were fired last night. This amid the latest sighting of a fugitive in South Coventry Township.Our affiliate's report that the stolen weapon is a 22 caliber rifle. There were also reports that shoes believe to be Cavalcante's were found overnight. Armored vehicles and heavily armed officers quickly swarmed the scene. Police have called nearby residents warning them to stay inside with their doors locked. It is the latest sighting of Cavalcante over his 13 days now on the run. Moments from now, police are set to hold a news conference to update us all on the case. CNN's Danny Freeman has been following these developments for us throughout since the manhunt really began. Danny, give us some sense of what's going on there behind you and what police are saying about how dangerous he has become now.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Sara. I mean, just to start off, this was the update that so many feared for so many days. Danelo Cavalcante now armed and still on the loose.Now where we are right now, we're at Ridge Road and Route 100. We're really at the corner of this now expanding perimeter just outside of South Coventry Township, where police are really throwing everything at Cavalcante at this point. We have seen armored vans, we just saw two trailers full of police horses taken into the search perimeter. We've seen officers behind me with long guns, they're searching cars, they're opening trucks. You can tell there's an enormous presence right now, an all-out push to capture this escaped inmate. But I want to tell you exactly how we got to this point because, Sara, you might remember yesterday was really a relatively quiet day when it comes to the manhunt. Law enforcement was focused on this area called East Nantmeal Township. It was about 20 miles north of the Chester County Prison. It's a small community. But importantly, it was the area where Cavalcante was said to have ditched his stolen dairy farm van that he stole over the weekend. Well, later last night, though, that low-key profile completely changed. We saw a flurry of police activity. We saw police vehicles flying up Pottstown Pike, one the main roads here. We saw helicopters surrounding this area again in South Coventry right behind me. And then a few things happened. First, Chester County alerted that there was a shooting in East Nantmeal around 10:10 p.m. last night in the area of Coventryville Road and Ridge Road. Remember, we're on Ridge Road right now. Police then confirmed to CNN at around 10:24 last night that there was a confirmed sighting of Cavalcante. Then that reverse 911 call went up to folks in the South Coventryville Township community advising citizens to lock their doors, lock their windows, because at that time, they said Cavalcante may be in the area and he may be armed. Well then, Sara, overnight at around 1:45 in the morning, Pennsylvania State Police confirmed that Cavalcante is armed and they're searching this area. So this perimeter is about 4.5 miles north of the area where Cavalcante is said to have ditched that van that I mentioned earlier. So police were right what they said yesterday that Cavalcante was still in Chester County, still in areas where they were searching but they were not able to get their hands on them at this time. Sara, this really is the nightmare scenario that he finally has his hands on a weapon but we're hoping to learn more about what exactly happened last night to lead to this presence at a press conference like you said at 9:30.

Roberts High School and middle school. One of the main high schools in this area. They announced it earlier this morning, they have closed all of their schools out of an abundance of caution, as you can see, because there is just so much police presence while this search is happening so close to that campus.We also know the Downingtown Area School District, they said school activities will be contained to indoors. But listen, there's a lot of concern. We've been speaking to people who have come out to this gas station were perched up who just want to see what's going on behind us. And I got to tell you, the concern is high, but the residents here, they're ready for Cavalcante to be caught. Sara?",

There's new video showing Kim arriving at a Russian train station. Kim is expected to meet with Vladimir Putin with his top party leaders, members of the government and armed forces at his side. U.S. officials have been warning that an arms deal could be on the table. Putin needs more ammunition and shells for his war on Ukraine. North Korea is short on cash and food. And after two decades of sanctions, the deal could give Pyongyang's nuclear capable ballistic missile program a boost. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us from Seoul in South Korea.

In fact, we do have new video of Kim Jong-un in Russia.This is the station of Khasan, which is in Russia getting off the train, meeting with Russian officials. According to state run media TASS, they say that the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources came to meet him as he crossed into Russia. Now according to the defense ministry here in Seoul, he actually crossed into Russia in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It's now about 10:00 p.m. on Tuesday. So a good 12 hours ago, this is expected to be. And he is heading north. This train he's on is pretty slow at the speculation that he may not be going to Vladivostok, but to somewhere a little further north Vostochny where there is a Space Launch Center. We've already heard from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, that he will be going to this area saying he has his own agenda there, not specifying that that is where he'll be meeting Kim Jong-un. But it is certainly what the speculation is. And of course, the fact that it is a Space Launch Center is significant. U.S. officials have told CNN, they believe that satellite technology could be one of the benefits that North Korea might get if they were to agree to an arms deal with Russia. John?",

She's now a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. It's good to see you. Thanks so much for coming in.What worries you most about this potential partnership and arms deal between Russia and North Korea? What do you see most that worries you? ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER FOR RUSSIA: Well, most immediately, we know that Russia has after more ammunition, which it sorely needs in its confrontation with Ukraine. And we know that North Korea has a ready supply of that ammunition. And so first and foremost, it enables Russia to sustain its war in Ukraine. And we know that Vladimir Putin is looking to fight a long war in Russia. But I think more importantly than that, I worry most about not what North Korea can give to Russia, but what Russia can give to North Korea. And as the previous commentator was talking about, we know that North Korea is after technology, they're after missile technology. They're after Russian capabilities that can help North Korea with its nuclear powered submarines. And so, as Russia is getting more desperate because of its war in Ukraine, the more it's going to be willing to give away. And so this war really, by making Russia more desperate, is amplifying the other challenges that United States faces in North Korea, but also places like Iran and China. So it is amplifying the global threats that the United States is facing.",

He spoke with ABC's Martha Raddatz in a new interview, and I want to play what he said when asked how serious this potential partnership, this potential arms deal is. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: It was previously that North Korea was dependent upon Russia or China for support. And now because of the war in Ukraine, Russia is having all kinds of challenges. It looks to me as if Putin has gone to North Korea with tin cup in hand asking for weapons, munitions and support which is an inverse of their previous relationship, which is pretty fascinating.

What do you think of that?KENDALL-TAYLOR: Yes, I think that's right. So it does -- you know, if there's not a lot that North Korea can really do for Russia. And so again, it's really the inverse that we worry about that Russia is amplifying the North Korea challenge. And as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said, they're going -- you know, North Korea has newfound leverage in this relationship. And the thing that worries me too, is that, you know, Russia historically has been a productive actor on North Korea, they've passed sanctions, they've generally implemented sanctions on North Korea in large part because they perceived that there were geopolitical advantages in advocating non-proliferation. Well, now that Russia is such a rogue actor, I worry a lot that then it's not -- it's no longer we'll see those advantages. And it's going to be much more willing to do things that it wouldn't previously have done.",

The second thing they can do in addition to declassifying this intelligence is to really try to pressure other countries and in particular, China, which may have more leverage in the situation to try to put the brakes on the relationship. But the United States itself, I think, given that both countries are so heavily sanctioned already have limited tools.",

And that's what the sort of goal has been for a long time.Now, he has to balance these 20 to 25, who are always agitating against the broader interests of the National Republican Party. Senate Republicans want to know what nothing to do with an impeachment inquiry. Even some of the most conservative senators, people like Tommy Tuberville have expressed no interest in impeachment inquiry. But then on the other hand, his far-right flank are saying, if you don't do an impeachment inquiry, then we're not going to vote to keep the government open. And once the government does shut down, nobody knows how and when they would be able to open it back up. When would they realize that this is such a bad political play, that we can really open the thing back up and wave the flag of surrender?",

So now, you have a Senate that is moving forward, not including any of these culture war issues, spending at the exact levels that Biden- McCarthy agree to in May, and they're going to be racking up 75, 80 votes for these bills out of 100.
