Fierce fighting in Eastern Ukraine as Russian forces attempt to encircle Bakhmut. Amazon is pausing construction on its second headquarters. And the overcrowding at Schiphol Airport becomes an issue for the Courts. Coming to you live from New York, it is Friday, March 3rd, I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Moscow is closer to its first major victory in six months as Russian forces attempt to tighten their grip on the City of Bakhmut. Last night, Russian forces blew up a bridge along the last main supply route. The head of the Kremlin's private army, the Wagner Group says the city is now all but surrounded. Yevgeny Prigozhin posted this video on social media calling on Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to withdraw his troops. The Ukrainian Commander in Bakhmut says his reconnaissance unit has already been told to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): In the middle of the night, the Madyar Birds Unit received a combat order to immediately leave Bakhmut for a new place of combat operations. We are following the order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are some four to five thousand civilians who are under an evacuation order in the city, that mission getting called off because a bridge was bombed on a major artery on the way out of the city. This bridge bombed according to a soldier in Bakhmut by a large Russian missile on the main supply route that Ukrainian forces are using to get to and from the frontline. That supply route leaving the town of Chasiv Yar. We were just there on Thursday. We saw all kinds of military vehicles bombing to and from the front, that is the only road that Ukrainian forces have left to get to the frontline. Now, if they want to pull back or evacuate people or supply those troops, they're going to have to use dirt roads, cross muddy fields that is very difficult, only certain types of vehicles can do it and they leave themselves extremely exposed. Ukrainian forces are surrounded in Bakhmut on three sides, to the south, to the east, and to the north. They are being encircled by those Russian forces. We did hear from the head of the Wagner Forces on the Russian side, they are the ones who have been leading that fight for Russia, the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, calling on President Zelenskyy to pull his troops out, saying that they are encircling the Ukrainian troops and that will be complete in the next one or two days. At the same time, we have seen the head of Ukrainian military forces in the eastern part of the country, visiting those troops in Bakhmut in the frontline, a sign that Ukraine intends to keep fighting for the City of Bakhmut knowing that if it falls, it will be a major victory for the Russian side after months of very bloody fighting and that Russia would try to use the city as a jumping off point to Drive Deeper Into Eastern Ukraine.

There are 48 children amongst them as well. And I think one of the questions for the Ukrainian military will be once they've withdrawn, since what we're talking about is the time that it will take for Bakhmut to fall, I don't think there's any question at this stage about whether it will given the numbers of far more experienced Wagner mercenaries and regular forces that have been piled in; however fiercely the Ukrainians have tried to defend it over the course of the last few weeks. Once that withdrawal has happened and the Russians have moved westwards as they've begun to and you heard Alex there a moment ago as well, inevitably further westward, the question I think will be was the sacrifice worth it? We don't know how many Ukrainian soldiers have lost their lives. We know that the battle has been extremely fierce. Now, on the positive side for the Ukrainians, what it has done is focus so much of the attention, the firepower, the manpower of the Russian forces, that elsewhere along that extremely long frontline, Ukrainian forces have been able to regroup. The question is when they'll launch their next counteroffensive and whether they'll manage to do so as successfully as they did the last two, in August and September. But it is a grim fate tonight that awaits Bakhmut. For the time being, Ukrainian soldiers say that they continue to defend it, Zain, and they will do until they get the order to retreat.",

It's become, of course, a symbol now of Russian determination, but it is also an importantsymbol of Ukrainian resilience and that is what it has become over the course of the last few months. It has allowed them to gain time as they regrouped elsewhere, but it's also allowed them vis-a-vis their Western partners to show in a very graphic and very important in the sense that the world's media has been watching this for some time battle. What they were lacking, what more they needed, to show the desperation of their fight and that has allowed them as well to explain and argue for the extra ammunition, the extra backing, the extra help. And of course, they've made even at the center of Bakhmut their arguments about the F-16 central. Now, Washington has drawn the line at the F-16 fighter jets, but these are also important battles because they remind the outside world of what's going on, on the ground, and the desperate fight for Ukraine to try and hold its own. On the other hand, it is also genuinely about preventing Russian forces from moving further in and this is what one Ukrainian Commander said to us. He said, look, if Bakhmut falls, they will move westward and westward and westward, and before you know it, they'll be back in Kyiv. So on the ground, it is important that they put up the battle every step of the way. The question is what resources they have and how they distribute them along that frontline. And of course, there are different assessments about whether or not Bakhmut should have been defended as fiercely as it did. It has certainly attracted the world's attention to what was happening there. The high cost though, is likely to be paid by the civilians that are left -- Zain.",

But the question, of course, in Germany and in the United States is, how do these populations where fatigue is growing for this war, how do you maintain that support? And that is something that these two leaders really did want to talk about, face-to-face, really get in the weeds of what the next phase of this war will look like, and I think when you look at the atmospherics that are surrounding this meeting, there is no State Dinner, there is no joint press conference, there was no sort of grand arrival ceremony. This is a business-like meeting where business was going to be conducted, and that is the business that they wanted to talk about, which is what it looks like going forward. Of course, Chancellor Scholz has been discussing this idea of providing Ukraine with security guarantees. He has been talking about it with the French President Emmanuel Macron, and the idea is really to bring these two sides to the negotiating table in a way that they really aren't now. There is really no talk of a negotiated settlement at this point, and that is something that I think he will want to raise with President Biden who has not necessarily weighed in on that idea yet, raising this idea with him sort of socializing it, coming to some sort of agreement about where they think that that track of the war, the diplomatic track of the war should head. But really, the question of how does this sustained support, particularly in the United States where there is growing concern about what the American Congress will be willing to provide going ahead, that is something that I think is concerning for a lot of European leaders when they look at, you know, people like President Trump or the other Republican candidates who are now getting into the race talking about how President Biden is not paying enough attention to the issues at home. Will the American presidential election that's coming in two years and the Republican primary that will precede it, will that sort of preface a change in the American approach to Ukraine, some of those dynamics are also at play in Europe. So as this war enters a second year, that is something that both of these leaders will want to discuss, sort of come up with a plan to ensure that the support for Ukraine will be sustained as it endures this very bitter fighting that they expect in the next couple of months -- Zain.",

That continues. We're seeing the technology sector, because many IT programmers, they are pretty much set at home and when there is a curfew, they continue to work and we've seen even that sector picking up. But you know, as I say, you know, 31 percent have had their companies, plants, and facilities damaged. We saw as the Russians came in through the north, they tried to come into Kyiv. They didn't succeed. But it's the companies like Coca-Cola, and they've -- the Coca-Cola facility, the Coca-Cola plant in Northern Kyiv, that has been rebuilt, it continues to operate. And not only is the plant operating, but the company rebuilt, reconstructed a kindergarten and nursery for the local community. So it is really sort of a business community coming together supporting the people of Ukraine and we have seen that some especially with President Biden when he visited Kyiv last week, a year ago, sort of the American, the State Department saying, you know, people should leave Ukraine; now, we've got the President Biden coming to Ukraine. And so you know, it is -- Ukraine is open for business and we encourage companies to come to do business in Ukraine today.

So just to give you a sense of how vast the second phase was, Zain, PenPlace as you say, it would include 3.3 million square feet of office and retail space, three 22-story buildings, 100,000 square feet of retail space, and more than two and a half acres of public space for international viewers, all of this as HQ2 happening in Arlington, Virginia which is about five miles outside of the nation's capital of Washington, DC. So Amazon has said that this announcement today does not have anything to do with those layoffs that you mentioned, Zain, But I do think it's important to think about the context in which they are happening. Amazon again announcing those 18,000 people being laid off, also coming of course in the midst of slowing consumer demand, and also coming as remote work remains a force, perhaps to the frustration of many managers around the country and around the world. And again, the slowing consumer demand. So you have companies like Amazon, suddenly trying to figure out how do they continue to grow, while demand is also slowing. Andy Jassy, Zain during the last earnings call in February, February 2nd, saying on a call -- on the earnings call, \"We're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments.\" So Zain, after decades of these tech companies just growing, growing, growing, suddenly they have to think about the environment in which they're in, and efficiency and costs, and that is what you're seeing here.",

Remote work being one reason, slowing consumer spending, but also a slowing advertising environment. You think about those comments that Satya Nadella of Microsoft made, I believe it was in Davos earlier this year, of normalizing demand, of needing to become more efficient, thinking about how to become more lean.

They're hoping to overturn a plan to cap the number of flights at Schiphol Airport, saying itwould hurt them, the economy and travelers. The government lowered the cap in June of last year as Schiphol was struggling with operational problems. The Dutch government responded to the suit in a statement to CNN saying stakeholders were invited to comment on the regulation and that they are committed to reducing the number of flights. Simon Calder is the travel correspondent at The Independent. He joins us live now. So, part of the issue in terms of why Schiphol Airport did this, that limiting the number of flights is partly because of carbon emissions and also noise pollution. Before we get to the lawsuit, let's just talk about how big of a problem that is in and around Amsterdam in and around Schiphol Airport.",

So, considering the population of the Netherlands, it is incredibly busy. And of course, this is in a very crowded nation. And really, wherever you are in this area south of the city of Amsterdam, close to the cities of Harlem and of Leiden, there is going to be noise impact. Now they do what they can to mitigate it in terms of having aircraft approach from the sea, for example. But ultimately, the wind decides what the flying patterns are going to be. And exactly as you say, this was nine months ago. And at the time, a number of big European airports including Amsterdam, Schiphol, including Frankfurt, including London, Heathrow were having real problems with resources. And so, you had a reduction in the number of flights. But everyone thought, oh, well, that's just a short-term thing. But then the Dutch government comes along and says, yes, we are going to cut the theoretical maximum from 500,000 operations a year to 440,000. That's an eight percent drop because we believe we've got to bear in mind, not just the local issues caused by noise, but also, of course, the global issues caused by aviation emissions.",
