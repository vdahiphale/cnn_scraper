Afoiled plot to kill President-elect Donald Trump, the DOJ charges three people over an alleged Iranian-backed plan. Plus, the Biden administration set to allow American military contractors to deploy to Ukraine. This as Hungary's President says it's obvious Ukraine faces military defeat. Plus, violent clashes in Amsterdam, targeting Israeli football fans. Police now investigating the anti-Semitic attacks. Amsterdam's mayor condemning what is a dark day. We being with breaking news. The U.S. Justice Department is charging three people accused of a newly-exposed Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump before the presidential election. Two of the three men charged were arrested in New York. They made their first appearance in federal court Thursday. U.S. officials say the third man charged in the case is still at large in Iran. CNN's Zach Cohen is following the story and joins us now. Zach, good to have you with us. So, three charged, two are taken into custody, one still at large. What are you learning?",

And two of those individuals that you mentioned, we do know that they were Americans, and prosecutors say that they were specifically asked to surveil an Iranian dissident living in New York, essentially providing information about her whereabouts with the intention of ultimately helping carry out an assassination -- an assassination plot on U.S. soil. And the third individual, as you mentioned, was -- that was charged is in Iran, is an Afghan national that is currently in Iran according to prosecutors. And that was the leader of this broader plot to kill Donald Trump, prosecutors say. His name is Faraj Shaqiri(ph), and prosecutors allege that he was the one who was tasked by the IRGC to come up with a plan to kill Donald Trump before the U.S. election. Now, the charging documents do lay out how what Shaqiri(ph) told prosecutors during his interview with the FBI, and he says that he met with IRGC operatives in Iran, and they instructed him to come up with a plan on October 7th or by October 7th for killing Donald Trump, because in the notes that they believe that Donald Trump was going to lose the U.S. election. And they said that if Shaqiri(ph) could not come up with a plan by October 7th, they would wait until after the U.S. election, anticipating that Donald Trump would ultimately lose, and they could carry out a similar plot after the fact. But look, this speaks to the broader concern we've heard from U.S. officials for months now about Iran's intentions to carry out these political -- politically-targeted assassinations against not just people like Donald Trump and former members of his previous administration, but also any political -- perceived political enemy in the U.S. and abroad.",

Well, a close Trump ally is calling on hisfellow European leaders to urgently adapt to Trump's election win, and rethink their support for Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hosted an EU Summit in Budapest. He suggests that Trump will end U.S. support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, and said that Europe cannot finance the war alone. Mr. Orban told state radio that it's obvious Ukraine faces military defeat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIKTOR ORBAN, PRIME MINISTER, HUNGARY (through translator): The Americans will quit this war. First of all, they will not encourage the war. They will not say war is a good thing. People say many things about Donald Trump, even those who do not like him. But nobody doubts one thing, which is that he will not start a war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say leaders are discussing how to respondin case Trump withdraws U.S. assistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Mr. Orban's call for an immediate ceasefire is nonsense. He also said he doesn't understand Trump's vow to end the war quickly, saying that would mean losses for Ukraine. Mr. Zelenskyy congratulated Trump on his election win on Wednesday, and we're now just learning that billionaire Elon Musk was on that call as well. But of course, Joe Biden is still the U.S. President for a couple more months, and now he has lifted a de facto ban on U.S. military contractors deploying to Ukraine for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Well, let's bring in our international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, who joins us live from London. Certainly, a lot of developments today, Nic. So, let's start with that call that happened between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian President. We're already getting leaks from the Trump team, apparently Elon Musk was on that call. Is Elon Musk now working on foreign policy? Why would he be on that call and what does that -- what does he have to gain from this?",

I mean, if you look at what the Ukrainian officials have been asking for in terms of military support, whether it's -- whether it's tanks, whether, you know, sophisticated modern tanks, whether it's the -- you know, the fighter aircraft, the F-16 fighter aircraft to fight in -- fight in the skies, everything, it always takes so long to come. And this has been a very important piece of the sort of up-arming of Ukraine that they've been denied in a way, the repair of equipment that gets mangled and beaten up in battle. And the quickest way of returning that kit to the frontline is to have people and equipment, mechanics, experts in place in country inside Ukraine to do that. So, we're told that the Biden White House took the decision to allow the Pentagon to appoint contractors to go inside of Ukraine to fix things like the Patriot air defense -- missile defense system, which is vital for protecting civilian and military lives inside of Ukraine right now, that decision was taken before the election, but the fact that it's being put into place now, of course, this is good news for Ukraine. But perhaps, they would be left feeling that they wished it had come sooner. It's a help, but yes, maybe too late.",

And again, that would be a way for controlling and bringing an end to the war, which is something that he said he would do. But -- so that puts the emphasis and the burden on the European leaders to come up with additional funds to keep the war going. And at the European Union level, we know that Viktor Orban has actually been a difficulty at those EU meetings, blocking funding going to Ukraine, making it take a lot longer, breaking down the amounts of money into smaller amounts of money, all that sort of thing. So, I think what we're hearing -- what we're hearing here is Orban articulating what he expects to happen, what the other European leaders are trying to prepare for. When you look at the statements coming from the European leaders, whether it's Macron, Emmanuel Macron, the French President, Alexander De Croo; the Belgian Prime Minister or Mark Rutte, the new NATO Secretary General, they're all essentially saying we don't have the money to go it alone, we need the U.S. money, and our pitch is going to be, we can work this out together.

Well, Donald Trump is making hisfirst major staffing decision since becoming President-elect. Trump has named campaign manager Susie Wiles his next White House Chief of Staff. Wiles is a long-time Trump confidant and political strategist, and she will become the first woman in history to be in that powerful role. Now, before agreeing to accept the job, Wiles wanted a promise that she would be the gatekeeper, and have control over who had access to the President inside the Oval Office. It's a task former Trump Chiefs of Staff struggled with. A source tells CNN with Wiles in charge, the clown car can't come into the White House at will. Well, the hiring of Wiles is likely to give the transition process a boost forward. Sources say Trump allies are working the phones in an effort to secure a high level post in the new administration. The President-elect could make more staffing decisions later today. Well, no one better to talk about Donald Trump's choice for Chief of Staff than Chris Whipple.

What I learned from writing the book is that every President learns sometimes the hard way, that youcannot govern effectively without empowering a White House Chief of Staff as first among equals to do a number of things. Most important, you mentioned the gatekeeper role, but the President counts on the White House Chief of Staff to execute his agenda. And at the end of the day, most importantly, to tell him what he doesn't want to hear. So, it's an absolutely critical position. And one of the reasons that the first Trump term was such so chaotic, frankly, was because the notion of a Trump White House Chief of Staff was really an oxymoron. Trump wasn't interested in having anybody tell him what he didn't want to hear, and the first term was the result.",

I think what Trump's chiefs of staff during his first term revealed about him is that, again, he's not someone who wants anyone to tell him hard truths. Trump wants to be Trump and do what he wants to do. He went through four White House chiefs and he ultimately found the chief that -- who was perfect in his own mind, Mark Meadows, who was the ultimate sycophant to -- who would -- who wouldn't challenge Trump on anything. So, the challenge for Susie Wiles is that she's going to have to find a way to tell the President hard truths.

But asyou and I have talked about before, the uniformity of what we saw in terms of 90 percent of the county is moving toward Trump. Very little variation in the improvement for him in the most urban counties, through suburban, through rural, suggests that mostly what happened, the biggest factor in what happened, was a common national experience, a common national verdict that people were unsatisfied with the outcomes they received from the Biden Administration over the four years. Primarily on the economy, and it also in other issues like the border in crime, certainly inflation at the center that. You know, 46 percent of Americans said they were worse off than they were four years ago. And the exit polls, 70 percent -- 60, 70, to 77 percent described the economy in negative terms, 60 percent said they disapproved of Biden's performance. Lynda, there is simply no precedent for an outgoing president's party holding the White House when you have those kinds of attitudes in the electorate. And I think that above all, I mean, you can point to other factors, but that is the big factor. People were unsatisfied with the way things are going in the country. And thus, they were willing to take a risk on a candidate about whom they still have some serious reservations in Donald Trump.",

But to you, Victor, I want to ask about the other major policy, the mass deportation plan, the biggest in history. Donald Trump says he's going to deport potentially over 20 million people. And he also wants to scrap birthright citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. The latest study by Ford U.S. found that one in three Latinos could be swept up in that.

They would have to win at least one other somewhere else. You know, it could be done, probably. It's going to be an uphill challenge for them to do so, which would be unified control for Republicans. Can I just add on that deportation point? Something really important note. If you look at the exit polling and the vote cast that was done, the other -- the other measurement we have about what voters thought. Most Latinos oppose mass deportation. Most voters in the country oppose mass deportation. But one-fourth of Latinos who said they oppose mass deportation voted for Trump anyway. Very similarly, one quarter of women who said they were pro-choice voted for Trump anyway. One in eight voters who said that he was too extreme voted for Trump anyway. One in eight voters who said that he might lead the country to our autocracy voted for Trump. What we saw is that the concern about the here and now, about the economy, outweighed the hesitations on these other issues that, you know, voters were telling themselves in many cases were not going to come to pass. I mean, you know, it was the devil you know was more concerning for them. They did not want to continue down the fighting path. But that doesn't mean that, you know, that the question will be if Trump in fact does pursue these policies -- there was a Republican senator on CNN Domestic today saying we intended to deport every undocumented immigrant in the country. If it does move down that path, will those voters who expressed unease about those policies but voted for Trump anyway because they want a more stable economic situation, will they stay on the bus?
