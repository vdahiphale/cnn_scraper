Here's what she told Jake Tapper in reaction to that CNN polling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Republicans decide that they want to nominate Donald Trump, the same thing that happened in 2018, 2020 and 2022 will happen again in 2024.

He's at 37 percent approval.The two issues where he overperforms his overall standing are on protecting democracy, 42 percent, and the situation in Ukraine, 41 percent approval. But look, where he is underperforming his low approval rating, I should note, 34 percent approve of his handling of the Israel/Hamas war. And consistently, we see Joe Biden's worst issue in terms of approval by the American public, immigration. I also want you to note here at how the immigration issue is proceeding and why I think we see Democrats starting to get on board with the idea of a border security bill here. Back in 2019, 80 percent of Americans said the top priority dealing with undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be a path to legal status. Now 68 percent say that. Whereas the top priority should be deporting all undocumented immigrants. Back in 2019 it was only 15 percent, and now that's doubled, 31 percent. Clearly still a minority here, but 31 percent and a big increase, believe deportation of undocumented immigrants should be the top priority. And in terms of whether or not the situation at the Mexican border is a crisis, you see here, Republicans have thought it was a crisis for a while. Independents now, 77 percent say it's a crisis. And even Democrats, we see two-thirds of Democrats calling the situation at the border a crisis.",

There are so many states coming up left that she -- that we need to see where there's actual traction there. But she made a really interesting point there when she said, you know, Trump has lost already before. Trump-endorsed candidates have lost in midterm. So why on earth are we pursuing this strategy again? But at the same time, if you see what happened on Capitol Hill, for example, when you were just talking about this, you've got this deal on immigration. They got to a deal on immigration. It is the best deal that they're going to get, that Democrats have -- for 30 years Democrats haven't come to a deal like that on immigration, and to get Ukraine aid. But all the Republicans bow down to Trump, when Trump said, no, don't vote for it, because it would give Biden a win.

And so I just cannot believe that this issue will dictate the election for a few reasons. First, because November is actually far for a war of this kind. Things in Israel/Gaza, wars of this kind, usually move very fast. So it's hard to know exactly where it will be by the time we get an election. But also because, at the end of the day, a vote where you're voting for someone else or you're voting -- you're staying home is, without a doubt, a vote for Trump. And Trump is going to bring back the Muslim ban, and he's also going to -- he was more supportive of Israel than any other past president. And so it's a very short-sighted view. So it's an important one. The White Houses understands it. Reaching out to that community is important. But I just can't see it dictating November elections.",

That immigration deal, it's tangled up in a series of major legislative lifts -- emergency aid for Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, a bipartisan tax package, impending government funding deadlines. Oh, by the way, the Federal Aviation Authorization expires on March 8, as well.These guys have lifts lawmakers never want to leave until an election year. Compromise is a bad word. Lawmakers have their eyes trained on the campaign trail. And motives, well, nobody seems to trust anyone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): And I would ask the president right now, President Biden, is it because we're in an election year that finally you get to the point where this matters? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It happened in a flurry of legislative action in 2011 as President Barack Obama geared up for his re-election battle against Mitt Romney. And again at the end of 2015, ahead of Donald Trump's battle with Hillary Clinton. Deadlines punted until after the election, when partisan rancor ebbs. At the same time lawmakers eye the holiday season, desperate to escape Washington. There's your jet fumes cliche. Few things motivate lawmakers more than that ticket home.Now, 2020 did demonstrate one of the few exceptions to the rule in the last couple of decades. A once-in-a-century pandemic did force major emergency action. And then, Congress largely closed up shop until after election day. Today, as all signs point to a rematch between Donald Trump and President Biden. The stakes could not be higher. On Capitol Hill, a full-blown legislative train wreck is gripping the Capitol, all of it could have -- should have -- been addressed by the end of last year. Instead, with House Republicans grappling with the narrowest of majorities and constant party in-fighting. They're now all inextricably linked together in an election year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): Joe Biden's approval rating is at 33 percent. Why would we do anything to try to help improve that dismal number? (END VIDEO CLIP)",
