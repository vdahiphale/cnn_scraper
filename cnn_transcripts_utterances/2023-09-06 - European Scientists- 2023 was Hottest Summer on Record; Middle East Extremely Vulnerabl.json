Just hours before that strike the U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian officials about their counter offensive. Plus in your headlines this hour this summer was the hottest ever recorded according to a new climate report. This as flooding now inundates several countries around the Mediterranean. And a CNN exclusive security camera video of ISIS prisons in Syria the terrorists did not appear to know they were being recorded. Now the footage is being used to prosecute Islamic State members. Ukraine of course is no stranger to Russian missile attacks after 18 months of war. But today the country's leaders are seeing right after a particularly devastating strike on a shopping area. Well, that was the moment of the strike. You can see that it was a residential area and civilians had to duck for cover. Officials now say 16 people were killed. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says this was a regular market of pharmacy. People who did nothing wrong calling it utter inhumanity. Let's get straight to our Melissa Bell.

The sound the suddenness with which that hit I think it's important to understand what we just saw on that CCTV footage and how terrifying it would have been. That town is just 19 kilometers to the West of Bakhmut and so within striking range. One of the questions I suppose Becky is the timing of this coming as it does even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is here for his visit looking to shore up support looking to find out what's happening on the front lines. But then to take a message back about what is happening here in Ukraine to shore up American support, which has been waiting for the ongoing effort here. It's very difficult to tell whether it was timed or not certainly, we had heard from Dmitry Peskov earlier today in response to Secretary of Blinken's visit here. Saying that it signaled that America the United States was going to give everything it could in terms of financing this war until he said every last Ukrainian had been spent. That was the reaction to Secretary of Blinken's visit. But I think the events in the town of Kostiantynivka, Becky, are an important reminder of just what life is like, of course for the ordinary civilians here in Ukraine. It came on the -- visit here in Kyiv by the way Justice Secretary Blinken was coming to visit also, ballistic and cruise missiles hitting once again the defense is successfully fending them off with the debris causing damage in the Ukrainian capital is an important reminder of why Secretary Blinken is here, what he's come to see and what he's come to hear from the Ukrainians about Becky?",

      "sentences": "Well Becky, whether it's the frequency of heavy rain events, perhaps the intensity of tropical cyclones across theglobe, or just the acreage or hectares burned by wildfires, the extremes are becoming more extreme. And that's associated with our changing climate. We're just giving Greece as an example. But if we look at the globe as a whole, we know that it's warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius on average since pre industrial era, right? So what that means is that the atmosphere has the ability to hold more water vapor, so more water vapor leads to the potential at least for heavier rainfall events to occur. Now, there's also scientifically backed information that highlights and points out what's actually ongoing right now across the Eastern Mediterranean impacting Greece, these cut off low pressure systems that literally meander for days, bring heavy rainfall to areas like Eastern Greece like it's doing right now. And that will become more common and more frequent as we go into our warming world. Now, when we talk about tropical cyclones, in particular, the forward speed of tropical cyclones from hurricanes and typhoons has actually slowed since the middle of last century, about 10 percent globally. So what that does is it allows for more rain to fall in particular locations. Once a storm makes landfall, we talk about stronger storms becoming even stronger in a warming world, but also the sea level and storm surge impacts worsen as well. As we start to see the increase in our sea level rises, it's all pointed back to the heat trapping gases that we continue to burn into the atmosphere. And that in turn is of course warming our oceans near record warmth across the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico. And then when we talk about wildfires, we just look what's happened across Canada this year, the seasons are becoming longer, and we're also burning significantly more acreage or hectares of wildfire. And Canada is a prime example of that this year's acreage burned so far is literally eclipsing the past four decades for Canada. I mean, that really says something that you believe, Becky.",

But it's the amount that record has been broken, scientists are usually measuring these in 100th of a degree or so. But the new record over the past 30 years, as you saw on that chart is nearly two thirds of a full degree Celsius as well. And this is just the beginning because El Nino, the natural warming cycle is just beginning. So the more chilling headline of this report, Becky is this could be one of the coolest summers of the rest of your life. And the thermostat obviously has been controlled by humanity's use of fossil fuels. Exxon Mobil in the United States said this week that humanity will miss targets to hold warming at two degrees, not 1.5 of the Paris Accord but two degrees because of the projected amount of fossil fuels oil that will be pumped by mid- century.",

At least 16 people have been killed ina Russian missile strike on a market in eastern Ukraine. This is one of the worst attacks in months. The Ukrainian prime minister says one child is among the dead. The President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack utter inhumanity. Well, this happening while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in country, he is in Kyiv. This brand new video we've just gotten in of Blinken meeting with Zelenskyy. Blinken doubling down on America's pledge of support in Ukraine's counter offensive against Russia's full scale invasion. For the very latest on the situation in Ukraine, let's bring in U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood from the State Department in Washington, DC. What more can we expect to hear from Antony Blinken, while he is in country? We've certainly heard sort of key words of support. What is there of substance at this point Kylie? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so I think you know, when it comes to his rhetorical support for Ukraine, we're going to hear a lot of that, we just heard that in his meeting with President Zelenskyy. But he's also going to be rolling out a billion dollars in new U.S. support for Ukraine, that's humanitarian support, military support, economic support. You know, a broad range of different types of support, to show that the Biden Administration isn't just talking about this support for Ukraine, but also, you know, putting their money where their mouth is. Now, in this meeting with President Zelenskyy, it's notable that the Secretary talked about the engagement that we have seen over the last few months with this counter offensive, now being very, very encouraging in his words. Now, that isn't how all U.S. officials have characterized Ukraine's efforts in this counter offensive facing Russia. So I'm having been critical saying that it hasn't moved ahead quickly enough, or they've been privately critical of how the Ukrainians have approached that counter offensive strategically. But the Secretary of State, you know, saying good things about it. And also looking forward, he said, to hearing from Zelenskyy, who has just visited the front lines to get his assessment of what he saw to understand what the Ukrainians plan to do in the coming weeks. So the U.S. is doubling down on its support for Ukraine, but also really trying to get the temperature on the ground there. And some details in terms of how the Ukrainians plan to forge ahead here, particularly heading into UNGA, which is, as you know, Becky, when you know, all the world leaders are going to visit New York be together, hear from the Ukrainians about how things are going and what more they need from their supporters.",
