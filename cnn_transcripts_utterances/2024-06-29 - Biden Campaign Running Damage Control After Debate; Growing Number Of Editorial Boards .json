He's trying to reassure some major donors who are reportedly rattled by his very shaky debate performance. The president hit some wealthy zip codes today. First, the Hamptons and then this New Jersey event hosted by Governor Phil Murphy. Many Democrats are wrestling with the question of whether President Biden should continue to stay in the race, and if he can win in November. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz joins us now. So, Arlette, what is the president saying to these donors and how are they responding?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, President Biden is once again trying to assure members of the Democratic Party that he is up for a second term as president. The president is about to speak any minute now at that fundraiser in Red Bank, New Jersey, that's hosted by the state's governor, Phil Murphy. But a bit earlier in the day, he made two fundraising stops in the wealthy area of the Hamptons.The president there really kind of repeated some of the themes from his campaign rally speech on Friday saying that -- acknowledging that he knew he had a bad debate night. But still saying that he believes that he presents the best alternative to former president Donald Trump. In that Hamptons fundraiser, one of the things that president said was he turned to a familiar phrase saying don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative. He said that in relation to the former president, but it does come at a time the Biden campaign is trying to tell that they had some fundraising success in the 24 hours after the debate. They said that they brought in $27 million on Thursday and Friday alone. But at the same time, Biden's advisers have been fielding calls from Democratic anxious donors. There are some in the donor class who are concerned about what it would mean to continue to have Biden at the top of the ticket. Now, there is also we've learned that Democrats are planning to conduct polling over the weekend and into early next week to try to gauge the impact that Biden's debate performance would have, not just on his own candidacy, but also what it could mean for other people running for office, including those in the House and Senate as Democrats are hoping to hold onto the Senate, and they also want to try to win back the House. There are some House Democratic members and their campaigns who are worried about those close contest. What kind of impacts Biden might have on those races. And that is all something that Democrats are trying to gauge in the days to come. Now a short while ago Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon released a memo kind of outlining their efforts since their debate and pointing to their battleground operations. She said that she believes that this will once again be a very close election. She believes that that was the case before this debate and will be the case after. She really tried to push back on some of those who were, quote, \"counting Joe Biden out.\" She said that the campaign team will continue to put their heads down and do the work in the coming weeks and months to try to defeat Donald Trump. But there will be big questions for President Biden and the campaign going forward as there has been a pressure on the president from some privately to a bow out of this race to try to set up the race to beat Donald Trump in November. So we will see what changes the campaign might make in the coming days and weeks. They've simply said that the president plans on remaining in the race. He plans on debating Trump in September, and that their focus now is on the work ahead and how to make their argument to voters.",

      "sentences": "No, no. Actually I think it's also a little different than what I wrote. I think Democrats are in a conundrum. I mean, no one can deny what they saw, which is that Joe Biden did not look capable of being president for four more years. And it was probably the weakest debate performance of any major party nominee in the history of the modern debates going back to 1960.And so there is I think enormous anxiety in the Democratic Party about simply sailing forward as if nothing had happened. Don't forget, Alisyn, going into this debate Biden is trailing. I mean, Biden is the one who needed to improve the trajectory of the race. The problem I think, the conundrum the Democrats face is part of the explanation for why Biden is running again to begin with, which is that there is a feeling -- you know, the Democratic strategists, donors, elected, who doubt that Biden can win are also pretty dubious that Kamala Harris can win. And so defaulting to her doesn't really assuage those -- you know, those anxieties. The problem is bypassing her as the first woman of color on a national ticket could tear the party apart. So the party faces some very difficult choices. But it is I think kind of kind of a willful ignoring of the evidence of the campaign to simply argue that going forward is the only thing that Democrats can do because there are lots of reasons to be very, very nervous about what this debate has meant to a race that was already slightly uphill for the president.",

It's all going to be fine in the end. I think the important thing to understand is the baseline in which he went into this debate. He went into the debate with the swing states in the southeast of North Carolina and Georgia looking almost completely out of reach.The swing states in the southwest, not that much more within reach, although still potentially plausible for him. The one reasonable pathway, the one plausible pathway for him right now, looks to be sweeping Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the former blue wall states. But today he's probably no better than even in Wisconsin and Michigan and behind in Pennsylvania and maybe behind in Michigan as well. He's the one who needs to improve, and the head-to-head, you know, the horse race number is almost always the best number in the poll for Biden. I mean, when you get below that and you ask about his approval, is he too old for the job, who is strong, who can handle the economy? Trump's leads are formidable. And so I think the Democrat -- there's a certain paralysis in the Democratic Party right now because when you talk to many strategists, many elected, many donors, they will share the views expressed in those kinds of editorials that this was difficult to begin with, and it becomes almost, you know, herculean after that debate. But no one at this point is willing to act on it. There's a gulf between anxiety and action in the Democratic Party now out of this belief that the only way that he, you know, that there's somebody could change was that he has an epiphany. I think history suggests that isn't right, that it isn't like everybody who thinks this is a bad idea is powerless in the Democratic Party, but that seems to be the view, the dominant view at this point.",

      "sentences": "Well, look. I mean, again, the most dangerous thing in politics as we both know is for a candidate to validate a pre-existing supposition or doubt in the electorate. And Biden went into this debate with two-thirds to three-quarters of Americans, polls saying, who think he's too old for the job now and much less for four more years. And, you know, it is very hard. You never get a second chance to make a first impression as your mother told you, and I think it is going to be difficult to erase the image of him struggling to complete a sentence.The kind of vacant look, the disoriented look, you know, the inability to really make a sustained argument in any way against Donald Trump. Biden now benefits from the reverse of what Donald Trump said when he said he could shoot somebody in Fifth Avenue, and, you know, and not lose any of his support. We are a deeply dug in and polarized nation. It would be surprising if he does in fact collapse in the polls because there is still substantial resistance to living in the America that Donald Trump is laying out. And Donald Trump did nothing in that debate to convince Democrats that he's unbeatable in November. So Biden may not, you know, collapse in the polls. But the question really becomes whether after that debate he can gain the improvement that he needs. I mean, that is the critical point. It's not like he came into this debate in a position of strength. They wouldn't have been asking for a debate in June if they were in a position of strength. He's the one who needed to shake up impressions and in fact -- and to the contrary, he kind of reaffirmed and deepened the biggest personal obstacle that he faced. I mean, look at the dial groups and focus groups that Stanley Greenberg, the Democratic pollster released today about the impact at this debate on voters that Biden needs to recover, particularly younger black and Hispanic voters, and their reactions were devastating. So again, not likely to collapse. You know, I don't think either side can collapse as Donald Trump has proved multiple times, but is Biden in a position to do what he needs to do after this? Obviously it's vastly harder and maybe impossible.",

      "sentences": "Well, look. I mean, first of all, you know, the way the Democratic Party changed the rules after 1980 -- Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy in their primary fight in 1980, there was the so-called robot rule, which said that you had to vote at least on the first ballot for the candidate that you were pledged to as a convention delegate. That's gone.The delegates really can do whatever they want even now. Now, you know, they were all selected as Joe Biden delegates. So they're not going to abandon him if he doesn't want them, you know, to do so, if he doesn't step aside. But he has no control over them. You know, if he did step aside, presumably the vice president would get in. And we could see whether anyone else would. But even before that, you know, I just go back and the example I have in my head is 1968. It's obviously different because it was much earlier, but, you know, the anti-war activists started organizing to try to persuade someone to challenge Lyndon Johnson before there was a candidate willing to do so. And that's what really happened in the fall of '67, early '68. Gene McCarthy did and did well in New Hampshire. Bobby Kennedy got in the race and two weeks after that Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for reelection. The situation is not exactly analogous, but the idea that the Democrats who fear that Biden is now too damage to win have no options that they cannot if they chose to organize in a way that demonstrated support for replacing him on the top of the ticket. I think it's just a kind of fatalism. And that is -- that's kind of the dominant emotion I've heard in Democratic circles over the last 48 hours, this fear that this cannot be recovered from in part because he went into it trailing. But uncertainty about whether or fatalism about whether there's anything they can do about it. The choices are not just waiting for Biden. I mean, people can try to influence Biden's choice either in a friendly way, you know, quiet conversation or in a more confrontational way by demonstrating that there's a constituency in the party which I think is pretty clearly evident in polls that is now uneasy about going forward in the course that they're on. You know, we'll see. Not like -- doesn't look like that's happening, but some bad polls in the next few weeks might change that calculation. One last point.",

So this is really a reward for January 6th for Donald Trump. It's sort of a big deal, but they'll send it back to the lower court to parse through the Jack Smith indictment and decide which parts of what Donald Trump did would be immune from prosecution and which parts would be private or personal acts that the case could go forward on assuming he doesn't win the presidency and call the whole thing off.",

The court could set forth a standard that he could say, listen, this is protected.I mean, the irony of it is, presidents have more power than anyone else on the planet, right? They can control the military. They have access to CIA counterintelligence information. They -- that's the very kind of thing you would say you want to make sure there's accountability for, but I think there is an appetite on this with this conservative majority to insulate presidents from even as private citizens having any accountability for abusing office and crossing the boundaries of criminal activity.

It would not be the first time something like that happened.Two previous US presidents decided to abandon their races for re- election. In 1968, Lyndon Johnson decided not to seek his party's nomination; and in 1952, Harry Truman made that same decision.

It is a very hard decision for a president to make both Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson thought about not running again for months before they announced it.And in both cases, they had a hard time, if you will, pulling the trigger in the end, but they made this decision, and the decision was a lonely one. They made it themselves. In the case of Lyndon Johnson, when his family discovered that he was considering this, didn't want him to do it. In the case of Harry Truman, he talked -- he sent a signal to his daughter, his beloved daughter, that he was thinking of this and there is no evidence there was any pushback. So it is a very lonely decision in both Truman and Johnson's case. They were mired in an unpopular war. For Truman, it was the Korean War; for Johnson, it was Vietnam. Both were tired and both were ready to leave the Oval Office. Nevertheless, it was a tough decision to make. Now, we are in a different situation. The situation we are in now is that the incumbent president may or may not have been thinking about retirement, but he made very clear that he was running again in April of 2023, and was the one who challenged Donald Trump to the debate that ultimately turned out to be disastrous. So the situation here is, the president is not controlling the situation at all. In both Truman and LBJ's case, they decided not to run on their own timetable. They did it by themselves. They were not forced out, although they both had opponents who were trying to seek nomination, but neither was actually seriously challenged by any other Democrat. So President Biden's situation now is quite unprecedented and he is being pushed to reconsider his re-election bid largely because of a bad performance, but also because of some concerns that he may not physically be up to the job.

There have been several delays of this return to Earth, and now, just Friday afternoon, NASA says there is now no target date for when those astronauts and that spacecraft will return home. The holdup has been some issues with the spacecraft's thrusters and also a few helium leaks. And so now, NASA and Boeing are going to shift the testing and the troubleshooting of those thrusters from the actual spacecraft in space to some ground testing on some replica thrusters in White Sands, New Mexico, that is expected to start next week, and those tests are expected to take a couple of weeks to complete. So we are looking likely at mid to late July at the absolute earliest before Butch and Suni can return to Earth. NASA really stressing though that those astronauts are safe. The spacecraft is safe.

Shark feeding is a practice of cutting the fins off, which are used for this shark fins soup and then putting the carcass back in the water. If the shark is alive, it will suffocate to death because without its fins, it cannot swim. One of the biggest challenges for law enforcement around the world is that how can they tell whether a shark fin that is coming into their country is legal or illegal? It is from a species that is regulated or not regulated? You need to do DNA tools or molecular tools in order to identify it. What we have developed is that we take a little piece of this fin. We run it through a machine for two hours and we are able to tell what species is it without sequencing very cheaply, very quickly. Before we deployed the tool back in 2018, Hong Kong authorities were seizing around five tons of shark fins annually. Now, those numbers have increased to a hundred tons a year. The idea is that in the long run, those efforts being translated in shark fishing nations to do more sustainable and well-managed fisheries. If we don't do something quick to reverse these declines, then were going to see several sharks going extinct in our lifetimes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
