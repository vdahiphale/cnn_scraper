It was October 7th. Well, it's 04:00 p.m. in Israel, it is 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". Also happening, Israel continues to hit Hezbollah targets in Beirut and its southern suburbs with aerial attacks. And Hamas fires rockets from Gaza to the outskirts of Tel Aviv, injuring two people. Well, we start with the Middle East and the world marking an anniversary that, one year on, has claimed tens of thousands of lives and left this already tense region far more dangerous than before. Hamas militants stormed into Israel from Gaza last October 7th, killing 1200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel today is remembering those victims and those still held captive with vigils and protests. Well, its visit -- president visited the side of the Nova Music Festival where many young people were killed, calling the attack a scar on humanity. Well, a year later, fighting still rages. The resulting war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and left large swathes of the enclave in ruins. And now Israel fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon, where more than 1400 people have been reported killed and more than 1 million displaced. Well, CNN's Nic Robertson revisited the site of the Nova Music Festival and reports that the pain and sorrow runs-deep. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Before dawn, a day of pain about to break you.

TheIsraelis say it's a targeted strike on what they say is the -- or the southern suburbs, which they described as a Hezbollah stronghold, although many people live there who have no connection with Hezbollah whatsoever. This blast was significant because we believe it is the closest strike so far to Beirut International Airport. That despite -- despite that, the flights keep on coming in and taking off. But definitely, what we're seeing is certainly over the last few days, at night, really intense strikes, and during the day, hourly strikes on the southern suburbs. Meanwhile, in the south of the country, the Arabic Spokesman for the Israeli military has put out yet another series of evacuation orders, this time to 25 villages in the south, many of them in the western sector on the border near the Mediterranean, clearly indicating that Israel is planning something far beyond the so called localized and targeted raids in the south of the country. Clearly, they are setting the groundwork for something much larger. They've told all of these, perhaps at this point, as many as 100 the residents of 150 towns and villages to go north of the Awali River, which is about 50 kilometers north of the border, and told them not to come back to their homes until further notice. The worry is that Israel will come in accompanied by massive destruction, of course, and then nobody knows when they will be able to go back. Keep in mind, Israel has invaded Lebanon before the first time in 1978. They didn't withdraw from the great mass of the occupied territories until May of 2000. The worry is here that history could repeat itself Becky.",

Well, Nada Bashir, following developments for us. 41,000 killed, many of them women and children. Many, many of those who are dead are women and children. This war goes on in Gaza on a day a year on from October 7th. Of course, the IDF launching new air strikes on targets inside Gaza, a refugee camp and a hospital compound. Why were these targeted?

      "sentences": "Look, Becky a year on, and we are still hearing the same messaging from the Israeli military. They maintain thatthey are targeting Hamas infrastructure -- Hamas militants in these areas. But of course, as we've seen throughout the year, the civilian toll is significant the implications for many of those civilians have been displaced is immense. And of course, as you've described, we have seen a number of strikes being carried out overnight and over the weekend, and of course, impacting civilians there as well. Just overnight, a series of strikes on the Al Borage Refugee Camp in Central Gaza, we've seen a number killed and several injured there. Again, the Israeli military saying that they are targeting Hamas infrastructure, but this is an area known to be housing countless civilians. And over the weekend, that's more troubling development is that we've seen the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, or at least the compound of the hospital, coming under attack. It was known that, of course, civilians had gathered around the hospital building makeshift tents to take shelter on the hospital compound. This is a hospital that is getting support from Doctors Without Borders at this stage. It is one of the last remaining hospitals still functioning in Gaza. Of course, it's a hospital where we receive footage from on a daily basis, because it -- because it takes in such a huge amount of wounded patients from across the Gaza Strip. But according to the Israeli military, they did target the compound with a drone strike. They have described the hospital rather the compound of the hospital's housing, Hamas Command and Control Center. Of course, no evidence has been provided of that, and we do know that a number of civilians were also killed in that strike. At least eight people injured. And what we've also seen in that area of Central Gaza is a broadening out of these airstrikes. We've seen the Al Aqsa Martyrs Mosque being targeted over the weekend, at least 21 people killed there. Again, we've also seen a nearby school being struck as well. So clearly, the situation in Gaza has not changed over the last year. We are still seeing these strikes taking place across the strip, particularly now concentrating on that Central Gaza area. And of course, what we have seen over the years these repeated evacuation orders, the vast majority of Gaza's 2.2 million strong population is now displaced. And of course, real fears as to where there is left for civilians to go for safety.",

I don't know. I just don't know what kind of people going to get back, and -- the cartridges are going to come back. We do know from the six cartridges that came back a month ago, the conditions were the worst, and that should have woken up the leaders of the world. You cannot allow yourself to leave human beings underneath the ground to die slowly without medicine. This one of the hostages has celiac, and another he's been forced to eat pita bread. Kids got high blood pressure, and there's children that don't have their parents because their mothers been killed and the fathers there. And it just breaks my heart. I think we've all gone through enough. I don't know what more to do. I don't know what more I can do, because I do know that Keith and not to just cannot stay there, because I'm a human person. I've got a heart, and Keith got a heart, and I feel for them. And I feel that it's the cruelest thing in us to live --",

That's 65 years old. It does not just it should -- you should not be underneath the ground, lying on a filthy mattress with other hostages and trying to think, what are they going to do to me now? Are they going to hit me again? Are they going to push me again? Are they going to stop me again? Maybe they'll decide to rape one of the girls next to me or touch her. That's torture, and that should not be allowed in any place in the world, and to let the hostages that died without the medicine slowly. I think that's the cruelest thing you know, and it should never, ever happen anywhere, anywhere and to anybody, if it's a Jew, a Muslim, a Christian. Anybody in the world should not suffer like the hostages are suffering. And I have been there, so I know what it's like, and I for 51 days, just try to survive -- And I want to tell you that there were so many moments that was so hard for me that I just wanted to die. To see them torture kids was for me, the end of the world for me to see them touch the girls was too much for me, for see them beat one of the girls with sticks and I had to keep quiet. I wasn't allowed to cry. I wasn't allowed to shout, and those I felt like they were my daughters, and I could not protect them. I had to keep quiet. I wasn't allowed to even show that I'm upset in any way. I wasn't allowed to cry forgive what they did to him and to the girls. And there's so much sadness and so much cruelty in the story that we've been Netanyahu, so while Biden, they need to wake up, it's too much, it's too much suffering.
