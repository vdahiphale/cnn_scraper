I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Kim Jong Un doesn't usually leave North Korea but for Vladimir Putin, he has. The 39-year-old dictator of the world's most reclusive country arrived in Russia by special armored train today. A show of support for the Russian president who needs all the help he can get for his war in Ukraine. The United States believes Pyongyang has sent artillery to Moscow and is warming that it should not make an arms deal. North Korea is thought to have stockpiles of ammunition, not surprising, since it hasn't fought a war since the 1950s. Here with reaction to this highly charged meeting and much more is Ben Wallace. He served as Britain's defense secretary for four years before stepping down just a few weeks ago. Ben Wallace, welcome to the program. There you are in London by parliament. I wonder if you can tell me, are you concerned about this meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin and how do you think and how would you think Britain feels it might change or impact the war in Ukraine?",

Imean, to think that the Russian president has to go on bended knee now to beg for North Korean predominantly 1960's equipment shows the state he has got himself into with his illegal invasion of Ukraine. I think -- you know, we have a saying in England, by your friends you shall be judged. And I think it just shows that Putin's circle of friendship is an ever-decreasing circle. So, I think at one level it's a slight sign of hope in the West that, of course, that's all who Putin has. And, you know, we should take some comfort from that. There is a little bit of worry that, of course, when it comes to less sophisticated weapon system that are needed by Russian forces such as artillery shells, of course, as you rightly pointed out in your introduction, you know, they haven't -- North Korea hasn't fought a war for decades. So, of course, unleashing shells or dumb shells to the Russian army would, of course, be useful to them at the time. But I think you can argue it's probably too late at the moment for Russia. And I think it's just another sort of -- you know, if that all President Putin has to boast around the kitchen table with his friends is that my new friend is Kim Jong Un, I think the world will look at that and see that he's now cozying up to a fellow isolated regime that's despotic and obviously isn't even viewed by China as a rational regime.",

I think what you could say is, if Ukraine had been properly equipped and supported from 2014or even before, I think what you would have seen is the deterrence in action. I think you would have seen Russia less likely to have taken the action that it did last February. I think once they had taken that action, it basically broke down into two phases. And the first phase was defense. And as we saw Ukraine defended itself incredibly well, it out -- exceeded everybody's expectations, Britain, America, Europe. Everyone thought, you know, that Ukraine wouldn't hold on for too long. It defeated a very, very large invading army. And then, you get to the next phase, which is the phase of offense. The offensive that we now see. And inevitably, that was going to come at a later date. So, I don't think that if everyone was lined up and was start line in February, it would have stopped it. I think if Ukraine had militarily reformed, as it has now done and it had been properly equipped by the West, you know, years before, I think then that deterrent would have worked.",

I want to ask you one particular question that I hear from a lot of British military and former military, as well as U.S. military and former military and special forces, they're still very upset that their colleagues in the Afghan National Army and elsewhere were sort of left to fend for themselves.

Ending investigations into crimes committed during the troubles. So, it apparently will offer amnesty to paramilitaries former soldiers. The Irish government might challenge it, it's being condemned by the Labour Party and others in Ireland. What can you tell us about that?

And look, ultimately,(INAUDIBLE) agreement which was signed by both sides and supported fully by the United Kingdom government and the Irish government was about drawing a line under the troubles, and within that, was a sense of forgiveness, whether we -- whether I found that comfortable or not. We released the IRA prisoners, for example, in exchange for decommissioning of weapons. So, there was a whole part of this process which was about putting the troubles behind us, recognizing that democracy is the way forward and not the use of weapons and arms. And ultimately, you know, after many, many years, you know, it's been 1997 since the Good Friday Agreement, you know, what's important is, if people want to come forward and want to engage with investigations, be they terrorists or ex-former security force personnel, then they have potentially the ability to be effectively forgiven, to be given an amnesty. If you don't come forward, if you're an IRA terrorist who refuses to cooperate, you will still be open to prosecution. So, it's not unconditional. And secondly, it's not one-sided. It will be open to both, you know, those people who under investigation from the state and it will also be open to those terrorists and paramilitaries as well. And that's not comfortable as a former soldier. I don't want -- you know, instinctively, I would say that those terrorists whose killed my soldiers should face justice. But I'm also interested in peace on the island of Ireland and peace in Northern Ireland. And if both sides and individuals who contributed to those troubles and people under investigation wish to actually cooperate and give some sort of peace to the victims, and remember, the vast majority of the victims were IRA and terrorist victims, I mean, in the thousands, the innocent killed by terrorist bombs, they deserve closure. I think that's what we owe as part of peace. And we owe an honest and open discussion of what happened to their loved ones. And I think, you know, if people are prepared to do that, after all these years and decades, I think this bill seeks to draw a line. But if you don't want to play that game and you're a terrorist and you want to keep hiding the truth and you don't want to admit your role in murder or anything else, then you'll still be prosecuted.",

I mean, even optimists are just stunned by how quickly and how painless the inflation has come down. That we're -- you know, no hint of a recession, at least so far, we never know, but know so far inflation not too far from, you know, the target of 2 percent and under 3 percent by most measures. And all of that just achieved painlessly. So, this is great. This is a Goldilocks economy. People say it's a terrible economy. But what's really odd is that people don't behave as if it's a terrible economy. You know, we can talk about surveys which -- in which people seem to be relatively happy with their own financial situation or we can just look at behavior. People are out there with a lot of discretionary consumer spending, travel, hotels, restaurants, all of that is booming. So, people are acting as if they're in good shape financially. And yet, they say, wow, this is a disastrous economy. Somebody must be a disaster for somebody. But not for me. And you know, we don't really understand why this is happening.

I mean, it's the -- you know, the bible of the financial would recall, mostly slightly conservatively tilting. And \"The Wall Street Journal's\" graph is very interesting, with a breakdown by party of how voters rate the strength of the U.S. economy. And you can see after a dip where there was that, you know, 2020 hard time, or whatever it was, there's a dip there between 2022 and 2023. But now, it's going up amongst both Democrats and independents, steadily up, but not, it's flatlined. Really, it's just been flatlined amongst the Republican and those leaning Republican.

And wages are growing at 5.3 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. So, again, the disconnect is interesting. Can I just swerve right into politics and ask you whether this is going to make people feel even more sort of in their silos? Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the house, has today given the go ahead for, you know, house inquiry into impeaching President Biden. You know, everybody's talked about the politics of his caucus that has forced him to take this position, the freedom caucus, all the rest of it.

The Republican -- you know, 92 percent of Republican primary voters think inflation is rising. These are people who are just living in near own universe. It's not -- nothing is going to change their perceptions. But maybe by kind of emphasizing just how radical the Republicans are this might cause Democrats and -- well, I'm not sure there are any real independents out there, but to the extent that Democrats are feeling a little wavering, they might be kind of rally around, saying, you know, we need to be the party that is somewhat sane on these substitutes.",

Do you believe in the value of college? Is college a positive force in the country? Is a college degree worth it? People were really starting to change their answers in the negative. And that has continued up until today. Gallup Poll just came out a couple of months ago continued to show a decline in what Americans are saying about college. At the same time, the numbers are going down on campuses. So, college going. The undergraduate population peaked a little more than a decade ago.

It's risen about twice the rate of inflation over the past 30 years. But it's also -- the cost of college has also mode very complicated by the fact that financial aid is so complex for so many families. So, the sticker price of college is almost always much higher than what families will actually pay. But it's really difficult for families to understand exactly what that number will be. On the whole now right now, it costs, with financial aid, about $33,000 on average for a student to go to a private university.

The other factor that complicates the financial calculation is that college has just become more risky. So, it used to be that a college degree would pay off fairly similarly for everyone. Everyone was benefitting a little bit from a college degree. Now, depending again on partly the luck of the draw, partly where you go, partly what you study and certainly how much you borrow, there are some students who are benefitting tremendously from their college degree. And there are others who aren't benefitting at all and who, in fact, are losing money in the gamble of going to college. And I think that has just created this very different sense. You know, when you go to high school, you don't think of it as a gamble, right? You just think, OK, I'm going to high school. This is what you're supposed to do. I want to graduate. When you go to college, suddenly, you know, you're only a year older but you're suddenly in this incredibly complicated and expensive academic game where some people are doing great and some people aren't. And a lot of 19-year-olds don't have the mindset to suddenly be in this very competitive world.

But for the country as a whole, it is hard to argue with the idea that it is actually making us more unequal. It is leading to less mobility. It is keeping us trapped in the kind of social divisions that we've been trapped in for a while. And changing that I think takes a really serious reconsideration of, first of all, how we finance higher education, how we pay for it, but also, how we organize it. You know, the idea that there are, you know, a very small number of colleges that everybody wants to go to, that are incredibly valuable and incredibly expensive, that is just not very democratic. That does not create a system where everyone does well and where everyone supports this institution. It creates a very competitive system where everyone is kind of anxious and mad all the time, where certain people are benefitting a huge amount, but lots of others are just feeling constantly disadvantaged. Lots of them are being disadvantaged by the system, but I think everybody feels insecure. It's true of a lot of things in American life right now, it shouldn't be true of higher education.

This was one of the interesting things that showed up in the polling data, which was beginning in about 2015, there was this realdivergence in what Republicans said about higher education and what Democrats said. Democrats are not quite as enthusiastic as they were a decade ago, but their enthusiast hasn't tailed off too much. But for Republicans, it's really fallen through the floor. The shift in how positive Republicans are about higher education has been massive since 2015. And so, I think that partly has to do with everything we've been talking about with economic insecurity, with the sense of unfairness, but it also, I think, has to do with this idea on right that colleges are institutions of the liberal establishment. And, you know, I think that that can be overblown, but there are data that show that there's some truth in it as well. College freshmen by about three to one say they are liberal over conservative. With college faculty, it's more like five to one. With administrators who are facing students, it's more like 12 to one. So, it's not surprising if you're, you know, let's say, a rural conservative person thinking about sending your kid to college, the sense that this is it not going to be a place where they and their ideas are welcome is not a crazy idea. And so, I think that shift is really undermining the whole institution. When institutions of higher education feel monolithically liberal, I don't think that's good for anybody. I don't think that's good for liberals or conservatives.",

In other countries, it's usually a few thousand dollars, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000. I come from Canada. And I was there over the summer and talking to friends who have kids who are going off to college. And in some ways, it is the -- a very much sort of an alternative system to the United States. And that it's cheaper. It's not free, but it's cheaper, significantly cheaper. I'd say less than half the price of college here. And part of that is because the government pays more. But part of it also is that there just isn't this sense of there being certain like gold-plated institutions that everyone wants to go to. There are a lot of really good colleges. There aren't a lot of, you know, low quality colleges. It's a much flatter system. And I think that not only serves the country better, it also just changes the sense of public opinion. Because everyone is feeling like, yes, you know, you graduate from college -- from high school. You find something that fits for you, whether it's a two-year degree or a four-year degree, and it's not a huge deal. It's not something that you spend, you know, the last two years of high school freaking out about and then have loans that you got to pay back the rest of your life.",

Their percentages of their young people going to college have all been going up rapidly over the past 20 years. And a big part of that is that they invest in public university. Tuition is much lower because the public bears a much larger part of the burden. And that's just based on this national idea in these our countries that higher education is something that benefits everybody. And I think that used to be an idea that was widely held here, you know, when the G.I. Bill, after World War II, we invested in all the G.I.s because we thought having lots more people go to college and graduate was going to benefit the country as a whole, and it did. It created, you know, the post-war middle class and the great post-war economic boom. And so, at this moment, I think we could make a similar decision and decide that we're going to invest in higher education that doesn't necessarily mean four-year universities, it can mean all sorts of different types of degrees for different types of interest.

For me, I think, what I would think about differently as a parent than I would have before is you really sort of have to think like a consumer. And so, I think, in the past, parents have just thought, whatever the best college your kid gets into, that's the one you should go to. Instead, I think you really have to take questions of tuition and debt into account. And you have be aware of the kind of data that these economists are coming up with. Going into huge amounts of debt to get a degree sometimes it's worth it, if it's exactly the right degree and you're sure you can pay it off. But often, it's not.
