      "sentences": "Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. More like elsewhere, if you're looking to buy a home in California now.State Farm says it is stopping all new home insurance sales in the Golden State. The reason is the risk of wildfire, as well as construction costs. Over the past five years, California has seen an average of 7,000 wildfires per year. That has scorched millions of acres and many homes as well. CNN's Matt Egan has the details. Matt, I imagine this is a numbers game here for State Farm, but really an alarming conclusion for homeowners looking to insure. MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMY REPORTER: Jim, this is an alarming conclusion. Think about this, State Farm is the country's biggest home insurer and it's saying it doesn't want new business in the country's most populous state. It's kind of unthinkable. Now State Farm is citing three major factors here. One, the cost of rebuilding has skyrocketed. Two, the need to rebuild has gone up because of all of these wildfires. And three, reinsurance has been harder to get. Reinsurance is how insurers spread the risk. It's like insurance for insurers. But that's been harder and harder to get because of the first two issues. Now of course, inflation is not a problem special to California. That is a national phenomenon, if not a global one. But it's the wildfire issue that has really become a particular problem in California. As you mentioned, that state is averaging 7,000 wildfires per year. These wildfires are consuming more than two million acres a year, damaging or even destroying countless homes and businesses along the way. Scientists, they blame the climate crisis for the intensity of these fire seasons. Now, in a statement, State Farm says, quote, \"It's necessary to take these actions to improve the company's financial strength.\" And State Farm, they note that this does not impact existing customers nor does it impact the company's auto business. Still, though, State Farm is just the latest insurer to take a step back from California. Last year, AIG reportedly decided not to renew insurance on thousands of homes in California. Chubb, which is the state's biggest insurer for high-end homes, that has also done the same thing. And, you know, it feels like, for decades really, wildfires were kind of just looked at as the cost of doing business in California for insurance companies. But the problem has gotten so bad that we're now seeing a growing number of insurers throw in the towel and basically say it's just not worth the risk at this point. And here's the problem, though. For consumers, that means they're going to have fewer choices. And the remaining players will have that much more power to raise prices. So, Jim, it does seem like this is going to be just another reason why life is going to get even more expensive in what is already one of the country's most expensive states.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, this actually started with an investigation. This happened in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where police got a call to a mobile home community about one of the homes being trespassed.So they responded to that call. They found three teenagers who didn't really -- weren't able to communicate exactly what they were doing, didn't look very good, had clothes on that were too big and they were very filthy looking. And so they connected them with their parents, who happened to be the mobile home next door, the one you're looking at right there, and talked to the parents. The police went inside. They found that padlocked refrigerator. They were told by the mother -- get this -- that the kids were just garbage disposables with legs. That's how she described her own children to police. Police actually left the area but came back not too long after with the state's child services. That's when they discovered even more children. Four were found in a back bedroom. They also just found, as you said it, Boris, deplorable conditions. There were snakes in the home, toads, a four-foot reptile, two dozen caged rats, dogs, turtles, rabbits and feces everywhere. It was just horrific. Plus, the children, they were malnourished. They didn't have any education. They learned that these kids didn't even know their own birth dates. So two parents, they have been arrested, charged with seven felony counts of endangerment of these children. They actually did get out of jail but those children are not with them. They are with the state. The good news here, if there is any, Boris, is that these children are doing a little bit better. They're actually gaining weight. But certainly there is a long road to recovery for these poor kids.",

Here's a look at some of the other headlines we're following at this hour.Divers overnight recovered a fourth body from a lake in northern Italy after a tourist boat capsized. Authorities say the search and rescue effort is over. And right now, an operation is under way to recover the sunken boat. There were 22 tourists and two crew members onboard when it capsized Sunday during a violent storm. Also, days after a passenger opened the emergency door of a South Korean jetliner mid-flight, the airline now says it will no longer sell tickets for certain exit row seats on its Airbus 321s, even if the flight is full. Video of Friday's incident on Asiana Airlines showed wind whipping through the plane's cabin as terrified passengers gripped their arm rests. The suspect reportedly told police that he felt suffocated and wanted to quickly get off the plane. And New York City officials are planning to house up to 500 migrants at an old Harlem prison. A city hall spokesperson tells CNN, over the next few days, the city and state will work to open an emergency respite center for adult asylum seekers at the correctional facility. It's located on the northern end of the central part of Manhattan. More than 70,000 migrants have arrived through the city's intake center since last spring and hundreds more arrive daily. Jim?",

Now, this week, they're meeting for the first time. They say they'll discuss intellectual property protection, disinformation, and how tech should be governed. It should be noted these are the G-7 nations. Right? You know, this does not include countries like China and Russia. Sam Altman, the head of Open A.I., said, because A.I. is an existential risk, we need international watch dogs, similar to atom watchdogs, to oversee A.I. regulation.
