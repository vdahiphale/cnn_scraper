      "sentences": "Now to a CNN exclusive. Stunning revelations in \"Elon Musk,\" a new biography about the tech billionaire detailing his impact on the war in Ukraine.The book alleges that Musk disrupted a Ukrainian sneak attack against Russia, its naval fleet in Crimea, by shutting off Kiev's Internet access via his Starlink satellites. The book's author, Walter Isaacson, says that Musk was driven by fear of a retaliatory nuclear attack following his talks with the Kremlin. Once Ukraine began relying on Starlink for offensive attacks against Russia, Musk reportedly second-guessed his decision to get involved in the conflict. Telling the author, quote, \"How am I in this war? Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people could watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.\" Joining me now is CNN media analyst and senior reporter for \"Axios,\" Sara Fischer. Sara, these are really surprising details coming out in this biography of Elon Musk. He seems to relish and enjoy the amount of power that he has. But in this specific instance of Ukraine he seems frustrated by it.",

      "sentences": "And, Sara, you mentioned the deal that was reportedly brokered between Musk and the U.S. government. Before that, there was some very public disagreements that he had on X, or Twitter, about the Pentagon paying for Starlink access for Ukraine.He obviously, in this reporting, has serious contacts with senior members of the Kremlin. Is the U.S. government at all concerned about his influence in those circles or their influence on him perhaps?",

And I think one of the reasons that they want to get involved here is not just to make sure that the Ukrainian government has the access but also to bring the responsibility of when it gets turned on and turned off to the U.S. government and out of Elon Musk's hands.The concern in that CNN exclusive report is that Elon Musk can himself unilaterally just turn off access at any point. In the particular report that we talk about today, he had instructed engineers to turn off the Ukrainian access as they were heading into a front in Crimea, which is already a heavily contested area. And so the U.S. government does not want there to be a third party, someone who's not involved in our national security decisions, to have the ability to make those kinds of calls in the split second.",

So they have long been very public about wanting him to ensure that the connectivity stays. The challenge, though, we're seeing this play out in this CNN exclusive today, is that no matter how much they beg Elon Musk is going to feel divided. Remember, his empire expands to so many different places around the world. He's used to working -- having to work with autocracies, whether that's Russia or building factories for Tesla in China. So he's in a very compromised position here. And I don't know to what extent it's going to look like moving forward other than the fact the U.S. government is now a lot more involved than it used to be.",

But in this case, obviously both Trump and Meadows were federal officials. For Meadows it's easier for him because his role is more limited in this scheme. It's easier for him to characterize this as merely giving advice to the president, which was his actual job. A little harder, considerably harder I should say, for Donald Trump.",

Obviously, for example, federal officials are not authorized as part of their job duties to commit crimes.But for example here, part of what is working against the D.A. a little bit is she had a very wide-ranging indictment in which she scooped up a lot of activity as part of this racketeering scheme, this RICO scheme. So there's a number of acts that are listed in the indictment that are not themselves criminal. So that was what the judge has been mulling over. If there are pieces of this scheme which are under the color of law, are part of his duties, is that enough? And you know, this is not the sort of case that comes along all the time, Jim. So the judge I think is seriously weighing this without a lot of precedent out there where, you know, this is happening on a regular basis and the judge can just look at what other courts have done.",

Peptic Ulcer Disease is when you get sores in the lining of your stomach.And also, I was just talking with a doctor about this, causes hoarseness if acid goes into your throat. And that could be something that affects somebody like Bruce Springsteen significantly, if that's what's happening. It happens when the protective layer of mucus in the stomach gets damaged. People think about ulcers caused by things like coffee or stress. That is not what causes these things. The main causes are this bacteria called H. Pylori, as well as use of a lot of painkillers. Those are things like aspirin, Naproxen, which is Aleve, Ibuprofen, Motrin or Advil, as well as prescriptions like Celebrex. The symptoms are a gnawing or burning pain, which you get at night or between meals. That pain goes away when you eat or take antacids. And it can also come with things like bloating, heartburn, nausea and vomiting. And it can have more severe consequences in severe situations as well. So it's something that requires a lot of monitoring.",

But it can recur.And so some of the things to do to try to prevent this is to limit the use of these painkillers. Other painkillers like Tylenol, for example, don't contribute to the stomach ulcers. Quit smoking if you smoke and drink alcohol in moderation if you drink at all because those can also contribute to raising the risk of stomach ulcers.",
