When it comes to this bilateral issue between the United States and China, which does affect actually other nations, which is China's spy balloons, as the one shot down over the United States was, China says they are not, that these had other purposes for monitoring climate and such. Whether he will mention that in this format is unclear. But U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken is here. He cancelled his trip to China following the shooting down of the Chinese spy balloon. There's a question here, will there be a meeting between them in the margins of this conference? Even that's unclear. We do know Secretary Blinken brought along his foremost policy person on China.

Ukraine saying Russian forces continue to viciously assault Bakhmut and the Donbas region. This Ukrainian unit says they're holding the line but need more firepower.

Mercenaries for the Wagner private military company and their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, we're hoping to push Ukraine's troop troops out of Bakhmut in time for the one year anniversary of the war. But they now admit that's unlikely to happen.A Wagner affiliated social medias channel posted this extremely graphic video, the authenticity of which we cannot independently verify, of alleged fighters asking for more ammo. Every day, we lose hundreds of our comrades in arms. He says. It could have been half as many if our military functionaries had supplied us on time with weapons and ammunitions and the things we needed. Vladimir Putin, meeting with one of his closest allies, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, trying to show he is dealing with a military supply issue. And of course, we will discuss, as usual, the entire range of our relationships, he said, including security issues and military cooperation. Lukashenko then claiming that Belarus, which served as one of Putin's launch pad for the invasion a year ago, will soon start producing warplanes. Yes, the attack aircraft, he said, a real workhorse. We are ready to produce it in Belarus with minor assistance from the Russian federation. Russia is apparently gearing up for a protracted and bloody war, which Ukraine's president warns, might expand beyond Ukraine. It's obvious that Ukraine is not going to be his last stop, Zelenskyy says. If we break, he will consume other countries, including all the other states that, at some point in time were part of the Soviet bloc. Another thing that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at that meeting in Munich is the Ukrainians really need this war to end during the course of this year. He said that modern weapons delivery would be absolutely key to make that happen. But from the Russian side, there certainly is no sign that Vladimir Putin intends to back down. One of the things we're looking at is next week, when Putin is set to hold a key speech here in Moscow. And we'll see whether or not Russia might escalate even further -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.
