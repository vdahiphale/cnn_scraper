Tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden hosts theJapanese Prime Minister at the White House, of course, we'll have more on those high-level diplomatic meetings and that press conference that you heard in the last few minutes. Plus, Israel says it has killed six family members of the political leader of Hamas. Now, the Hamas chief says he will not back down, those details for you, are just ahead. And then Ukraine's leader says his forces can break Russia's backbone if they get the aid they need. CNN's conversation with President Zelenskyy ahead. But right now in Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden has been hosting as you've been watching here on CNN, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a critical summit. Just moments ago, both leaders wrapped up joint news conference that did briefly touch on the war in Gaza and aid for Ukraine. Let's go to Priscilla Alvarez, who has been monitoring that press conference. And Priscilla, well, talk about the war in Ukraine and Israel as well in just a moment. Just talk us through, first of all, what is been announced from the Japanese Prime Minister in terms of cooperation and United States. What did they unveil today?",

And so, there was a wide array of issues that were touched on primarily, for example, the deepening of military cooperation, of course, as there is a resurgent China and amid the heightening complex abroad. But there was also and perhaps related to this, changing the U.S. for structure in Japan, that was quite important going into these meetings as Japan has shifted its defense policy. In addition to all of that, they also discuss space collaboration as well as artificial intelligence research initiatives, all of which the senior or senior administration officials had previewed to reporters that would be part of the dialogue between the U.S. and Japan. And earlier before the press conference and the two during a ceremony also, not a two-some -- more symbolic takeaways. For example, Japan providing more cherry-blossom saplings here in Washington as some of them are going to be chopped down here in the tidal basin for construction purposes. So, all of this to say that this was really a visit that showed how significant this relationship is with Japan. This is a relationship that the U.S. has touted especially on the defense front, but also in the other initiatives that they have worked on together, including, for example, when I mentioned with artificial intelligence. The President, President Biden saying during that press conference, you're seeing images there, that this is -- their relationship is a beacon to the entire world. So, above all else, this was obviously an opportunity for the two to reaffirm that publicly. Also, tonight, they will have -- there will be a state dinner. So, the pop- in circumstance will continue here in Washington as these two leaders continue their dialogue.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they didn't say it in so many words, that this is about standing up to China they made, took care to say this is adefensive alliance between the U.S. and Japan, which it is. But strengthening this alliance is very much about China and about China's military rise and expansion. And you can see it as part of a broader response to China's rise in terms of the U.S. strengthened relationship with South Korea, the tripartite relationship between the U.S., Japan and South Korea. The AUKUS Agreement between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia for submarine technology, all those are pieces of a broader U.S.-led strategy, to stand up to China's expansion, not go to war with it, but increase those defense alliances, but also as both Kishida and Biden mentioned there, it's about trade, it's about keeping shipping lanes open and so on. And we should not forget that they view North Korea as a threat, not on the scale of China, but it's a nuclear power, it's got an expanding missile program of course, very close to Japan, that is a threat, very much at the top -- much at the top of Japan's mind as well. So, this is about that threat. We should also note though, it's about trying to solidify these alliances with a very open question as to how the U.S. will proceed in the world following the November election. Because also on the ballot is Donald Trump, who -- senior advisors of his own have told me, has very little interest in these alliances, and attempt by the U.S. President now to lock those alliances in, in effect prior to whatever the results are of the November election. However, the fact is, U.S. commander-in-chief has enormous ability to enforce or not enforce such alliances. So, it's an open question, and it's one that U.S. allies in Asia and Europe have said to me, and you're hearing more publicly is an issue of enormous concern for them.",

And President Biden had released a statement shortly thereafter, saying that he was quote, \"outraged\", and then that followed with a call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where the President said directly that he wanted to see changes, some of those changes were announced shortly thereafter by or approved, I should say, rather by the Israeli security cabinet that included, for example, opening up a land crossing, opening up a pore to get more humanitarian aid in, and also ramping up supplies. Now, this is something that the U.S. has been watching very closely as the humanitarian situation unfolds in Gaza, the images of the catastrophe that has happened there. And so, this has been front of mind for the president. We have seen a rift between the President and Israeli Prime Minister over time since October 7th. Of course, they -- we talked quite regularly right after the terror attacks. They have talked less often now, and we have seen some of the back-and-forth between the two of them play out privately and publicly. And so, this was a moment where the president when asked about this said and reiterated that he is being blunt with the Israeli Prime Minister who he has a long history with. Of course, we do not know what steps the U.S. would change if Israel doesn't change itself and its policy towards Gaza, but all that remains to be seen.",

The driver of that vehicle was also killed, and now in just the last hour or so, the Israeli military has now confirmed that it carried out that airstrikes, saying that it was targeting these three Haniyeh's sons, Amir Haniyeh, who they say was a Hamas cell commander, Mohammad Haniyeh as well as Hazem Haniyeh. Both of whom the Israeli military calls Hamas military operatives. And so, it's interesting obviously, to see the Israeli military confirming this strike, claiming that these three sons of Ismail Haniyeh, who is the head of Hamas' political bureau, were active military operatives. Now, Haniyeh, for his part said that this would make him quote, \"more steadfast in our principles and adherence to our land.\" And he also suggested that the Israeli military had sought to target his sons directly in order to influence the state of those negotiations. And he said that whoever thinks that this will influence the state of negotiations is very wrong, saying that it will of -- it's delusional, sorry, that this will not force Hamas to back down from their demands. Obviously, this is a very significant strike that the Israeli military has carried out because of the personal connection directly to the head of Hamas who has been involved in these negotiations. It's not clear yet whether the Israeli military was targeting these individuals because they simply believed they were Hamas operatives or because they knew that they were Haniyeh's sons understood the symbolic value of this strike as well. That is one of the questions that I am still asking at this moment, Isa.",

I was also quite surprisedby Volodymyr Zelenskyy, especially despite some of the battlefield problems that they've been having over the past couple of weeks, the past couple of months, of course, they are badly outmanned and outgunned. I would have expected him to be a little more downtrodden, but he certainly was very combative, and actually optimistic in a certain sense as well. He did say that the Ukrainians have a plan to take the fight back to the Russians. But of course, all of it hinges as he put it right now on U.S. Congress. And if, when and what type of weapons they are going to get from the United States. He says that it's very important for the Ukrainians to get ammunition, of course, first and foremost, but also surface-to-air missiles, he says is absolutely key if Ukraine is not only going to survive, but also hit back at the Russians. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): As Russia unleashes barrages of powerful missiles in Ukraine's cities, killing and wounding dozens in the past days, and Kyiv, both outmanned and outgunned suffers setbacks on the battlefield. I asked Ukraine's president about Donald Trump's reported plan if he's elected to end the fighting by forcing Ukraine to give up territory and hand it to Vladimir Putin. (on camera): Would you ever be willing to give up Ukrainian territory for peace? VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): First of all, these signals were on the appropriate media, on the appropriate platforms in the mass media. I did not hear it directly from Trump. His ideas in detail, I did not have the opportunity to talk to him about this topic and his idea of how to end the war. If there's such an opportunity, I will be happy to hear, and I will listen, and we will talk about this topic. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Trump campaign today also denied the former President has agreed to visit Ukraine after reports surfaced he was planning a visit. Zelenskyy says Ukraine will lose the war if Republicans don't approve U.S. military aid fast. Kyiv's army running short on everything, from artillery ammo to air defense missiles.",

They literally showed up because someone reported that they were dating white women. And then they went inside that home, tortured them, sexually assaulted them, beat them over and over, tased them for over two hours. Listen to one of the victims talk about what today meant to him.

That bullet exited out of his cheek, and that's the reason why when state investigators started investigating this, they said, oh, this doesn't make sense, and then this whole case started to fall apart. These men were charged with crimes they did not do. And in fact, one of the deputies even went into the closet to urinate in it. To make sure that when the men got out of jail, the house would smell.

CNN's Nic Robertson tells us that this year in Gaza, it is marked by sadness and loss. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Eid's joys are scarcer in Gaza this year. Celebration eked amidst ruin. Farrah (ph) crying as she recounts finding her beloved Eid clothes in the rubble of her home, then realizing she won't get to wear them. Her family's festivities foregone this year. Thank God we're alive for Eid, her father explains. But we're exhausted and devastated. We should be in our home, comfortable, eating, celebrating. But we're humiliated with nothing. But we still thank God. In the ravaged enclave, millions are clinging to what is unbreakable, tradition. We insisted on praying inside Rafah's Farooq Mosque so all the world knows that we are holding on to our mosques, to our land, to our country, Mustafa El Hallou (ph) from Gaza City says. Hopefully, next Eid, we'll be celebrating inside the mosques near our homes. Eid spirit also being kept alive in makeshift kitchens. Ingredients of everyone's Eid memories donated by charities outside of Gaza. Lovingly crafted into date, sesame and caraway cookies. We're trying to make our kids happy. Remind them of the smell of Eid, Akhlaan Salah (ph) says. They didn't get the traditional new clothes. There is no joy for Eid. No balloons. No sweets. The kids are missing all kinds of delights and happiness. What is in abundance this year, Eid's custom of commemorating the dead. Silent clusters of sorrow surrounding fresh dug soil in other years less tragic than today. Um Ahmed (ph) came with her children. My kids lost their father, she says. When I told them I was going to visit his grave, they told me, mom, we want to come visit baba. This little one was banging on the stone, saying, I want to see baba. He said, who's going to celebrate Eid with me like baba used to? There is no going back. A generation here growing up with new memories of Eid, of suffering and loss. A long time before the joys shared by about 1.9 billion other Muslims around the world become universal in Gaza again. Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the recent figures being reported by COGAT, the Israeli government, need to be further verified. There are valid concerns by the U.N. that the numbers being reported of aid trucks entering are lower than what we've seen. And so, the important point here, I think, is that even if 400 trucks or a little over 400 trucks per day have entered Gaza recently, it's still not enough to meet the growing needs on the ground and to avert famine which is looming now across Gaza. So, for us it's not about the number of aid trucks entering Gaza only. It's also about the volume of aid on the trucks themselves.

And she had been -- she and her male companion had been asking information about this particular location in the days prior to when her body was found. Now, police are still searching for him. We don't have a lot of information. The police have identified her positively. Her family members came down to Italy to identify her, but they have not named him. There has not been an international arrest warrant or anything like that, but there is an ongoing search for him, obviously, to ask any questions about what he might know, or, of course, to see if he was involved in her murder. She bled to death. She was cut -- had several cuts in her neck which -- and her body was drained of blood. Some of that blood was taken from the crime scene, investigators told us, but she was also shot.
