So, where will he -- where will this deal that has close to being reached ultimately lead him?Now, this conference call will occur at about 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time. McCarthy and his team will lay out what essentially has been reached with a handful of holdouts who asked for more power, essentially, give them more sway over the legislative process, more ability to influence things going forward, the ability to oust a sitting speaker by having one member call for such a vote, something McCarthy resisted --",

But no joint intelligence bulletin, no conference call.You hope they've learned their lesson. You hope they're going to do things a little bit better this time, follow your policies, follow your directives. Even internal to the Capitol police, I know they have done some restructuring there to make sure the information gets into those hands that need it to make critical conditions.

That DNA collected from the trash was apparently from the father of Bryan Kohberger and it was a similar enough match to the sheath found on the bed. That is just one key item that we learned in addition to that roommate who also saw the suspect. Apparently, he was around -- she described him in that affidavit as around 5'10, had bushy eyebrows, but he was covered in a mask. His nose and mouth were covered in a mask and he was wearing all black and he walked right past her at around 4:00 A.M. when she heard activity in the home and had heard a voice saying something to the effect, I'm going to help you, coming from another room. We also understand that Kohberger's cell phone activity kind of placed him in the area of the home around 12 times from June until present day. And police also believe that cell phone activity shows that he actually may have gone back to the crime scene hours after the murder took place. Jim and Erica?",

Also, other steps he seemed to take to -- it seems turning off his phone, at other times, as he came close to the house and then turning it back on.When you look at this and you also add in details we learned about what he was studying as a criminology student, what kind of suspect are we looking at here?",
