I'm told that Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as Richard Hudson, who was the head of the House GOP campaign arm, really reach to Trump on a number of key House races and trying to coordinate with him about how they can only keep the House majority, but also expand it, which, of course, is going to be critical for Trump if he wins the White House and wants to enact his legislative agenda.Let me read you part of the statement from Speaker Johnson that he put out on social media, of course, with a picture of him and Trump's smiling and putting up with thumbs-up. Johnson said: Our party is united and working together. I am confident we will send President Trump back to the White House, win back the Senate, and grow our House Republican majority. Now, last week, when Trump was here on Capitol Hill, he did vow behind closed doors to lawmakers that he would do tele-town halls and do anything he can to support candidates. But, of course, he's not going to be an asset in every single congressional race. So another part of this meeting was trying to figure out where Trump could be the most helpful and also ensuring they're aligned because Trump hasn't always been on the same page as Republican leadership. In fact, he is endorsing a primary on it to Bob Good, the head of the House Freedom Caucus, who endorsed Ron DeSantis over Trump and also led the effort to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker. But, of course, this meeting, Jake, also comes in the wake of Trump's hush money conviction in New York and shortly after that verdict, he did call, according to sources, Johnson and say sort of generally, we need to do something about this. Now, perhaps not so coincidentally shortly after that, the Republican leadership in the House began gauging support for a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. That bill we should note had been sitting in committee on a shelf since September. They only pulled up now, in the wake of the verdict, I did ask Johnson if Trump had asked him to act on that bill, but he insisted that this was a member driven effort -- Jake.",

He was brought up Joe Biden himself by saying, I think it'd be appropriate for me to maybe take action after them. So, this is the same type of language we've heard from not just Donald Trump's fiercest defenders, but also from people inside his camp and him directly. Now as we look ahead to the debate, I have been told him my conversations with Trump's campaign that the language around his legal battles and retribution and revenge, they recognize that that's likely to come up. Of course, you're still working on your questions. We'll see what actually ends up being the topics next week, but they have been having policy discussions behind the scenes, including last week, Donald Trump met following his meetings with House and Senate Republicans in D.C. He met with Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Eric Schmitt, as well as his to co-campaign managers to talk about January 6 and how to frame the response and the messaging around that. I'm told they're also doing those policies discussions around this type of language, around retribution, as well as his legal troubles. And so, even though Donald Trump's campaign is arguing they're not actually doing debate prep, they are having these conversations behind the scene and know that they need to figure out what the best languages to message on that for when he is on that stage with Joe Biden.",

And so it's a meticulous job of going by slowly and checking every single area here to make sure that things remain the way they are. This is an area that not only was burned by the fire, but there were also some back burns being done by these firefighters to try to keep the fire line in this area.

So it's just been a difficult day for firefighters. We have not seen a lot of progress when it comes to containment and went from 2 percent to 8 percent. And we did see the acreage increasing. And so, there's clearly a lot of work to be done here. These firefighters, as you see, just working around the clock, Jake.",

Meanwhile, the government of Israel announced a, quote, tactical pause in the fighting in southern Gaza along a key humanitarian aid route.The Israel Defense Forces were quick to point out that that pause in fighting does not apply to Rafah. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in the northern coastal Israeli city of Haifa. Oren, now that there's no war cabinet, how might Netanyahu's approach in Gaza shift?",

Before, he had to confer with his defense minister and Benny Gantz. He is the war cabinet member who resigned just a few days ago when he says Netanyahu had no plan for what the goal was here or for the day after. Now, once Gantz left, there was no need to have a war cabinet. Theonly members were from Netanyahu's own party. So it'll be Netanyahu now, going back to the security cabinet for consultations, and that is sort of an organization that Netanyahu knows well how to control years, even decades of practice. So this becomes much more so now Netanyahu's war, and he will face more of the scrutiny, more of the criticism because of that, we've already seen some of that confusion with this tactical pause. It was decided upon by his own defense minister from his own party. And yet we learned that Netanyahu himself founded unacceptable and only sort of became okay with it. And we have seen it play out id for a couple of days here once he learned that the Rafah offensive would continue, and that too has continued to play out. In terms of the humanitarian corridor itself or rather the tactical pause around that, it's supposed to be 11 hours a day to get more aid in to the European hospital just north of Rafah. The U.N. welcomes it, but says its not enough. Israel says there are a housing trucks waiting to go in.",

For that the Biden administration sent in their envoy, Amos Hochstein, to try to find some off ramp here. But Israeli leaders and officials made it clear that look, this has to end. It either ends diplomatically or it ends militarily. It is the military that is of grave concern because of frankly, Hezbollah strength.

There are six different terrorist organizations in Gaza. The main ones are Jihad and Hamas. Both of them, they are holding some of the hostage. They don't know the exact numbers. Who is dead, who is alive? And that's why they don't come up with a deal, to agree to any deal, they keep rejecting any deal.

It's titled the inside story of Israel's dramatic Gaza hostage rescue. You are report that Israeli intelligence received word of the four hostages and their location on May 12th, almost a month before they were rescued.What was most surprising to you as you reported this intricate operation that Israel engaged into to try to rescue these four hostages? What surprised you the most? Well, I was amazed, first of all, that the joint forces that in my time when I was a commando back in the '70s, we didn't have that privilege to have combined forces to help us to deal with those terrorist organizations in Gaza, all the sophisticated means that we have now, drones and things. And also, there is a new unit come to the picture. In my days, the Shabak/Shin Bet intelligence, their job was to do only to gather the intelligence from the locals, informers from the undercovers, and from others. But these days, there is a unit that is part of the intelligence forces who are actually wearing the same combat gear and they go inside the field to help the ground forces to do the job. And that combination was really surprised me where their success in this, but its not only these operation. There are many others who are not published maybe, that it does those kind of -- this kind of cooperation was really, really successful. Less casualties from the other side, but unfortunately, there was another surprise that I didn't like that I wrote in the article that Israeli forces didn't expect 33 more Hamas fighters in that particularly house where the three hostages were held, when they came in house through the window, they had to -- they had to use a ladder to surprise them through the window and other force went through the main door when they came inside, they did it intend seconds. They got the hostess. I can show you a clip. I have 22nd clip that's showing exactly the operation the interest through the window. The shocked faces of the hostage, and then it was all clear and 1015 seconds. However, when they start the procedure of clearing the house and getting the hostages out of the house to the helicopter, they encountered another 30, 35 other Hamas fighters who were awaiting them outside the house.

The open-source data, the flight path, paints a tale of a lot of demands on the pilots here.The Southwest Boeing 737 MAX 8 coming into land in Lihue, a short flight over from Honolulu, about 27 minutes, a very busy cockpit on those short flights. But add this into the mix. The weather was really bad at the time, low visibility and rain the pilots were set up to come into land, but apparently aborted the landing when they could not see the runway in front of them. It's something called a missed approach, known to be as especially busy time in the cockpit of a large airliner, you typically climb and turn for a point out in the distance, but the data shows the plane continued to descend at about 4,000 feet a minute until that dissent was arrested at only 400 feet above the ground level. The question here will be the cause and the memo reported by these other outlet says, the first officer was flying at the time and may have inadvertently pushed forward on the control column. Here is the statement from Southwest Airlines. It says nothing is more important to southwest than safety. Through robust safety management system, the event was addressed appropriately, as we always strive for continuous improvement, a bit of a circle the wagon statement there from southwest. Similar incident happened on a United Airlines flight back in December of 2022, also in Hawaii, also in bad weather. The NTSB found significant miscommunication in the cockpit? People might be asking if this is a Boeing problem, Jake, but this is not appear to be something like that. Not stemming from Boeing's quality control issues. The FAA is investigating here, but the NTSB says it's not going to take out this investigation. Southwest doing an internal investigation.",
