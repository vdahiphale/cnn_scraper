I'm Eleni Giokos, and this is Connect the World. Happening this hour, the International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent the commission of genocidal acts in Gaza, and to punish any public incitement of genocide. That provisional ruling announced at The Hague a short time ago, with the court concluding that it has jurisdiction over the case brought by South Africa alleging Israel's actions in Gaza could amount to genocide. The court stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. It did order however Israel to submit a report within one month on what it is doing to respond to the Court's order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It says at least 183 were killed over the past day. There is a lot to unpack here. We've got Melissa Bell connecting us from The Hague, Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv, as well as David McKenzie in Johannesburg, all standing by for an analysis. Melissa, let's start off with you. We've just heard from the ICJ that, of course, ruling that just came through immediate measures, it says that Israel must adhere to. Take us through what you've heard.",

It was just short of a ceasefire, of course, that the ruling went, and yet significantly further towards it than any of us had imagined. When these proceedings began, we'd listened on the 10th and 11th of January Eleni, to South Africa, and then Israel lay out their case. And what we just heard today was the Head of the ICJ essentially go extremely far the direction of South Africa, conceding that it was plausible, the genocidal acts were being committed, urging Israel to take immediate measures to ensure that there are no further killings of Palestinians in Gaza group, by the way, that the court recognizes the protected people, nor the further causing of any mental or bodily harm to them. Now, that is short of a ceasefire, but very close to it. And I think this is a ruling that Israel is now going to have to respond to it, had been said the fact that they were chosen to represent themselves as robustly as they did an indication of how seriously they took this course, and its rulings, and no doubt what the wider world will consider as it takes in these proceedings. So, an order that I think will now see a great deal of pressure on Israel, certainly to allow more access to Gaza, and probably, Eleni, to alter the way in which it is perhaps going about its military operation, or certainly the transparency with which it's going about it. The weight of this -- the UN's highest court such that it will be a very difficult ruling for Israel to ignore.",

As Jeremy mentioned,Israel is required to give a report in about a month about how it is going towards meeting those requests, those binding requests of the Court to avoid what the Court says, may at some point amount of genocide as it does its investigation into the horrible circumstances in Gaza. So, from the South African perspective, they will be hoping for the pressure to be piled on to try and improve the conditions of the people in Gaza. It was very telling that when someone asked Naledi Pandor, the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation on the steps of the Court, you know, what does it say about South Africa and Israel? She said, well, this is about the Palestinian people. And as you know, Eleni, the ruling party here has had a long affinity to the Palestinian cause all the way back to and before Nelson Mandela. This is a consistent policy stance by the South African government, and they've put the money where their mouth (ph) is, as it were. She said, they couldn't stand idly by while these alleged atrocities happened. And now, they are going to continue this case in the months and potentially years ahead. I think an important thing to note as well is South Africa says that it wants to pursue this case, also to try and make a statement about bodies like the UN Security Council not being effective in trying to push global cooperation. They said, this venue may be a way to do it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, Israel has repeatedly denied that it is doing anything in the theater of war. And in fact, they've said that they have tried to protect civilians and provide humanitarian aid. It will be really important to see whether the behavior of Israel or the sense of how they are working towards these judgments or at least rulings by the Court play out in the coming days.",

      "sentences": "I think that's an excellent point, Eleni, so much of the 400-page Israeli defense included the publication, the declassification ofgovernment documents, cabinet, war cabinet minutes, instructions given to the military, both civilian and military documents, suggesting that whatever the pronouncements of Israeli politicians had been in public, the fact of the matter is that behind the scenes, Israel had been working hard to ensure the protection of civilian populations in Gaza. And you're quite right, the fact that the Court's President chose to rule out to include in her comments, some of those statements that were made by Israeli politicians that South African lawyers had claimed, were indicative of an intent to clearly state what its intentions were in Gaza, and that those were South African lawyers alleged genocidal, I think that is interesting and an important indication of how the judges felt about the evidence they were presented, both by South Africa and by Israel, so much, by the way of the evidence, the three hour statements that were made here on the 10th of January by South African lawyers, were based upon previous statements by UN Secretary General, UN officials over the course of the many previous decades and years about what was happening in Gaza. And then more specifically, about the then three-months of war that have taken place inside the Gaza Strip, UN officials, UN agencies that had repeatedly been warning of their fears of the potential for genocide, that was at the heart of a lot of what the South African lawyers put forward. And it was picked up on today by the judges. I think another important point to note is that on so many of the accounts that were read out by the ICJ's President, there was essentially unanimity, barring one or two dissenting voices here and there, the 17 judges of this Court were fairly unanimous, in their rulings, again, very much in favor of what South Africa had been requesting the courts to decide, Eleni.",

But at the end of the day, this is an interim verdict. This wasn't a ruling on genocide per se, that could take years. What are people reading into the ability of Israel to take immediate action on what the ICJ has recommended in terms of measures? It needs to start thinking about as it continues this war in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, on your first point, first of all, I mean, these Israeli officials are very much amplifying and echoing the fact that theICJ, in this provisional ruling, did not rule on the merits of the case. And that is something that they are certainly stressing right now. As it relates to the provisional measures, I mean, if you look at them, there are about six different orders that the ICJ has outlined here in terms of steps that Israel needs to take. The sixth step, of course, is that report ordering Israel to commission -- to submit a report to the court within a month as it relates to measures one-through-five. I think if you look at those measures, Israel is going to argue that it's already doing four out of the five. They are going to argue that they are already taking measures to prevent the commission of acts of genocide, they are going to argue that they're already ensuring that their forces don't commit these acts. And they are already arguing that they are providing humanitarian aid. I think the one measure out of those five that Israel has not shown any intent to act on it, and the question will be whether or not they do act on this, is as it relates to public incitement to genocide, because we have seen a number of members of Israel's government make very inflammatory comments as it relates to Palestinians. A few of those comments were read by the Judge on the Court today who was reading that ruling. But the order here from this Court says, to take measures to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to commit genocide. And that's not something Israel has addressed so far. And so, it will be interesting to see, whether or not, in the next month, they take any steps at all to address those kinds of comments by Israeli government officials.",
