It is -- we've seen a sea of people in Moscow defiant and risking their own safety to show up and say goodbye to Alexei Navalny. We have reports of chanting \"We won't forget\" and \"Putin Without -- or \"Russia Without Putin.\"  Alexei Navalny's funeral service has just finished. His body is now atthe burial site. And we've just received an image from inside the service we want to show you, showing Alexei Navalny's open casket covered in flowers as mourners surround it. His mother there as well. And one of Navalny's senior aides said this morning that she hopes his death, quote, \"will become the starting point for the collapse of the Putin regime.\" Joining us now is CNN national security analyst and former CIA chief of Russia Operations, Steve Hall. Steve, just speak to the images that we've seen come out. The crowds that are showing up. The chants that we're hearing from the crowds. What do you think of these scenes? STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER CIA CHIEF OF RUSSIA OPERATIONS (via Webex by Cisco):  You know, Kate, I think what we're seeing is really two very important things from the Russian government. The first is their incredible fear and concern that they have that Navalny's death and the symbolism that goes with that -- the burial, the service -- the church services, and that sort of thing will be a rallying cry and a point where opposition forces that exist inside of Russia will use as an opportunity to try to put pressure on the Putin regime. The other thing that we're seeing, though, sort of on a human level, is the -- is just the lack of humanity. Just the approach that the Russian government has taken. We've seen reporting recently of how difficult it was for the family to even get a hearse to carry Navalny's remains because, of course, If you're in that business and you involve yourself even in a normal just business fashion inside of Russia, you can face retribution from the Russian Security Services. So it's a very nervous time for the Putin regime and it will be very interesting to see what the next couple of days bring.",

About seven days that lawmakers now have to finish up this next tranche of bills, and it is something that Speaker Johnson has been confident that they are going to be able to pull off.But I think what you are hearing from conservatives is two things. One, they're very frustrated. Two, they also realize that this trajectory was one that was set back in June. When the debt ceiling bill passed there were budget numbers put in place that really set this course. And so, many conservatives, while they are saying that Johnson bears some responsibility -- they are also arguing this was a path that Kevin McCarthy started them on, and once they were on it, it was extremely difficult to get off of it. We should also note that some of the frustration coming from conservatives that they are not passing individual bills and that this will likely end up in a situation where they have what are known as minibuses on Capitol Hill -- just larger tranches of spending packages -- that is in part because conservatives blocked a series of individual spending bills on the floor last summer, into the fall. That made it extremely difficult for leadership to move anything with just Republican votes in a narrow majority. So while you're hearing conservatives complain, they are, to some extent, to blame for the fact that those individual bills couldn't pass -- John.",

And that car there is completely burnt out. The entire building -- the inside of it is burned. This roof has collapsed. And there are a lot of structures here in the area that look exactly like this. One thing that's sort of interesting and both bizarre to look at is that as you drive along you see some properties that have been completely destroyed and then you see some others that are still standing.

He is being laid to rest. His body just arrived at the cemetery moments ago.With us now is Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democratic from Connecticut and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, thank you so much for being with us. We've seen remarkable images all morning long of mourners streaming past our reporter Matthew Chance who was standing outside the church where this funeral was taking place. Now, that is when we could see Matthew because, for a time, his signal was blocked or jammed. What does it tell you that his signal was blocked or jammed during the funeral of Alexei Navalny? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, Vladimir Putin is a killer. He is also deeply fearful of his own people and so he is going to do everything possible to squash information getting out about the number of people who are on the streets today. And frankly, all of those individuals are now putting their lives at risk because of the way that Vladimir Putin crushes dissent inside of Russia. Listen, the students of history know that Russian regimes tend to fall during periods of time where Russia overextends its military abroad. These ultimately -- the people -- get fed up that instead of money going to help them, to feed them, to support their kids, it's being used for military adventurism with no real point other than conquest overseas or outside of Russia's territory. So, Putin is worried that as conditions inside Russia worsen and as he spends more money in Ukraine that the people are going to turn on him.

Because he is spending extraordinary amounts of money fighting this war -- money that the Russian people know is not going to them and to their neighborhoods. And so every day that we continue to help Ukraine fight -- first and foremost, that's in service of protecting Ukraine -- but there's no doubt it is also weakening Vladimir Putin's hold on power.
