It has been postponed until Wednesday, at least, over poor water quality levels in the River Seine. This comes despite months of work and over $1 billion  to clean up the river ahead of the games. In addition to polluted waters, France also bracing for extreme heat and more rain today. It's been a tough start for the Paris Games. Joining me now is CNN's Melissa Bell. She is in Paris. \"WORLD SPORT\"'s Coy Wire is also here to discuss the Olympic competitions that are slated for today, he joins us from outside the gymnastics venue. And I'll get to you, Coy, momentarily. Melissa, let's start with you. A French triathlon federation official telling French media, as I understand it, quote, \"There was a bit of anger and disappointment on the part of the athletes as they found out about today's postponed or canceled event. This is quite a blow for organizers. Just explain the history to this. What's been going on and why we've got to this point?",

People had said it couldn't be done. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, had gone herself a couple of weeks ago to show that one of the large infrastructure projects finished just in time, just upstream from where I'm standing, was functioning. The bacteria levels were low enough that these events could take place. But of course, this was always dependent on the weather and French officials haven't had much luck. It's been just three days of dry weather. Because of those showers, those big rainstorms we saw over the course of the weekend, Friday and Saturday, the rain impacts the quality of the water, the bacteria levels. It simply wasn't possible. Huge blow to the athletes involved who were prepared psychologically, physically for this event to take place today. Still, all is not lost. There are still another couple of days this week when they can be moved to. One of the hopes is that tomorrow morning, the men's women and the women's event can take place one after another in the River Seine. So we're going to find out very early in the morning tomorrow. So for now, all is not lost. They're still hoping to have a triathlon but starting to consider whether the possibility of a duathlon might not actually end up being the case.

They're not supportive of Hamas or anything like that. But they're outraged at the way Israel is treating Palestinian detainees. And then you've got that other side of the coin, the much more hardline sort of right-wing, I suppose, aspect of Israeli society, the people for on whom Benjamin Netanyahu depends for his government to continue in power. And they want a much harder-line stance against Palestinians, even harder than the one that's already been adopted by the Israeli state.

Congress has nearlydoubled the budget for the Secret Service over the last 10 years, from $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2014 to $3 billion in fiscal year 2024. Despite this large increase in funding, the number of agents in protective operations has fallen from 4,027 to 3,671 during that same time period, an approximate 9 percent reduction.

That's the first time in a number of years that we've been able to do that. Part of that was gaining some efficiencies in our hiring process. But what I want to emphasize is that we have not dropped standards. Only 2 percent - - 2 percent -- of every applicant actually makes it through the hiring process. We are filling our classes at the federal law enforcement training center. We are doing this ramp-up as part of what lies ahead of us, with the L.A. Olympics in 2028. With respect to what has happened in years prior, this is a difficult and challenging job, being a Secret Service agent; living your life by somebody else's schedule, constantly away from your family, constantly having to meet increased operational and investigative demands, which we gladly do. But it's not for everyone. And I think there are times where people have to make tough choices and they decide to leave the agency. But that doesn't mean that they were any less of an agent or that they weren't committed to the mission. Because we are all committed to being patriots and serving our country and protecting our nation's highest leaders. I think there was a variety of factors -- some of it was the pandemic, some of it was the economy or other opportunities. We have people that are very skilled in cyber that often leave the job. Some of the protective skills that they acquire are also in demand in the private sector. Some of the mechanisms that we've put in place just in the last year is also retaining our workforce and that's what we're focused on right now.",

You've heard from both the FBI and the Secret Service. Bobby Chacon is a retired FBI special agent. He joins us now, live from Palm Springs in California. Let's start with what we've just heard from both the acting Secret Service head and the FBI deputy director. What do you make of what we've heard and what stands out to you? BOBBY CHACON, FBI SPECIAL AGENT (RET.):  Well, first of all, the acting Secret Service director, I think he hit all the points that people were frustrated with. He said there will be transparency. He outlined the problems that happened, why that roof wasn't secured in Butler that day. I mean, he went down the list of all the errors that many of us have been pointing out for the last two weeks. And he said how -- that they would be addressed. And I've been overly critical of the Secret Service since this event happened. But it's been an anomaly because I've worked with the Secret Service before and they are topnotch, they are great at what they do. This particular event, I think, was an anomaly and it sounds like he's going to get to the bottom of how so many things failed that day. And he's going to take corrective action. On the FBI side, you know, they're going ahead with trying to determine this shooter's motivations. They think he acted alone. You just heard senator Graham express some frustration that we can't get into these -- some of these devices, some of these apps. And he's talking to an FBI director that -- I mean, that's deputy director, that we can't do anything about that. That's the law. The law favors privacy and things. So Congress has to take action, not the FBI. The FBI has to work within the framework of the current laws as they exist. And there's always a balance between privacy and liberty and things like that. So I mean, I think the question of the deputy director of the FBI by Lindsey Graham is a little bit misplaced because we have to operate within the law as it exists. And Congress, if they want to address the law, that's up to them.",

That is the most equitable it's ever been at a time when women'ssports, of course, are attracting more and more attention around the world; 46.7 million people watched women's sports on TV in 2023. That's 1 million more than the previous best. And that's just the TV numbers. Despite that, though, female athletes still face many challenges: unequal pay, sexism, lack of opportunities and investment, just to mention a few. Kara Nortman joins us now from Paris. She's the co-founder of Angel City Football Club, which just became the world's most valuable women's sports team. She's also a partner of Monarch Collective, a platform for global sport equity. And we're absolutely delighted to have you on the show. Congratulation on the team. A superb result for you and I know how much work has gone into just putting women's sport on your part on the map. Let's talk about what's going on at the Olympics; 49 percent of those competing are women. That is fantastic. Is it enough, though? Have we done enough at this point? And what sort of challenges still remain?",

And I believe back then,  23 percent of athletes were female. So we have to celebrate this milestone, being at close to 50-50 for the first games that have it. But it's never enough. Now we get to redefine what equity means. We should look at viewership. Do more people watch gymnastics or female swimmers? Do more people watch the U.S. Women's national team or the U.S. -- or all the -- all the different athletes? I was at tennis last night, seeing players from Spain and the Ukraine. So I think it's time maybe to redefine equity and understand what it means that the business ranks, where the IOC has done great work but continue it, like let's not settle for 50-50. Why shouldn't it be 60-40 female athletes if we like to watch them more? Which we might.",

But to pay the women, we also need to get big media deals and continue to put butts in seats at stadiums. We have a long way to go and we have to do it together.

So the media dollars are catching up; over $2 billion will go to the WNBA over 11 years. But how do we, how do we get to 70? We just actually create distribution, allow the fans to build a connection to the teams and the players. And then go to social media, follow these players. The top eight of them the 10 social media athletes, I'm told, at the Olympics are women. And I always say it's, we just have twice as many words as men. (LAUGHTER)",
