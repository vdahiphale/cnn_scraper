And we begin with the horrific hospital blast in Gaza City which has killed 471 people according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.The U.S. now says intelligence suggests Israel is not responsible for the explosion as officials in Gaza have claimed. Instead, President Joe Biden echoed the explanation from Israel saying the hospital explosion was the result of an errant rocket fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. New video from Al Jazeera appears to show a rocket fired from Gaza explode in flight above Gaza City on Tuesday. Moments before the hospital blast, just a few seconds later, you can see large explosions on the ground. It's not clear at this point if these events are related. The Palestinian Red Crescent reports explosions near another hospital in Gaza City. The group says the blast targeted residential buildings on the main street in the area. The Red Crescent says Israel ordered the group to evacuate the hospital on Saturday. Meanwhile, Egypt says it will start allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. President Biden says 20 trucks will pass through the Rafah crossing possibly on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And CNN's Matthew Chance shows us the chilling evidence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): CNN has gathered chilling new insights and details on the Hamas assault inside Israel.

Searches of their dead bodies revealing a trove of highly specific Hamas battle plans, including these detailed maps now shared with CNN by the Israeli government. Showing communities near Gaza like Kfar Aza targeted by the attackers. These were the terrifying scenes inside as a mass gunman recorded themselves moving freely through the gardens of Israeli home. Code red, code red, the Israeli loudspeaker blares in Hebrew, punctuating the sporadic gunfire. After the attack, Israeli first responders saw bullet holes and bloodstains in room after room in what looks like a coldly methodical killing spree. CHANCE (on camera): But while hundreds of Israelis were killed, some Israeli communities managed to repel the Hamas gunman and save lives. The Kibbutz Beth-El scene also near Gaza, residents pushed back Hamas attack and found documents on the bodies of the militants they killed with disturbing highly accurate intelligence on their homes.

And this is a call for caution for all people that are following the situation, not to listen to what Hamas is saying. This is an organization that butchers babies in their bedrooms. They'll have no problem lying to journalists, or fabricating stories, or inventing stories.So I would say, yeah, when we try taking out of the real world to the media reflection of what's happening in the real world, there's a lot of caution and suspicion that needs to be taken regarding Hamas and the reports that are coming out from Gaza, because everything is under control there. Just like in North Korea. There is no free press, there is no free coverage. When it filters over beyond the region, of course, then there is the world networks that have a huge responsibility to make sure that they have all of the facts, because if things that Hamas is saying ignite mass protests because of something that didn't happen, like the explosion in the hospital, it was caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket that malfunctioned, then we have to be very aware, and I would say even afraid, that that eventuality can happen. This just goes to show that in this day and age of the media- saturated, or social media-saturated world, how much responsibility individuals have, how much responsibility we have as responsible organizations, bodies, how much responsibility the media has in convening what is actually happening on the ground in order to contain fabrications, misinformation, and disinformation that can be aggravated in order to create a much broader regional distress. We've talked about, Rosemary, over the attacks on the border with Lebanon by Hezbollah, and we know for a fact that Iran are trying to aggravate the situation. So there's an interest to try and make a broader issue out of this attack against our people. And we need to be very focused, and I'd say from our perspective try and contain that, be factual, be accurate, be timely, and this perhaps is always the challenge when social media is setting the pace, and we are trying to keep up with images that are very dramatic, and I would say extremely painful and heartbreaking.

Generally, many of them seem to be dug by hand, relatively small, and then they're reinforced with concrete so they can't easily be collapsed. How big is this network?Well think about this, Gaza itself is only about 25 by six miles, and yet the indication from some experts says there may be more than three hundred miles of tunnels underneath that. The depth, unknown. Maybe it's a few meters, maybe it's a whole lot more. And many of them appear fairly cramped. Possible uses? Well, hiding command centers, weapons caches, rocketry, and yes maybe even hostages. Secret movement of key Hamas figures, so they might be in this part of the area, and go to this part of the area and be undetected because they can't be spied by satellites or people who are trying to look with drones or anything else. And they would represent a safe place in this small area. Relatively safe, in that a lot of conventional weapons would not easily penetrate this. But in fact you might have to bring in bigger, sort of bunker buster bombs if somebody really wanted to be able to go through the reinforcement and of all of the earth to get underneath.

And do you assume they are all being held in the underground tunnel system in various locations?O'LEARY: So traditionally speaking, Hamas has treated their hostages well. They are currency for Hamas. You know if you reflect back to one of their more infamous cases where they took a Israeli soldier, they held him for over five years, but then traded him years later for over a hundred Palestinian prisoners. So it is in their interest to treat the hostage as well. Secondly, because there is international hostages who have dual citizenship from places like the United States, the UK, France, and others, there is an international call to ensure that they are being treated well. So the assumption would be, they are treating them well. Hamas, like other groups who have demonstrated a capacity and almost a profession in hostage taking over the years, have this down to a science. And although they are not rational actors in many other ways, they will act in a rational way this way because it's transactional.",

Number one, both Israel, the UnitedStates that has surged intelligence resources to assist and other international partners, they're looking to fully identify each hostage, going through that initial video feed from each of the capturers, some of which was taken on other cell phones, some of it was broadcast by Hamas. All of that data is being exploited, they are trying to fully identify each hostage. But they are also trying to identify Hamas members, and illuminate the network we call it, to try to find out who they're connected to, what their historic bed down locations are, to try to find out where the hostages may be taken.
