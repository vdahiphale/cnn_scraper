      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, this morning the Fetterman campaign is obviously quite delighted with this outcome. They told me last night that they were very confident in what they had done in the last five days. They really felt like they had closed out the last five days in the strongest way possible. They actually pointed to that endorsement from Oprah Winfrey as helping them with suburban women. That's a target demographic. I'll come right back to that because it played in last night. And then also the rallies with former President Obama and President Biden.They also really believed that Mehmet Oz undercut his own message of being a moderate by appearing at that rally with President Trump and standing on the same stage as him. So they felt confident, but they said to me, we think it's a jump ball. That all changed once the numbers started coming in last night. And they were specifically watching some bellwether counties to see if they could outperform what President Biden did in 2020 when he won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and then also too if they could keep Oz's margins down in what's known as the t, essentially draw a t over Pennsylvania. That's what started to happen. And so once they saw like Erie County coming in, I'm told, and then Montgomery County, which is suburban women, it's those Philly suburbs, that's when they knew they had it. They were really excited about it. As for the gubernatorial race, also worth noting, Josh Shapiro beating election denier Doug Mastriano by a very sizable margin here. [09:35:05] Anderson.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, you know, I think one of the big questions coming into this election, you know, you spoke about on your panel, it was abortion versus inflation. The idea was essentially that inflation would run away and be the most important issue to voters. But take a look here, they were about equal as the most important issue. Inflation at 31 percent, abortion at 27 percent.And I think there was also this idea, OK, maybe Democrats won't turn out, but take a look at the turnout by the 2020 presidential vote and I think this gives you an understanding that, in fact, Democrats were turning out to vote because it turns out that amongst those who voted in this election, what you saw was it was 48 percent of those who turned out in this election and voted for Joe Biden, versus 44 percent who voted for Donald Trump. That four point margin looks very similar to what we saw two years ago. So, Democrats were, in fact, motivated to turn out to vote. Now, I think there's also this question of Joe Biden. How much was Joe Biden a drag on Democrats? So, if we look at the exit poll, what you see is Joe Biden was not a popular guy. His unfavorable rating was at 56 percent. Just 41 percent of voters who voted yesterday said they had a favorable opinion of Joe Biden nationally. And let's look at those who said they had an unfavorable rating. How did they vote? Well, they voted overwhelmingly Republican. Look at that, that margin, 85 percent to 14 percent. And I want you to keep that in mind when we think about the former president, Donald Trump, how much of a motivator was he? Well, he was actually more unpopular than Joe Biden. Look at that, a 39 percent favorable rating to just a 58 percent unfavorable. Fifty-eight percent unfavorable. That is huge. And look at those who had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump, how did they vote? They voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, 77 percent to 20 percent. So, it was basically this canceling out, right, where both Joe Biden and Donald Trump were disliked and they were pretty much equal in the minds of voters and that's why I think Democrats held their own yesterday, Anderson.",

You saw a lot of split ticket voting, where folks were saying, you know, I like a little bit of this and a little bit of that. And it reminds us that we are not as polarized as a lot of the narratives say we are. And I also want to say that, you know, a lot of the preconceived notions of what the middle looks like, I think got busted. You look at John Fetterman, who's not supposed to win statewide in a state like Pennsylvania, who's clearly a progressive, who clearly believes in Medicare for all. And he won. And so it says a lot about the way that the narrative might just not be right.
