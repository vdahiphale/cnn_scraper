      "sentences": "Hello all. Welcome to First Move. Great to be with you this Thursday and a Happy Thanksgiving to all of our viewers inthe United States and beyond those who celebrate it. The Wall Street, therefore, is closed while U.S. investors enjoy their turkey and trimmings a day after stocks posted some pretty solid winnings, tied to hopes the jumbo Fed rate hikes are in the final innings. Why? Well, the latest Federal Reserve minutes out on Wednesday suggests the U.S. central bank may be poised to reduce the magnitude at least of upcoming rate hikes. That doesn't mean that borrowing costs won't still rise, of course. Rather, they may just go up in small increments than we've seen over the last six months or so. That potential rate revaluation helping boost the mood in Europe at least, with stocks there hovering near three-month highs, fresh number showed improved German business confidence also helping the sentiment there too and also, of course, I think, having offset the ongoing concerns about China's rise in COVID cases on what is going to be ultimately required to suppress the disease. Chinese stocks falling a quarter of a percent today as cases rose to all- time highs, outbreaks reported across multiple cities as factory workers pushed back too against health restrictions. We will discuss this complex and ever shifting picture with special guest Michael Pettis, a senior at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who will join us later on in the show from Beijing. But, first, power is slowly returning to some homes in Ukraine after further massive attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. The death toll too has risen to ten after Russian strikes across the country on Wednesday that plunge thousands of homes into darkness and left many without water. Meanwhile, thousands of mineworkers were trapped also where they were working. In fact, 3,000 miners have subsequently managed to escape from underground. But that was earlier today. Matthew Chance has the details from Odessa, Ukraine.",

You have got thousands of people on the move, moving from their sort of war- torn frontline locations to big cities like Odessa, where they can at least get some kind of relief, some shelter, some food, some electricity provided by generators. We're in a reception center right here in the middle of Odessa, and there's a bit of big crowd of people. There're about 500 to 700 families from all over Ukraine that come here to try to get food and water and sort of basic sanitation supplies as well. It's a big center. Actually, you have some people here, some of the stuff they've picked up. Can I have a look at what they've got? This woman here is from the Donetsk Oblast. Of course, that's one of the main centers of the fighting. She's come here several hundred kilometers, miles away. And she -- all right, some sweet corn or some -- whatever it is, beans. I specified can of beans, some oil, some washing up liquid here, toothpaste. A lot of this, of course, from USAID, from the United States. But there are other donors from around the world and from private companies as well. It is all sort of helping scratch the surface at least of providing some support for these people, but the big problem is the missile strikes from Russia are continuing, electricity and water systems are being pounded by the Russians. And it means that with every day that passes this humanitarian crisis, the shortages are getting worse and worse.",

They have been divided on this for many weeks -- I was going to say, all week -- for many, many weeks now. Emotions have really run high. I'm actually going into the meeting this morning. It was always interesting looking at the doorsteps and the arrivals, but the (INAUDIBLE) prime minister said it would be, quote, spicy. The Maltese energy minister said the proposal wasn't, quote, fit for purpose. And this was the perhaps most telling doorstep of all from the Belgian energy minister. Take a listen.

That is actually really high. So, lots of people said, well, actually, that is never really going kick in. So, what good is it, which is probably those people saying it is not fit for purpose. Some, of course, in the E.U., many actually, really opposed the concept of a cap on gas prices, full stop on the basis largely that it does not do anything to reduce gas demand, which is a very important tool at the moment dealing with the energy crisis. And some would actually rather see a completely different sort of cap. So, similar to what you see in Spain and Portugal, perhaps putting a cap on the gas prices from energy suppliers when it is used to generate electricity and having consumers pay for the subsidies. They are kind of leaving out the state, leaving out the wholesale market. So, many different proposals, so many member states completely at loggerheads, really, and really quite emotional about it. They feel very strongly about this. And I very much question how they will come to an agreement, and actually less than a month for that next meeting. Julia?",

So, after those days of violent clashes, Foxconn trying to quell the chaos there, offering the equivalent of $1,400 for those workers to quit and leave. Now, those workers, they were angry about wages, dirty living conditions, chaotic COVID rules. And we obtained more video today showing how those protests turned violent. We learned that squadrons of riot police arrived. In one video, we could see a group of police in white hazmat suits beating the workers with batons and metal rods. We found other video showing workers tearing down COVID barriers, masses of them throwing these little bars and metal parts towards please. Foxconn wanting to quell the situation, but this, of course, puts more pressure on Apple, the Foxconn supplier. They need these workers ahead of the key holiday season. Now, these types of public displays of dissent, they are rare in authoritarian China, but we have been seeing more instances of clashes between law enforcement and people in China because of these harsh COVID-19 lockdowns, people still in China struggling to get access to food, necessities and critical medical care during the lockdown. In fact, recently I visited one man in Beijing who is grieving right now over the death of his father. And he blames his father's death on the country's zero COVID policy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANG (voice over):  They sit together sobbing, shaking, looking at photos of his father, her husband, and mourn his death at their home on the outskirts of Beijing. The local government killed my dad, he tells me, breaking down in tears. I just want to get justice for my dad. Why did you look us down? Why did you take my dad's life away? His 58-year-old father needed emergency medical help when their building was locked down. He says there were no COVID cases in the building, but China seals off entire neighborhoods even when there are only suspected cases nearby.

It took us about five minutes to get from his house to the hospital less than 2 miles away. When his father was sick, he had four relatives waiting outside of this building begging to go in and drive him into the hospital but they would not let them in. He says authorities in the hospital gave him no explanation for why the ambulance took so long. All they gave him was this document stating the date and the time of his father's death.

China carefully counts every COVID death butnot countless people who died because they could not get emergency care during lockdown. Authorities have acknowledged many of those cases, but they usually blame poor enforcement of zero COVID instead of the policy itself. Before his father's death, he fully supported the country's zero COVID policy. But the local government execution of the policy is beyond reasoning, he says. It is inhumane. He shows me his favorite picture of his father surrounded by family. His son who was closest to his grandfather now struggles to eat or focus, he tells me. The quarter of his room piled with lettuce, potatoes, leaks and canned food. He says all of this food here is in case they get locked down again. The corn planted by his father is one of the few things he left behind. His grief now mixed in with fury. He struggles to comprehend the meaning of it all, his father in the name of zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) WANG (on camera):  And, Julia, this man told me that all throughout the pandemic, for this whole three years, he had a lot of faith in the country's zero COVID policy. He believed it was saving China from a massive amount of deaths. But after this experience, he is struggling to comprehend how a policy that the government claims is to save people's lives is causing so much tragedy, because for three years, we have been reporting on stories like this over and over again, people who have died, young and old, because they could not get that emergency carry fast enough during lockdown. And what is causing so much anxiety right now in China is that people don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Nobody knows when all of this is going end.

And we've long talked about this need for a greater rebalancing and for sort of the consumption and the consumer side to play more of a role in the economy.

In the rest of the world, mature economies typically invest around 20 percent of GDP on average. And if you look at high investing developing countries in the midst of their growth boom, they're typically investing 30, 31 percent of GDP. China is not in the midst of its growth boom. We're definitely on the slowing downside of it. But China, nonetheless, invests about 42 percent of its GDP, in other words, a third more than high investing rapidly growing economies. And that's simply not sustainable. In fact, we know of the consequence has been, which is basically been for 15 years as more and more of this investment is non-productive, investment in the property sector and in infrastructure, China's debt burden has really surged. So, one way or another, they have to bring investment down. And if you bring investment down, the problem is that because it's such a powerful engine of growth within China, bringing it down means growth will slow significantly. And the only way really around that is if you could get a significant surge in consumption, which is really tough to do. But the problem that we're seeing in China is that we are not even getting reasonable growth in consumption. The growth and consumption has really stagnated.

I know there was a great deal of disappointment because a lot of the favored reformers were moved out and replaced by loyalists. But I think we overestimate the range of options that China has and, therefore, the impact of a good policy versus a bad policy. The fact is China has really limited options. It's got to bring investment down. And the main policy decision there is bring it down more quickly or bring it down more slowly. And as you bring it down, that's going to drive growth down with all of the consequences. So, you have to bring up consumption, which is also very difficult to do. So, in a funny way, you might argue that a more sort of less fractious politburo might actually be slightly better for China simply because of the -- in order to get consumption up, there has to be really major income transfers mainly from local governments to households. And it would be really surprising if local governments didn't oppose that pretty ferociously.

They pay that fee and that covers all their all-inclusive fees for the whole year. So, that's all their food and beverage, activities, use of the wellness center, bowling alley, the golf simulator, you name it, everything that's on board that you could possibly want, access to all of those things.",

Thank you so much for coming to talk to us about it today, Alister Punton, founder and CEO of Storylines, thank you. All right, from a nonstop cruise to a meal we can't refuse. It's Thanksgiving Day in the United States and I am thankful to be with all of you every day. I'm also very thankful to once again be presenting our yearly look at the tasty stocks investors that have been feasting on in 2022, as well as the unappetizing corporate turkeys. Let's call them that. First up, investors giving thanks to the energy sector ranks. Energy, as you would perhaps imagine, the best performing U.S. stock sector with Occidental and Constellation up 130 percent-plus since January. Some phenomenal pharmaceuticals too, Merck and Bristol-Myers, two sector winners, up more than 25 percent. IBM, a rare tech outperformer, two shares truly computing, up 11 percent, as revenues there rebound. The rest of tech, well, feeling a little bit, shall we say, featherbrained. Meta, the worst performing, off more than 65 percent, as advertising sales slow, investors clamoring for less Metaverse spending. Over there too, Netflix streaming less than gleaming, call it a crown frown or a royal ruckus, with shares down more than 50 percent year-to-date. And even blue chips have been whipped, manufacturer 3M suffering an almost 30 percent postage note plunge, the soaring dollar weighing on foreign earnings there. And, finally, stored (ph) returns at U.S. auto giants Ford and G.M. amid rising recession fears. And we aren't done yet with the winners and losers in a World Cup whipsaw, Japan defeating Germany on Wednesday by two goals to one, their first ever victory over the four-time world champions. And fans are eagerly awaiting the tournaments debut of Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo after he and his club, Manchester United, parted ways earlier this week. World Sports Amanda Davies is live from Doha with all of the action for us. Amanda, one of the best things about the World Cup is we get to speak to you just about every day. And I tell you what. Never mind the football, the Japanese fans tidying up after themselves were some pretty iconic images, never mind the win of the game.",
