And we wanted to highlight some of the lesser impressive rainfall totals but they are impressive because they're breaking daily rainfall records but also it's never rained this much in the month of August. Keep in mind, this is generally a dry area for this time of year. San Diego, their wettest day in nearly six years Long Beach in Los Angeles also setting daily record rainfall rates -- rainfall totals, I should say, from yesterday. This is in the past 24 hours. 7 million Americans or 8 million actually currently under a flashflood warning, this includes portions of Los Angeles County. I want to highlight this area because we have the transverse range. This is a mountain range located across Southern California. And this water has literally been piling up across this area, just the rainfall kind of bands just working in perpendicular to this mountain range.

This is according to a senior law enforcement source with knowledge of the surrender, because this time, the former president will appear in Georgia where he's facing charges related to 2020 election interference.The Fulton County district attorney has set that deadline for Friday for Trump and his 18 co-defendants to surrender at that jail. Joining us now with what we can expect, what does that actually look like when someone surrenders themselves at the Fulton County Jail is retired Fulton County Sheriff's Office Lieutenant Charles Rambo. Lieutenant Rambo, it's good to have you. This jail is notorious. Is that the right word for it? There have been a lot of issues with it. There's been DOJ complaints against it. What is this going to look like when Trump in particular walks in there sometime this week? CHARLES RAMBO, RETIRED LIEUTENANT, FULTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: Well, provided that he has already been served an indictment, persons who surrender themselves normally will come in through the front door. We have to remember also, again, we're talking not someone who should be under the presumption of innocence as he walks into the door. And when he comes in along with other officials, they would be pat down, led to the booking office in the rear. From there, they probably will have to have ties and shoestrings and all those type of things taken. Then from there, the persons would be fingerprinted, given a booking photo and then having to spend some time possibly for NCIC and GCIC checks. Again, for the purposes of safety, it is highly recommended, and I do not speak on behalf of Sheriff Pat Labat, but just from my own experiences in dealing with dignitaries and high-profile persons who come into jail, it's best to just get those persons booked in as rapidly as possible and get them released, because you don't want the jail to become more of an international theater than it has become here recently.",

These are things that are documented as well that have been shown on network television. It's a jail that dysfunctionally has been that way, honestly, since we opened it. I helped to open the jail in 1989. But I can also remember between 2009 and 2016, when we got it from up under federal consent decree and got it rolling into the right direction. It is my prayer that this sheriff will be able to get that done so that people, again, whether it's the persons who are getting ready to come in now or even our locals, everyone will be able to come in for a fast and speedy process so they can get their day in court.",

But, particularly, I think this is really the biggest, most detailed Iowa poll that has been done to-date.And it just indicates a few things. It first indicates that his support with these indictments both hardens and increases. That was one of the notables in the Iowa poll that I pulled out of that.",

And so that's something that I imagine Trump's team is going to be keeping an eye out for because, you know, you just never know. We still have a lot of time and so you have to see if something does happen, if one of these indictments long-term does start to stick. People are still considering Ron DeSantis, even as Trump is a very clear frontrunner as of now.",

I mean, if we look at 2016, Ted Cruz won Iowa and Donald Trump ran away with the nomination.I want to talk about this Truth Social post where he says he's not doing the debates, plural, right? So, maybe he's talking about the two that have been announced, this one coming Wednesday and on the 27th. But is it plausible that he could just say, I'm not doing primary debates because I'm so far ahead of you, they would probably be legally problematic anyway with all the cases and still go on to win this nomination?",

So, he's trying to give the sense that this is inevitable, right, that his nomination, this is all inevitable. The primary is essentially over. It's time for him to pivot to Joe Biden.
