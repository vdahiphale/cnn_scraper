Mark, thanks for joining. So a recent CNN poll shows there remained doubts among voters about how Vice President Harris will handle the economy. Among likely voters, 50 percent trust former President Trump more to handle the economy. Only 39 percent trust Harris and for all the concerns that are top of mind for voters, 41 percent of voters say the economy is the most important issue. This is one of the reasons why this race remains so close. Why do you think she is struggling so much to close the deal on this issue? MARK CUBAN, ENTREPRENEUR &amp; INVESTOR: I don't think she's struggling at all. It just takes time. She's been in the race, what, 45, 50 days? She went from having horrible favorability polling to, you know, lack of recognition. But in those 45, 50 days, she's turned to completely around. Donald Trump really is the one that should be worried. When it comes to the economy, she was 20, 30 points behind 45 days ago. Now, the trend is her friend and she's catching up. And I think her speech today went a long way to really convey to voters that she is pro-business, that she wants to partner with businesses, that she wants to incent businesses. Look at Donald Trump. He's threatening one of the most legendary companies in America, John Deere, with 200 percent tariffs that would make buying from China cheaper than buying from John Deere. That's insane. So he's looking to just throw just beat down how an American companies while Vice President Harris is saying, look, we want to work with you. I want to talk to you. I want to learn from you. I want to incent you to continue to grow. I wanted to help you incorporate new technologies like A.I., and Blockchain and others so that we can compete better. I'm a big fan and I think as more people learn that she truly is pro-business and about more of her policies. I think that 39 percent that will grow considerably.",

As long as you know, is she -- as long as you hear from her, what you need to hear before you walk into the ballot booth. That's all that matters.You've got 40 days and I think she's going to do a lot more communicating like she did today to explain to them that she's pro- business, that she can think on her feet. That's responsive. That she's thorough. She's not impulsive like Donald Trump. She thinks through her policy. She's very deliberate and I think businesspeople and I think voters in Texas and across the country are going to start to really recognize that that's a huge positive over somebody who just invents new tax policy because he thinks it'll get a good share out -- out of a crowd.",

When she -- one of the things that really resonates with young man, and I have a 15-year-old son, is crypto. And she talked specifically about encouraging Blockchain innovation and that that was important to her and that she was going to be supportive of it. That's really important to young men and I think as she does that message starts to get out more and more. It'll start to resonate with young men even more.",

And when those disasters happen, she wants to be in a position to be able to say, no, you can't jack up those prices by 40 percent. You have to stay within a particular realm, a particular guideline.And by the way, there are already 37 states that have similar guidelines. All she's doing is saying were just going to make that a national law. So, that's certainly not price caps or price controls at all. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is the king of price caps.",
