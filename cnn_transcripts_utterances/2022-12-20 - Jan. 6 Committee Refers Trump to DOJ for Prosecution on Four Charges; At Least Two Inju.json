He knew that the mob he was addressing on the Ellipse included armed individuals. He wanted to go with them.He sicced the mob on Mike Pence after the violence had begun, Ana. He did nothing for three hours to stop it. He said words of love to the insurrectionists when he did speak. That's a tight case. As a prosecutor, you're looking for a tight case. Toughest case is the insurrection case, but that's very important because it sets up disqualification of Trump on ballots, even if it's the hardest criminal case it may get in the way of him running for president under the 14th Amendment.",

We were told that at least two people were hurt. There are widespread power outages and some damage, including a bridge that cracked.CNN's Veronica Miracle is in San Francisco. Veronica, what exactly happened? Where did this earthquake hit? VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ana, this happened near the community of Ferndale in this rural coastal community up in Humboldt County. About 70,000 people remain without power eight hours since this hit. That's 70 percent of Humboldt County, a rural area, but a lot of widespread damage. This is the largest earthquake to hit the state of California since 2019 when there was an earthquake in Ridgecrest. And authorities are saying, they're asking people to access the damage and be careful as they go about their way and go through the community because there are debris - there's debris on the roadways. There's cracks in at least one bridge, Fernbridge that you see and that runs through the community of Ferndale. They've had to shut that down and access the damage. The CHP working on that. There's been reports of at least two injuries. And the damage that we've seen in storefronts and at homes, you see a lot of just toppled furniture destroyed, family heirlooms destroyed, shelves knocked over, people really rattled and shaken when they were awoken this morning. And authorities are warning people, be prepared for aftershocks as you assess the damage, as you clean up. They're asking people not to call 911 unless there's an immediate threat. Ana?",

We've been telling you about the growing demand for children's pain medicine as flu, COVID and RSV all surge right now across the country in addition to other viruses.Walgreens and CVS are now limiting the number of bottles shoppers can purchase because of the shortage right now, the demand is so high and Dr. Tara Narula is here with us now. So if a parent or a caregiver needs this medicine and they can't get their hands on it, what do they do? Are there alternatives? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you and I were just talking. It's really hard when you see your child sick, especially with a fever, for example, and they feel so unwell and your instinct is to give them those medications and when you don't have it it can be really frightening. And so I think, you know, there are other things that parents know that they can do. They want them to know they can do. They don't always have reach for the medication. Certainly there are alternates. So you can use Tylenol and you can alternate that with Motrin or Ibuprofen. You just look at the hours. So some are every four, some are every six. You don't always have to give medication. So just because your child has a fever, unless they're really under two months and have a temperature over 100.4, if they're eating, drinking and active you don't have to give them the medication. You can use things like cold compresses, making sure to take off their clothing, keep them kind of in cool clothing, keep the room cool, a lukewarm bath. Important, not a cold bath.",

And also important, no aspirin as well in kids under 18. That can, in some cases, cause a rare syndrome called Reye's syndrome, which has to -- basically causes liver and brain inflammation. So those are two important no-nos.But in general if there's any questions just pick up the phone, call your pediatrician and then also smaller pharmacies, as well, may have these drugs that some of the bigger chains may be limiting.",

They're vomiting or having diarrhea, those are, kind of, the things that we look for that are lethargic. So they can kind of walk you through the warning signs or if the temperature is very, very high.
