The President spoke for about 11 minutes from the Oval Office, with his family also in the room, including First Lady Jill Biden, as he really offered his first fulsome remarks relating to his decision to leave the 2024 race.Now, Biden made no mention of the Democratic pressure campaign he was facing over the course of the past month, as many Democrats publicly expressed their worry that Biden would be able to campaign effectively or beat Trump in November's election. Instead, Biden really tried to portray this moment and decision as an attempt to unite the country and preserve the very democracy he has been fighting for throughout his presidential time in office, as well as campaign.

Now, Biden has said he'll will also focus on foreign policy issues during his final months in office as well.And the President also used this speech as an opportunity to praise his Vice President Kamala Harris, who will now lead the Democratic ticket. He painted her as capable and experienced and a leader for this country. He ultimately urged Americans to make their choice in the election, one that he hopes will preserve democracy after November. But, for President Biden, this speech really marks the first step in what's expected to be a long goodbye, as he has another six months left in office.",

He is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here for a meeting. It comes just two days after the President has said he thinks they are on the verge of striking some type of deal to end the conflict in Gaza, as well as return hostages back home to their families. So, this meeting is coming at a consequential moment, as the President is hoping to discuss those ceasefire negotiations directly with Netanyahu. Of course, this will be the two -- first meeting in person between the two men since Biden visited Israel in the days after the October 7 attack by Hamas. Of course, the two men have had a very complicated relationship, and the entire approach to the conflict in Gaza has been a key concern for members -- voters within the Democratic coalition. This is something Biden is eager to try to find an end to the conflict, as he is winding down his time here at the White House.",

And I think one of the things that he did not say, he did not say the word \"hostage deal\". And if you go and ask many of the hostage families who were in the gallery and listened to what he said, they were extremely, extremely frustrated and disappointed by the speech when Netanyahu did not say that he is going to push for a deal.

It is the first time that the U.S. has seen the Russian and Chinese bombers actually operating together in Alaska's Air Defense Identification Zone, which is technically international airspace and therefore didn't pose a real threat to the U.S. and Canada at any point, but still, very notable. And the U.S. and Canada clearly felt the need to respond to it by scrambling F-16 and F-35 fighter jets on the U.S. side, and F-18s on the Canadian side. Now China, its defense ministry said in a statement earlier today that this was part of the normal kind of strategic cooperation that China and Russia are undergoing at this point in terms of cooperation between their two militaries.But, it really is concerning to U.S. defense officials, particularly the commander of Northern Command, who has said in recent months that he believes that the Chinese are going to try to be operating more in Alaska -- around Alaska in the Arctic in the coming months and years, especially as they continue to try to work more closely with Russia's military. As we have seen, the Russian and Chinese militaries, they have started to work more closely together and coordinate more closely, really, in the last several years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and China has been helping Russia's military support itself in that conflict. And so, this is a pretty ominous sign of that increased coordination between these two militaries. But again, the U.S. saying that at no point that they pose any threat, but of course, in order to send a message to the Russians and the Chinese that the U.S. finds this concerning, they did scramble those fighter jets to try to intercept them. The Russians have done this before. The Chinese have not. So, that is what makes this very significant at this point. Clearly, the Russians and the Chinese were trying to convey some kind of show of strength here to the U.S. and Canada, something that the U.S. felt it needed to respond to, Fredricka.",

The FTC pushing back in a statement, telling CNN that Lina Khan is honored to serve in this administration, and arguing that she has worked to protect consumers, protect workers and entrepreneurs from corporate abuses. And it is worth noting that Lina Khan has won praise from many on the left, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for taking on dominant companies, whether it's Big Oil or Big Tech.
