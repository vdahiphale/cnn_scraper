One Republican saying. \"Once the barn doors are open, so to speak, the horses are out.\"Here's the challenge though, for Republican leaders over the course of the next several weeks. They have to convince a number of their members who won in districts that Biden won back in 2020 that this is a smart electoral move for them. Because usually, when you open an impeachment inquiry, you have a vote on the House floor into that matter. And the House Republicans have just a narrow majority, which means McCarthy is going to have to convince his members to get behind this push. One of those members who won in Biden's district back in 2020, Don Bacon, had this to say. \"Did the president committed high crimes and misdemeanors? The committees need to do more digging to clarify this. There's tons of smoke, but let's verify what's beneath it all.\" Now, many House Republicans who support this effort say opening an impeachment inquiry gives you more tools to get documents, to get witnesses, to get information, where they will try to directly tie President Joe Biden to his son Hunter Biden's business dealings abroad. So far, both investigations in the Oversight and Judiciary Committees have not been able to find that direct link, but their argument is an impeachment inquiry gives you more power to do that.
