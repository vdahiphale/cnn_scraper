Well, Russia again is launching multiple missile and drone strikes in Ukraine overnight as Kyiv claims partial success in its offensive. At least 78 people have died after a bow carrying migrants sank off the coast of Greece. The Greek Coast Guard has managed to rescue more than hundred people so far, but hundreds of others remain missing. And Former U.S. President Donald Trump remains defiant after pleading not guilty to all 37 felony charges. \"Partial Success\" those are the words Ukraine is using today to describe intense ground fighting in the opening phase of its summer counteroffensive. Advances are reported in Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia by all accounts fighting has been intense. And these battles are happening amid increasing air attacks by Russia. Ukraine says missile strikes killed three people in Odessa and three others in the Donetsk region. I want to bring in our Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley joins us now live from Kyiv. Good to have you with us Sam. So let's start with this summer counteroffensive certainly underway. Talk to us about where the efforts are focused right now.",

So in that context, this is a very important frontline indeed from the Russian perspective, because it is the defensive line against possible Ukrainian advances towards relief of the Crimean Peninsula. It's also captured by Russia back in 2014. But the Ukrainians initially began with their assaults there in a rather low level, a series of reconnaissance raids reconnaissance by force as it's known in the military trade. Now it's stepped up its actions in a significant way. It's still not a kind of blitzkrieg; it's not the massive assault that many people were anticipating they're still making very small incremental gains here and there. They are taking significant casualties. At the scale of those casualties, of course, remain a military secret. But we have seen evidence that they've lost some of the NATO equipment inevitably that they were going that they were given to use in this counter offensive. But Lynda at the same time, they are enjoying success and gaining momentum in a salient of territory south of the city of Bakhmut now that puts the Russian troops that have been battling there for more than a year in a very, very brutal and ongoing struggle on the back foot. That is an important development because of the way it will split the pressure on the Russians making it difficult for the Russian commanders to decide quite where to invest their troops. But they do still have the advantage the Russians in terms of troop numbers in terms of the fact that they can dominate the skies above all, and it's for that reason that the Ukrainians are continuing to make international pleas for that help with particularly F-16 Aircraft. There are a number of countries that are currently agreeing to -- have agreed to or even began training of pilots on fourth generation fighter jets. But they've yet to be seen any of those jets given a much less deployed here in Ukraine, Lynda.",

But some of the vehicles have already been lost and the Russians continue to fire back constant artillery shelling and even air strikes too close for comfort as our crew had to duck for cover. Still, the Deputy Brigade Commander says his soldiers are just getting started. Our counter attack will definitely be successful he says we believe in victory.

Nada could not enter a plea because he did not have a Florida lawyer present.

The Justice Department has to provide a list of which those people will be ultimately, but it was something that Trump's lawyers really did not want to be put in place over the Former President. They were saying in court that everything about his life is this case; it is witnesses that are part of his protective detail in the Secret Service. There are witnesses who still work for him, his Co-Defendant, Walt Nauta travels with him every single day, even was with him at campaign stops after the proceeding yesterday, and then later on and so all of this will come together.

But Evan Corcoran's notes and audio tapes that form the part of the indictment that suggests look, here's what was said to me, an audio recorded contemporaneously, discussions about wanting to shield documents, discussions about sort of the plucking motion that took place in that point in time. That'll be the part of the pre-trial motions. It's not unheard of to have these motions. It's quite standard to talk about what's going to come in, what's going to be excluded. We're talking about a jury, of course, the court of public opinion will probably hear a lot more than actually a court of law jury and paneled people will do. But the number one question is going to be the schedule. It's a big question mark. We know that they have a lot of time against them for the prosecution, but we don't actually have a set schedule in terms of a trial date, most importantly, of course. The speedy trial says within 70 day that's puts you about August, around the time that it's likely not going to happen. But the reason there's a question is because these are co-defendants. And unless once arraigned, unless both are arraigned, you don't have a chance to set a full schedule.",

But at the same time, we want also other states, other donors to join and shoulder this this humanitarian challenge. So it's, it's dire, it's worrying.

And within this, this framework, we've engage many states to have you, you maintain carve out, you maintain an exemption within the sanction regime thing in the U.S. we had a very successful dialogue. In order to have this you may turn exemptions. There are other regime, other sanction regime which are also having those exemptions, but we want them to be way more permanent and predictable.
