Any moment now, we're expecting to hear directly from Mitch McConnell amid questions over his health. It comes after two incidents this summer where he froze up in front of cameras while answering questions for reporters. Today, a Capitol doctor released an update on that.CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill for us. So Manu, what can you tell us about the Capitol physician's view of McConnell's health and whether we expect McConnell to talk about his health today?",

      "sentences": "We are - it's unclear exactly what he will say on the Senate floor when they open just in a matter of moments. We do expect McConnell to address the Senate business. He typically does that. It's unlikely that he will talk about his health. He has been very reticent to provide any details about what was - what has happened amid these health scares. Twice this summer that he froze for roughly 30 seconds when cameras were upon him, including last week - in last week's episode in Covington, Kentucky, afterwards, we have not heard or seen him publicly.So these remarks were the first public remarks he has made. He has met with members privately, including one Senate candidate, Jim Banks, late last week after that incident. I mean, the immediate aftermath had a fundraiser for him, spoke at that event. Banks later told me that McConnell seemed perfectly fine. McConnell has spoken to other senators as well in the recent days, tried to reassure them about his health. And then today, a letter to try to ease any concerns about the 81-year-old Republican leader and whether he can continue to hold on to his powerful leadership post that he has held for the last 16 years. A Capitol physician, Brian Monahan, said that he had consulted with several of McConnell's neurologists, four of them, in fact, the leader spoke with, as well as conducted a number of exams, including MRI imaging and EEG study to monitor electrical activity in the brain. And the result was that, according to the doctor, \"No evidence that he has a seizure and no evidence that he experienced a stroke or a TIA or a movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease.\" Now, that is where some of the concerns that could have been there. But here you're hearing the Capitol physician ruling it out. It is still uncertain exactly what caused McConnell to freeze. His office said that he was lightheaded at the time in both instances. And the Capitol physician said it's not uncommon for someone who has suffered a concussion to experience lightheadedness. McConnell suffered a concussion back in March when falling and hitting his head in a Capitol - in a Washington hotel. So still, Boris, questions about this issue, questions about how you address it, including when he meets with his colleagues for the first time behind closed doors since they've returned from recess and that will happen tomorrow, Boris.",

But you see, by putting out two medical letters within days of each other to try and provide an update, they're clearly trying to isolate this to something that is just about a sort of normal recovery from a significant concussion back in March and ruling out all other things or a lot of other things that it could potentially be.",

Four of those men - four of these men were convicted of seditious conspiracy. Enrique Tarrio, of course, is the leader. He was not even here that day and that's something his lawyer, his attorney is really emphasizing to the judge, saying, look, he wasn't here that day. He wasn't in touch with them, with the members of the Proud Boys. He's not even - he wasn't even able to control them in some of the previous rallies in some of the previous altercations that they had with police. But the judge said, that is something you argued to the jury, and they didn't - they didn't believe it. Right now, the judge is saying that the judge is saying that he is looking to - to add that terrorism enhancement, which, again, would increase the level of sentence. Prosecutors have asked for 33 years. And so we - we're waiting to see what the judge decides. His lawyer right now is saying, look, Enrique Tarrio is not a terrorist. He's just a misguided patriot, something the judge is not really buying at this moment. Brianna?",

Under Georgia law, these co-defendants have the right to waive their arraignment, have a right to plead not guilty or guilty prior to appearing in court. And that's exactly what these 19 co-defendants did.What was once going to be a very busy day in court on Wednesday is no longer and Mark Meadows among the - one of the last of these co- defendants to enter a not guilty plea and to waive his arraignment. And Meadows has been charged with two state crimes, the RICO indictment, as well as solicitation violation or trying to get a public official to violate their oath. And he'd been trying to get his case moved from state court to federal court. And it was recently that he was making his case in federal court, arguing under oath that the actions for which he's charged were done while he was operating under his official role as the chief of staff or the former president. A federal judge still has not made a decision on that, so we're waiting there. Look, there has been a flurry of legal activity around this case in Tuesday. Today, that continued. Not only did Meadows enter a not guilty plea and waive his arraignment, there was also several others that did so, Jeffrey Clark, there was also John Eastman, the pro-Trump attorney, former GOP chair in Coffee County, Cathy Latham, the former GOP chair here in Georgia, David Shafer, among the many that entered these pleas. And there are also, while this is all happening, there are several of these co-defendants that have filed motions to try to sever their cases from one another, some wanting speedy cases, others, like the former president, wanting to delay their case until after this proposed October trial date. So we're even seeing those that want to have their speedy cases done, try to sever their cases from one another. The bottom line here, Jim, is that we're starting to see these complexities that come with this RICO indictment and charging these 19 co-defendants. Jim?",

He was the most vocal of wanting a speedy trial. And then we saw Fani Willis propose this October trial date. So pretty interesting to see all this legal activity surrounding this case, Jim.

And prosecutors want to know about money raised by Powell's nonprofit Defending the Republic. And they want to know if that money was used to fund efforts to find evidence of voter fraud. And specifically, if it was used to fund efforts to get access to voting systems in key swing states around the country and we've seen invoices that show that her Defending the Republic did pay for certain individuals to gain access, unauthorized access, to voting systems in places like Georgia, in places like Michigan, in places like Pennsylvania. So it's interesting that this is coming up now, even after Donald Trump is already facing criminal charges.

Well, six days ago is when he broke out, now we have six confirmed sightings of him since and five of those sightings was - were actually in a pretty confined two-mile radius a little bit south of where we are right here at the prison. But it was a sighting last night at Longwood Gardens that was outside of that perimeter, that sixth sighting that really escalated the manhunt and the search today. And you've been looking at this picture that was, as you described, a trail camera surveillance video basically that was taken at Longwood Gardens. And you can see in the photo right there, Cavalcante, he is shirtless, but he's also wearing a duffel bag and still potentially those prison-issued pants right there. And what police are taking from that is that Cavalcante has probably been able to either burglarize some homes or break into perhaps some cars to get things like a backpack, a duffel bag and potentially some other clothes as well. And that risk, Jim, was all too real for one homeowner that we heard from over the past few days who said that he came into contact with Cavalcante in his home. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's only about five miles, at least the most recent search radius from the prison. But also they believe that that sixth sighting out of the perimeter, yes, he was able to slip out of it.
