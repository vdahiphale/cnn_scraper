What we've also heard from three sources familiar with these talks is that Hamas has now made a counter proposal and within that it is asking for a 12-week ceasefire for that first phase. They had agreed, we understand, to a six-week ceasefire, so this is also causing a major obstacle in these negotiations. It's something that Israel would not agree to, an upfront 12-week ceasefire, because after that it would be very difficult for the fighting to begin again and we have heard that Benjamin Netanyahu say that as far as he's concerned there has to be this major ground offensive in order to destroy the last battalions of Hamas, Max.",

REID (voice-over): As his hush money trial entered its 14th day, his team attacking Stormy Daniels' credibility in a tense cross- examination. You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real, defense attorney Susan Necheles said. Wow, Daniels replied with a pause. That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room. Necheles asked Daniels if she made up the story with Trump. If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better. Daniels shot back. The defense zeroing in on small inconsistencies in the details of Daniels' story, hoping to undermine her credibility with the jury. Your story has completely changed, Necheles said. Daniels, in a raised voice, replied, No, you're trying to make me say that it changed, but it hasn't changed. And then they questioned Daniels' earlier testimony that she felt powerless in Trump's hotel room. You acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, Necheles said. But according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a T-shirt and boxer shorts was so upsetting that you got lightheaded. This wasn't the first time in your life someone made a pass at you. Daniels replied, No, but it's the first time they had a bodyguard standing outside the door. Adding Trump was twice her age and bigger than her. When pressed, Daniels explained, my own insecurities made me feel that way. He did not put his hands on me. He did not give me any sort of drugs or alcohol, and he did not hold a weapon or hold me or threaten me. Necheles also highly critical of how Daniels profited off the encounter, even calling out her strip club tour, Make America Horny Again. Daniels responded, I did not name that tour, and I fought it tooth and nail. But Necheles said Daniels has made nearly $1 million from a book deal, documentary and selling products on her website. You're celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store, right? Necheles pressed. Daniels quipped, Not unlike Mr. Trump. Trump frowned as photos of the various merchandise were shown before the court. Daniels defended herself by saying she did an interview with Anderson Cooper on \"60 Minutes\" for free.

It's dividing the city and complicating matters for Eurovision as it continues to insist that it's apolitical. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg joined in the pro-Palestine protest. She says young people have been showing the world how to react to the dire situation in Gaza.

There have been pro- Palestinian protests every week actually since October, so you can understand how the response around this contest is going down, and we're actually expecting protests tomorrow for the final in the city to potentially be 20,000.That's what the organizers are expecting in terms of the numbers, which is actually more than the 15,000 people expected to attend the actual live event in the audience, so huge protests for the city, and all regarding whether or not, of course, Israel should have an act in the Eurovision Song Contest. The organizer EBU refused to ban them. They have weighed into political decisions before, banning Russia in 2022, and there are calls, of course, to boycott the event as well. So all of this is going to be happening off the stage in terms of the protests, but then you've got to think about what's going to happen on the big night on the stage as well. Artists are banned from making any kind of political statements, but in the past we have had some acts, for instance the Icelandic act in 2019 holding up a Palestinian flag, they got fined, we could see some of those protests. Also from the audience, I think we can probably expect some booing from the audience throughout the Israeli act's song at this stage, and the EBU have made clear that they may have to adjust noise levels for that. So all this, Max, the Eurovision's motto is united by music, but certainly not for the first time. I think this is going to be very much divided by politics.",

We are in La Cruz Station, one of the main terminals in Buenos Aires. This place is usually crowded and now it looks almost empty. The same happens in all terminals around the city. This way also flights have been suspended, ports are paralyzed and banks remain closed, although some shops, schools and universities work, but with minimal functions. This strike was organized by the General Confederation of Labor, the CGT, and many other unions joined against Milei's austerity measures and planned reforms. They include less labor protections in a bill that has already gotten approval in the lower house and is waiting for a final vote at Senate. Argentina is going through an acute economic crisis. Also it is experiencing a record inflation of over 280 percent, much inherited from the previous government but increased since the start of Milei's presidency. However many here in Argentina still support their plans, although his tough austerity measures have hurt people's real salaries, pushed up already high poverty levels and seen economic activity tank. According to the latest official statistics, industrial activity fell in March by 21.2 percent year-to-year, while construction plummeted 42.2 percent. The government has rejected the strike and stated it affects 6.5 million people, mostly due to the lack of public transport. However, presidential spokespersons said public employees who don't attend work will not get paid for the day. Also he reminded that Milei has already faced two general strikes and many other protests, unlike the previous government, the Peronist Alberto Fernandez, who said he had zero strikes. In fact, the CGT never made a strike during that period, but many other smaller unions did. Ivan Sarmenti, CNN, Buenos Aires. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
