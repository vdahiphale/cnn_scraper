Vance's former Yale law school classmate and close friend, Sofia Nelson, who Vance refers to as \"Sofs\", sharing more than 80 emails with OUTFRONT. Vance in those emails taking on Trump, the police, and MAGA voters. We'll share them with you. Plus, Kamala Harris's momentum raising record cash, doubling down on calling Trump and Vance flat-out weird. That's the word they're using. Now Republicans are trying to turn the tables. Will it work? And Kim Jong-un tonight preparing his daughter, his young daughter, to take over the country. This daughter is not even a teenager yet, and it comes as new details emerge about just how poor Kim's health is. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: Will the real J.D. Vance, please stand up? Tonight, an exclusive interview with J.D. Vance's former classmate and close friend, Sofia Nelson, someone Vance refers to lovingly as \"Sofs\" in some of the more than 80 emails they wrote each other, that Nelson has shared with OUTFRONT. Now, most of these emails have never been seen before, and their emails in which Vance rights openly about hating Trump, he goes after some Trump supporters as racist and even go so far as to say he hates police. We're going to dive into these emails along with are many questions for Sofia Nelson in just a moment. But these revelations come as Vice President Kamala Harris and potential running mates see an opening when it comes to J.D. Vance. Here's the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, just moments ago at Harris rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

You and J.D. Vance, of course, were friends, close friends. So I understand you're a transgender public defender in Detroit. Vance now is one of the Republican Party's staunchest culture warriors.

So, this is an email, all the way back from 2014, October. Vance writes you, quote: I hate the police. Given the number of negative experiences, I've had in the past few years, I can't imagine what a black guy goes through.

And here's what a spokesperson for Vance says, Sofia.They say, quote: It's unfortunate this individual chose to leak decade-old private conversation patients between friends. Senator Vance values his friendships with individuals across the political spectrum. He has been open about the fact that some of his views from a decade ago began to change after becoming a dad and starting a family. And he is thoroughly explained why he changed his mind on President Trump. Despite their disagreements, Senator Vance cares for Sofia and wishes Sofia the very best. Now, I want to ask you about that last sentence in just a moment. Sofia, if I may, but first, what he's saying here is that these issues of which we've touched on some from reparations to the police to racism, that this all change because he had a family, because he became a dad.

I just want to emphasize, you're talking about a ten year friendship.Ten years is a long time to have a deep friendship with a person. You would think you know them well. He wrote about you, Sofia, in \"Hillbilly Elegy\". He says -- he's talking about a class. And he says one of those classes, a constitutional law seminar of 16 students became a kind of family for me. We called ourselves the island of misfit toys, as there was no real unifying force to our team, a conservative hillbilly from Appalachia, the super smart daughter of Indian immigrants, a black Canadian with decades worth of street smarts, a neuroscientist from Phoenix, and aspiring civil rights attorney born a few minutes from Yale's campus and an extremely progressive lesbian with a fantastic sense of humor among others. But we became excellent friends. Now, just to be clear here, Sofia, the last friend he describes is you, all right? He describes you as extremely progressive lesbian and a day after his book was published he writes to you, he calls you Sofs, which I guess was his nickname for you, and apologizes for referring to you in that way. And he goes on to say, I recognize this may not accurately reflect how you think of yourself, and for that, I'm really sorry. I hope you recognize that description came from a place of ignorance, when I first started writing years ago. I hope you're not offended, but if you are, I'm sorry. Love you, J.D. So, you know, when you think about that, what does that say about the person that you knew and this support that he -- I don't know.

And I was taught, we treat others how we want to be treated. And so you don't have to share a faith or a racial background or a political background with your neighbors to treat them with respect and dignity and J.D. reflected that and our relationship. And, you know, the J.D. Vance that I knew was supportive of marriage equality and had LGBTQ friends, myself included. And when I had gender affirming surgery in 2012, J.D. delivered me baked goods when I was going through my recovery. Again, he didn't necessarily fully understand a transgender identity, and that's fine. I don't need everyone to do that. What I need from people is a sense of decency and respect, which is consistent with the Midwestern values that I was raised with and why I returned to the Midwest. I've lived here since 2013.

You know, I told him what I went through as a child in response to his public support of criminalizing access to gender affirming care. And he was very dismissive and again, the tone that I had been the basis of our friendship across political differences, had completely shifted. He had gone from a compassionate thoughtful, kind person to mimicking Donald Trump's derisive cruelty. And, you know, I have many family members and friends who are independents, who are Republicans.

It is -- it's an opportunity for Kamala Harris to show her stature as the future president United States, and to make a decision of extraordinary significance and what everyone says, who is around two, who has seen her make very important decisions if she's going to be ruthlessly pragmatic, she's going to focus on winning and she's going to focus on the necessity for leadership in the future.

We felt a little bit like the Lin- Manuel Miranda's wonderful music that said, we were in the room when it happened. And I think that being in the room where it happened when President Biden made his first speech, having conceded that he was not going to run for reelection, was just a magical moment. We all were pinching ourselves because as he had said to us, he cared a lot about the office but he cared most about his country. Well, my father made a similar kind of decision because he cared so much about his country and both of them cared tremendously about civil rights, and the importance of it. The 1964 Civil Rights Act was signed on my 17th birthday and my sweet father didn't have time to come down to drugstore and pick up a card. So he wrote me and love letter on why they're stationary and even noted the time of day. I think with the hope that one day, I would realize just what an incredible birthday gift I have gotten, that they end of what was really legalized apartheid in the United States.

Well, it comes as the extent of Kim's poor health is coming into sharper focus.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the flood ravaged North Korean, along a swollen river near the Chinese border, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, overseeing the evacuation of thousands. Noticeably absent from state media coverage, Kim's young daughter, Kim Ju-ae, now undergoing secret succession training, South Korean lawmakers say, suggesting the elementary age girl is being groomed as the next North Korean leader. Two lawmakers in Seoul briefed by the national intelligence service say Kim Jong-un's health may be deteriorating. His doctors searching for new medications to treat Kim. He has a family history of heart for disease, weighs more than 300 pounds, a dangerously high body mass index in the mid-forties, high stress, smoking and drinking, all putting the 40-year-old Kim at high risk lawmakers say. They add succession plans could change, but right now, all signs point to Kim Ju-ae, who could become the first female and fourth generation leader of the ruling Kim family. Kim Il Sung died in 1994.

Pyongyang aware of reaction to her young age, adjusting propaganda, reducing public appearances, as her father consolidates the Kim family's power, bolstering ties with Russian strong man Vladimir Putin, building up his military spy satellite program, and South Korea says stepping up training for a successor to someday take control of North Koreas growing nuclear arsenal.

He was reportedly chosen as the successor on his eighth birthday, but the outside world didn't know about it until many years later, Erin. This very public reveal of Kim Ju-ae, just a year-and-a-half ago, maybe the beginning experts say they have a personality cult for Kim's daughter, his health, one reason experts believe this might be happening now, but many people now know her that the crucial challenges for her to build credibility, especially with the military, Erin, that is crucial to maintaining the Kim family's power.",
