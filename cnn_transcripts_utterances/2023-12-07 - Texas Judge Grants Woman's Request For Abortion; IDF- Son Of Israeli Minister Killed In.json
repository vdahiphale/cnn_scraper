He found no accounting fraud whatsoever. And like everyone else who said, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? This is a political, witch hunt. This is meant to influence an election. This also comes from the White House. This is not just a state matter because the White House is controlling district attorneys. In fact, in the district attorney's office, they put one of their top people, DOJ put one of the top people right under the attorney general, put him into the district attorney's office also put a man into the state. Attorney General's Office, Letitia James office happened to be the same man. This is coming right from the White House. This is a disgraceful situation. The country's never seen anything like it.

In an emergency hearing, a state judge just granted a woman's request to get an abortion for her high-risk pregnancy. Doctors for Kate Cox say her fetus has a condition that makes it unlikely to survive birth or for very long afterwards, and continuing the pregnancy is putting her own health at risk.CNN's Ed Lavandera is with us now. Ed, what are the judge say here?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, this is the most significant challenge to the near-total abortion ban here in Texas which says no abortions allowed after six weeks unless the life of the mother is in jeopardy. And this is -- as I mentioned, this is the most significant development we've seen here since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.In a hearing that ended just a short while ago, 31-year-old Kate Cox was granted permission by a judge to have an abortion. And this comes after she just learned at the end of November that her baby -- and she's 20 weeks along in this pregnancy was diagnosed with what is known as Edwards syndrome, a genetic condition that is fatal in nearly all cases. And her doctor said that at best, if the child were to be born, that would only live a few hours perhaps a couple of days, at best. Because of that, Cox and her lawyers argued that her future health and her future ability to get pregnant again would be in jeopardy if she would be forced to continue on with this pregnancy. And the judge ruled in her favor just a short while ago saying, \"The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice. So, I will be signing this order.\" So, she has been given a temporary restraining order against the abortion ban -- abortion law here in Texas to carry out that abortion. And really at the heart of all of this, John, is this question of the -- when the life and the mother -- the life of the mother is at jeopardy. Abortion rights activists say here in Texas that law is too vague, that it is very confusing for doctors who face criminal repercussions if they were to carry out an abortion. And the mother also faces civil legal action here in the state because of the abortion law. Now, attorneys for the Attorney General say that in the filings that Kate Cox and her lawyers filed that they did not provide ample evidence to support that her life would be in jeopardy down the road if this pregnancy were to continue. But the judges, you heard there, just quickly dismissing all of that in this ruling in Kate Cox's favor. A very significant ruling in the abortion battle here in Texas, John.",

Because this was a city that was almost untouched since the war began. So, for two months, Hamas was preparing for an Israeli grand invasion of the city. And this city hosts right now, according to the IDF all the Hamas leadership, mainly Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and we see quite significant fighting there at the moment.",
