But, of course, he was also snubbed by the leaders of Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority. Plans for a four-way in-person summit were quickly canceled after that deadly blast at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds of people.The president did back Israel's claim that they were not responsible, but the explosion was actually caused by a misfired Palestinian missile. Tonight, President Biden will deliver a primetime address calling for continued aid to Israel in the face of Hamas's attacks, and to Ukraine and its ongoing war against Russia. CNN's Becky Anderson is live in Tel Aviv with more. Becky, let's talk about Gaza, because the president is focused on trying to get these trucks across the border. There's still a lot of logistical hurdles to getting that done.",

But what about the intelligence operation on the Hamas side?A CNN investigation is taking a closer look at the depth of intelligence that Hamas appears to have gathered before the attacks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Even with detailed intelligence, not every Hamas objective was achieved. Nearby kibbutz Sa'ad wasn't even attacked, although we now have documentary evidence that Hamas intended to inflect the maximum possible human casualties there, and to hold hostages. A highly detailed street map found on another Hamas gunman, and obtained by CNN, shows individual buildings in Sa'ad identified and were assessed for their military value. The communal kitchen, for example, is described as the main place suitable for holding hostages. Inside the guard room, the soldiers must be neutralized the Hamas instructions say. While the kibbutz dental clinic is designated a place for first aid for both enemies and friends. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Shawn, some of these details are terrifying. What is your view on how Hamas was able to gather this? I mean, there were maps. There were battle plans. They knew about the locations of rural roads. They knew about generators. I mean, how -- how is it possible that they gathered all this information? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  Yeah, good morning, Kasie. Thanks for having me. You know, there's no doubt that Hamas has made significant progress with regards to military tactics and strategies. And even in their collection of intelligence. But make no mistake, there is no universe in which Hamas has the type of resources necessary to get the level of detailed information that we see in some of the documents and some of the reporting since this attack happened more -- just more than a week ago. I mean, as you pointed out, you look at the fact that they knew where communication towers were. Those communication towers were critical to taking out some of Israeli's defenses, some of the remote defenses. They knew where there were openings in barricades across -- across the area. They even had a better sense of the fact that they could overwhelm the Iron Dome system if they launched multiple rockets at different trajectories. So that level of detail tells me that there's definitely something else going on here with regard to how they obtained that intelligence, Kasie.",

I think that most likely scenario here is that Iran may have participated in gathering intelligence, either gathering the intelligence themselves or stealing intelligence through cyber insurgents that they provided to Hamas. That could have happened over a long period of time and that intelligence could have come from a range of different resources or different sources. That's a likely scenario.The worst case scenario is that Hamas was able to recruit and place humans or human intelligence sources on the ground within Israel to return that intelligence back to Hamas. Now, again, I say that is the worst case and it is too early to conclude that that is what happened here. But when you look at the level of detail, the level of specificity here, this is not the kind of information that you get from a Google search or the kind that you get from paying close attention. [05:15:09] It's also the kind of information that -- that is very present. It's very relevant. You know, intelligence changes very rapidly in Israel. You know, they tend to upgrade their systems, what have you. And so, their intelligence is fairly recent intelligence. So I think those are the two most likely scenarios.

So, there's all the diplomacy going on behind the scenes. We don't know what progress is being made there. There are a lot of key U.S. allies that they are speaking to. But to the public, they need to manage this emotion and this rage and this massive distrust about anything that any of these Western powers are saying and Israeli powers as well. Interesting to see -- I mean, Rishi Sunak has now gone to the Middle East.
