A major commitment on the second andfinal day of the NATO Summit appears to calm growing concerns from Ukraine's Leader over his country's potential NATO membership. Members of the G7 made new long term security guarantees pledging to help Kyiv build its own powerful military, while it waits to be allowed into the alliance. Just a day earlier President Zelenskyy clearly frustrated called the lack of a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO \"Absurd\". A very different tone last hour when President Zelenskyy and his American counterpart met one on one, the two men exchanging mutual praise and Mr. Zelenskyy thanking President Biden, for standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. I would like to go to Jeremy Diamond, who is going to unpack these conversations for us. So much happening, but I just really want to get into what we saw coming through from President Biden and President Zelenskyy at that press conference. And as we said, mutual praise, frankly, a more conciliatory tone coming through from President Zelenskyy and Biden, reassuring Zelenskyy look, we're here to stay. We are not going anywhere.",

And you know, over the last couple of days, in particular,yesterday, we saw some frustrations bubbling to the surface; both on the Ukrainian side, as well as on the American side. On the Ukrainian side, President Zelenskyy was clearly unhappy with, you know, the statements from the NATO alliance, about the future of Ukraine within that alliance, clearly not believing that the statement about Ukraine joining when conditions are met and the time is right. Zelenskyy didn't feel that that was strong enough. He wanted a more concrete commitment from the alliance that Ukraine will be able to enter the NATO alliance. And on the American side, you heard Jake Sullivan as he was facing questions about that just this morning. You know, offering some frustration about the notion that, you know, Americans should ultimately be feeling a little bit more gratitude from the Ukrainians for all of the support that has been provided and so today, as you saw President Zelenskyy, and President Biden sitting down together. Both of them were clearly very eager to put on a united front, you heard President Zelenskyy expressing that gratitude that Jake Sullivan was talking about thanking the American public for their support.
