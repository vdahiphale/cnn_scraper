He is ahead. When he takes that stage tonight in this hall, he is ahead. And you could even say he's ahead in a commanding way that is growing.This is the current CNN projection and watch when I go through it because this will change in the coming days. Already, we have the data to change this. Right now, if Donald Trump just won, deep red, solid Republican. Light red, lean Republican. If he just won the states on this map, that we have as either solid or leaning Republican, he's already the next president of the United States. 272 electoral votes. But, but, the data in recent days we know, Trump is now ahead. Let me turn this off here. Trump is now ahead in Pennsylvania. Trump is now ahead in Wisconsin. Trump is ahead in this Nebraska congressional district. Trump is ahead out here in Arizona. Let's turn all that. That's 313 electoral votes right there. And there is data that shows that some other states that maybe he's only ahead a little bit, or it's margin of error, or it's tied, but they're traditional blue states. States like Virginia. Trump is now at least in play there, Dana. And then you come up to New Hampshire. Trump is in play there. There are Republicans talking about maybe Minnesota. There are Democrats worried about Colorado and New Mexico. Look at this map right here. Potentially 330 electoral votes. Does that mean Donald Trump's going to get 330 electoral votes? Of course not. Do the blue states tend to come home late in the campaign? They tend to, but the president is so weak. Let's just show a little bit of reasons of why Democrats are so worried about this. This is -- this data is several days old. I have seen data in recent days, private data that is even worse than this, but this is public data. This is the incumbent president of the United States. His ballot chair in Arizona, 37 percent. 40 in Georgia, 38 in Wisconsin, 40 in Michigan, 40 in Pennsylvania, 40 in North Carolina, 42, his best state, Nevada, 42. Correlates almost exactly, within a point or two, to his approval rating right there. Dana, the president is in trouble. And when Donald Trump takes that stage tonight, this is his race. He's in the driver's seat.",

Donald Trump was close.This -- and this is where J.D. Vance, again, vice presidential candidates tend not to make a huge difference, but can they make a little difference? J.D. Vance, Donald Trump campaigning in the state like this. This is just one of them here. It was very close. And again, in 2020, third party candidates didn't matter. Donald Trump can get to 45. He can get to 46. If Joe Biden is in the high 30s or low 40s, it's not just Minnesota. That's why they're worried in Colorado. They're worried in New Mexico. They're worried in New Hampshire. They're worried in Virginia. Can Joe Biden change it? Sure. But that's why you have consistent pressure, Dana, on him to please get out, Mr. President. Give us a chance with somebody else.",

But to see it in public, it's quite different.You know, when you go through a life or death situation like that, it changes, and it really changes for people that are around you too, especially when they see it. They know that you're in a fight. They know that you're fighting for a cause, and in his case, the United States. But when you see somebody try to take their life, it puts things in perspective. And so just to see him around his family, and for the American people to see that on stage and see the love in his eyes and I love they have for him.
