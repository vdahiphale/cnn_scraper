She is getting out there, going across the country. But the bottom line is Donald Trump was a disaster last night. Issue of immigration. He's talking about immigrants eating pets, eating cats. I mean, this is someone that was completely unhinged last night, couldn't put together rational thoughts. She kept on the defensive every single time. And the one thing that for me stuck with me the most in that debate, he couldn't even look at her. Not once did he look at her because why? He's scared of her.

There's only an extra debate or the final debate goes forward if both candidates think they need it or if one is so far ahead, he or she doesn't care what happens at that debate. But generally, both candidates have to want it for one reason or another. And like the Congressman who was just on, I rather suspect that Donald Trump won't want it. But we'll all see together.For the undecideds, this is really interesting. This is where we don't have much of a precedent. In fact, the best precedent is way back to the first set of debates, four debates in 1960. Even though John F. Kennedy had been around in the Congress for 14 years and the name was well known, people really didn't know him at all. He was more of a backbencher because he'd had serious back problems and operations in the 50s. And so they wanted to learn more about him. People don't watch the conventions. They ought to, but they'll watch little bits of it here and there. So the debates back then, and I think the one last night, were essential to people getting their, if not first impression, then their foundational impression of Kamala Harris. Donald Trump, I don't know what Donald Trump could say. Well, maybe the dogs and cats getting eaten. I don't think most people expected that. But there's very little he can say that would be new, that would strike people as being worth remembering. And she absolutely cleaned his clock. And she actually, I think, laid the foundation for the rest of her campaign. I'm sure her team is working on that today and will continue to. So it was well-worth her time. Nay not have been wise for Donald Trump, but Kamala Harris has a pathway now to actually winning, which still, as she has said, was hard quite to believe. She was still the underdog. She may still be the underdog, but not by very much.",
