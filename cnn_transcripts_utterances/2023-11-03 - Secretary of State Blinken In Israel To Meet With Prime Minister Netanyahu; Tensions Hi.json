You were mentioning how the Americans who have said that they support Israeli's right to defend themselves are also now calling perhaps for a little pause. Not a ceasefire but an opportunity to allow aid to get into the areas that are being hit the hardest by this Israeli activity in the area.We keep hearing reports of hospitals being hit, people -- more people getting wounded, and the warnings that this could turn into a real humanitarian crisis. And also, the regional leaders -- they are making increasing calls to have some restraint to try to avoid a larger regional crisis, especially in as we are expecting an important message -- proclamation later today by the leader of Hezbollah that is going to perhaps change the dynamics of what's happening in the region. That message later today could have larger implications. But right now, the expectation is to see what is Benjamin Netanyahu going to do as he's listening to the U.S. Secretary of State.",

First and foremost, he's speaking to the Israeli public and what he's doing there he's reassuring the Israeli public that the United States stands with Israel in its war against this blood-thirsty terrorist organization in Hamas. But he's also -- to your point, he's going to talk tough to Prime Minister Netanyahu behind the scenes, of course, outlining the support the United States is providing. The support to try to ensure that Iran is deterred. But also, he's saying what's your plan? I mean, this has been a consistent theme throughout, even prior to Israel's response to Hamas' October 7 attack. What is your plan for winning the peace, for securing dynamic after this conflict, and how are you going to provide assistance (PH) to the Palestinians. And I think this reflects the domestic audience -- this last crucial audience, which is the American public. It's not a secret that the American politics are now roiling over this and over the response by Israel. And so, he's going to be very firm that there is a -- there's an unending level of support without questions or convictions on Israel right now, and he's going to have to make that very clear behind the scenes.",

And this means that our strategy has to ensure that a) we're supporting Israel, but that b) we also understand that Israel knows that we have needs, too, and that we need to keep the region from flaring and having this become a regional war. And I think you're going to see Sen. Warner, in this case, coming in. That's how he thinks. He thinks about the broader national security question, understanding that the threat environment is not so simple as one country versus one terrorist organization. We've been through that in the United States. One country versus a terrorist organization, be it al Qaeda or ISIS -- it doesn't resolve all the problems. So they're giving some support from President Biden and President Biden and Sec.

And first and foremost, there has to be really strictly enforcing the student code of conduct. Intimidation and harassment are not allowed. And there's a -- you know, students on campuses have the right to free speech but there's a limit. The code of conduct needs to be enforced. Indiana University, in 2018, formally endorsed the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of antisemitism. And when I was in student government, we worked to pass that in student government as well. And that blatant -- that very plainly lays out what is and isn't antisemitic. And there's a ton that the university can do while still working within the confines of students' First Amendment rights to very clearly just say if you call for the destruction of the state of Israel, that's antisemitic. If you hold Israel to a double standard, that's antisemitic. Refusing Jewish students the right to -- the Jewish people the right to self-determination, that's antisemitic.
