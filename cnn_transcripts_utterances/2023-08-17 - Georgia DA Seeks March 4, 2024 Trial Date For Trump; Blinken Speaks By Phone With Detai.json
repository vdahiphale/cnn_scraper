That's where Donald Trump and his co-defendants have to turn themselves in by next Friday.If the district attorney Fani Willis has her way, Donald Trump will be facing trial in Georgia the day before Super Tuesday. It's a big if, but Willis asked for the judge -- asked the judge for a March fourth start date for Trump and his 18 co-defendants who are accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. A trial would be just one of several potential trials that would collide directly with the 2024 presidential campaign schedule. Willis' date, however, just a proposal. The judge gets the final say. And this just in. We're seeing the first polling since these indictments in Georgia. According to an ABC-IPSOS poll, 47 percent say the charges are very serious, and 16 percent say they're somewhat serious. Joining us now to talk about all of this, two witnesses who testified before the Fulton County grand jury on Monday just hours before that indictment was returned. CNN political commentator and former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, Geoff Duncan; and former Georgia state senator Jen Jordan. Guys, I want to start with the reporting we had at the top of the show from Donie O'Sullivan in terms of the jurors. You spoke to them -- you both spoke to them. You both said they took their jobs very seriously. It was a very sober and heavy kind of moment. Their names were in, as they were supposed to be based on Georgia law, the indictment. They are now being doxed. Their names are now floating around. There are threats being directed to them. You guys, I think, have faced similar types of threats over the course of the last couple of years. What's your response to what we're seeing right now? JEN JORDAN, (D) FORMER GEORGIA STATE SENATOR:  Yeah. I think this is just kind of a prelude of what's to come. I wish that Georgia law didn't require their names to be in there, but it does. But it is incredibly serious. The lieutenant governor and I both had significant threats against our lives and our families. And look, we played such a small role. But if you have Trump supporters who really look at these grand jurors as kind of the reason that this case is going forward -- you know, with Trump saying this isn't true -- these are lies -- I mean, these people's lives are in danger and their families are in danger, and it's very, very serious.",

You look at the new polling that we were just talking about. It's a snapshot. It doesn't tell the whole story, but I think we had 47 percent say the charges were very serious.

And I think we have to break this down like a business problem, all right? We've got to attack -- if 35 percent are diehard in love with Donald Trump, then we need to go figure out who those 65 percent are and message to them. And then we need to simplify it even more. Let's go figure out a way to short-circuit the caucuses in Iowa, in New Hampshire. Let's go take those big-dollar donors that are out there that haven't jumped in yet and them behind a full-scale effort to flip that 20 percent lead that Donald Trump's got in Iowa, and then roll it in New Hampshire. And now we can reset the -- reset the stage. But there's never been a better time for GOP 2.0 to show up and to really lead with our policies, right?

He's taken big bets that will make money if the market goes down. Beyond that, it's tough to see what else is going on. These bets may still not be valid. They may have run off by now. We don't know really in terms of what the market was doing whether this was part of a bigger strategy. So you have to be a bit careful. I can tell you in that awful previous life I used to do this a lot with clients. And what I would do is protect what they owned already if I thought turbulence was coming or I thought that the market may trip over. And if you take a step back and look what's going on today, that's a possibility. To your point, you mentioned the markets have had a great run this year. Perhaps it's time to take a bit of protection or take some money off the table. The other thing to consider here I think, as well as the economic data, look at the Fed minutes yesterday. We've gotten to a comfortable position where we think the Federal Reserve is done with their rate hikes. What actually, given the strength of the data, happens if they have to hike rates again? That's going to cause some problems, too. And the other thing I think that's interesting what Michael did -- he sold Chinese stocks. The Chinese officials, this week, said their recovery has been torturous. That's a drag on economic growth, too. So for all these reasons my view would be don't panic. Listen to what he's saying.
