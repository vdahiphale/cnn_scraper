And they are, of course, urgently needed because we are seeing Russian air superiority on the front lines, not far where I'm standing here in the south, during the counteroffensive, slowing Ukraine down. Killing hundreds of Ukrainian troops from the sheer volume of explosives they were able to drop from that position. Now, at the same time, Ukraine, if they have F-16s, might be able to counter that, they could certainly perhaps reduce threats to civilian areas, not allowing the jets to get much closer. And they could also, too, drop their own bombs on Russian positions, potentially enabling as most NATO armies would not even contemplate proceeding without using air power to assist their counteroffensive. Instead, now, after last week's very open comments by the Ukrainians that they weren't going to get the jets, frankly, fast enough, we've not had this flurry of European activity. Denmark saying 19 jets, six this year, and the Netherlands saying 42 jets. Unclear how many of those necessarily they'll keep for training or how many they will give to the Ukraine to actually use. It's faster or it's more concrete, certainly, as a timetable. Is it fast enough for Ukraine right now? Absolutely not.

We are different from most other scientists in that way. We don't want to see our predictions come true because what it means is that the warnings that we were issuing decades ago have largely gone unheeded. And now, as a result of that, we are seeing the devastating impacts of climate change begin to play out in real-time every summer. Just these vast arrays of unprecedented extreme droughts and heatwaves and wildfires and floods. This is climate change. We don't have to use the imagination anymore to wonder what it looks like. This is what it looks like. And it will get worse if we don't act. Am I surprised as a climate scientist? The warming of the planet is almost exactly what we predicted it would be if we continued to -- you know, to pollute the atmosphere with carbon pollution. But some of the impacts of that warning, especially this very persistent extreme weather events are beyond what we expected to see at this point.

You know, we made a prediction of how much theplanet would warm if we continued, you know, to burn fossil fuels. We have, unfortunately, made the decision to stay on that trajectory, and we're seeing the warming that the models predicted. And so, in that sense, the models were spot on. Here's the thing, the impacts of that warming, in many cases, are going beyond what the models predicted. It's true with the melting of the ice sheets and the beginning of the collapse of the major ice sheets, the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet, already contributing to the sea level rise earlier than we expected. That means there's all this freshwater running into the North Atlantic, for example. That freshening of the North Atlantic appears to be slowing the so-called ocean conveyor that helps deliver warm waters to the high latitudes of the North Atlantic. And so, that's another impact that we are seeing earlier than we expect that. And again, these extreme weather events. And some of our own research suggests that the unusual pattern of the jet stream that gives us these stuck weather patterns, these big highs and lows that sit in place, alternatively heating and drying one area and dumping rain on the other, the way that the jet stream sort of gets locked in place and those weather systems get stuck in place for weeks on end, that behavior is not well captured by the climate models. It may be one of those other impacts that we didn't really capture and we're seeing it now play out in the form of these unprecedented extremes, some of the weather events across the entire hemisphere right now.",

We saw, you know, commitments from the major polluting nations of the world to substantially reduce the carbon emissions. We sort of got enough of a commitment from the world community to almost cut the projected warming in half. We were on a trajectory headed toward four degrees Celsius just a decade ago. Now, if we just sort of continue with current policies, they're not enough, but current policies alone will probably keep warming at about three degrees Celsius, that's too much. We need to go further. But we are seeing some progress and we are seeing carbon emissions now plateau. That's the good news. The bad news is, plateauing isn't enough. They've got to come down. We've got to come down the other side of that mountain and we've got to do it fairly quickly. And so, we need to see far more progress at this next conference of the parties later this year. One of the stumbling blocks has been getting certain developing nations, like India, to commit to phasing out fossil fuels. But in order to convince them to do that, the industrial countries of the world, like the United States, that have had this legacy of access for more than two centuries of dirty fossil fuel energy to grow our economy have, we've got to have our own house in order. We've got to be doing enough so that we can convince India that it is worth, you know, their while in skipping that fossil fuel phase of their economic development and going directly to renewable energy. We've got to make it worth their while. And that means there have to be even greater commitments from the industrial countries to get these industrializing countries to come on board, and that's what this next conference is all going to be about later this year in United Arab Emirates, COP28.

What did this mean to you and why did you feel it was necessary? PATRICIA OLIVER, GUN SAFETY ACTIVIST AND CO-FOUNDER, CHANGE THE REF: Well, this means a lot to us because, first of all, we create all this tour on Joaquin's name, because Joaquin's birthday was on August 4th. He will be turning 23. We decided to visit 23 cities that have been hitting to gun violence, and it's been really meaningful because we've been learning how the problematics and the communities are going through with the gun violence in the area. We also met with survivors that, you know, you have to learn more about, being through this path and seeing them going through this for such a long time. For example, when we were in Aurora, when we were in Columbine, that happened 20 years ago, and we still see those faces, sad. But optimistic that we are in -- we are more in this movement and we can really -- the more we are, the better we're going to get results. So, that was that was the positive side of this visit.",

I'm either optimistic or I lose this and I just move on with the norm, which I will never accept. We wake up every morning, there's a lot of kids with us, a lot of young Americans that really believe that they're going to find those changes in society, which is beyond gun violence. We're talking about things that really concern them, like climate change and civil rights. So, I'm glad that we could be part of that. We can fit and try to get results together. And going around the nation for 50 days showed that there's a lot of us, and we're ready to organize better and have that louder voice. That's the goal here.",

Because we have also seen entrenched issues, even if people are touched by gun violence, sometimes it doesn't change their point of view on that issue. P. OLIVER: Yes. We've been seeing that too, but that's -- you know, we -- I consider that they are a minority in this situation. Actually, I've been seeing more people concerned even though that they're just -- they're advocating because they believe that we have to find an answer, a quick answer to all these craziness that is happening in the country by the hour. So, that it makes me feel more comfortable with more hope that next year, as Manuel just said, we are in an electoral year, we have more and more people connected to this specific cause, because this is our goal, this is our mission. And I've been seeing that people is waking up, that is not affected directly, but considers that it's important to fight against this.",

You went right to the doorstep of the NRA, the National Rifle Association. What do you think that evokes from what you know are ardent supporters of the NRA? P. OLIVER: Well, that -- you know, that they act like cowards. They really sell to the world that they are powerful and they have a lot of money and that, which is right, which is correct. But at the very, very end, when you go there, when we were trying to bring all these 22 buses next to us, because we're 23 total, they freak out. They just start blocking the streets, they start detouring all the buses, and they just allowed us to come with our bus. So, that says a lot from them. They were bringing big trucks to get everybody arrested. I don't know which were everyone arrested. M. OLIVER: Twenty-two empty school buses. P. OLIVER: Because we were just like twenty people there. Because we couldn't go home because they start blocking the streets. So, they got to the event an hour later. So, that that says a lot. And that was my first time going to the NRA. So, I know more or less how they react. The last time we were having a campaign with cookies and they were asking on Christmas time that we have to exchange cookies for ammunition. So, we were there. I was there with David Hogg. And we were trying to get those ammunitions back to get -- you know, to be safer, because we don't believe in that. And they were just closing the doors. They did the same thing that they did last week with us, and they did the same thing with us, they didn't allow us to pass the premises with the cookies. And I said, you were asking for cookies. I brought the cookies. I just need the ammunitions and we are all good. And they didn't do that. They ignored us.",

OLIVER: Well, you got to keep going because, you know, we lost Joaquin on the streets. And I always said, and I said it immediately the day after what happened to Joaquin, I said, you know, we lost Joaquin on the streets, and on the streets we have to be. We're going to have to have time to grieve, to cry, we're going to hold our pillow, we're going to take a shower, we're going to cry there, but we need to do our job outside, because this is now going to happen like, not -- you know, we're not going to pretend that this is just -- that Joaquin was lost, that was killed, and we don't want to do anything about it, on the contrary. That gave us the power, that gave you the action, that gave you the passion, because Joaquin was an incredible human being, that he was already connected to this cause and we don't want to let him down. And that's the main reason why we're on the streets. M. OLIVER: We're also Joaquin's parents. We -- how we feel when you look and you think how Joaquin felt that day, the pain, the fear, the suffering, we as parents, it's totally relevant how we feel. This is a duty.

President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, kissed one of the players on the lips after she received her gold medal. Now, he has since apologized, but the incident is proving just how long that road ahead is for women's sport. Spain were surrounded by controversy, in fact, going into the tournament after players accused the Federation and their coach of mistreatment. But they defied those odds, beating England one-nil. CNN sports analyst and sports columnist for USA Today, Christine Brennan, joins us now. Christine. Really good to have you on this. And we will get to those controversies. But I really want to hear from you about what we all know was exhilarating play on the pitch, right? You know, ending with the finals. The keeper did what she could to keep England in it. In the end, Spain was just too much. But really, from start to finish, this was quite a tournament, right? I mean, broke attendance records. Two billion people tuned in around the world.

And Spain, on the field, remarkable, Paula. It was as if the soccer ball was tied between all the players on a string. It is beautiful. The way they play, technically beautiful. And the building blocks of this team, the young players. Spain is winning everything. They're winning all the younger tournaments around the world. They're showing the world how to do it. The great performances, the joy with which they play. All of that, of course, as you alluded to, overshadowed by the controversies now. But a great credit to the athleticism of female athletes. England, all of the nations that came out of the woodwork to surprise other nations. The U.S. not playing well, as tough as that was for U.S. fans, it does show that the world has caught up, and that is a great credit to the U.S. women who fought for that and others around the world to see now that there are other nations, the misogynistic, sexist nations that couldn't have cared less about women's sports, now, Paula, they do care and we're seeing it on the field of play.",
