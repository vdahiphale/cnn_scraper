Western allies huddle in Munich and they look to show solidarity and dismiss talks of cracks in Ukraine's firewall. Plus, full disclosure. Senator John Fetterman checks himself into the hospital for clinical depression. And new text messages revealed topical sick fox. The same hosts who carried water for Donald Trump's election lies knew that his claims were \"really crazy.\"But up first, the diplomatic battlefield. Right now, the United States and its major western allies are in Munich as the war in Ukraine is about to hit its one-year mark. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy opened the global security meeting with this plea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE: Goliath must lose. There is no alternative to Ukrainian victory. There is no alternative to Ukraine in the E.U. There is no alternative to Ukraine in NATO. There is no, no alternative to our unity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Russians have been conducting what should be consoled - conceived as shaping operations, Abby.This is the use of increased use of artillery probing attacks, a lot of effort being put by the Russians into trying to find out where weaknesses may lie in the Ukrainian frontline ahead of what is anticipated to be a major Russian push. That is not to say that things have been dialed down in any way closer into the east in Bakhmut, which has been the scene of incredibly vicious fighting for the last several months. Recently with a considerable uptick particularly in the use of aviation, that's aircraft and helicopters, but also longer-range artillery, very heavy artillery bombardments indeed coming from the Russian side. And that, Abby, is because they have the edge in terms of the number of guns at their disposal. And above all of ammunition. On the ground, ground commanders are saying they're seeing the first signs of this push but they're also desperately short of artillery ammunition and ammunition for their tanks in particular. And it's that kind of thing really that the Ukrainians need. In addition, as President Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for fighter jets, helicopters and longer-range artillery. They want to be able to reach into the Russian logistics chain very deep into the rear to prevent the supply of arms and ammunition coming in because it is only then will they believe that they could get the edge over the Russians in this ongoing fight, Abby?",

CLARK: I think that the west from the beginning has been a little deterred by Mr. Putin, so nuclear power. If it weren't for his nuclear power, there'd be forces from all these countries in there actively assisting Ukraine. This is a violation of the U.N. Charter. It's absolutely naked aggression. We didn't let it stand in Kuwait. President Bush in 1990 said, this will not stand, we sent troops to Kuwait to protect oil. Here we're protecting 40 million people with our values, trying to establish world order. And we won't go in and help them because Mr. Putin has nuclear weapons. It's Ukraine's airspace yet, we won't put aircraft into Ukraine's airspace even if they ask for it because there might be a Russian air. So, what I'm saying, Abby, is---",

It took a while before the United States was ready and Europeans were ready to do that. Do you think that the planes are going to go the way of the tanks and that eventually no, will become yes?GEN. CLARK: Well, they certainly should. But Abby, if you do what Chancellor Scholz said, and you were really in this for the long haul, you would have already been training F-16 pilots. You would have had crews trained on M1 tanks, and then the politicians would make the decision. OK, now is the time to put the F-16 jet. If they decided today that they wanted to give Ukraine F-16s, those F- 16s wouldn't be ready to fight with Ukrainian pilots for a year. And that's the simple truth. And so, the strategy is just - it's just a mishmash here. And what I'm hoping would come out of Munich, is clear leadership by the United States. And so, what's the strategy? The battlefield action has to be linked to the goal of the war, the goal of the wars get Putin to stop. You have to find out what it is he values most and threaten it, then he would. Stop simply holding the line and hoping you're going to bleed him out, it's not likely to be a winning strategy.",

She said, she wanted those to face those officers who wanted to see them to their face. So, it was an important day for the community, an important day for this family to have this opportunity to be in that courtroom as these five officers walked in, pleading, not guilty to the charges.And now the process gets under way here as it appears that these attorneys for these five offices are going to vigorously defend their clients. As one would expect, one of the attorneys for Darius being one of the former officers said that there's still a lot more that we haven't seen, there's more video coming, more audio coming. There's information that has not yet been made public that he thinks will be helpful to his client, including the fact that he feels that his client was doing his job that day. And so, all of that certainly is starting to play out here, as we're starting to see some reaction from the attorneys for these officers. And really, this was a day for the community to come in a day for the families, so they could face these officers and a day for these officers to hear formally hear the charges against them. PHILLIP And Shimon, we're also learning that the Shelby County District Attorney's office is planning to review up to 100 cases tied to this Scorpion unit of which these officers were apart.

And what this is about is about these five officers who five former officers who are charged and their work their arrest cases that they were involved in, while they were with this now disbanded Scorpion unit.So that 75 cases at least 75 related to them. But then there's also an additional 25 that's related to another officer who has not been charged criminally, but was fired by the Memphis police department, Preston Hemphill, that officer who was fired, they are also reviewing cases. And this is just the start of it. So, I don't know that necessarily these numbers are going to stay at 100. It's likely they could grow and also significant that they could wind up dismissing many of these cases. So, that's certainly going to be something that we're going to have to look at.",

Last week, he was admitted to George Washington Hospital after experiencing some lightheadedness and it was in large part because of the fact, he really wasn't eating much, he was not drinking much.And then when he was discharged from George Washington Hospital, he met with the Capitol physician Brian Monahan on Monday. Monahan validated him and then diagnosed him with clinical depression on Wednesday. That's when Fetterman checked himself in to the hospital. Now, I am told by a source familiar with the matter that it's unclear exactly how long Fetterman will stay at Walter Reed Hospital. He's there voluntarily. This could be some an absence, could be a few weeks, could be a month, could be a little bit longer than a month. It really depends on what his medication, what ultimately the disease settled on, and what the proper medication is for him. So, that process could take a little bit of time. And there's been some speculation about his future, will he resign, will he be forced to resign. He's not planning on resigning. I'm told very, very bluntly here, he was just elected to his six-year term. There are a lot of senators who have had illnesses have been on for much longer. This is no different I'm told here.
