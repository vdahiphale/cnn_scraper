I think the challenge for prosecutors is really going to be to establish not just that these things happen but that there was some nexus between gifts and favors presented to Senator Menendez and his official actions.I think what stands out to that effect are some of the colorful details. For instance, the fact that you're dealing with gold bricks and big wads of cash, neither of which are themselves unlawful to purchase, but when considered in the context of other conduct just simply raises flags and certainly will not look good in front of a jury. With respect to this letter that he ghost-drafted for other senators, an important detail in the indictment is that he uses his personal email address to transact about it. Now, again, senators are free to use their personal email address, but they have official email addresses. And the mere use of some mode of communication, which appears to have been a way of evading further scrutiny is itself the kind of thing that will look bad in front of a jury. So, all of those details do paint a pretty broad picture and really do suggest, if not criminal behavior, certainly behavior that's not befitting someone being a United States senator.",

Elliot was speaking to that issue earlier. I think there has to be a nexus between the conduct alleged and the actual activities engaged in.What do I mean? It is the sole essence of a senator's job to represent constituents, to do what you do on behalf of them, to do it forcefully. And so now, where they're making an attempt, that is the government, believe to suggest that there was a quid pro quo. Now, if you suggest or you say that, then I want to see the connection. Are there emails with respect to I will act in the event, for example, that you pay me money, I will act if you give me gold bars, I will act if you line my pocket? So, I would really make the argument that this is not espionage. To the issue of people telling them to resign, you know, it's about to process. These are accusations. An indictment is an allegation. That allegation has to be substantiated in a court of law by a jury of your peers, which finds you guilty. That's not the essence of the evidence in an indictment in a grand jury. So, I don't think we could jump to conclusions with respect to his guilt or with respect to him being engaging in espionage. He, from a defense perspective, was representing his constituents forcefully. And that I think will be his attorney's argument at the core as they move forward.",

I think the challenge prosecutors are going to have in this case, as in any other, when you're dealing with public corruption as, and particularly in Washington, there is the conduct that maybe people find distasteful of the influence-peddling, the wheeling and wining and dining and the wheeling and dealing. But when does that rise to being criminal conduct? And prosecutors are going to have to establish a clear link between one act and another. And where I disagree with Joey a little bit is, in many respects, it's a political question. Do people want this individual to be a senator? That's very different than the criminal question. Can you convict him? And can prosecutors be successful on the basis of the conduct? What they laid out was a lot of evidence and a lot of information here, but a jury is going to have to believe a direct link between the gifts and the favors and the official action.

In order for us to move forward as a unified country, it's going to require a healthy Republican Party. And they have to become whole and healthy again.

And none of the Republicans are saying that he should not run for president of the United States.The fact of the matter is, some say even if he is convicted, they will vote for him. I say if someone is convicted, if after due process, Senator Menendez was convicted, then, clearly, he would not be able to be the senator from New Jersey, but due process. You know, I come from a community where due process did not happen for us for a long period of time, and many people fought and died for that right of due process. So, there's no way that I, with the background that I come from and understanding the history of this country, can step away from due process being the rule that has to still be followed.",

And, Wolf, this is quite interesting. What this is driven by is anger at the former president. When we asked a respondent here, voters in New Hampshire, what is driving their decision, anger toward the former president is higher than a lack of enthusiasm for the current president. So, certainly, just a snapshot in time. Obviously, this is considerably early. A, we do not know if there will be a rematch between them. And the dynamics could change, but certainly a benchmark. But, Wolf, what is underway here, of course, is a Republican primary campaign. And former South Carolina Governor and former U.N.

One is that judges in general are supposed to be independent and impartial and part of that is they're not supposed to be involved in either political events or fundraising events. And this Koch network donor summit in California is arguably both a political event and a fundraising event. So, we spoke to a judge who is George W. Bush appointee who said that it took his breath away that a judge would do this and as a lower- court judge, he would have been disciplined for doing something like this. But more specifically, you know, as you mentioned, the Koch Network has actually brought cases before the Supreme Court. There's one coming up in the Supreme Court turn that's about to begin. It's on a legal issue known as Chevron that most people haven't heard of. But has, you know, potentially huge ramifications for the government's ability to regulate things like the environment, labor, consumer protections. That's a case that Koch Network lawyers have brought to the Supreme Court, and, you know, now because of our reporting we now know that Justice Thomas has this, you know, very, very unusual relationship with this group that's litigating at the Supreme Court.",

It all started about two years ago when everybody was kind of shocked that hundreds of people showed up at the grassy knoll in Dallas, of course, where President Kennedy was assassinated almost 60 years ago. And this group of people, hundreds of them, we're seeing they're waiting for either Kennedy or his son, JFK, Jr., to show up. Now, they didn't materialize, most of those people went home. But this core group left their families for quite some time to wait for the Kennedys to return. Some people describing this as a cult. What we wanted to do with this documentary was kind of get beyond these irrational beliefs because that is what they are, and really look at the impact that this is having on American families, but also why people are going down these rabbit holes in the first place. And, you know, really what we found is that the people who believe in this, many of them, they aren't always, quote/unquote, always been crazy people or quacks. Many of them productive members of society, loving -- have loving families, have jobs. But something clicked. Often times it's a trauma or they're going through a tough time, and they find these communities online and they get sucked into them. And, as you can see from that interview there with Erica Vigrasa from Pittsburgh, her brother got sucked into this rabbit hole. And you can see the devastation it causes, Wolf.",
