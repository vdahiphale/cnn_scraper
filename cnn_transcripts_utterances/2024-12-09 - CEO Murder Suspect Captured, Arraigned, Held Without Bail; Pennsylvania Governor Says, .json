It spread all around really this country and this world.Essentially, what we're learning from police is that it was someone who spotted him eating at this McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, who then alerted an employee at that McDonald's, who then called police, is a person -- rather a police officer, only six months on the job, then responded to that call, confronted Luigi Mangione there while he was eating while he was typing on his laptop right there at that restaurant, essentially said, please lower your mask because he was still wearing a mask at that time, and was able to also identify the fact that he looked like this person in those pictures. And we're told through the complaint that when asked had he been in New York City recently, he got nervous, he got quiet, he started to shake a little bit. He also didn't give police his actual name. He gave them a fake name, which also is in correspondence with what they also found on him, which was a number of fake I.D.s, including one fake I.D., which directly ties him back here to New York. That was a key piece of evidence for police is what you're looking at right here. This New Jersey fake I.D., which police say he used when he checked into a hostel on the upper west side before this murder was committed last week. Police also finding on him a ghost gun, as well as a magazine filled with a number of bullets, as well as articles of clothing, cash a number of things that police are now looking into as part of this investigation. As you just said, Audie, he is now in custody right now, NYPD waiting to also now work with the Manhattan D.A. to file its own charges, extradite him back here to New York and continue this investigation.",

Our group's going to discuss. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:15:00] CORNISH:  Tonight, the internet cheers on an alleged shooter indifferent to the killing of health insurance CEO. 24 hours after gunman murdered the head of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, the company shutdown comments on a LinkedIn post noting his death. On Facebook, same thing, comments on lock after a post about Thompson's killing received more than 6,000 thumbs up, 400 laughs, and 78 claps. Just hours after the arrest of Luigi Mangione, the reaction is very, very different. The comments posted in reaction to the CNN news post, brutal. McDonald's employees snitched on a working class hero, 251 likes. I hope someone creates a GoFundMe for his legal defense. This man needs to be acquitted of any and all charges. Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear backpacks. Does he need someone to corroborate his alibi, because I got him? And leave him alone, he did us justice. It's okay for a CEO to intentionally hurt people, but not okay when the tables turn? Well, Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro addressed the online praise for the suspected killer this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  Violence can never be used to address political differences or to address a substantive difference or to try and prove some ideological point. That is not what we do in a civilized society. That was true in Butler. It was true in New York City. The suspect here who shot at that CEO and killed that CEO is a coward, not a hero.
