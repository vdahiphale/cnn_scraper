      "sentences": "-- and that chaos you described was a roomful of lawyers, there were lawyers. But for one witness on the stand, who should be very well versed in what it means to have decorum in the courtroom, but this tells you just how much emotions were running and what is at stake in this issue. And he did try to pull back on a number of things, warning, talking to them about trying to ensure that they had their proper and professional decorum here.But remember what's at stake here? These litigants who are trying to disqualify her, they are trying to take you inside of the bedroom of the DA. She wants you to remain inside of the courtroom of Fulton County. Why? Because in order to disqualify her, it's not about her romantic interludes or lack thereof, it's not about necessarily exclusively whether they had a relationship, they admit to that. It is about whether that relationship gave a personal financial benefit to the DA that must be proven. And here's another element to it, John, it had to actually undermine the ability of the defendants to have a fair trial. There's a lot of salacious information they want to extract from her, perhaps, inquiring minds, as they say, want to know. But the judge as the ultimate enquirer, wants to know, was there a financial benefit you can prove? And on that front, there was testimony that came in yesterday from Nathan Wade and Fani Willis about having multiple sources of income? If I were to ask anyone in the audience today listening --",

If you can end her testimony and put a bow on this, you're happy, you don't want to bring her back, all that can happen is that if she comes back, it's unpredictable. You don't want the DA on the stand. If you have an opportunity to end this, you end this.Now from the other side, from the defendants point of view, I think they've recognized properly that she's not going to suddenly give it up. She's not going to admit she ordered the code red. She's not going to order she's done any of the things that she has been alleged to do, the way the defendants are going to have to prove their case is with other evidence with documents relating to bank records or phone calls with other witnesses. That's the only way they're really going to undercut her, they're not going to get her to just reverse herself on the stand.",

That's kind of the way normal court actually is not caught on T.V., right. And so their calculation, though, I think, is a big mistake on the part of the defense to not clean up yesterday's testimony. The prosecutor was smart.I agree with Elie not to cross examine her, right, because that's what they could have done is cross examined Fani Willis is really it's a cross examination of their own witness. But the defense should have focused the questions on the finances today. Because as Elie said, you can easily ordered documents that they either are or they aren't a certain way, or they either say or they don't say a certain thing. And they just haven't met their burden of disqualification. So if I were on the defense side, I would want to focus my questioning away from the relationship and more just on how does it work in the office? How do you hire someone who approves? How do you decide how much he gets paid versus other people get paid? What were those conversations like? How did you determine $250 an hour? All of the things that would potentially go to disqualification and they didn't do it. And so that to me is curious.",

Well, clearly, if we believe Ms. Merchant, and she said it in court with her phone. She's got text messages from this lawyer which will refute the testimony of the District Attorney. So they may have wanted to lock Ms. Willis in which they've done yesterday.

This guy represented him to some extent in his divorce and said, no, shut up, can't talk. He has a right to do that.But if Fani Willis and Nathan Wade are going to say we met these charges head on. We were transparent and open. It's hard to reconcile that with invoking the privilege on what could be a really crucial piece of evidence. If there are, to be clear, if there are texts from Nathan Wade to this lawyer before Nathan Wade and Fani Willis say the relationship started showing that they were already in a relationship, that's a big if.

She had to be calm down, according to those that we've spoken to during that break. But it wasn't a surprise necessarily to see her stand her ground.Fani Willis is a strong, independent woman. She showcased that yesterday. She is a formidable force. And she is all about respect. Talking to those around her, she is not going to be one of these people that thinks that somebody is going to go have to fight or defend her own name. She wants to do that. And that's what we saw yesterday. She saw -- we saw her call Ashleigh Merchant a liar. She is insulted by the very essence of these allegations. She feels that is a gossip, an attempted gossip -- an attempted, creating a circus and a spectacle and to delay what was on track for an August trial date. And it has.

There's a mistrust of the systems at large people feel like this is our hard earned money that we earn with blood, sweat and tears.
