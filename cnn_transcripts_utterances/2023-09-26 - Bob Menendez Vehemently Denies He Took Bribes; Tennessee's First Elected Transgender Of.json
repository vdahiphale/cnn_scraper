Menendez held a news conference Monday in his home state of New Jersey. He said the half million dollars in cash.Federal investigators uncovered were his savings for emergencies and he said he will be fully exonerated. Menendez and his wife are accused of taking bribes to help three New Jersey businessmen and the Government of Egypt. Peter Welch of Vermont has now become the third U.S. Senate Democrat to demand Menendez stepped down. New Jersey's Governor also has done so but Menendez says he isn't budging.

They and the three businessmen are due in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday. A Criminal Defense Attorney tells CNN what prosecutors will have to prove in order to get convictions.
