I'm Laila Harrak.A familiar face at the political act conference in Maryland, former U.S. President Trump makes his pitch to be the Republican nominee for the White House again. Bakhmut could be on the verge of falling to Russian troops but Ukrainian forces say they're holding on in the fight to keep the city. And just over a month since the toxic train derailment in East Palestine Ohio, another Norfolk Southern freight train derails in the state An adoring crowd greeted former U.S. President Donald Trump Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Trump spoke for nearly two hours promising retribution against Democrats and establishment Republicans. An unscientific straw poll of CPAC attendees found that 62 percent want him to be the next Republican presidential nominee compared to 20 percent who want Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Well, CNN U.S. National Correspondent Kristen Holmes is there to at the conference and has this report. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Trump talking to a very enthusiastic crowd here at CPAC. He pitched himself for another trip to the Oval Office. He talked about how he wanted to obliterate the deep state. He took on the establishment, particularly Republicans. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're not going back to people that want to destroy our great social security system, even some in our party, I wonder who that might be, that want to raise the minimum age of social security to 70, 75 or even 80 in some cases and that are out to cut Medicare to a level that it will no longer be recognizable.

This is something Trump has gone after him a number of times over.Now, the Florida governor has not entered the 2024 presidential race but he is seen as Trump's most formidable opponent should he decide to run for president. But it was interesting as we walked around during this event for the last several days, this used to be the premier event for conservatives, instead it's seems now like the Trump show. Almost all of the speakers were Trump-centric, they were supporters, they're people who wanted to see him in office in 2024 and it showcased really the deep divide within the Republican Party, particularly as we noted so many of these potential 2024 hopefuls decided to skip the event this years, and it really set up what is expected to be a very ugly Republican primary.

He was certainly invited but he chose not to speak there, as well as some other high named Republicans such as Mike Pence and Tim Scott.Others have recognized CPAC as more of a place really that is loyal to Donald Trump, and their time is best served elsewhere. Many of them went down to the state of Florida to speak with the group called Club for Growth, which is an anti-tax group, and they see that as more of the place to go to move their message forward. And what we're seeing is while a lot of people at this event over last few days are strong Trump supporters as evidenced by the straw poll, many in the Republican Party are realizing that it's time to turn the page. We're looking at the fact that with Donald Trump in the White House, we lost the House and the Senate. Of course, we regained the House but we lost the house and Senate and the White House due to his leadership, in large part because of his election denying and conspiracy theories.",

But as of right now, Ukrainian forces holding the line of resistance, Ukrainian troops say they've been able in the last 24 hours to stabilize that frontline. They say Russian forces, of course, remain on the outskirts of the city on the other side of a body of water, a river that divides them and Bakhmut itself, the city itself is still under Ukrainian control.But one Ukrainian commander says every hour in that city is like hell. Ukrainian forces say they've been able to repel dozens of attacks just in the last 24, 48 hours by Moscow's troops in those Wagner mercenaries, of course, attacks by artillery, heavy shelling, multiple rocket launches literally everything Moscow's troops can get their hands on being lobbed at this battle. It would very much be a victory for President Putin, who has claimed very few wins in the last few months. In fact, in the period of last year, the second half of last year, what we saw Ukrainian forces able to claim back serious amounts of territory from President Putin's forces. So, you can imagine the Kremlin is absolutely desperate for a win, particularly when it's given so much resources, depleted so much manpower over the course the last few months to take this one city. But this would be largely a symbolic victory, Laila, for Russia. There's very little strategic value in the city of Bakhmut itself. It does begin to give them more of a bridge, more of that territory in the Donbas region. It's wedged between these two separatist areas, these two areas that are controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Luhansk and Donetsk. So, it does expand that territory of Russian control if Moscow is able to claim it. And for President Zelenskyy, it is also very symbolic. He's vowed never to back down, never to let a drop of Ukrainian blood go in vain, to gain back every single inch of territory for his countrymen. So, what you're going to see happening in the next few days, Laila, is an absolutely ferocious battle for what very much now is the city at the heart of this conflict.",

And this is a significant step, because, initially, he said he made a mistake and he had sort of admitted to what was going on. But we're going to hear details about what we heard and the recording when he spoke to the train driver saying, you should pass the red lights and also ordering the switch key operator to not turn the key and change track. That is going to be absolutely vital in understanding what happened.In meantime, being in Athens, you get the sense that everyone is traumatized. There's a peculiar energy when you walk in the streets and you speak to people. And I guess it's pretty much evidence in some of the newspaper headlines here. I just want to show you a couple. This is from eKathimerini. This is just a black page with candles, this being quite a few vigils around the country. Every single church is holding memorial service. There's another headline, which is quite striking. It says guilty and fatal and showing the people that perhaps are responsible for this, including the transport minister that resigned, prime minister, the station master and a few other people that are leading some of these state-owned enterprises. There will be protest action, peaceful protests that are also organized across the country. They will be occurring in around an hour's time. People here feel that there was a lack of maintenance, that they hadn't been focused on a very well known fact that Greece's railway system urgently needed upgrading and modernizing. Greece's railway safety track record, according to the E.U., had the worst in the index across the European Union. So, it basically shows that this was something that had been discussed. Another vital point to this is the pain and the anger that has ensued in the aftermath. Most of the people, most of the passengers on this train were young university students. There was only one survivor from the first carriage, which we know 57 people dead, 15 people in hospital and 7 currently in critical condition. This is a story that is going to plague the country for many months.",

That's what Jack Sullivan on the U.S. side said, but the German government said, no, it wasn't, we didn't put pressure on the U.S., this was a decision that we took together. So, it's not entirely clear how this came about but the message that, I mean, both really want to send, Scholz and Biden, is a message of unity in the transatlantic relation, a unity also among the European and American partners.

And to be honest I would have liked Germany and also France and other Europeans to step up and take more of a lead. I mean, all of these countries are supporting Ukraine and they're also working together, but Scholz in particular has been looking a lot to D.C. more than to, say, London. London also announced that they were sending tanks before the U.S. did but that didn't seem to have an impact.

Across the country, police using arrests and beatings to crush dissent against the Ukrainian war. Some anti-war protesters even drafted into the army in a cruel punishment for pacifism. Political opposition always a risky business in Putin's Russia is now essential outlawed with prominent opposition leaders like Ilia Yashin recently sentenced to eight and a half years in jail for criticizing the conflict. This will all end soon, he shouted in defiance, but there's little real reason for optimism. This was Vladimir Kara-Murza, another leading opposition figure in Moscow back in 2015 after surviving a suspected poisoning at the hands of Kremlin agents. He was allegedly poisoned again in 2017 and survived that too, only to be imprisoned last April on charges ranging from disobeying the police to treason. The price of silence Kara-Murza wrote from jail was simply unacceptable. But the price of speaking out against Putin's Russia is extraordinarily high too.
