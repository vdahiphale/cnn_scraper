Millions of people, over five states, we are tracking it all.I'm John Berman in Tallahassee. Sara's out today. Kate Bolduan with Jessica Dean in New York. This is CNN News Central. And I am John Berman in Florida this morning, which is bracing for Hurricane Helene, which is heading straight for this part of the state, the panhandle. It's a category 1 hurricane strengthening overnight, expecting to make landfall as a category 3 or stronger on the Big Bend area of Florida. The good news, not a populated area. The bad news, once it makes landfall, it will cross paths with millions and millions of people, 85 million people in its path from Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, all the way up to Virginia. They have all declared states of emergency. Along the Florida coast, though it is not that populated, they could see storm surge of nearly 20 feet. The weather service calls that unsurvivable storm surge. Add to that, wind speeds that could reach 130 miles per hour. Again, Tallahassee has never had hurricane force winds, sustained winds. We could see winds here north of 100 miles per hour. And the damage after it hits here, it will spread all the way up the coast. CNN is tracking this storm. Carlos Suarez in Gulfport, Florida, which is feeling it harder than I am right now. First, though, let's go to CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar in the Weather Center to get a sense of where it is now, where it's headed, what it did overnight.",

That is in Pinellas County where already we're starting to see some flooding associated with the storm. Now, a good part of this is the fact that we're in high tide at this hour. But some of that rain that has moved in has clearly started to make a bit of a mess out here.This area in Pinellas County is known to flood. We have been here the last two years covering two other hurricanes, and this is a prime location for some of the flooding to take place. We are in a mandatory evacuation zone. That order went out yesterday. Folks that live in this part of Pinellas County were told to get to higher ground. Over in Hillsborough County in the Tampa area, a mandatory evacuation is underway for some parts of the city along the Bayside. And then if you head further north, of course, those parts of Florida have already been preparing for all of what's to come here in Perry, Florida, which is about 3.5 hours north of where we are. Preparations got underway there yesterday with folks getting their homes and their businesses boarded up and getting ready for yet another impact of a hurricane. The folks in Perry, Florida, are still recovering from Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall last year and flooded hundreds of homes there. And then up in the in Tallahassee in the Leon County area, that part of Florida, the panhandle there, state emergency officials really are telling folks across the state of Florida to please take this storm serious. As you guys have been discussing, the sheer size of this is just so great that it really doesn't matter where you live in Florida. You are going to see some sort of impact associated with this storm if you live not just in Florida, but as you mentioned up in Georgia as well. Here now is Governor DeSantis yesterday kind of striking that same tone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  The impacts are going to be far beyond the eye of the storm. You're looking at winds that are stretching 200-plus miles away from the eye of the storm. So, that entire Gulf Coast of Florida, even places like charlotte and Sarasota, of course, the Tampa Bay area and then up along the nature coast in the Big Bend, expect to see a surge.

You can see it on red there on your map.The big concern in that area is storm surge, which could be as much as 20 feet, which forecasters call unsurvivable. Of course, CNN's Marybel Gonzalez is in that area, which may not be able to sustain some of the damage in Steinhatchie, Florida. Maribel, great to see you.

Residents here, as you mentioned, they are pretty used to being under these severe weather conditions, but many of them are not taking any chances. And a local sheriff here is urging those people to please get out while they still can, adding that if he was not the sheriff of his area, he too would be evacuating.Now, if you can see a little bit now, we can see because the sun has started to come up, but the area that we're in, the concerns here continue to be that flooding. It was raining earlier this morning. It has tapered off a little bit, but we do expect that to continue as Helene inches closer and closer to us. As you can see off the riverbanks, there are properties here. There are people's homes that are here just feet away from the riverbank. There are boats that are docked. All of those are expected to sustain severe, even potentially catastrophic damage. And we know that people have been preparing for that for days. And it's not just here in this region. We know that this is happening across the state of Florida. Just yesterday, right outside of Tampa, we were at a sandbag distribution center and people were there early morning loading up on those sandbags, not only to protect their own homes, but also those of their neighbors volunteering and helping distribute those to their elderly neighbors and also those with mobility issues. Now, as we mentioned, in areas like these low lying areas, we do know there are mandatory evacuations in place. Businesses have been closed for ever since. Actually, last night, we saw many of those closed. The curfews are now being enforced. People are bracing for the worst, but definitely hoping for the best.",

The request and meeting is going to come as the future of American support for Ukraine could be up on the in the air depending on the outcome of the upcoming election.Now, later this afternoon, Zelenskyy and President Biden will sit down in the Oval Office, where Zelenskyy is expected to present a victory plan to President Biden. Now, it's not clear exactly what that will entail that hasn't been laid out by Zelenskyy just yet, but sources who have been briefed on the matter say that Zelenskyy is expected not just to request more aid for Ukraine, but also trying to seek some long-term security guarantees to try to ensure that American support can continue despite, or regardless of what happens in November's election as both Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are facing off in a very close race. He also has been pushing for the U.S. to grant the approval and authorization of the use of western-made long range weapons deeper into Russia. That is something that so far President Biden has not granted, though he has shown some openness to the possibility. Now, heading into this meeting, the White House and President Biden announced so we're going to be looking at some new security assistance for Ukraine that includes President Biden saying that he's authorized $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority. That's money that's already allocated by Congress, but that Biden needed to formally approve and authorize by September 30th, or else it would have expired. There is also another $2.4 billion coming from the Defense Department security initiative for Ukraine. They're also rolling out some new long range weapons that they will be providing to the country, Patriot missiles as well, as President Biden has insisted he wants to continue to ensure that Ukraine has the ability to defend themselves and wage this war against Russia.",
