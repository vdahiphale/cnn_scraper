It came in, in 2017. That essentially was meant to control how police officers were allowed to use their weapons at police stops. In fact, what critics of it say, and there are now calls from the opposition for it to be changed is that, it allowed -- it led to a hike in the number of violent traffic stops. Because essentially, police men and women were told that they could use their weapon in such cases if they felt that their lives or the lives of others were in danger. When you look at the instances over the last few years since that, they have gone up. So the prosecutor being very clear, the policeman himself has been suspended, and yet, Isa, that is not doing very much to calm things down. We've just heard from the Elysee Palace just nearby here, that they believe a state of emergency is not necessary. And yet, what is being planned for tonight is the deployment of armored vehicles and more men -- police men and women to try and restore order. In fact, just down behind me at the Place de la Concorde, we're expecting a gathering they've been called for in other cities around the country. And as you were just hearing from Nick, there, there will be this funeral tomorrow and more protests. In fact, some planned here for the Champs- Elysees. So, you have a disconnect on one hand between the language of the government, which is about restoring law and order, pursuing this particular policeman. That is what the judiciary is doing. And the popular anger there that doesn't seem to be calmed by any of that so far, Isa.",

Yevgeny Prigozhin is said to be in exile after accepting a deal brokered by Belarus to end his brief rebellion against Russia's military. But it's not just Ukraine that may be on the guard. EU countries neighboring Belarus are also concerned about the possibility the Wagner mercenary forces could turn up closer to their doorstep. I want to get more now from our Nick Paton Walsh, who is live for us this hour in Kyiv. And Nick, then, what is your assessment of this decision by President Zelenskyy to bolster the northern defenses? Does Ukraine see a direct threat from Wagner mercenaries in Belarus.

Right in front of me, I have the statement from the Polish internal security agency. And we have quite a number of significant piece of information here. For example, we are learning that, that athlete has been in Poland since October of 2021. He was a professional hockey player for one of the first league clubs in Poland. We are learning that we don't know if he was caught in Silesia because he was performing some sort of illegal activities there or because he simply was based there. But what we do know is that, he was for example spying on critical infrastructure in other regions. So this was, if you will, a countrywide operation potentially even. We do know also that he was spying on critical infrastructure, and that, that was taking place, for example, in the form of taking pictures. We do know that he was paid for his efforts, and that he was updating his handlers, if you will, quite regularly. And as a precautionary measure, that man has been sent to prison for three months because the judge ruled that he is a flight risk.

And since that time, we have learned that 14 people have been detained. This man is the 14th person detained from that network. They all have been identified as foreigners from countries east of Poland. They are accused of conducting special espionage operations. Now, the man we were talking about today, he has also already been charged. And generally-speaking, when we talk about these situations, those are people who are accused of monitoring critical infrastructure, monitoring for example, the railway network, and also of promoting hostile damaging propaganda aimed at NATO, aimed at Poland, aimed at the Polish government.

He did say many pieces of information that are just straight up incorrect. I want to tell you a little bit about what they were. These were read out loud in the court proceedings over the past three days. One of the things he said is that the '22 elections might have been compromised due to fraud. He did not substantiate this, how that would have happened. He did say also that in 2018, voting machines literally changed the answers of voters, people's votes to that of his opponent, even though he won that election. He also said that the machines were not auditable, that they couldn't be looked inside to see how they were working. He insinuated that the justices of the Supreme Electoral Court, the very justices that were now in charge of his destiny, that they were working for terrorists. All of these claims, Isa, were shut down by the Electoral Court, of course. And in the votes today and yesterday, as they started coming in, I just want to read you a little bit of how they framed this, how seriously this court took them. They called it a criminal extremism, attacking the powers of the state, fake news, disinformation that were put there to try and deceive voters. Now talking to the international community, expressing these concerns, that is not necessarily the place of a president. No foreign policy was debated that as Alexandre de Moraes said as he cast his vote for his ineligibility today, Isa. It's a matter that's being taken extremely seriously here.",
