      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.New not guilty pleas, in Georgia, including from Rudy Giuliani, who just waived his right, to an arraignment, as tonight, Mark Meadows awaits a crucial ruling that could potentially impact the entire criminal case. Plus, they met in Florida, after Hurricane Ian, and the Surfside condo collapse. President Biden said he would be with Governor Ron DeSantis, again, tomorrow, when he's in Florida. But now, the Republican governor and 2024 candidate is saying otherwise. And efforts to knock Trump off the ballot are gaining steam. It's a longshot legal theory, but it is now at the heart of a battle, between Republicans. One of them, who is leading the charge, will join me, in moments. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Rudy Giuliani has now joined 11 other co-defendants, in pleading not guilty, as we head into this holiday weekend, all waving their arraignments, in Georgia, next week. That leaves seven left to enter their own please. And we are still waiting, tonight, to learn about Mark Meadows' fate, a decision that could come at any time, on his attempt, to move his case, to federal court. But that would just be the first step in what he is ultimately trying to do here, which is get his charges dismissed, entirely. If this doesn't come by Wednesday, Trump's former Chief of Staff will still have to enter a plea, just like Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and 10 others have done so far. Meanwhile, the first defendant, with a scheduled trial date, in Georgia, Kenneth Chesebro, had made crystal clear, in a motion today, that he really, really wants nothing to do, with his fellow co- defendant, Sidney Powell, who followed in his footsteps, and also asked for a speedy trial. Chesebro arguing, they are like \"Oil and water; wholly separate and impossible to mix (into one conspiracy).\" Just to reinforce the idea, here, he said, in his court filing, he has never physically met Powell, never sent an email to her, never received an email from her, never called her, never received a phone call from her, never texted her, never received a text message from her, and never communicated with Powell, through any social media or telecommunication app. Got it? Meanwhile, Trump has filed a motion, to separate his case, from both Kenneth Chesebro, and Sidney Powell. Let's break all of this down, tonight, with two top Georgia prosecutors. J. Tom Morgan, the former DeKalb County District Attorney; and Melissa Redmon, a former Fulton County prosecutor. J. Tom, I will start with you. I mean, obviously you were part of that brief, I should note, against Meadows, trying to move that to court. We're still waiting to hear what happens there. But with Rudy Giuliani, pleading not guilty, making it a total of 12, who've done so already, that means they don't actually have to show up, in court, next week. What is the strategy in that? Is there a strategy, do you believe? J. TOM MORGAN, FORMER DEKALB COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Kaitlan, what they're trying to do is divide and conquer, by having separate trials, in different courts, and that way of pushing the prosecutor, in many different directions. The underlying, with Mr. Meadows, and everybody else, Kaitlan, trying to get into federal court, is they do not want this case broadcasts to the American people. And no offense to your profession, journalism, but I don't want a reporter, to tell me what was said in court. I want to see it for myself. And that's what these defendants are trying to do. They do not want this case, in federal court, where the secrecy and cameras and recorders are not allowed.",

On the Jan. 6 committee, we saw with Cassidy Hutchinson. She initially had a Trump-paid lawyer. And she came to us, and said, \"I don't recall. I don't recall. I don't recall.\" When she got a new lawyer, she came in, she told the truth, and she provided some of the most damning testimony against Trump.

And when you're charged and indicted, the quickest way to get out of a case is to plead guilty. And the best way to avoid liability, when you plead guilty, is to cooperate. So, some of these folks, especially those who are charged, with the RICO charge, which has heavier penalties, they start building financial pressures? That's just the beginning. And we are early. We haven't had motion practice. We haven't had court appearances. This case has not even begun to warm up. So, when it does get moving, those bills are going to skyrocket.

Hours later, a spokesman, for the Florida governor, issued a statement that reads, in part, quote, \"In these rural communities, and so soon after\" the impact, \"the security preparations alone that would go into setting up such a meeting would shut down ongoing recovery efforts.\" That would be different than what we saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian last year, when Governor DeSantis, and President Biden, and the first spouses did meet. The White House says their visit to Florida has been planned, in close coordination with FEMA, as well as State and local leaders, to ensure quote that \"There is no impact on response operations,\" also noting that Biden told Governor DeSantis, yesterday, that he would be coming, and the Governor did not express any concerns during that call. Joining me now, Jason Osborne, and Kate Bedingfield. Of course, Jason, former Trump campaign adviser, and Kate Bedingfield, the former White House -- Biden White House Communications Director, I should note. Jason, I mean, I think, the question here is, is this a legitimate reason? Because, they met after Hurricane Ian. It didn't seem to be an issue, then. I think it was there were a few more days in between when the actual storm struck, and when President Biden came down. But they also met after the condo disaster, in Surfside. I mean, what do you think has changed here? And do you think this is legitimate? JASON OSBORNE, FORMER SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST, BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016: Well, first off, Roll Tide. Secondly, yes, I do think this is -- I think there's a couple things at play here, right? I mean, the security aspect of it is very important, because it is a rural area. I mean, if this hurricane was going to hit anywhere, if you needed it to hit anywhere, this is the area to hit it, because it was very rural and very farmland and foresty. So, having Biden come in, and even having the Governor go in, to some of these areas, is a big undertaking. You have to set up the perimeters, around, for security purposes. You don't know what you're walking into, in many cases.

This year, with so far, with this hurricane, I think we saw record numbers of folks without power, getting their power back, and minimal damage.

So, I don't think that the Christie-Obama situation is at the forefront. It's probably for a few of the staffers, a memory that they would not like to relive.

I think, as I reflect on the anniversary, I just think so much about the work ahead, because while we can look back, we can go through the mistakes that we've made, I think the more important work to be done, is to figure out how we can take care of those, who took care of us, and who fought a war that we asked them to, on our behalf. So, making sure that they are taken care of, in the United States, that they're evacuated, from the countries that they may be in now, whether it's Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran or elsewhere?

But he's still claiming that his actions were consensual, when, of course, Jenni Hermoso says that they were not. Julie Foudy is a retired Captain of the U.S. Women's National Team, and a gold medalist in soccer. Julie, what do you make of his continued defiance, here, and the perspective, and the shaping this gives, to Spain's standing in soccer? JULIE FOUDY, FORMER U.S. OLYMPIC WOMEN'S SOCCER GOLD MEDALIST, RETIRED CAPITAIN OF THE U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: Well, he just continues to dig that hole. I don't understand the point of all of this. I think, obviously, what we've seen is, one, you have, for the first time ever, a women's team in Spain, win that World Cup. And that has never happened in that country. So, in this moment of joy and glee, for these women, all of a sudden, all of that is taken away, by this man's, Rubiales' refusal, to one, even apologize, at first. He just said \"No, I'm not resigning. I'm doubling down actually. And it was consensual,\" and it was almost blaming it on her. They even threatened to sue Jenni Hermoso, as we know, the Spanish Federation. So, I think, the difference, honestly, Kaitlan, this time around, because obviously we know this has been happening for a very long time, in women's sports? And not just women's sports. I think a lot of women, watching, will agree that this happens in a lot of different industries is that you have this movement, culturally, in society, where you're seeing a global reaction, to this. Not just soccer players, defending her, not just women. We've seen men soccer players. We've seen men's Spanish national team players, threatening not to play, for their Spanish national team. But there has been a global reaction to that. And the government is responding to it. And so, I think this will not end well for him.",

And so, the Spanish Federation, when that letter came to them, said, \"How dare you even threaten this? That's not your lane. Apologize.\" They slapped him on the wrist and said, \"Apologize, or you will never play for the Spanish national team.\" So, that Spanish national team that actually won this World Cup had about 10 players, who would not go back to the national team, that were stars. It wasn't even their best team. To give you a sense of this is not just about a kiss. This is about a larger systemic issue.

This, of course, bars any American official who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, from holding future office, if they later engaged, in quote, an \"Insurrection or rebellion.\" The man behind this push, in New Hampshire, Corky Messner joins me now. Corky, of course, as I noted, it bears repeating, you were endorsed by Trump, when you ran, for the U.S. Senate, I should note.

And I think that because we're in the first-in-the-nation primary here, it's important that this issue get decided, as soon as possible, because if it gets decided, after the first-in-the-nation primary, here in New Hampshire, then the New Hampshire voters will be disenfranchised. So, he's seeking guidance, from the Attorney General. I think that's a good move, on his part. And everyone's awaiting his decision. And then, based on that decision, we'll decide how best to proceed. It's, the Baude article that talks about this, it's very, very compelling that Donald Trump is in fact disqualified.
