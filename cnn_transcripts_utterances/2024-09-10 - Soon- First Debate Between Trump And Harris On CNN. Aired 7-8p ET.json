We're just steps away from the National Constitution Center where the Harris-Trump debate will begin in less than two hours. You can see it live here on CNN. This will be the very first time a sitting vice president and a former president go head-to-head in a presidential debate. Another extraordinary aspect of tonight's faceoff with comes only about two months since the Biden-Trump debate on CNN transformed the race. Our political team is out in force to set the stage for the 90- minute debate and to break down the strategies and the stakes for both the Trump and Harris campaigns. First, let's go to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, also here in Philly, covering the Harris campaign. And, Priscilla, you have some new information on how Vice President Harris is preparing to take on former President Trump.",

They say they know that Trump can be a wild card and they anticipate that there will be falsehoods that he spews tonight. So these debate preparations has been focused on how the vice president navigates those moments, that she not get roped into those falsehoods, especially because those microphones are expected to be turned off when each candidate is speaking. Instead, sources have wanted -- have told me that they want her to stay focused on the message and speak directly to the American people.

He thought he did well in that debate and then he came off stage and saw the faces of his advisors who were like, it did not go well. So he's very wary of being too aggressive and how he was towards Joe Biden in that debate.I will say within two minutes, the other reason that Trump campaign is hoping it will help him is that as they've been rehearsing, you know, he knows what that -- what that kind of clock is like. He did it with you-alls debate where he has the time to answer the question, but also pushed back on Harris and kind of pivot to what his argument is, either against her or what he would do it and what I've heard though from his advisers have been talking to him in recent days as they've said, don't underestimate vice president Harris because in his its brain and the way he talks about her, he often insults her intelligence and says he doesn't think she's very competent. He'll contrast, say Hillary Clinton, while he did not like her was a brilliant debater he thought. But his allies have they been watching her Senate hearings? They've watched her past debate performances in the Democratic primaries, and they've warned him that she can be a tough questioner. And so, that is what they're looking for. They're hoping that the two minutes will be like it was for Biden where he often did not use all of the time and kind of trailed off. And as both of you reminded him, often at, he had 30 more seconds or 45 more seconds. That's, of course, something the Harris campaign is acutely aware. CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST, \"THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW\": But, Jake, I would argue that the muted mics really prevent this from being a true debate. In the 2020 debate that I did, obviously, Trump day now admit was kind of out of his mind and interrupted 145 times in 90 minutes? Not that I'm counting. But the fact is, even in that debate, there were some great exchanges wouldn't Trump kept interrupting and Biden's, will you shut up, man? At one point, I said, would you tell your right wing supporters, white supremacist supporters, would you disavowed them? And he said like who? And Biden said like the Proud Boys. And Trump said, Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. The problem now with these muted mics, is it really isn't a debate where those interaction there, almost like simultaneous news conference as you get two minutes to answer, you get two minutes to answer, but you don't get the interaction which has been some of the most memorable moments in the debates since Nixon and Kennedy back in 1960.",

We're counting down to his historic face- off with Vice President Kamala Harris that could potentially tilt the balance of what has been in recent weeks, a razor close presidential race. And you're going to see it all play out live on CNN.Joining us now here in Philadelphia is Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, supporter of President Trump. Senator Rubio, you've been on the debate stage with Donald Trump, you know, firsthand how things can turn personal and nasty. What's your advice to President Trump tonight? Should he stay on policy? Focus on policy or as he says, do it my way on the debate stage? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Well, I think doing it his way, but his way is going to be different in every debate. It depends on the direction that debate goes. You know, he's I think because probably natural to him in instinctive, but also because of years of being on television and being in front of the camera, I think he's got a real good feel for how the audience is viewing an event, how the audience is viewing the presentation. I think that was a big advantage to him in 2016 as well. And so -- that's why I think he should trust that, and obviously they're going to be specific for policy questions and things of that nature. And I know he's put in the time. But, you know, I think one of things that really helps him as he does a lot of interviews. He answers a lot of questions. Kamala Harris doesn't. I don't believe she's had a single solo interview since she became the nominee. And she won't have no cards and she won't have a teleprompter tonight. So I think a lot of people are going to be tuning in to watch that, particularly those of us who have been followers of this process and of her career having served with her in the Senate and having watched her as vice president, is whether she's going to be able to actually speak authentically without the benefit of notes and talking points.",

And he got some blowback from anti-abortion conservatives.What do you think he should be doing when it comes to the issue of abortion?

He wants it to be decided at the state level through elected legislators. Voters get to decide it through them. The ones that want to federalize abortion practices in this country is Kamala Harris, who basically wants to pass a federal bill that in essence, though they'll never admit this, will allow abortion almost for any reason at any the time paid for by taxpayers. So I do think there's a point of contrast there. He wants to leave it to voters at the states through their legislators to decide what the law should be in their state. And she wants to federalize it. But I think on his views and so forth, I don't think it's about moderating. I think he's describing an aspect of what federal governments role should and should not be on an issue like this.

And we know this after the fact in states like Wisconsin and others.Now some states ran great -- look, I'm very proud of the way Florida runs elections. We haven't always had great elections in Florida, but in recent years, you've seen how the reforms we've made and how applying our laws have led to that. About half of what's most important about these elections, obviously, the vote count is important that it be accurate, but also public confidence. And when people are citing instances of where laws are not being followed are certain things are being allowed that maybe should not have allowed because it violates your own laws. Or you have state entering into consent decrees to ignore their own laws without legislative input, it's going to create all kinds of questions. And I think in a number of states, this happened. It happened in this date. It happened in Wisconsin. It happened in Arizona and even somewhat in Georgia. So I think he should be pretty clear, but when he talks about the interference in -- I think one the main points that he points to about 2020 is very damaging information about Joe Biden and his son was censured from -- kept from the American public for something that we know to be true, people flat-out would not cover or misrepresented what the laptop meant. That was information Americans should have asked us to before voting, and they didn't and he views that as clear interference by a handful of people, including 50 something former intelligence officers or officials who signed the letter, saying something that turned out not to be true but somehow that that laptop was fake and it was actually a product of Russian disinformation. So I think he should point to those things. Those are valid things to talk about that happened in 2020 some of those things under the cover, an excuse of COVID, using COVID as an excuse to allow anyone to vote anyway, they wanted. TAPPER: Well, obviously, for the record I mean, it wasn't the case that anyone who wanted to vote could vote anywhere in the attorney general, Bill Barr said that there wasn't enough widespread fraud to have changed the course of the election.
