(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORREPSONDENT (voice-over): Through the breach, we enter northern Gaza at the Erez border crossing. The land here, once fertile farmland, is barren, and the trees that might have provided enemy cover destroyed. In the distance, smoke from an Israeli airstrike is a stark reminder that this is day 34 of a war that may stretch much longer. On Thursday, the IDF Chief of Staff and the head of the country's internal security service entered Gaza and promised strength through cooperation. Everyone is doing everything, said General Hertzy Alevi, just so you can be as strong as possible. Along our path in northern Gaza, the signs of civilian life have given way to the constant hum of drones and the distant echoes of artillery. Our time with the IDF began at the coordination base for the border crossing, the first international media to visit the site. The terror attack on October 7th hit hard here, the scars of machine gun fire and RPGs still visible. The base was mostly empty on the holiday, but not entirely. The IDF says nine soldiers were killed here and three kidnapped. It took 12 hours for Israel to regain control of the base. Now it's one of the main gates to Gaza. A month into the war, more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry there. The IDF says 35 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the strip since the start of the incursion. The October 7th attack by Hamas in Israel killed more than 1400 people, mostly civilians.

There were many trenches. There were a lot of weapons and ammunition. We found here a storage site with many explosives. against tanks, RPGs. Even from a distance, the scale of the destruction is stunning. Apartment buildings, homes, neighborhoods, decimate. Colonel Tal says the area is almost completely evacuated. We don't see civilians in our eyes. We see sometimes terrorists, but the majority of civilians haven't been here in a while. They've all gone south in the direction of the heart of the strip. As we talk, we hear rocket fire and see the trails of the launches triggering red alerts in Ashdod. After about 90 minutes inside northern Gaza, we make our way out, hugging the border wall for safety.

A spokesman for the Arab League saying that the Arab League demands an immediate ceasefire. He stressed that they're not interested in these humanitarian pauses, which many in the Arab world have likened to just giving food to somebody while they're being beaten to death. So, it's difficult to say what these Arab leaders will be able to do, given that they haven't used any sort of the non-military weapons at their disposal, for instance, an Arab oil embargo, like happened back in 1973 under the leadership of then-Saudi King Faisal. Now, also, happening tomorrow in Riyadh is going to be a summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, another one of these Middle Eastern talking shops that don't really achieve much. What's interesting is that Ebrahim Raisi, the President of Iran, is going to be there. That's the first time an Iranian President has been to Saudi Arabia in a very long time. And according to a spokesman for Raisi, if the organization of Islamic conference summit does not result in any lessening of the violence in Gaza, he says, perhaps the conflict will broaden. Now, you mentioned earlier the visit of the Qatari Amir to Cairo today. Also yesterday, the head of the Politburo of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, and the head of Islamic Jihad, met with Abbas Kamel, the head of Egyptian intelligence. That certainly indicates the Egyptians are trying to move the situation forward, perhaps trying to convince Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which also does hold some of these captives in Gaza, to somehow start releasing some of them, perhaps to allow for, if not a permanent ceasefire, at least a temporary one.

Why do we do that? Why do we do that? And how does that change, Edward? EDWARD AHMED MITCHELL, NATIONAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR, COUNCIL ON AMERICAN- ISLAMIC RELATIONS: Well, first, let me note that it appears to us that Islamophobia is absolutely out of control in the United States. As you noted, our new numbers show that we received 1283 complaints over just the past month. That's a 216 percent increase compared to last year. That includes hate crimes, hate speech, free speech violations, employment discrimination, attacks on protesters and also employment, and school bullying. So, it's a wide variety of problems that are plaguing the American Muslim community. And yes, I think you're right, that there's a common habit of blaming people of color for things they had nothing to do with, simply because someone who looks like them or shares their beliefs did something wrong. But also, mind that there are people who are very deliberately using dehumanizing anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian language to not only justify the killing of Palestinians in Gaza, but also to silent supporters of Palestinian human rights here in America.

We've seenschools that issued very biased, one-sided statements that acknowledge the horrific killing of Israeli civilians, but completely ignore the horrific killing of Palestinian civilians. That created a really bad environment for Muslim Palestinian and other students. And then you had incidents in which teachers themselves are delivering lesson plans that are not only biased but inappropriate, Islamophobic, racist in nature, and then of course bullying. Kids bullying other kids because they're visibly Muslim, because they support Palestine. All that is unacceptable. And the way we can stop that is for schools to, number one, either just stay out of discussing foreign affairs like this or if they're going to do it, discuss in a fair, neutral way and make sure that they treat anti- Semitic incidents with the same level of seriousness as anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian. You can't tolerate bigotry against one group of people and then oppose it against another group of people.",

I'm hearing intense anger from the Muslim community about what they're seeing out of Gaza and about President Biden's, not only his support for it, but the dehumanizing language, questioning the Palestinian death toll, saying that innocent Palestinians dying is the price of waging war. That has really caused incredible anger in the Muslim community, and I think among other Americans. And so, the more we see images of kids being pulled out of the rubble, hospitals and ambulances being bombed, refugee camps being blown up, that anger is only going to increase, and I think all bets are off in 2024. We plan to encourage people to vote no matter who they're voting for. But I think we're going to be in for a surprise with what happens next year.",

What we don't need is ethnic cleansing in Northern Gaza. We need to ceasefire across all of Gaza, the release of everyone wrongly held in Gaza and in Israel, and then for the Biden administration to pursue negotiations to secure a just and lasting peace. So, this does not happen over and over again. The Israeli government has made it very clear. They've said there are no innocent civilians in Gaza. That's what Israeli President Herzog said. The defense minister said that they are going to be treating everyone like human animals, and that's why they're shutting down fuel and water and other aid into Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu made a reference to a biblical story about wiping out, committing genocide against people. So, the Israeli government has made it clear they are committing war crimes and our government must stop ignoring that and stop enabling it before more innocent people die.",

They say their troops are now well inside Gaza City, where they found Hamas command and control as well as weapons-making facilities. We are now fighting a ground offensive that will only deepen, the IDF spokesperson says. In the heart of Gaza City, we will reach more and more Hamas strongholds. Gaza's civilians continue to suffer as Israel presses on with its offensive. Tens of thousands fleeing the northern part of the Strip in recent days, according to the U.N., while the Palestinian Ministry of Health says thousands have been killed or wounded in Hamas-controlled Gaza. Still, tough talk coming from Hamas' leader, Ismail Haniyeh, threatening the Israeli army. They are drowning in the sands of Gaza, he says. This will cost them a lot on all fronts, including the life of their hostages. But Ismail Haniyeh himself isn't even inside Gaza. Like much of Hamas' political leadership, he's in the safety and the comfort of Qatar.
