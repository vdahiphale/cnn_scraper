There are extremely troubling developments, happening in Russia, which have been playing out, and seemingly escalating, throughout the day, today. Tonight, as you can see, there are armored vehicles, on the streets of Moscow. Security has been tightened. And the White House, we are told, is monitoring these developments closely. All of this is happening, after Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was the leader, of the mercenary group, known as the Wagner Group, accused Russia's Military, of their generals, of attacking his forces, earlier. Now, Russia's Internal Security Agency has launched a criminal investigation, of Prigozhin. And Russian generals are accusing him of trying to start a coup. As you might imagine, given that this is Russia, we're talking about, there are still a lot that we don't know a lot that is not confirmed, because these are not trustworthy sources that this is coming from, whether it is the Wagner Group, or the Kremlin itself. For more on what we do know, tonight, let's go first to CNN's Matthew Chance, who is live for us, in Kyiv. Matthew, obviously, I mean, this is a remarkable scene that's playing out, what we're seeing, on the streets of Russia. And I know officials there, in Ukraine, are watching this closely. What is the sense of what started this? Because Yevgeny Prigozhin is someone, who is a very close, Putin ally.",

That feels very real. But you're right. I mean, there is an element of what's happening, inside Russia, at the moment that we don't know, whether it's orchestrated, whether Prigozhin has the green light, to do the things that he's done, from the Kremlin. In fact, there's been a big kind of debate, in Russia, when I was last there, just a week or so ago. A lot of people questioning which side, Vladimir Putin would come down on. Would he come down in support of the Defense Ministry, and his Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, or would he come down on the side of Yevgeny Prigozhin. At the moment, it looks like he's coming down on the side of his own Defense Ministry. But, I mean, you're absolutely right. That could be, as the Russians say, maskirovka. It could be just a ruse, to divert attention, from some other plan. Look, I mean, certainly, the Ukrainians, from the people I've spoken to here, say that they're watching this situation closely. You get the impression they're watching it with relish as well, in the hope that this is Russia, sort of imploding on itself. But of course, it may be something quite different to that.",

When you've got somebody, like Prigozhin, saying, first of all, everything that Putin said it, with regard to the reasons as to why they invaded Ukraine are not the case, then he's claiming that the Russian Ministry of Defense is actually bombing and killing his own people. And of course, last, and I think most significantly, and probably most worrisome, for the Kremlin, is this promise of \"OK, we're all going to march, there's 25,000 armed guys, and we're going to march, to Moscow.\" That sounds very much like a push, like a coup. And I think that's what you've got -- what you see going on the streets of Moscow, right now. It's certainly why the FSB is involved, one of the most capable internal security services. And also, I would add, probably a direct link to Putin, there. He would have been the one who said, \"OK, FSB, you got to go and do something.\" So, this is, really, I think, in a different league than some of the stuff that we've seen from Prigozhin, previously.",

But I think he felt that he was not respected by the Military, that, his men were used, essentially as cannon fodder, which they were, and a lot of them were taken out of prison, to fight, as we've been reporting, for a long time. So, I think, for the actual men, who are fighting, the question will be, for Prigozhin's people, will they support him? If he is actually serious about marching, either to Rostov or to Moscow, will they support him? Because, right now, another extraordinary thing is that you have the Russian Military, the General, Surovikin, who's in charge of the Military, in Ukraine, saying, \"Hey, guys don't support Prigozhin. We're on the same side. This is only helping the Ukrainians. They're taking advantage of this.\" This is another really, really important moment, to be watching.",

ADAM KINZINGER, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE -- ILLINOIS, AIR NATIONAL GUARD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think you have to start thinking through every worst-case scenario. So obviously, Putin, out of the picture, I think, generally would be great for the world. But you think about the instability, in Russia that will inevitably come from that. Even if he's -- even if this whole supposed coup fails, there will be some instability in Russia, which has nuclear weapons. There's concern about proliferation, if the Russian Republic falls apart, in the even more pieces. I think, on the other hand, too, this is extremely good, for the war, in Ukraine, because even if as Prigozhin is marching on Moscow, even if that fails, Wagner is out of the fight. And they were a significant part of this effort against Ukraine. Not to mention that all around the world, Wagner protects Russian interests, whether it's in Africa, Libya and other places. This is a massive blow to the Russian Republic, a massive blow, to their Military effort. And I'll also say, it's a massive blow to the people, here, in the United States, like, say, Tucker Carlson, who have been parroting Putin talking points, to have Prigozhin, the head of Wagner himself, say, \"Those have been lies.\" There have been a lot of people parroting those Putin lies, and the head of Wagner even just said, those are lies.",

The Russian people say, \"OK, we will surrender many of our basic rights,\" or at least what we consider here in the United States to be, our basic rights, \"in order for you guys to provide us with stability.\" In other words, in order to make sure that the things that are being rumored to happen, right now, don't happen. And so, the breaking of that social contract is extremely problematic, for the Kremlin, and for Putin, specifically, because he's the guarantor of the one, you know, he's the one, who makes sure that that happens.

But General Marks, what Congressman Kinzinger was just saying there, from a Military perspective, what's the impact this could have, on Russia's war, in Ukraine, as this counter-offensive that Ukraine is conducting, is happening, right now? MAJOR. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), U.S. ARMY, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think what I've heard from all the contributors is absolutely spot-on. Look, this is the struggle between two titan egos. And let's be frank, most leadership, in Russia, is a body of egos. I think from the soldier perspective, in Ukraine, this doesn't matter. It's incredibly important. It's strategically significant. But as a soldier, on the ground, I'm concerned about what's in front of me, and am I prepared, to execute my missions? Am I conducting intelligence? Do I have my fires prepared? Can I conduct maneuver? So, a lot of this really won't impact the soldiers on the ground. But as indicated, the Wagner Group apparently now is out of the fight. And if I was part of the Wagner Group, here to say this a tad flippantly, I wouldn't worry about the Russian Military trying to attack me, if I'm en route Moscow, right? They haven't, the Russian Military, haven't been able to hit much of anything, if it's a mobile target. So, if I'm in the Wagner Group, I think the safest place for me to be is on the road, en route Moscow. I don't know exactly how this is going to play out. But, on the ground, this is a great opportunity, for the Ukrainian soldiers, to continue to do what they are doing, which is being very cautious, very aggressive, find out where the Russians are incredibly weak, and then exploit that because the Russian Military, right now, is distracted.",

As you pointed out, in your conversation, with Matthew Chance, and you just touched on it, a second ago, it's very difficult to know for sure what's really happening.You have essentially three bodies here, right? You have Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner. You have the Russian Ministry of Defense. And then, you have the Kremlin, whose arm, at least for information, is Russian state media. And all of those are notoriously unreliable sources of information. Prigozhin himself will either lie or exaggerate. Russian state media, as we've seen multiple times, over the past, is not to be trusted. And the Ministry of Defense is not reliable at all, in terms of information, it's putting out, whether it's on the war, in Ukraine, or otherwise. But, of course, the U.S. has tracked carefully and closely this power struggle that we're watching, perhaps play out in real-time, right now, between Prigozhin, and the Ministry of Defense, a power struggle about who has more influence with Putin, who can get resources, for the war, in Ukraine, and in the end, of course, who comes out on top. Ever since this emerged, as a more clear conflict, earlier this year, the U.S., according to officials, has been trying to gather Intelligence on it, and collect as much as possible, to try to find out where this is going. But in terms of what's happening, right now, and where this leads, that's something the U.S. is watching very closely. There was a sense, and there has been a sense, I should say, over the course of the past couple of hours that this is something different than what we've seen before. Prigozhin has complained repeatedly about the ineptitude of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Normally, that has followed some sort of Ukrainian breakthrough, or tactical success, on the battlefield. Not anymore. There wasn't any apparent Ukrainian success that would lead to this. This is Prigozhin openly complaining, and perhaps acting. And that's why the U.S. is watching how this plays out, so closely, Kaitlan. The question, of course, where does this go from here, as we watch these videos from the Kremlin of it being cordoned off?

If you recall, a few weeks ago, after the siege of Bakhmut, if you will, ended, there was a confrontation, between Wagner, and regular Russian troops, on the ground, in that area.

And Putin has tolerated Prigozhin's outspokenness, now, for nearly a year. So, there's that in play. This is fairly between him and Defense Ministry.But I think the tricky thing here that we all need to keep in mind is this is more than just a drama, between Shoigu, and Prigozhin, or between Wagner and the Russian Military. There are other players here that are affected, and may be looking for opportunities. You have within Russia, pro-Ukrainian elements, you have anti-Putin elements, you have the far-right, who believes in many things, that Prigozhin is saying, about the ineptitude, of the Russian army, and how weak it's performed, on the battlefield. So, you have any number of players out there, who are looking for an opportunity, here, or trying to assess what may happen next. And then, you have the Russian soldiers, who are on the frontlines, right now, in Ukraine, and asking, they got to be wondering \"What is going on with my leadership.\" And when you're dealing with a force that is, a fair number of conscripts, who don't want to be there, in the first place, you really got to ask yourself, what does this do to their morale? Particularly, since what I think has been the most -- could be the most damaging part of this, right now, is the fact that Prigozhin has belied the claim, by Putin, early in the war, beginning of the war that this is all about threats, from Ukraine, that this was denazification, et cetera, et cetera. Prigozhin has undermined all that by saying \"It's not real. Putin was lied to by his generals. This is about senior officials, and oligarchs, wanting to plunder the rest of Ukraine.\" I think that does incredible damage well beyond what happens in the next 24 hours, 48 hours, when it comes to the war effort, and Putin's credibility.",

Two men, who were fake electors in Nevada, in 2020, for Donald Trump, previously, they had declined to answer questions, in the House investigation, saying that they wanted to maintain their Fifth Amendment rights. And then, when they showed up to the grand jury, the Special Counsel's Office said \"No, you actually need to tell us what you know. We're going to take your testimony. Here's some immunity,\" with a letter that they had provided from the court. And so, that gets those witnesses in.

Everyone wants to see women supported, who are facing a difficult position, or difficult decision. The second thing, whether you're Republican, Democrat or Independent, is that all of us don't want to see the number of abortions increase. Everybody, I think, can agree the humane thing is to see how do we reduce the number of abortions, in this country, one way or another? You can do that by providing greater access to birth control, particularly to women, who are in rural areas, or poorer areas. You can support women, who have been raped, by ensuring that their rape kits are processed, in a timely manner, and put into a database, where their rapists can be found, prosecuted, charged and prosecuted with a crime.

And we need to show women that we care. And I've got a number of bills addressing this. I've got a rape kit bill that I will be dropping, this summer.
