But now, his lawyers are insisting the entire case should be thrown out, arguing that he was, quote, only trying to ensure election integrity.And in their filing today, they dismissed the allegations from prosecutors that Trump, quote, knew that widespread reports of fraud and election irregularities were untrue. They're also arguing that the then-president's actions were within the ambit of his office, so he's absolutely immune from prosecution. Now, they have made similar arguments in civil suits, because the Supreme Court has held that presidents are immune from being sued for civil damages or anything related to their official duties in office. But what exactly constitutes an official duty? Well, that's still a little murky, and this is, of course, the special counsel's investigation. This is a criminal context, and as we are so often, with former President Trump, we're really in uncharted waters here, because no current or former president has ever faced criminal charges. So, this is likely something, a question that could make its way all the way to the Supreme Court.",

Don't go too far away.Right now, I want to get to some breaking news, a stunning new report from ABC News raising very serious concerns about Donald Trump's handling of highly sensitive U.S. national security information. According to ABC, the former president allegedly shared data about the nation's nuclear submarine fleet with a foreign member of his Mar-a- Lago club back in April of 2021. That member, an Australian billionaire, then allegedly discussed the information, very classified information, with more than a dozen other people, including foreign officials and journalists. Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigators were reportedly made aware of the alleged conversation, but as of now, it has not been included in the indictment against Trump. We are not aware of any response from Trump or the Mar-a-Lago club member to ABC News. Let's bring in our legal and national security analysts for analysis. Shawn Turner, let me start with you.

But the reason we have these rules is precisely because of the risk that it will get into the wrong hands.It also sheds light on his intent. In any criminal case, you have to prove state of mind. And so it's relevant on that ground. But we do have to caution, of course, it's a media report now. It does not appear to be in the case, certainly is not in the existing charges.

They also charged another incident where he talked to someone in his inner circle allegedly about classified information.So, for some reason, the special counsel decided that this is an anecdote that they may not be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. So, while this story is certainly concerning, the special counsel did not think that it warranted being included in the indictment, and I think I would be surprised if they were to issue a superseding indictment as that could alter the timeline of their case and push it back even further, something that they have been fighting not to have happen.",

In fact, I'm going to get out of your way and you can see just what this missile, which the Ukrainians say, struck this place earlier today, what it did to this house. You can see that the building has completely been annihilated. This is the kind of rubble that you would probably normally only see if there was a substantial earthquake.If you look over here, you can see that it really knocked over entire parts of this building, just a complete, substantial, large, thick, very heavy wall just falling over, and that's certainly something that you can see throughout the debris of what is left of this building. Now, what we have to keep in mind, Wolf, is that the Ukrainians say what was inside this building was both a shopping mall, a shopping center, probably more like a little store, but then also a cafe or sort of event center, really. And they say at the time that the strike took place, that there was a funeral wake going on for a Ukrainian soldier who died a year ago but who had been buried somewhere else, because this place was under Russian occupation and was supposed to get repatriated to here. The Ukrainians say that by and large, the people who were at this funeral wake were civilians. Most of them coming here from this area and many of them, of course, killed on the spot. Now, the reason why this building looks the way it does and certainly the surrounding area does as well is the Ukrainians say that it was struck by an Iskander missile, Wolf. That's a medium-range missile that the Russians have, and it has a very heavy warhead of about a thousand pounds. It's usually made to destroy infantry. It's made for the battlefield, to destroy armored vehicles there. And, obviously, if it hits a house like this, the aftermath that you see here is certainly something that is extremely devastating. We came here as the search and rescue operation was still going on, and there was certainly a lot of bodies that were being pulled here from this building. Those operations have now ceased because the folks here say that it's absolutely impossible to find any sort of survivor, certainly, in here, but in any case, they don't believe that anybody could have survived what happened here. More than 50 people were killed.
