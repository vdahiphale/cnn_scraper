Here is some of what it looked and sounded like from Sderot, just across the border from Gaza border in southern Israel.With flares overhead for much of the time, Israeli warplanes launched wave after wave of air-to-ground guided munitions at targets in Gaza. One ripple of tightly grouped ordnance after another could be seen streaking downward, while in the background, the sound of outgoing artillery followed by thumps of the shells and warheads landing.   Shortly before this latest wave of strikes began, Secretary of State Antony Blinken left on a swing, including stops in Israel and Jordan. His message to Israel was twofold. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Nic Robertson, appreciate it from Sderot.New video on what Israeli troops are seeing and what they -- what more they could be facing on the streets of Gaza and beneath them. CNN's Ed Lavandera has that.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The Hamas propaganda video shows its fighters emerge from underground tunnels in what appears to be the northern outskirts of the most populated areas of Gaza. Hiding in the terrain, the Hamas soldiers fire away at Israeli units advancing into Gaza. One video shows a Hamas soldier stalking an Israeli tank running up next to it and placing an explosive device on the machinery, then running away. Seconds later, the device detonates. The Hamas fighter then disappears into the ground through a trap door. A political leader of Hamas spoke this week about the tunnel's vital role in the Hamas military strategy. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) LAVANDERA (voice over):  \"We have built the tunnels,\" he says, \"because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels,\" he says, \"are meant to protect us from the airplanes. We are fighting from inside the tunnels.\" While Israel has unleashed thousands of air strikes across Gaza since October 7th, Hamas is also trying to show off its airstrike capabilities. It released this video of a munition strike dropped from a drone over Israeli soldiers. It's not clear how many casualties it inflicted on the Israel Defense Force. Several soldiers can be seen running away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces released this Hamas propaganda video, which captures the elaborate maze of tunnels, which stretch for dozens of miles underneath Gaza. The militant organization uses the tunnels to store weapons and to launch airstrikes towards Israel. Veteran Israeli journalist, Shlomi Eldar, has reported on Hamas for decades. He says the underground tunnels are known as the \"Gaza Metro.\"",

      "sentences": "Anderson, if I can address what we've both been seeing from a soldier's perspective first, Nic Robertson has been showing some great films. Ed just showed that film of the underground tunnels.The combat environment inside of Gaza -- Gaza City is just something that will help the senses. We can look from a faraway distance, as Nic is doing, and just see smoke, and lightning, and bombs blowing up, and artillery rounds landing. If you're inside that area, and I believe that Israel has encircled all of Gaza City because, in urban combat, you want to control ingress and egress of your enemy into what their defensive positions are. So now they're trying to confuse Hamas soldiers in terms of where those tunnel entrances are. They're trying seek out the locations. They're trying to cause just confusion by those soldiers. But in past wars, in 2021 and 2014, Israel was very effective in finding where those tunnels were when they were first built. They would drop smoke inside of tunnels and see where the smoke -- green smoke or purple smoke and see where the smoke came out in other buildings. So then they could get a determination of where the tunnels went, where the routes were going in and out.   I don't think you're going to see a whole lot of the Israeli soldiers going inside the tunnel, but they are going to continue to bombard those with the kinds of explosive devices that we've seen over the last couple of days to cause those tunnels to cave in and trap those that are inside. Now as part of that, they're unfortunately going to be hitting cities where there are still civilians interspersed with Hamas fighters. That's why there's so much confusing in this area. I was just looking at the film that Nic was showing, and I got to tell you, I wouldn't want to be in that city fighting if I were a Hamas soldier right now, because it's just utter confusion and assault on all of the senses. You don't know where you are. You don't know where the enemy is. And even though the Israeli forces are going in with Merkava tanks, a little tip on that, those tanks have vision blocks in the driver's seat that are about this big. So they're trying to figure out as the turret moves back and forth what they can see. They have thermal sights inside, but sometimes you just can't see through some of the smoke and rubble. This is a horrendous fighting inside of a city. That's why soldiers don't like to fight in urban environments.",

So you also have to try and hold those locations and ensure the Hamas terrorists who are moving around in the tunnel, perhaps even with some of the hostages, are controlled in that area.That's why the exits of those tunnels around the cities have to be destroyed. And that's why the Israeli Air Force is hitting some of these cities with these large super penetrating bombs that go 100 feet down before they explode. That's why you see the large craters that you're seeing now in the Jabalya area yesterday. It's not because it's blowing up a lot of things, but it's penetrating the dirt up to 100 feet and then blowing up, which will collapse the tunnel.

That's not going to happen. And the question is, when you talk about humanitarian pause, for how long? Is it a six-hour pause just to get a truck from one place to the other? Is it 24-hour, a 48-hour pause to get hostages out? It's not very clear. And I think that it's definitely an issue that Secretary Blinken is going to raise in his meetings.

One of the reasons he is coming to the region is to have this conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, look him in the eye, and say, \"Bibi, what's the plan for the day after?\" And even though we are still in the very early stages, it's a conversation that the administration wants to have with Netanyahu.",
