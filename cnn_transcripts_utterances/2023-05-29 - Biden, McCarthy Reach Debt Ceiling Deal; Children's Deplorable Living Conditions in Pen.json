Basically, let me back up and tell you how police came to this house.It's in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. And essentially, what we've learned is that police arrived to a call, basically there were teenagers rummaging through a mobile home in the area, they determined that these teenagers actually lived next door at a different mobile home. They didn't sound right, they didn't look right, they had ill- fitting clothes. They connected with the parents, that's when they went inside their home, found that refrigerator with a padlock on it. Found there was barely food inside. There was feces on the ground. It was just a pretty disgusting scene for these police. They actually left that scene, you know, connecting these teenagers with their parents, then returned back with the state children services and uncovered four kid four more kids inside the home hidden in the back -- bedroom. Seven kids in all, ages four through 16. And basically, they said they were malnourished, they didn't have any education, didn't even know their own birthdays. They were all taken into the state custody. These parents whose names are Shane William Robertson and Crystal Robertson charged with endangering the welfare of all seven of these kids actually posted bond (ph). But the goodness here is the kids are now in the care of the state and are getting actually the nutrition that they need. Some of them have actually gained some had weight. But just a horrific scene that they uncovered here in Bucks County.",

And now, by law, he's suspended from his job until the Senate trial. Just minutes after the vote, the attorney general, Ken Paxton, called the impeachment a political motivated sham. But remember, this was a Republican-led effort. Ken Paxton, a third term Republican, has been accused of a years' long pattern of corruption.CNN's Ed Lavandera is joins us. Ed, this is like upheaval in Texas. Where does it go now?",

      "sentences": "Well, the politics of this, extremely rich, John. But that vote was decisive on Saturday afternoon. 121 house representatives to 23 voted to impeach the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton. And now, this case moves to the State Senate side where the math becomes a little more difficult. There are 31 state senators in Texas, 12 of them are Democrats. One of them is the wife of Ken Paxton.And so, they would need nine Republicans to vote with those Democrats, assuming that all the Democrats vote to convict Ken Paxton for him to be removed from office. But Ken Paxton is facing 20 articles of impeachment, which include a long litany of abuse of power, bribery, among other charges that House representatives are filing against the attorney general. But what is interesting is that Ken Paxton, even though he is one of the most controversial politicians here in the state, he does have the support of extreme right-wing Republicans here in the state and especially, he has the support of Former President Donald Trump who tweeted support for him over the weekend before the vote was cast. And even Trump is going after the Republican governor here in Texas, Greg Abbott, saying missing in action. Where is the governor of Texas on all of this? Of course, really, right now, there is not much for Abbott to do other than possibly appointing someone to temporarily fill Ken Paxton's seat as attorney general. But right now, John, we're waiting on when the timing of this trial in the State Senate will be. We have not heard from the lieutenant governor who presides over the State Senate and would have to set the timing for all of that. And in other news, today is the last day of the legislative session. So, this is something that's going to happen here presumably at some point this summer or later this summer. John.",

This is something we do in Congress every single year. The discretionary portion of the budget expires on October 1st. That's the fiscal year. So, roughly between April and October, we're negotiating over that.And in this case, you've got Republicans controlling the House, Democrats controlling the White House, and as always, I like to say, nobody controlling the Senate. Well, with the 60-vote requirement there. So, it's a tough negotiation. What Republicans did this time is they took the debt ceiling hostage, which is an unbelievably irresponsible thing to do. There are plenty of incentives for the budget deal. If we get to October 1st, as we've seen in the past, we have government shutdowns, we have continuing resolutions, we negotiate and haggle over how to get that resolved. The Republicans took debt ceiling hostage. And the president was absolutely right, that shouldn't happen. But he was also absolutely right that they did it. So, he had to deal with it. And he dealt with it, I think, in the most responsible way possible to cut what was basically a deal that we would have cut sometime between now and October 1st anyway given the Republican control of the House and how we had to negotiate. So, like I said, I think that the president did the best he could in tough circumstances.",

Of course, its relations with the U.S. government are of importance to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.And in the past, we have seen tensions between the two nations, the two allies. We've seen the U.S. government taking issue, for example, with Turkey's decision to purchase Russian-made air defense systems and in turn, Turkey has, of course, had tensions with Kurdish fighting groups allied to the U.S. that Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations. So, there are certainly challenges to overcome there if those relations are set to be reset between Turkey and the Biden administration. We've heard from Biden, as you mentioned, congratulating President Erdogan yesterday. He took to Twitter to say that he looks forward to continuing to work together as NATO allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges. And of course, Turkey has, over the last year or so, become a key player, a key negotiator in the war in Ukraine. We heard from President Erdogan actually speaking to CNN exclusively talking about his relationship with President Putin, he described this as a special relationship, often of course at odds with the views of Turkey's own NATO allies. But we have seen Turkey positioning itself as a sort of mediator, again, in the past when it came to potential peace negotiations, as we saw with the grain deal secured by Turkey and the United Nations.
