Now, those are the markets and these are the main events. The UN Security Council is meeting now hours after Israel says it killed top Hezbollah operatives in an airstrike on Beirut. Nike shares rise more than six percent. The new CEO faces an uphill battle. And is showtime the greatest of all time. Japan's Shohei Ohtani makes baseball history, and then some. Live from New York, it is Friday, September 20th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. We do begin right now in Lebanon where Israel says it has killed the leader of an elite Hezbollah unit and 10 other commanders in an airstrike on Southern Beirut. Now, the strike hit a crowded neighborhood and destroyed a residential building. Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least 14 people have died and many more now injured. It follows a week of deadly chaos in Lebanon in which dozens of people have been killed and thousands more injured by small explosions from pagers and walkie-talkies. Lebanon's prime minister is blaming Israel and accusing it of carrying out acts \"akin to genocide.\" Israel, meantime, is hailing it as a new era of war. The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting on the situation in Lebanon this hour high. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk just called for an investigation into the circumstances of these attacks. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Hellyer, who is a Middle East studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and he does join us now from Cairo. If we take Israel at its word, they say they've entered this new phase of war. How does this latest airstrike fit in the assassinations themselves? H. A. HELLYER, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES SCHOLAR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: First, thank you for having me on your program. I think your correspondent is entirely correct. This represents the beginning of a major escalation. I think, Israel frankly is playing chicken to see how far it can go in Lebanon without Hezbollah raising the ante, and upping the ante much more than it has already. Remember, Hezbollah is in possession of quite a huge arsenal of rockets and missiles that hitherto has not used against civilian targets by and large in Israel. And I think that we have to be very cautious about how things move forward from here. As Ben pointed out, that hasn't been that much in terms of a warning from Washington, DC even though Washington DC made it very clear that it did not want to see this escalation, that did not want to see Israel taking the region into a much wider regional conflict. But it is another red line that Washington has placed in front of the Israelis over the past almost 12 months that Israel has walked over without accountability, without consequences, so naturally, they feel empowered to be able to proceed as they see fit and I think this brinkmanship is very risky and runs the risk unfortunately, of plunging the region into a quite severe regional conflict.",

Iran, its main sponsor is also not willing to go into a regional conflict, past this war of attrition, and the war of attrition that is currently underway is something that suits, frankly, the Iranians quite well, going much further beyond would lead to a much wider war across the border and I don't think that works to Hezbollah's interest or to Iran's interest. But having he said that, the Israelis have really crossed so many different lines in this latest escalation. Hezbollah will feel obliged to respond in some sort of fashion in order to ensure that it maintains its own reputation in the country and it will try to re-establish some kind deterrence. Again, I am not sure that that's entirely possible without taking the region into a much more devastatingly difficult position. So, it is in everybody's interest for the Israelis to pull back.
