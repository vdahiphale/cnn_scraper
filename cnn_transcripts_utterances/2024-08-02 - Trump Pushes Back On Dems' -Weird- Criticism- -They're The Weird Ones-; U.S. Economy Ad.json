And the report underscoring concerns that the economy has slowed down too quickly and could lead to a recession. We're going to talk about all of that now with Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su.

And I continue to travel the country and meet with workers who are unionizing for the first time, have reached a union contract that is providing double digit wage increases. We want to make sure that workers get a fair share of the economy that they're helping to make possible and we see that happening and that's one of the measures that we use to -- to indicate that the economy is doing well.

I want to get your take on a specific aspect of it because the chief economist at ZipRecruiter told CNN recently that a lot of the growth has come from just a few industries, healthcare, government, leisure hospitality.So, in short overall aggregate numbers look good but everyone might not be feeling that goodness equally.

It's all the industries you mentioned, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's multiple industries, it's primarily private sector but also some in government we're seeing it across the board. And this is important because that also has a sign of economic strength. And we're seeing growth in, you know, construction for example is up 200,000 over the year. These are, you know, manufacturing has continued a steady growth under President Biden's leadership.These are all, you know, things that don't happen by accident that are happening because the investments that we are making are helping to grow certain industries and are leading to private investments in those same sectors. So, we are fixing things, we're making things in America again, there's work that we still need to do.

That was a major attack with dozens of ballistic missiles and drones that the U.S. largely was able to counter to intercept along with a coalition of allies who essentially came together to protect Israel and of course the U.S. forces and other allies' forces that are in the region. Well now they are saying that this could be even bigger than that. It could be coordinated with Hezbollah, which of course is a very powerful paramilitary force in southern Lebanon. It could also be coordinated with the mini proxy militias that Iran has in the Middle East that have been launching attacks against U.S. Forces over the last several months. And so, what the U.S. is weighing now is just how they're going to be shifting these resources that they already have in the Middle East, including, you know, amphibious assault ships that are currently in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as a carrier strike group that the U.S. has in the Gulf of Oman, which could be moved closer to Lebanon, closer to a possible point of conflict if something were to break out. But of course, there's also the consideration of what happens if a major conflict erupts. And the U.S. has to get its citizens out of the region. So, another thing they're considering is a possible noncombatant evacuation operation if it comes to that. But again, everything is kind of in the planning stage at this point remains unclear whether any of it is actually going to be necessary. But they're preparing for the worst essentially, Kate.",
