I asked former State Department official Josh Paul why he resigned over this war. Then, an Israeli and a Palestinian peacemaker looked beyond this war to a final peace. Plus, why are so many people dying in Puerto Rico? \"Washington Post\" reporter Arelis Hernandez tells Hari Sreenivasan. And finally, \"All the Light We Cannot See.\" I speak with newcomer Aria Mia Loberti about taking Netflix by storm. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel is expanding its ground operation to all over Gaza, warning civilians to move and evacuate yet again. After three days of intense fighting and airstrikes, the U.S. is stepping up its public warnings, as the death toll has risen to over 15,000, according to the Hamas authorities in Gaza. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stressed Israel's \"moral responsibility\" to protect civilians. He also said it can affect the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Our first guest tonight, Josh Paul, resigned from the State Department soon after October 7th in protest of what he said were unscrutinized U.S. arms transfers to Israel. In his resignation letter, he said the Israeli response and American support \"will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and Palestinian people and is not in the long-term American interest.\" And Josh Paul is joining me now.

Do we have concerns about some of the units that these arms might be going to and their track records? What was different here was that there was no discussion. There was no space for that discussion. There was simply an approach of essentially the barn doors are open and that remains the case. You know, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported just in the last couple of days that America has transferred over 4,000 dumb bombs to Israel, several thousand guidance kits, and 45,000 artillery shells.

And a charity called Defensive Children International Palestine drew our attention at the State Department to the sexual assault, actually the rape of a 13-year-old boy that occurred in an Israeli prison in Moskobiya (ph) in Jerusalem. We examined these allegations. We believe they were credible. We put them through Israel to the government of Israel. And you know what happened the next day? The IDF went into the DCIP offices and removed all their computers and declared them a terrorist entity. I think it is vital that atrocities not happen to anyone, not sexual atrocities, not sexual violations, not any kind of gross violation of human rights. We are looking at a situation where there is so much dehumanification where people are not seen for the value that they have.

The goal was always to show to Israel that the Palestinian security forces could be trusted with Israeli security rather than with Palestinian security. So, what they end up doing, for example, is when there is a protest against the Israeli Defense Forces, it is the Palestinian police who line up in between. And what that does is it undermines the legitimacy, as it would of any country, when you see your security forces not protecting you, but protecting someone else.

So, I think that we learn a few things from that, A, we won't have security and safety or any viable future if we don't choose right now a political solution, and that the Netanyahu government has invested in Hamas, seeing it as an asset instead of investing in peace and negotiation. I hope that that's number one that we learn. And the other one is that, you know, even if we separate and build a huge wall between Israel and Palestine, if Palestinians don't have security and safety and their interests met, of course, side by side by Israelis having their safety and security needs, interests met, we won't have security for anyone. We are tied together in this homeland, which is one.

If you think about security, which does not exist for Palestinians, but for Israelis for the past 30 years, there has been a sense of security, that has been, in many ways, thanks to very tight collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians, not only due to the separation barriers. And so, I think that we need to start learning, if we learn about the world, again, the E.U., but even Northern Ireland, moving from intense violence not so long ago to power sharing. We are trying to learn from the lessons, both in Israel, Palestine, both from the negotiation deadlocks, through the paradigm of sharing and through our idea of two-states, one homeland of a more confederal model. We actually have very creative solutions. Two deadlocks that have prevented us from moving forward into peace. So, it's very important for us to convey this message now. The day after is now.",

There are a bunch of different things that we think. Mental health care, maybe the federal government needs to look a little bit more closely and what -- in what ways it can help support federally qualified health clinics that are in some of these communities to be able to reach those needs.

Instead of it being a cost saving measure, it turned into a huge issue and plummeted the government into debt, into the debt that they're still trying to get out from under in Puerto Rico. I've seen reports out of California that sounds really similar to what's happening in Puerto Rico, again, to the sort of decreasing numbers of specialists and doctors who are available to provide appointments in a timely manner to be able to catch things before they become very serious problems.

But Shawn is very much an intellectual. So, we came at each other with this real common ground. And I told him, like, you're not going to offend me if you tell me that I'm doing something wrong, because I want to be great. I think I found something that I loved. I think I found the thing I'm supposed to be doing. And I want to be great it, but even more so than, you know, wanting to portray this character and the story well. I am a sort of representation that hasn't happened before for people in my community. For a hundred years of storytelling, we have been told that a blind person has a vacant expression, they don't look at the person they're talking to, they shuffle their feet, they're probably really vapid, and none of those things are true, even though they've been ingrained in our cultural identity. So, when someone like me walks on set, and I don't use a mobility aid, and I look you straight in the eye and my vision is variable, it's not a complete void of darkness, even if my characters -- my character might not see anything, it's a very interesting place to come from because media has told us otherwise. And, you know, I admire the work you do. And I admire the work of, you know, everyone who I got to listen to, like, coming on this program, like, as I was sitting and waiting. And, you know, we're not solving world hunger. We're not tackling these issues, but I could bring a voice to something and maybe it'll make a difference. And --",

I learned how to use it, and it's very difficult to learn that skill, but I never used it because I was bullied so badly for it. And getting Ingrid, my guide dog, was this catalyst to not only being safe and independent and moving really fast and freely through college at the time, but like displaying my culture to people and my identity. And it really is a culture. And so, I would never have been able to put out this tape as much as I didn't think anything was going to happen from it, I would have never been able to even record the tape in the first place if I didn't have the confidence in my own identity that she helped me instill in myself.",
