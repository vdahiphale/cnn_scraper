Israeli normalization with a bunch of countries. That's a big deal. You also have the Iranian deal that was brokered by the Chinese with the Gulf states. That's still in place.In some ways it's stronger. Higher level direct engagement between the Iranians and Gulf leadership. The Qataris, which had been essentially blockaded by the Saudis in the UAE. That got fixed. The GCC is more coordinated than it was. The status quo that's irrevocably broken was the unsustainable relationship between Israel and the forgotten Palestinians becoming more radicalized and particularly in the group of Hamas. And there I -- if it were just one risk, it's a lot of risks. It is true as Zanny just said that all the major states do not want this to escalate and explode. But there are lots of organizations that are hard to deter. You've got, of course, the Houthis in Yemen. You have Hamas itself. You have Netanyahu knowing that if the war is over, that he's out and probably going to prison. And you also have, of course, the incredible radicalization that is leading to more religious conflict, not just Israel-Palestinian, not just in the Middle East, but also in Europe and the United States. So, I think there are far too many ways for this to go wrong. I'm not sure which of them are most likely to hit, which of those tail risks over the course of the coming months. But I would bet that a few of them will. So I would take the bet that this is going to significantly escalate, unfortunately, in 2024.",

It is a policy that is strongly supported by the entire Israeli people. So it is true that the United States by being essentially stapled to this war cabinet is in a more isolated position globally than perhaps even the Russians were when they invaded Ukraine two years ago which is an astonishingly shocking thing to say given the violence perpetrated against Jews in Israel on October 7th.But it is where Biden is today.

He said, you know, if you are not helping Ukraine, you're helping yourselves and this was particularly at Europe.And he called Putin an animal who senses weakness and that if, you know, you allowed Putin to win in Ukraine, it would be much, much worse, it would be an existential risk for the rest and that argument just at moment isn't landing, I think, and that's what really is the sort of underpinning his sense of frustration which was very real.

And the bulwark against Donald Trump returning to the White House is an 81-year-old who is showing his age, who is the most -- has the lowest approval ratings of any modern president. That is not a great position to be in for the Democrats. And you know, you know most Americans do not want these two people to be running.Most, many Democrats don't want Biden to be running. When he first came in, there was a sense that he would be a one-term president. After '22, after the midterms, you know, something changed and there was a clear sense that he's decided that he wanted to do it again. And we argue that that is not only for noble reasons. I think there is some in the party, some complacency and some cowardice, and that has led them to sort of sleep-walk to this position which is not a position a party wants to be in and frankly not a position that anyone in the world wants. That the consequences of Donald Trump potentially returning to the White House are, you know, terrible in so many ways and you don't need to think that it's sort of end of American democracy, although I think it would have caused real problems. Even without that, it will cause tremendous problems for the U.S. and internationally. And I think it is by far the biggest shadow over a year, which in itself actually as you I think have mentioned before, Fareed, this is the year when over half the population of the world lives in countries that are having elections. More than 70 countries are going to the polls. Really big ones. Eight out of the 10 most populous countries. But hanging over all of that is the U.S. election. If you're in Beijing, if you're in Delhi, if you're in the Middle East, if you're certainly Bibi Netanyahu, if you're Putin, you are looking at this election and you are rooting for one particular outcome. And I think that is just -- it's going to be an extraordinary year and that's going to dominate everything that we think about. And for the administration, for the Democratic Party who got itself into this position, I think it's just, you know, a really, really unfortunate place to be in, and that's why we came out so strongly. It's not -- don't get me wrong. Joe Biden has been a good president in many ways. He's a noble public servant. He's doing a lot of very good things but he is -- people are worried about his age. He is 81 years old and that worry is only going to continue.",

So, the implication is that we have these -- the number of elections but most incumbents are likely to lose. So, when we do this next time this year, I think, we're likely to see a lot of new faces around the world. So, it used to be that having the public office, the visibility, the pedestal helped you. That used to be the case globally. Seventy percent of incumbents would win elections.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, one of my big trends of 2024 is this epic clash in the making between politician and investors. Politicians generally tend to spend more in elections years. That's well-known. The incentive to do so now is even much more because of approval ratings.I looked at the approval ratings of leaders around the world, and across western democracies, the approval rating of leaders currently is close to an all-time low. So, it is not just a Biden problem, as you point out, it is a universal problem. What is the implication? They want to spend more but they've already run very large deficits going into this election. The U.S. used to run a deficit of about three percent of GDP or so for much of the last decade. Their deficit now is six percent of GDP and likely to be that way. And I think that is going to be there that as -- whether it's the U.S. or other countries too from South Africa or whatever around the world, Mexico, everywhere the deficits have shot up. So, politicians try and spend more. You're going to have people in the bond market, the vigilantes, as they are known, sort of revolt against this. They're going to be saying, OK, you've got so much supply coming at us, we want higher interest rates. And that higher interest rates, obviously, has implications for everybody. So, currently you're celebrating the fact that the state has stopped its interest rate hikes, interest rates in general have come down. But if you end up getting these bond vigilantes shift their focus away from inflation to deficits, you're likely to see long-term interest rates not come down as much as you would expect or in fact even go up on the back of the all of these spending plans.",

So, this is a very heavily indebted country.And then you have Xi Jinping who really wants to make the country much more fortified and less big beneficiary of globalization which is what lifted China. And here is the real problem, which is that they go on printing GDP growth numbers showing that the economy is growing at five percent. The reality is that it is not growing at five percent. If you look at all the other metrics, what the companies are earning or what their revenues are, but the charade continues. That they claim they're growing at five percent. A lot of western academics and other China watchers believe they are growing at five percent so why do anything? So, you've got this very strange situation but a charade is on.

It is going to be possible to do that, I believe, if we focus on it as a research community, as a group of governing actors, as creators of the technology in the open source and in the private companies. We have to make that a priority.We have overcome huge scientific and engineering feats to contain nuclear power, to get the best out of aviation and not have planes fall out of the sky all the time, to regulate cars and make sure that everybody is trained to drive a car and that there are, you know, airbags and wind screens and vehicle emissions and traffic lights and -- you know, these are important moments in the history of the development of our technology where we've really paid attention. And this is another one of those moments. The good news is, that over the last decade, as the models have got bigger, they've actually got easier to control. There are fewer hallucinations than there have ever been. There are fewer biases than there have ever been. And with each order of magnitude of computation that we add to these training runs, what we see is that they make fewer mistakes, they're easier to control, and they take instruction more closely. And so, the real question becomes, whose instruction and what instruction? What is the behavior policy that we're asking these AIs to adhere to, and who is auditing and verifying that the AIs are behaving within the boundary constraints that have been set for it?",

That, you know, before the enlightenment, we didn't understand the world and we would attribute anything we didn't understand to divine forces. You know, if the sun rose, because the sun god moved his chariot across the sky.We will be in a situation where the A.I. will tell us, you know, this is the answer, this is -- this person has cancer. But we won't be able to understand why because the level of computation and analysis will be so much greater. What kind of position does that place human beings in? We're almost returning to our pre-enlightenment self when the -- in that time we looked up to God and now we look up to this black box called A.I. but in both cases, we're believing, not actually understanding.",
