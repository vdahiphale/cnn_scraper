I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Straight ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Ukraine, as the country is in a critical moment in its war against Russia. We'll bring you his remarks live. Then, riot police disperse protesters in Georgia after lawmakers passed a controversial foreign agents bill. We will have the latest developments here. Plus, right now, star witness Michael Cohen is testifying for a second day in Donald Trump's hush money trial. We'll have the latest updates and live updates from inside the court. Well, we want to begin in Ukraine. During a critical moment in its war against Russia, over the past few days, Moscow's troops have been making gains on the ground, including a surprise border attack in the eastern Kharkiv region. And as Russia makes these gains, Ukraine awaits the deployment of newly arrived U.S. security assistance. There is also a newly approved $54 billion financial aid package from the European Union. In Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a little earlier on Tuesday. He is also expected to speak in Kyiv at any moment. Of course, we will bring you those comments just as soon as they happen. But, Secretary Blinken was told by President Zelenskyy that Ukraine needs more air defenses like Patriot missiles. Joining us with the latest now with CNN's Kylie Atwood. She is at the U.S. State Department, and Fred Pleitgen, who is in Berlin. Good to see you both. Fred, let me start with you. The timing of this visit, it's hard to miss. I mean, Russia is now making these gains on the ground. What more can we expect to hear from Blinken, do you think?",

I think it's an absolutely crucial time and a very difficult time for the Ukrainians and certainly very important for them to have Secretary of State Blinken there on the ground, who acknowledged that right now it is difficult for them. And you did hear also the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, thanking the Secretary of State for coming in, and of course the U.S. for OKing that aid package, military aid to the Ukrainians, which is so very key.And one of the things, Rahel, that you were just talking about is absolutely correct. The President of Ukraine emphasizing that air defense systems right now very crucial to the Ukrainians, especially as they face this new onslaught from the Russians in the northeast of Ukraine, where the Russians are currently pushing across the border there right now. The Ukrainian President saying that the Ukrainians, he believes, needed two more Patriot U.S.-made surface-to-air missile systems, longer-range surface-to-air missile systems because crucially the Russians are now able to employ their air force and use their air force a lot more effectively than they have in the past. They've managed to put wing and guidance kits on Soviet-era bombs, meaning they can drop them further away from the frontlines. And the Ukrainians are saying the only surface-to-air missile system that can keep those planes away and shoot those planes down is the Patriots. So, that key, but then also, of course, for the Ukrainians getting ammo to the frontline also, and that's why this visit by the Secretary of State so very important to the Ukrainians, militarily, but of course, also politically as well.",

Blinken has visited Ukraine about four times since Russia's invasion. He has visited the Middle East about half a dozen times since the October 7 attack. He clearly has a lot on his plate. Talk to us about the message of solidarity, of support we may hear from Blinken to Ukraine. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. That's right. We are expected to hear that message of solidarity. Rahel. The Secretary of State already said this morning that the United States remains determined to see Ukraine succeed. But, he did acknowledge, he said in his own words that this is a challenging time for Ukraine. Of course, we're more than two years into this conflict. And as Fred was saying, the Russians are making some gains now. But, he was able to come. He is the first Biden administration official to visit Ukraine since that supplemental funding that is enabling those new U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine to actually head in that direction. He said they are on their way to Ukraine. Now, that U.S. weaponry, some of those weapons are already have reached the frontlines, and the Secretary of State said that he does expect that that sort of support will have an impact on the battlefield for the Ukrainians. We'll have to watch and see if it actually does, Rahel. But, he is going to be giving a speech later this hour. He is really focused on building of a democratic Ukraine, not just, of course, the military endeavors that Ukraine continues to be focused on, but also on the reform that it needs to undertake in order, of course, to move forth with its bid for NATO and the European Union. [11:05:00] So, that will be a focus. And in addition to meeting with President Zelenskyy where, as you said, Zelenskyy was thankful for this new U.S. support but also calling for the need for that air defense from the United States. The Secretary of State is also going to be meeting with other Ukrainian lawmakers. He met with the Foreign Minister Kuleba earlier today. He is also going to meet with members of civil society and also members from the public sectors. So, this is a wide- ranging trip for the Secretary of State to make sure that he connects with a wide range of Ukrainians, not just in government, but also in civil society to see what they need to continue keeping their country on its feet.",

Then, in March, barely three months after gaining EU candidate status, the Georgian government revived the law.

Turning now to Donald Trump's hush money trial, this just in, the New York State Court of Appeals has denied Donald Trump's request to lift the gag order placed on him by the judge in the hush money trial. And right now, Michael Cohen is back on the stand again. This is day two. It's going to be critical testimony that could make or break things for the prosecution. Prosecutors today are trying to nail down their case and show that Trump was directly involved in covering up payments made to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Cohen testified that invoices he'd submitted in 2017 were to get reimbursed for payments that he made to Daniels and were not for valid legal fees. The defense could begin cross-examination as soon as today, and this is widely expected to be quite volatile. Sparks could fly, as many expect, as Trump's lawyers take off the gloves and attack Michael Cohen's credibility. Let's bring in now CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider, who has been following all the latest on this. So, Jessica, just give us a sense of what has happened so far this morning.

So, I think they set the stage for him nicely. And now, in a very sober, methodical way, he is going through the evidence in the case, and I think that evidence is compelling of what he has to say from his personal knowledge, meaning the evidence corroborates everything he says.And so, you don't even have to like Michael Cohen, although I think he is presenting himself as a likable figure, because everything that he is saying, they're showing him documents to say, and is this what you mean? And is this what you mean? And remember, jury, when David Pecker said this or (inaudible) said that, is that right, Michael? So, everything they're tying together, I think, nicely.",

And they're trying to say, well, Michael, did you do all that stuff? And he is saying, yes, I did. I'm ashamed of it. This is why I did it. And hope that the jury says, you know what, I get it.

But, I was in the room with Donald Trump when he said this. I was in the White House with Donald Trump when he said that. So, he is the direct evidence link to the circumstantial evidence. That I think is what makes the case stronger. It's not to say they'll get a conviction. They could get hung jury.But, I think Cohen closes that outlet for the defense to saying circumstantial, reasonable doubt, nobody knew anything. Donald Trump was taken advantage of by Michael Cohen.

Also for minute-by-minute updates from inside of the court, you can see that on the left side of the screen.But, we do want to get to some breaking news now that we're following out of the state of Florida. At least eight people have been killed and another 45 hurt after a bus crash in Marion County. The Highway Patrol says that a bus was carrying farmworkers when it was involved in an accident with a pickup truck. I do believe that these are live pictures there. Officials say that it appears the two vehicles sideswiped each other which then led to the bus veering off the road that we are hearing and seeing here. It looks like you can see -- I mean, clearly, you can see heavy police presence there on this road. I'm not exactly familiar with Marion County. But, from the looks of this live picture, it does look to be in a suburban area or a more remote area. But, we'll obviously get these details as we learn them, but really serious developments, a bus crash killing eight people, injuring 45 in the state of Florida. Several of those people injured we do know are in critical condition. We continue to follow it for you. All right. After a break, is a new trade war on the horizon? Still ahead, the U.S. announcing billions of dollars in tariffs on a variety of Chinese products. We'll take a look at why and what the fallout may be. Plus, the numbers are in, and American businesses still feeling the pressure of inflation. Coming up, we're going to take a look at the latest wholesale inflation report, PPI, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SOLOMON: Welcome back. U.S. President Joe Biden is ratcheting up America's -- or concerns about America's trade war with China, increasing tariffs on a range of Chinese imports. The tariffs affect around $18 billion in products, including electric vehicles, steel, aluminum, solar cells and medical supplies. Those are very steep hikes, some of the rates going from zero percent to 25 percent or 50 percent. Tariffs on Chinese EVs quadrupling to 100 percent. The Biden administration hopes that this move will cripple development of critical technologies in Beijing and prioritize U.S. production. Joining us now from the White House is Arlette Saenz. Arlette, tell us a little bit more about what the White House is saying, because as I said, this is sort of igniting concerns now about potential trade war with China and how Beijing may respond to this.",

They want to talk to Michael Cohen about his former attorney Robert Costello. And it's interesting. When the prosecutor started, she said, are you familiar with an attorney by the name of Robert Costello? And instead of immediately answering, Michael Cohen just side. It turns out that Robert Costello actually did testify before a grand jury and he called Michael Cohen a lie, cheat, steal. So, despite their previous attorney-client relationship, Robert Costello has spoken out very disparagingly toward Michael Cohen.And this as the prosecution really getting out all the bad stuff it can about Michael Cohen before the defense gets up for what could be a brutal cross-examination. And like I said before, I think we're nearing the end of this direct testimony, because just before the break, Michael Cohen talked about his last interaction with Donald Trump. It was right after the FBI raid of his hotel that he was staying at in 2018. He said he heard from Donald Trump afterward, basically saying you'll be fine. Stay strong. And oh, yeah, don't flip. And apparently, that was the last time that Michael Cohen and Donald Trump spoke with each other. So, presumably, all of the interactions have already been documented by the prosecution. And now, they're probably going to take a little bit of time before they are wrapped up with direct examination, getting out all of the bad stuff that they anticipate the defense might bring up in cross-examination. So, Rahel, that is likely why we're seeing this discussion begin about Robert Costello and the bad things that he might have said about Michael Cohen, because remember, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar. He pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges, including lying to Congress. So, again, the prosecution wants to get this out there before the defense brings it up at cross. SOLOMON: Yeah, pleading guilty to those crimes in 2018. Jessica, give us a sense of the color in the courtroom, because we don't have a camera inside.

But, the way the courtroom is arranged, from what we understand, is that when you're in the witness box, you actually really don't have a direct line of vision to Donald Trump. You have to kind of lean over and look around because there is -- the way it's configured, you just don't have that direct line.So, there really hasn't been any interaction between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump between yesterday and today. It seems like every time they take a break, neither of these men look at each other, and that's probably the way it's going to continue. I mean, it's a very -- the relationship has a lot of animosity. And I'm sure that Donald Trump's attorneys have warned him to kind of stay as calm as possible, not erupt at anything Michael Cohen says, and that's actually just what Donald Trump has done so far. There has been no interaction between the two men, and they really haven't even glanced at each other, Rahel.",

There is a big sort of elephant in the room of Allen Weisselberg. He is at the heart of so much of this and it doesn't look like he is going to make an appearance in the courtroom. And so, they got to sort of figure out what are they going to say, both sides, about his absence? And that has -- that's something I'm looking forward to seeing how that's addressed.

And he understands that. And I think that the prosecution has their fingers crossed, that he can maintain his temper, because he is likely going to be directly accused of being a liar and a scoundrel and all manner of things. And he has just got to say, look, yes, it's true. I own it. I'm sorry. I don't know what more you can ask me, Mr. Defense Attorney or anything it would be. I think is going to be planned at the cross-examination. What do you want me to do? It is in the past, I did it. I admitted, I acknowledge it. I'm sorry for it. But, what I'm telling you right now is the truth. And the prosecutors will say and that truth is corroborated. And that's why earlier when we talked about, can they go too far in their attacks of him and make him sympathetic, is a line they've got to be careful of.",

We will take you to those comments just as soon as they happen.But, in the meantime, I want to welcome in General Mark Hertling. General, always good to have you. Please excuse the interruption if he does come to the podium. But, in the meantime, talk to me a little bit about how important this moment is, Blinken's visit, as it comes in the midst of these gains for Russia's side. LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's critically important, Rahel. This is more than just talking about arms and weapons, though. The Secretary of State is there to not only talk about defense and how we will -- can -- how U.S. will continue to support Ukraine, but also their long-term recovery and reconstitution after the war. And he has also held meetings with members of the Ukrainian Parliament about corruption. This has been -- having spent a lot of time in Ukraine myself, this has been an issue since they separated away from the old Soviet Union as an independent state. The older generation of Ukrainians have always had kind of a concept of corruption, and it is -- has been tamped down over the last two decades. But, there is still elements of it within the society. So, all of these things were topics that Secretary Blinken was addressing, not just with President Zelenskyy, but many of his ministers.",

It's been very tough over the last seven months. And whenever you have an organization in combat, like Ukraine's military has been, any disruption in the supply lines is going to be exacerbated on the frontlines. So, that delay over the seven months has affected Ukraine's ability to keep the frontline stabilized. And Russia has continued to focus on spreading the front. And what I mean by that is they are attacking in multiple axes, have advanced into Ukraine, and causing the Ukrainian forces to determine, where do we want to defend?So, you're seeing Ukraine defend in multiple directions, such as in Donetsk (ph), against rockets coming in to -- and missiles coming into Kharkiv. And Sumy is a new area of operation that the Russians are trying to approach. So, all of those areas, not just from ground sprites and the massive amount of Russian artillery, but also the use by -- of Russia by missiles. Glide bonds, as you said during the last hour with Fred Pleitgen, have become a weapon of choice with the Russian, and all of those required defensive systems to counter them. Ukraine has not had those because of the delay in delivery of supplies over the last seven months.",

And as Mr. Blinken is probably going to say, we are interested in not only the defense of Ukraine, but the recovery and reconstitution of their country from the massive assaults and war crimes that Russia has committed.So, I think Mr. Putin was very happy for a period of time, over six months. Now, he is not as much so, and we've seen issues this weekend, as a matter of fact, when Mr. Putin changed his minister of defense from Shoigu to Belousov, and he is also probably going to change a lot of other things to put Russia on a complete war footing.",
