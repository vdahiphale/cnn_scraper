And new details on the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO, police revealing what they say directly connects the suspect, Luigi Mangione, to the shooting.Well, we begin in Syria, where a new reality is taking shape. Days after Bashar al-Assad was driven out of power, rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani says that he will dissolve the security forces that served Assad's regime and plans to close Syria's notorious prisons. Meantime, there is fighting in northern Syria between pro-Turkish and Kurdish factions. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of militant groups dominated by Kurdish organizations, says that Turkey and its militia allies are bombarding areas near the Turkey-Syria border. Syria's new caretaker government says that it is ready to cooperate with the U.S., as the search continues for Americans who went missing under Assad's regime. The interim government says that there are ongoing efforts to locate American journalist Austin Tice who vanished while reporting near Damascus in 2012. And CNN's Clarissa Ward and her team are giving us an exclusive look inside a secret prison in Syria. They had hoped to find traces of Austin Tice, but instead made this discovery.

But, he also made clear that while -- that they have been close before when it comes to these negotiations, and so he would not say that a deal will indeed be achieved, but he did say that there is cause for optimism. He explains why he believes that's the case. First of all, he said that the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon may have changed Hamas' position. We've heard that repeatedly, of course, from U.S. and Israeli officials. But, at this moment, Sullivan made clear that he believes that the ceasefire in Lebanon changed Hamas' calculus and made them, as he said, adapt their posture at the negotiating table.At the same time, he also indicated that there have been some changes on the Israeli side, that the military successes that Israel has achieved in Gaza, as it relates to killing Sinwar, to dismantling Hamas' military structures inside the Gaza Strip, that that may also be contributing to getting the two sides closer, potentially to a deal here. So, from Israel, the National Security Advisor is now heading to Doha, Qatar, as well as to Cairo, Egypt, where, of course, the two key mediators in these negotiations are based. And he said that his goal is to, quote, \"put us in a position to close this deal this month\", again, staying clear of saying that this deal can happen, will happen this month, but clearly, making no bones about the fact that these negotiations are at a critical juncture at this time, and that there is the possibility in the air of closing things out. He also made clear that both President Biden and the incoming President Trump are both eager to see a hostage and ceasefire deal, and he doesn't believe that Israel will wait until Trump comes into office to reach that deal. And lastly, he also offered some progress, a status report, I should say, on those Americans who are being held in Gaza, seven Americans, four of whom have been confirmed dead. He said that the three other Americans are indeed believed to be alive, but the United States wants to get all of them back, those alive and dead, as part of a future ceasefire and hostage agreement.

Trump responded, we're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there is something causing it.

But, economists are warning that Americans could end up paying higher prices for everything from autos to avocados if Trump follows through on his plans to slap both U.S. friends and foes alike with higher tariffs. According to research from the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, the impact of tariffs would be the greatest on the many goods that the U.S. imports from China. So, think toys, think sneakers. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to ramp up tariffs on Chinese imports to 60 percent if he returned to the White House, although, after he was elected, that figure actually dropped closer to an additional 10 percent.Let's bring in our Matt Egan, who joins us now from New York with more details. So, Matt, obviously too early to know if Trump will actually follow through on these tariffs. But, if he did, how does this impact consumers?",

Now, to your point, we don't know what's going to actually happen. We don't know who is going to impose those tariffs and how long they be in place for. But, this new research finds that the goods that are most exposed to Trump's threatened tariffs are the ones that we predominantly get from China and then have low tariff rates right now.So, specifically, we're talking about electronics, think smartphones, like iPhones, machinery, toys, clothing, sporting goods, all of them would be vulnerable to price spikes, according to this Peterson Institute research. Now, footwear is another thing that could potentially go up significantly in price, because we get almost all of the shoes that are sold in the United States from overseas. 99 percent are imported, and more than half of them come from China. Now, Trump has repeatedly said that he does not believe his proposed tariffs will increase prices. He notes that they had pretty low inflation when Trump was in office the first time and there were tariffs in place. Of course, that was a different period, right? That was before COVID. That was before the inflation crisis. And also, what he is proposing now is just much bigger in size and scope. And so, that's why these researchers say that a 60 percent tariff on China almost certainly will be felt directly by American households. Rahel.",

And it showed the producer prices were up by three percent year-over-year in November. That was hotter than expected, and that is actually the highest rate for producer prices on an annual basis since early 2023, and on a monthly basis, it also went the wrong way, doubling from where the growth rate was for prices in October.So, why is this happening? Well, a lot of this was driven by goods, in particular, food prices. We saw a significant increase for fresh fruit, vegetables, poultry and eggs. Egg prices at the wholesale level skyrocketed more than 50 percent, and that, of course, is being driven in large part by bird flu. But, I think, as that chart shows, look, we're a long way from where we were two, two and a half years ago, when we had very, very high inflation in the United States, and really around the world.

They are facing charges in connection with the 2020 fake electors plot. I know it's almost 2025 now, but we're still talking about 2020 because these cases are still ongoing.So, these charges were filed by the Wisconsin Attorney General, who is a Democrat, and there are three Trump allies who are in legal peril here. There is Ken Chesebro, the architect of the fake electors plot. There is Jim Troupis, who was one of Trump's 2020 campaign attorneys in Wisconsin. And there is also Mike Roman, a Trump 2020 campaign official. Remember, this was about the fake electors. They organized a plan for Republicans to sign fake certificates that Trump then tried to use to overturn the 2020 election when Congress met on January 6th to tally up all of the real electors. So, this was a seven-state plan, but today's hearing is about Wisconsin, one of the states where the Trump campaign tried to pull that off in 2020. Today is just an initial appearance. They are expected to plead not guilty. But, of course, I should point out that these are state criminal charges. Yes, Donald Trump is going to become the President next year. He will be in charge of the Justice Department, but that's for federal crimes and federal cases. He can't order the DoJ to shut this down. And also, he can't pardon these defendants because these are alleged state offenses, not federal offenses. So, while Donald Trump ascends to the presidency and his legal clouds are lifting, there is still serious legal trouble for these three allies in Wisconsin and dozens of others across the country who have been hit with similar charges.

You can see this rotor wing helicopter dropping an incredible amount of water on embers that are towering several stories into the air. This fire burned so hot at one stage that it was altering the weather in and around. The fire, just incredible.So, when we talk about the potential rainfall, it is going to be marginal at best. So, I don't want to get anybody's hopes up, but we will take what we can get, and here it is. The incoming cold front will bring not only a change in the wind direction, but the small chance of light sprinkles in and around the Malibu region. It quickly moves eastward, and then another approaching cold front by the weekend will bring yet another chance of cloud cover, cooler temperatures and perhaps some more moisture into the atmosphere as well. And I tell you why that's important in just one second. Some impressive containment numbers. Remember, yesterday, at this time, we were talking about zero percent containment with the Franklin Fire. So, they're gaining some marginal ground on this fire, but the winds are changing direction, and this is important for the firefighting efforts on the ground. We no longer have the Santa Ana winds coming from the Northeast up and over the mountain ranges towards the coast, speeding up as they do so. We're actually going to see more of an onshore component to the winds in and around Los Angeles and Ventura County. And what this means is that it will actually take some of the moisture from the Pacific Ocean, and increase the relative humidity and dew point across southern California. We will take that as well, because that will help slow the progress of a fire. You could see the browns changed over to more green. That represents more relative humidity in the atmosphere with the first cold front that comes through, and then watch the secondary cold front by Saturday. It will approach the region, bring another change in the wind direction and also more cloud and an increase in the relative humidity as well. Again, not much precipitation out of the sky, but we will certainly take what we can get at this stage. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
