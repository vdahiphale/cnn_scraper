CNN has reporters stand out across the country. Miguel Marquez is outside the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio and Harry Enten is at Niagara Falls. I love seeing both of you .

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jessica, it is good to be with you and it pains me to say  this, but yes, if Ukrainians don't get the aid that they need, it is going to be a real problem for them because at this particular point in time, we are looking at munitions shortages, weapons shortages, troops shortages -- things that you've basically outlined get in that President Zelenskyy has talked about.

So hopefully, the Ukrainian pilots that have been trained on the F-16, I have learned to operate the platform in a jamming environment.

Those particular things were significant achievements. The problem is they needed to keep the momentum going and because of the way western aid was provided for in this case, not provided in a timely fashion, that made a big difference and that prevented the Ukrainians in part from succeeding the other part, of course, was also tactics and the types of tactics that the Ukrainians used were basically tactics that they had adapted in some ways, apart from us, but also in part from the Soviet days when they were part of the Soviet Union, and those tactics did not work against a foe that was able to get entrenched, to actually even stabilized the frontlines in their favor and that really prevented things from going forward to the way the Ukrainians wanted to.

There is the possibility that Ukraine could achieve some localized gains and capitalize on those, but in essence, what we are looking at so far, unless there is a dramatic change on the battlefield is in essence the status quo, which would be somewhat akin to the solution that was achieved in Korea after the Korean War ended. So in essence, you had a static frontline that has been in existence since 1953. In that particular your case, we could see something similar to that in Ukraine. It is not a good solution and it is certainly not something that is satisfactory to Ukrainians or to their western backers. But that might be the case unless there is a drastic change in how the Russians supply their forces, and if there is a way to cut those supply lines, then that could potentially change things. But until that happens, there is basically very little that the Ukrainians can do except to hold on, and that's going to be tough.",

A source familiar with the details says the event in Palm Beach has already raised $43 million.And let's look where the number stands. The Biden campaign saying it has raised more than $90 million in March with $192 million cash on hand. That is a significant edge compared to Trump's $65 million raised in March and $93 million cash on hand. Joining me now to discuss this and more is CNN's political commentator and democratic strategist, Maria Cardona, and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart, always great to have both of you on. Maria, let's start first, money is great. People love money. It is better to have more than less when you have a presidential campaign, but how does the Biden campaign take that money and actually use it to its advantage?",

We haven't seen much of her since they left the White House and certainly not on the campaign trail this go-round. So I'd also like to know what you think about her appearing as well. ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORAnd what we're seeing with these high dollar donors, the Mercers, the Hamms (ph) and Steve Wynn, these are people that have donated to other candidates when - during the primary process, whether it's Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, and now they are coalescing. This high dollar unity was bound to happen as soon as the Republicans got their nominee. Now they realize it's Donald Trump and they are coalescing behind him because they understand their finances, as well as most Americans, were much better under the Trump administration than under the Biden administration. And big money aside, New York Times reporting last week and the campaign is reporting that Donald Trump actually has more small dollar donors, under $200, than Joe Biden. That is going a long way because, as you said, Jessica, money is big, but votes are bigger. And when you have small dollar donors, that is more voters. And, look, President Biden needs all of the money that he's raising because he is trying to go out there and court voters that he should already have. He's spending millions upon millions trying to shore up Hispanics and voters of color that he's losing to Donald Trump because they're frustrated with the economic situation, they're frustrated with the crisis at the border, and they're frustrated with the foreign policy of this administration. So Biden is going to need all the money he's raising because he is behind in six out of seven of the battleground states, and that's going to take a lot of money to dig out of that hole.",

Every one of those sons of (expletive) who did that, we ought to find them, try them and send them to jail. And if - and one of the critical mistakes made in this campaign is that Donald Trump has now said, I'm going to pardon those people because they're hostages. No, they're not. They're thugs.

This kind of message reminds them of that threat, reminds them that Donald Trump wants to go in there not just to stay out of the jail, but - not just to stay out of jail, but if he gets into the White House again, the first time around, Jessica, was a trial run.He has already said that he wants to be a dictator on day one. He has already said that he will use the Justice Department and all of the institutions to go after his enemies. He has already said all of the horrible things that he wants to institute if he gets another chance. And so we should take him at his word. And the fact that he believes, Donald Trump believes that these January 6 criminals who attacked our capitol, attacked our democracy, tried to hang Mike Pence, killed some law enforcement officers, that he believes they're hostages, yes, that is a very powerful message for the Biden administration and the Biden campaign to continue to communicate, and they will.",
