He just wrapped up a critical Mideast visit. And President Biden is back on the world stage. He's headed to Italy right now for a highly anticipated summit with world leaders one day after his son's conviction. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. We begin this hour with a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East. Israel's military says Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces have fired at least 200 rockets into Northern Israel today. No injuries are reported, not yet. The IDF says it responded by striking the rocket launcher in Southern Lebanon and other Hezbollah targets. This new exchange of hostilities comes as cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas have descended into turmoil. This morning, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is in Qatar to meet with mediators on a plan that would end the fighting in Gaza and free the hostages who were seized back on October 7. I want to bring in CNN's national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood. Kylie, you're there in Doha, Qatar, where Secretary Blinken spoke just a little while ago. Update our viewers. Tell us what he said.",

He said some of their proposals are workable and some of them aren't, Wolf, clearly, not a full-throated assessment that things are going incredibly well here.Listen to the secretary's own words just in the last few hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. We discussed those changes last night with Egyptian colleagues and today with the prime minister. Some of the changes are workable. Some are not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the secretary of state said that, in the coming days, they're going to be engaged in an urgent effort to try and bridge these differences between the Israelis, between Hamas. Of course, we will watch and see if they can do that with the mediators here in Qatar, also the Egyptians and U.S. officials who are intimately involved in this process. And he also said that in the coming weeks, the U.S. and the other players in the region are going to be releasing proposals for the day- after plan for governance and for what it could look like in Gaza after this conflict is over. He said that will be necessary to push a cease-fire towards an enduring peace. But, of course, in order to get there, you have to get a cease-fire. And we just aren't there right now.",

So we can focus on Netanyahu all we want, but they have agreed to the cease-fire. It is Hamas who has not agreed to the cease-fire. So if the war goes on, it's because Hamas wants the war to go on. If there are more civilians that get killed in the war, it's because Hamas wants that to happen in order to sell that propaganda to America and around the world.

They sense an opportunity because they see the world shunning Israel, based on the propaganda that Hamas has sold and antisemitism that exists that is being tapped into. They see the U.N. going after Israel. They see the ICC, who has no jurisdiction, going after Israel. They see the protests on college campuses. They see the \"Death to America\" chants. They see the \"Jews go back to Poland,\" right? They see the \"Kill all Zionists.\" They're watching everything, and they sense an opportunity. And that's why they're escalating. And it's why right now the world needs to put as much pressure on Hamas as possible to agree to a cease-fire. If we get that cease-fire, this thing that's going on between Israel and Hezbollah will tamp down.",

We would never tolerate people protesting in front of the 9/11 Memorial on behalf of Osama bin Laden. I mean, and that's what's happening in New York City, and it's antisemitism that is growing around the country, right? We have seen this show before, right? This is never late, right? It's always blame the Jews. This has been going on for thousands of years. But, right now, the Jewish community is at an inflection point, and we need our allies to stand with us. The Jewish community has stood with many people, many different races, ethnic backgrounds over hundreds of years fighting for things, and now we need those allies to stand up for the Jewish community, because we are being targeted not because of Israel, but because we're Jewish, period, OK? It's disgusting. President Biden's done a great job standing up against antisemitism. My colleagues, my Republican colleagues in the House have done a good job, and so we need an all-of-government approach. We need Democrats and Republicans to stand up to the extremism in both of their parties in order to tackle this antisemitism problem.",

It's the people who are protesting, right? I didn't see one single college student during the protests come out and say, hey:  Look, I'm here to help the Palestinians. I'm here to help free Gaza. The folks over there that want to kill all Jews, they're not with me. I didn't see one student do that, OK? And so that's what this movement has become. This movement has become anti-Jewish.

That's something that's very much angered the Kremlin. And so I think this deployment takes on an additional message as well, which is, look, from the Kremlin point of view, you can make our lives, our task very difficult in Ukraine, but we can also be a nuisance to you in your own backyard as well.
