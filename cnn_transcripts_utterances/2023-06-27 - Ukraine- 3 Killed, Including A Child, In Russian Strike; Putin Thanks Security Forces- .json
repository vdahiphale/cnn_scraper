An eyewitness tells CNN's team on the ground they've seen up to a dozen people pulled from the rubble, this after days of turmoil inside of Russia, following an attempted armed rebellion by the mercenary Wagner group led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, that sent shock waves through the Kremlin and revealed cracks in Putin's two-decade long grip on power. We have reporters throughout Ukraine. And co-anchor tonight, Erin Burnett, is near the front lines in Dnipro.

He said that it was crammed with people, dozens of people and it was utter pandemonium. OK, here, the air siren has gone off again. Now, we were able to get inside of the restaurant. What we saw was just utter destruction. There were slabs of concrete, there was dozens of rescue workers just digging in the rubble, trying to find more people, more bodies. Our producer, Khost (ph), actually was there when they pulled out a body. Now, according to the police, the latest numbers are four dead, including one child and 42 injured. We can actually hear the work going on behind me. It seemed that has resumed. But this isn't the first time that this sort of catastrophe happens in Kramatorsk. We're not very far from the front lines. Bakhmut is just an hour away from here by car, and it's also the first anniversary today of a strike on a shopping mall in central Ukraine that killed 22 people, which really underscores that these strikes oftentimes are random. They seem designed to terrorize the civilian population and punish the soldiers in this war effort.

But the new spin is too late, as Prigozhin is no longer the target of Russian prosecutors, Tuesday, appeared to have fled to Belarus, according to its president, Alexander Lukashenko, who relished in colorfully describing a starkly contrasting weekend for Putin, in which he persuaded Prigozhin in a phone call to stop his tanks moving on Putin. There was cursing. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Yevgeny was in complete euphoria. There are ten times more expletives than normal words.

Russian troops targeted here outside of Bakhmut, usually don't have phones, and might not have learned yet of Wagner's revolt. What morale will be left to shatter when they do? (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera): Erin, I think what's most staggering about the last four days is that Yevgeny Prigozhin, if indeed he is in Belarus as Lukashenko says, is still a free man. He has essentially driven tanks on Moscow and then changed his mind. And yet he's not in prison, and indeed, it appears from Russian prosecutors, is going to have those charges essentially dropped against him. What of him now? Does Wagner reconstitute in Belarus? Does it become an asset for Lukashenko? A thorn in Lukashenko side trying and get back in Putin's favor? I think the last option there, pretty remote, but Prigozhin is still a free man.

So, Putin lives on to fight another day. And so, he stays in the office. So, in this sense, he actually is successful enough, and he got Lukashenko to do his bidding.

And if I'm DOJ, I'm trying to flip Nauta, apparently, they already have. But I don't think I need him, right?

His lawyers being paid for by a Trump affiliated entity and he's not flipped so far. So, the thing is, if I'm the DOJ here, looking at the indictment, looking at the evidence, including the recording we just talked about, I don't need him.
