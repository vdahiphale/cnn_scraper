The governor was traveling to an event in Chattanooga when he was involved -- when a vehicle he was in was involved in a car accident.Now, we are told that the governor is okay and his staff are okay, but we still are trying to figure out what exactly happened, who is at fault, and all those sorts of details. We do know the governor was traveling in Tennessee today to appear at a bunch of fundraising events. He had three scheduled in the state. Fundraising, of course, is an important part of his campaign. He is trying to build up the funds to take on former President Donald Trump. His campaign released a statement to us this morning about the incident, and it said, quote, this morning, the governor was in a car accident while traveling to an event in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He and his team are uninjured. We appreciate the prayers and well wishes of the nation for his continued protection while on the campaign trail. Now, it's not clear exactly how many vehicles were involved in this accident, but I know from covering the governor that he often travels with a pretty large security presence. He's usually in and out of large black SUVs. He goes with staff, he goes with security. There's usually vehicles in front of him, behind him. So, that's sort of the size of the operation. And we're still waiting more details, but, of course, most important thing so far is that the governor is okay. And that seems to be mostly positive details coming from the campaign so far.",

But we have no indication yet today, Rahel, that the grand jury that the special counsel's office has been using for some time to look at January 6th, Donald Trump and the 2020 election, that that specific grand jury has convened today. But if they do, the day is still pretty young. And if they do, any time that they are meeting is a time where they could be asked to review an indictment or even look at additional evidence.And you mentioned those new documents that the special counsel's office now has. That's a pretty significant trove of information. And we don't know what the Special Counsel's Office will find in that or what they will want to do with that, as they're looking as a possible case here. That's because those documents come from the group of people that Rudy Giuliani was working with most closely to try and perpetuate this idea of election fraud across the country that was just not founded. And the reason that those documents had been held back was because the Trump campaign did not want to turn them over. Bernie Kerik, a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, had those documents, was not turning them over to anyone, including Congress, when they asked for them, and then just recently, over the weekend, became willing to turn them over because the Trump campaign decided, yes, it was time they would have to turn them over.",

And in this particular aspect, Sean Lyngaas here at CNN was able, to find out with a bunch of other reporters here working with him that there was a meeting in February 2020 when Donald Trump, as president, at the time, was briefed by senior national security officials about how secure they believed the election was going to be.They believed it was going to be very secure. They were quite confident in that. Trump was very receptive to that idea, apparently, in this meeting, and even wanted them to hold a press conference about it, to take credit for the work that they were doing to make sure that paper ballots and other aspects of the election would be so secure for the American public. Now, the special counsel's office has heard some information about that, and it's not totally clear why they want to know that. But if you couple it with what Trump said, even two months later, he was talking about how there could be fraud and how there may not be reason to believe and have faith in the election.",

But right now the focus appears to be on Joe Biden.But John, that will take some time to play out. It probably would not happen until the fall.

Welcome to you both. Jackie, I want to start with you and turn to this op-ed.

Some of them are in the -- most of them are in the single digits. So, there's a lot of time between now and then, but it seems like he's leaping ahead in the assumption that, you know, not donors, voters are going to want something else.",

And he's taking a note from Democrats who had the discipline to do that after South Carolina, where the field really thinned and paved the way for Biden, albeit Bernie Sanders, a real duality, clear contrast there. But, basically, folks saying, you know, Biden has got the best chance to beat Donald Trump, let's coalesce behind him, after a crucial number of contests.I think, look, Chris Christie is doing the best job of drawing a clear contrast. He has the charisma of commonsense and his convictions. More folks can take a note from him than that. I wouldn't count out Tim Scott. I think a lot of Republican voters like the fact that he's an optimistic figure selling an optimistic vision, which is the opposite of what Donald Trump does. And there's some standouts in this field, but they should take the note from Mitt Romney. This is about math. And while the RNC can adjust its own rules by October 1st by making it more proportional, less winner take all, to Jackie's point, Trump's in poll position right now.

And this started with a motor carrier enforcement inspector who noticed Jadarrius Rose driving in the semi who had a missing mud flap, a missing rear mud flap.So, he tries to pull him over, but Rose, according to the case report and we see in the video, does not stop. So, he calls for backup, and then a chase ensues, at some point, stop sticks are used. And we do eventually see Rose coming to a stop and then continuing on. And that is when he gets on the phone with 911. We hear him talking to a dispatcher, saying that he feels unsafe stopping because the officers had him surrounded with guns, that he didn't know why they were attempting to stop him in the first place. Eventually, he does finally stop. He gets out of the car with his hands up. He's again surrounded. And we hear a state trooper not only giving him commands, but also to a different officer, an officer for the Circleville Police Department, telling him, hey, do not release that dog while Rose's hands are up. Despite those repeated warnings, and it's not clear here if that state trooper was heard, the officer, who we now know as Ryan Speakman, does release the dog. Watch. We do have Mitchell Christian, who is a canine expert, he's a certified police instructor who reviewed the video of that dog being sent out to Rose. And he told us what his thoughts were about that video with his professional eye. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCHELL CHRISTIAN, OWNER, CHRISTIAN K-9 ACADEMY:  So, with that there, in that position to deploy the dog, it's probably not a good decision to be made there because the guy was clearly on his knees, hands were up.
