      "sentences": "Well, the lying congressman is back. The question tonight is, for how long? Tonight, on LAURA COATES LIVE.You know, you've got to wonder what took them so long. The House Ethics Committee releasing a report shock full, and I mean shock full of evidence, that George Santos allegedly used campaign funds for his own personal profit, also alleging that he reported fake loans and kept it all going through a -- quote -- \"constant series of lies.\" Not mincing words, they say -- quote -- \"He blatantly stole from his campaign,\" -- unquote. And they brought the receipts. I mean, they literally brought the receipts. A $3,332.81 cent Airbnb listed as a hotel stay on an FEC report for July 7, 2022. A day's own campaign calendar listed Santos as off and spending the weekend in the Hamptons. A $1,400 at a spa that month charged to a campaign debit card and described as Botox and expense spreadsheets. A $1,500 bucks at another spa, also noted as Botox. I don't know about Botox. That's a whole lot for someone who allegedly was relaxing in the Hamptons. But there's more. You probably knew that there would be more, right? But this might surprise you. $4,127.80 at Hermes. Now, I can't afford it, so I'm going to call it Hermes, just for effect. There are also hotel bills, plane rides, taxi bills, casino charges, and get this, what's intriguingly described in the report as smaller purchases at OnlyFans and Sephora. Now, if you don't know a lot about OnlyFans, \"The New York Times\" described it as a platform where some participants charge money for explicit content. I'm just going leave it at that. A defiant George Santos calls the report biased, but what do you expect from the congressman who really lie his way into the job in the very first place? Telling one major whopper after another, lying even about graduating from college, lying about working on Wall Street. Who after saying that he was very proud of his Jewish heritage, claimed he didn't mean he was Jewish, he meant Jew-ish. Even lying about being a college volleyball star. Now, it would be funny if it weren't for real. And this wasn't a member of Congress. It could have an impact on your actual life. I mean, I guess it is kind of funny. But don't take my word for it. See what SNL thinks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which was in charge of opposition research on Santos, produced an 87-page report. Now, they missed a lot of stuff. I'm not going to defend that. But they also nailed a lot of important issues, too.But part of the problem here, Laura, is that, as your own CNN contributor has said, the media covers the marquee races, they don't cover the local elections, and they get lost in the process. And many journalists made a sincere effort but came back to us and said, we don't have the money or staff or time to do this kind of work. And part of the problem that journalists have and campaigns have is that the Federal Election Commission that should be charged with overseeing the financial reports that are being issued doesn't have the staff to do that type of investigative work. So that's the real frustration. But here's the bigger point. For a year now, Laura, the Republican majority in Congress has known the story on this guy. There's no mystery here. Yet for just a selfish manipulation of power, a desperation to hold on to their majority, they buried these stories. This ethics report wasn't written over the past couple of days. These facts have been known for a long time. But they held on to -- they covered up these facts. In fact, they were accomplices to his crimes by trying to cover up the situation and protect him. And now, they had to release it because of public pressure. But we're not there yet. Don't take for granted that he'll be expelled.

He has been called out for so many of these disputes and controversies. It doesn't seem like he cares or that there will be consequences for him.",

I think, you know, there are a lot of Jews who have very different positions from each other. We're a very broad community. But when you -- when you run into somebody who just starts talking about the Jews and blaming them for stuff as though there is some unified conspiracy, I mean, that's textbook antisemitism. That's what he was doing here. I think this felt to me like actually even in the span of Elon Musk outrages, like a real break and a real step for him, you know, in the path of like Henry Ford and Howard Hughes and, you know, American industrialists who wind up really in a very dark, strange place at the end of their lives.",

The lawsuit filed in federal district court in New York alleges years of sexual abuse, rape, as well as -- quote -- \"luring her into a drug-fueled lifestyle during their long romantic relationship.\"In a statement to CNN, Ventura says -- quote -- \"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story.\" She also says with the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching -- quote -- \"it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\" Lawyers for Combs released a statement to CNN vehemently denying these allegations, calling them offensive and outrageous. Here to discuss, Kierna Mayo, executive editor at \"One World Roc Lit.\" Kierna is also the former editor-in-chief of Ebony Magazine. Kierna, I'm so glad that you're with me today. I mean, I have been going through this complaint and the allegations that are contained in it are pretty stunning. I mean, you have helped women come forward against men who are very powerful in the music industry and beyond like R. Kelly, like Russell Simmons. Diddy is known as a mogul. So, from your experience, I mean, how difficult do you think it was for her to even come forward with these allegations? KIERNA MAYO, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROC LIT 101/ONE WORLD:  Oh, first, thank you always, Laura, for having me, except this evening is so unfortunate, you know. It had to be incredibly difficult. It's difficult for me just a couple of hours in just really grasping the degree of her allegations of abuse, but also just being reminded that there is often so much more than meets the eye when we're talking about even legendary men. You know, Sean, Puffy, Diddy, all the many names that he's known as, is an icon. He's a legend, literally a living legend within music culture, entertainment culture, certainly a Black culture. And it's a heartbreak for many people, I think, to imagine even for a fraction of what Cassie is alleging. But the truth is these rumors have been around for a very long time, very long time.",

But also, she claims that he exerted his power and influence -- that's a quote from her -- over her. I mean, he was a media mogul. When they would have met, she would have been an R&amp;B hopeful.

So, when you think about what she was actually up against and how singular -- you know, not many of us know what it's like to be partnered with someone who is at this level and has this much power, access, control. She was also his employee technically as an artist. So, you know, the ways in which he was unmatched -- the match up was not existent. She almost didn't exist if you look at who she is in comparison to who he is, especially at the time of their meeting. And so, there's a lot of heartbreak for me. I know all around the community, there's just a lot of heartbreak. Many of us are friends or friends of friends. Many of us came up in this business together, all hoping for the best and all aiming for the best. You know, Diddy -- [23:44:55]",

There are a lot of opinions that have been formed about this already. I mean, you can just -- everyone's phone was blowing up thinking about these allegations the minute it happened.But his attorneys, I want to say, his attorneys are accusing her of blackmail. They're adding -- quote -- \"For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship.\" So, she's being accused really of this being really a money grab.

And so, I think that's kind of keeping our eyes on the prize.When someone has been partnered again for over a decade with a person of this kind of immense wealth and power, there is a lot of money made, right? And that kind of intimate partner relationship, almost as if in a marriage when partners separate and one spouse says, hey, I'm entitled to so much of what you created during that time. You know, when she talks about darkness, I have to say that's the thing that feels most resonant to me just as a witness to that space and time in the entire entertainment industry. The 2000s became dark. The drugs. The violence of the 90s almost seeded itself to another kind of darkness where drugs and really this kind of rampant power grab that the men, quite frankly, in the business exerted almost on everyone was a dark time. So, you know, I'm not here to legislate. I'm certainly not an attorney. I have my own personal feelings. I really don't even plan on sharing those publicly. But I do think that there's a lot to be learned when women come forth, and we should listen and also read between the lines. And as I said, for so many of us, because the rumors have existed for so long, it's almost as if this testimony kind of aligns with the whispers. So, it's a deep time, I have to say. It's troubling to say the least. And I'm wishing the best for Cassie and for all of these women who are taking advantage of this very slim amount of time that's left. Just imagine, a year exists. For many women who have been abused in this kind of way that Cassie alleged, it takes a lifetime to come forth. Some women go to their graves with these kinds of stories. So, I think that there's an impetus because there is a window of time that says, hey, look, we will listen, and we may potentially validate your claims many, many years ago. I think that's a good enough reason for a woman to come forth. Whether or not Cassie feels she's entitled to money or not to blackmail him, I don't know.",
