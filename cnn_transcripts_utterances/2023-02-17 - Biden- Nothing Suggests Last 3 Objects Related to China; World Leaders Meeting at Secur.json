At least we've ended the week minus another way would balloon and President Biden aiming to discuss with President Xi and that of course would be a boon. And after the action on Wall Street, and well that's as you can see more like a lead balloon. U.S. features softer across the board Europe, pulling back to after a week a handover. During the Asia session, the major U.S. averages all down well over 1 percent. During Thursday's session on news that prices at the U.S. factory gate rose by an expected to a greater than expected amount last month. You can see the performance there in front of you the worst fears of investors might come to pass that maybe no Fed pivot - an end to the rate hikes this year if inflation stays high. We've even had two Fed Officials now raising the possibility of a larger half point hike. So that's 0.5 percent in the months ahead, the world heading into a period to have somber reflection as we approach one year since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. World leaders and military officials are in Munich, Germany today to discuss Ukraine's weaponry needs. As well as Europe's security future remember too, a longer war means fresh inflation uncertainty globally as well. We'll be live in Munich for you in just a few moments time. But first, some good news perhaps according to China and China is declaring a major and decisive victory over the latest wave of COVID-19. Claiming that despite scrapping restrictions late last year, it has the lowest COVID fatality rate in the world. But questions inside and outside the country remain as Kristie Lu Stout reports.",

Now in a meeting on Thursday presided over by the Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. Members of the Politburo Standing Committee also claimed to have kept the lowest COVID-19 fatality rate in the world. China's most powerful leadership party also said this \"With continuous efforts to optimize COVID- 19 prevention and control measures since November of 2022, China's COVID-19 response has made a smooth transition in a relatively short time, China has created a miracle in human history\". China has been accused by the World Health Organization and world leaders for underreporting the toll of the outbreak caused by the sudden easing of its pandemic policy. The country's official COVID-19 death toll was remarkably low given the rapid spread of the virus the relatively low vaccination booster rates among the elderly and given the widespread reports of overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums. This declaration comes just weeks before China is due to hold the National People's Congress its annual legislative session is Beijing looks to revive an economy hammered by three years of zero COVID restrictions.

Communications have certainly been stunted. There's certainly been a lot of back and forth.

And it is indeed closing, but we are still finding survivors. We are still seeing these miraculous videos of people being pulled from the rubble alive. And for the thousands of people waiting for news of their loved ones still beneath the rubble each and every rescue is a moment of hope. But of course, the situation in Southeast Turkey is dire to say the least. And the conditions for those survivors are hugely difficult. And there has been a real emphasis on providing humanitarian support as a matter of urgency to those survivors in Southeast Asia; we're talking about freezing conditions. These are thousands of people, families, children, made homeless by the earthquake with absolutely nothing left of their former lives. And we're already beginning to see some people including families being evacuated to other parts of the country, including here in Istanbul, where we've had the chance to meet with some of those families. And of course, they've described this evacuation process as a lifeline for them, but the emotional trauma, the memories of the earthquake is something that is difficult really to deal with to cope with. And we met with one family, a Syrian family who spoke of the fact that this is not the first time they've been displaced, not the first time they've been made homeless because they've had to live through war in Syria and have been made homeless time and time again. So this is a hugely difficult period for families in Southeast Turkey and indeed families in Northwest Syria. But we have seen an outpouring of support the United Nations now appealing for $1 billion in aid for those families impacted. We've already seen the United Nations calling for nearly $400 million in international aid as well. The World Health Organization also calling for further funding and saying they are offering support when it comes to providing medical care and urgent medical assistance as well as providing medication for those impacted. But of course, there is still a long way to go a huge challenge ahead for the Turkish Government in order to provide that support.",

In a matter of weeks, people will be alerted, you know, from where they bought their Tesla and that will be done that software patch will be done. They won't need to bring the car anywhere. And so that's why I think Elon Musk is quibbling with the actual word recall. What the government is saying here is this is a potentially unsafe situation.

You could see remnants of people's personal effects, dressers mirrors, life that basically stopped at 4.20 on that, that Monday morning. And it's you know, the scenes in the city when I was there were lots and lots of families that were in parks, people were standing and looking at buildings somewhere waiting to see whether or not their loved ones would be found. And others wondering what they were going to do next. And shelter needs, obviously the highest priority, but also clean water a place to sleep safely. And thinking about what comes next for them, particularly those that had serious damage done to their homes, many of them losing their homes.

It's funny, I saw some of the German data and they recorded, Ithink, 1.1 million arrivals from Ukraine last year. And the vast majority of those have stayed. And I just wonder for the money that you're saying look needs to be allocated to help those nations that are dealing with displaced Ukrainians. To what extent now does that money go to sort of further integrating them into these societies on a longer term basis? I mean, we're talking about the one year point in this war, do you make any distinction between those that perhaps still want to go home versus those that have to accept, and it could be some time?",

Now, during these cold winter months, there's been a bit of a pause and a slowdown in the number of people coming back to Ukraine even to be reunited with family. Once spring comes the temperatures are a little bit warmer, the damage that has been inflicted on the energy infrastructure, the electricity issues and other energy issues inside the country, hopefully alleviate a bit, then you may start to see some movements, including movements of people going back. Our priority right now is really inside Ukraine to try to address the needs of what has been, you know, a third of the population uprooted. Now many of them have in fact, crossed to other parts of Europe, about 8 million, but there is a large number of internally displaced people 6 million to be exact, but there are a number that haven't been displaced, where their needs are also acute. And so the UN as you mentioned, put out an appeal this week for the needs both for refugees outside of Ukraine, but also for the internally displaced in the conflict affected inside the country. Everything from shelter to protection to cash and other relief items that family's need in order to weather this terrible, terrible winter and war.",

U.S. startup Pyka is looking to redefine aviation with industrial unmanned electric airplanes. The company has already had success with its agricultural plane called Pelican Spray. The fully autonomous aircraft was built for low impact crop dusting. Last year it received regulatory approval in Costa Rica. Now Pyka has set its sights on expanding its fleet with the Pelican cargo. The fully electric plane has a range of up to 200 miles and a payload of up to 400 pounds or 180 kilos. Like its predecessor, it's controlled remotely making it the first autonomous vehicle of its class. The company says it's already secured pre- commitments of over 80 orders for the new plane. And joining me now is Michael Norcia; he's Co-Founder and CEO of Pyka, Michael, great to have you with us. MICHAEL NORCIA, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, PYKA: Thank you so much.",
