Without a doubt, that is a major question that we will be asking and looking to get answers to. And I do think that there are several indications that this was obviously a very significant strike. Netanyahu apparently rushed out of a meeting as we saw reports of a strike in Beirut. Admiral Hagari coming out very quickly on television to talk about it. So there is clearly something very significant about this strike, whether it is just the fact that it is this central headquarters in a densely populated area or something else. We will find out soon. Jeremy Diamond, live for us in Haifa. Thank you so much. Let's get some perspective from former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., John Bolton, who's also served as the national security advisor under President Donald Trump. Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. You're the perfect person to talk to on this specific issue because you played an integral role in the ceasefire that was ultimately laid out in 2006, that brought an end to the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah. As your ambassador to the United Nations, we're seeing reports of the United States and France, once again, proposing a ceasefire outline for the Israelis. No word yet on whether Israel is ready to accept this. Now, you have the reporting of this massive explosion said to be at the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Your reaction and the possibility as to who perhaps this target was. JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, I think the resolution we negotiated in 2006, Security Council Resolution 1701, was not implemented. That was designed to prevent the resupply of Hezbollah and give the government of Lebanon real control over the country. That obviously didn't happen. And it says something about what it's like to go through that kind of negotiation and find 10 or 15 years later that it meant essentially absolutely nothing. I think it's certainly the conversation in Israel right now is that this was an effort to destroy the top command and control of Hezbollah's military capabilities. And that Hassan Nasrallah was in fact the target. Now, whether he's met his maker or not, we don't know. But I think that this is -- this is the inevitable consequence of Iran unleashing the ring of fire strategy against Israel back on October the 7th. The only surprise that it's taken this long to get to this point.",

I certainly wouldn't be interested in defending Hezbollah, particularly after what they've done in many instances around the region. But the fact of the matter is that the United States has been calling on the Israelis to de-escalate over the past six -- actually 6 to 12 months. The Israelis have sent messages saying, yes, we will. And then they crossed that line. And even in the past couple of days, as you and your viewers will know, the United States and France announced the ceasefire proposal just for Lebanon. They weren't even talking about Gaza. And Netanyahu's government said that they were supportive of it and then changed their minds almost in mid-flight. I don't think that this is a two sides situation. If you're talking about the number of strikes that have gone across the border, then multitudes more have come from the Israeli side into Lebanon. It's not comparable to the other side. I do think that we have to move towards de-escalation here and de- escalation particularly when it comes to the use of this sort of weaponry.

So I do think that the framing here is very important. We have destroyed Gaza. We have Beirut being bombed with huge tolls for civilian casualties.

So whether that strike was in fact successful or not, today, will prove to be an inflection point in this brewing Israel-Lebanon conflict. No doubt, whether he's dead or not, whether Nasrallah is dead or not, this conflict just crossed the threshold of an all-out war, which is something that all of us who've been watching this now for over 11 months have been waiting for, wondering whether that moment would come or not. When you target with over 10 bunker buster, 2,000 pound bombs, a residential area in Beirut that flattens at least two high -- sorry, six high-rise residential building, you're going to have a significant casualty and civilian death rate, irrespective of whether you succeeded in killing Nasrallah or not.
