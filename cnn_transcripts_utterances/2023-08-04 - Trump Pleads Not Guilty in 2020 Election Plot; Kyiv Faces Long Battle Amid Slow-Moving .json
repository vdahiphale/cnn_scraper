      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us here for CNN.And at his third arraignment, Donald Trump officially pleaded not guilty to four felony counts, alleging he plotted to steal the U.S. presidency. And this is the case which many experts say is the biggest legal threat the former president is facing. After that appearance, Trump returned to his golf resort in New Jersey and, in the coming hours, will hold a campaign rally in Alabama, then another rally on Saturday in South Carolina. At the end of the month comes another hearing, when the judge is expected to set a trial date. While prosecutors are pushing to move quickly, Trump's legal team seems uninterested in their client's right to a speedy trial. They're trying to delay the trial until after next year's presidential election. Trump was released without any real conditions, but he did receive a reminder not to commit a crime and not to tamper with any witnesses. The judge also addressed him as \"Mr. Trump,\" not \"Mr. President,\" which according to sources, was the reason why he left in a sour and dejected mood. The former president spoke briefly to reporters at the airport before boarding his plane. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The judge who will oversee this case through a possible trial, giving the government just seven days to tell her when they're going to be ready to take this case before a jury and how long that jury trial could take. Now, defense attorneys are supposed to give her the same information just a week later so that she can possibly set a trial date at the next hearing, which is in August 28th. That is a pretty quick turnaround for these kinds of decisions, suggesting that the judge would like to move this along quickly. Now it is unclear at this point if this case will really go to trial before the 2024 election. One of the big outstanding questions that could really impact a possible schedule is that the special counsel intends to add additional charges or additional codefendants. We know from our reporting they will continue to interview witnesses over the next several weeks, suggesting that there could be additional charges, which could impact that timeline.

And while it now will fall to juries -- and I think this District of Columbia case is going to go before a jury first and fast -- it'll be up to the juries to decide his guilt. There is an incredible amount of evidence. I wrote a model prosecution memo -- bipartisan, Republican and Democratic legal experts -- where we concluded that on this case for the 2020 election interference, there's more than enough proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump engaged in multiple conspiracies, because he didn't want to recognize that he had lost the election. He wanted to deprive the 81 million Americans who had voted for his opponent, who won, of their vote. And Special Counsel Jack Smith has laid out a tremendous amount of evidence in his 45-page charging document. The same with Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg on his 34 charges. Also for election interference for fabricating documents the cover-up hush-money payments to avoid a damaging scandal in 2016. And then you have the Mar-a-Lago documents case, another 34 charges.

But there's also requirement to secure the area. In other words, get the Russian troops out of there, because as long as there are Russian forces inside those two oblasts -- Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblast in the South -- it will cause problems. It will take a long time. Many of us who understand the complexities of combined armed warfare have said for a very long time that it will take much longer than anticipated. You know, the Ukrainians went into this, a lot of people thought they were ten feet tall, much like we thought Russians were at the beginning of the conflict. But when you're on the offensive, over a long stretch of frontlines with a lot of territory to recover, using new equipment, doing something that you've never done before against an enemy that's dug in with mines and wire and trenches, it's extremely difficult.

It's going to be costly, and yes the Russians have to defend along that entire line. The Ukrainians can attack in a few places. And then once they find weak spots in the Russian lines, they can push.

They just don't do it. I've had past experience, too.But when you're talking about minefields, first of all, Russia has -- as you said, have the capabilities to lay a lot of mines. But what we're seeing now, that the Ukrainians are reporting, is not unexpected. They're putting dead bodies over the top of mines, even some mines have hand grenades underneath them. So when the Ukrainian forces trying to de-mine an area, they pick up the anti-tank mine, and there's a grenade underneath it. And you know, every military has experience with that. When we were in Iraq, and when my forces were in Iraq, we had insurgent forces planting explosive devices inside of dead animals, putting them on the side of the road. Putting them inside of houses, house-born explosives so much soldiers when they would explode, or when civilians would go in, they would explode. This is the kind of approach that truly barbaric armies use. And again, if it can be proven, it is a war crime, because they are indiscriminate attacks that could potentially hurt civilians.
