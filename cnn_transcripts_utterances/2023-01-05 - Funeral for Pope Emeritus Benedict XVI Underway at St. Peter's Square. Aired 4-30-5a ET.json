Anyone watching cable TV, you have fodder for all sorts of that. Sometimes it makes the Game of Thrones blush.I think that Benedict was very much in the line. Sometimes I think that he was the right Pope for the wrong time. He was very much in line with those Popes following the protestant and Catholic reformation. So, talk about 1600s to about 1900s when we had Popes who presided, Popes who were professors. And this was very much a professor Pope. He reminded me, in fact, of another Benedict, Benedict XIV who lived in the 1700s who basically wrote the book on canonization.
