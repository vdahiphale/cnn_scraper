Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defiant response to President Biden's threat to withhold weapons if Rafah is attacked. A contentious cross-examination. Stormy Daniels testimony wrapping up at Trump's hush money trial in New York. Baidu blunder. The Chinese search giant's PR chief reportedly leaving the firm following social media posts lambasting their workers. And defeating deepfakes. TikTok and Adobe teaming up to tag A.I.-generated content. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. That's right. That's the firm message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Israeli people. And the Israeli military says it has enough weapons to invade Rafah. It follows Wednesday's warning from U.S. President Joe Biden that he will halt certain weapons shipments if Israel targets Rafah's population centers. The threat to withhold military aid has sparked backlash from some on Capitol Hill. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says he hopes that the president was having a \"senior moment.\" And Democratic Senator John Fetterman says he doesn't agree with the president's decision either. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  It demonstrates to Hamas that they're winning the PR war and things. And also, the president cares about the casualties, innocents in Gaza and Hamas doesn't. And that's part of the plan. So, they are exploiting compassion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have a very different perspective on this situation. The White House has said that they believe that the operation or the sort of limited operation that has already been taking place on the edge of Eastern Rafah has played into Hamas's hands, has strengthened it. So, everybody has a different perspective on all of this. The White House is still holding out some hope. We heard from National Security Spokesperson John Kirby earlier who said that he believes with some moral courage and moral leadership that it would still be possible to close the gaps between the two sides. But at this stage, those gaps are significant. And as I said before, no sense that Israel is willing to hit the brakes in terms of continuing with operations in Rafah, Julia.",

Now, day 14 of Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York ended with the former president attacking the integrity of the presiding judge yet again. Trump called Judge Merchan corrupt and conflicted after he denied the defense's latest motion for a mistrial. It comes after a second day of testimony from the adult film star Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the case. The defense repeatedly attacking her credibility and claims about the former president. Kara Scannell has more on the day's events. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Back on the stand, Stormy Daniels, the adult film star at the center of Former President Donald Trump's hush money case. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think you'll see some very revealing things today. SCANNELL (voice-over):  Trump's lawyer, Susan Necklace, spent over two hours attacking Daniels' credibility during Thursday morning's cross- examination. Necklace pointed to Daniels' history of making pornographic films, saying, you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear to be real. Daniels responded, wow, that's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room, referring to her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies. Daniels previously testified that the night of their alleged affair she felt faint while she saw Trump posing on the bed in his T-shirt and boxers. Necklace questioned why that scene would be so upsetting since she appeared in about 150 sex films. Daniels testified it was because she was not expecting a man twice her age to be naked. Necklace argued Daniels gained publicity from her story and media appearances, like her interview on \"60 Minutes.\"",

Duncan, great to have you with us. What was accomplished, net, prosecution, minus defense in the six hours and 10 minutes of testimony that Stormy Daniels gave? DUNCAN LEVIN, MANAGING PARTNER AND CRIMINAL ATTORNEY, LEVIN &amp; ASSOCIATES AND FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Well, in a way, Stormy Daniels is a witness that the district attorney's office did not need to call because they are -- have already established a lot of the elements of the crime. Maybe all of the elements of the crime. They've established that there were false business records and the Trump caused them to be filed in the books and records of his company. They've established this intent to commit a fraud on the voters, and they've established this criminal conspiracy between David Pecker, the National Enquirer, Michael Cohen, and Donald Trump to violate the nation's campaign finance laws by giving this hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. They didn't really need to call her. The reason that she was called was to lay out for the jury exactly what the story was that Trump was so afraid of coming out right before the 2016 election, right? After the Access Hollywood tape that almost sank his campaign. His campaign got word that two women, Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, were out there trying to sell their stories. That all came out last week in the testimony of Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels lawyer. And at that point, there was a feverish attempt by the Trump campaign to try to buy off Stormy Daniels with a $130,000 payment. What happened over the last few days is that Stormy Daniels, for the first time, told the story in her own words, and the story was sorted and it really was the kind of thing that was put out there so that the jury could determine here is what Trump was trying to cover up. It was made it very visceral. And I think in attacking her over the last few hours today, the Trump defense really made a huge unforced error because they were reinforcing what came out on direct examination, this -- all this notion that Trump was a predator, that he was sitting there in his hotel suite in his boxers and his pajamas looking like Hugh Hefner, that Stormy Daniels was shaking as she was putting on her gold heel shoes. That she felt faint. All of these things that came out in the direct examination really were reinforced in this direct. And so, I think they didn't score any points with the jury on cross. And the prosecution, who took a risk in calling a witness with a lot of baggage, that risk paid off today.",

I guess to your point, if she's not directly related to the falsification of documents and the charges he faces and more to do with his character, perhaps, and that's what we saw over the last two days, has the prosecution done enough to provide evidence of the charges that the former president faces?

So, whereas she's not a necessary witness to prove intent, she did in spades when that came out, her story was so terrible and now, you understand why his intent was to conceal it.

These chips are implanted in the part of the brain that controls the intention to move. So, in the weeks after this initial surgery, which happened in January, we saw even a video of this first human trial subject, Noland Arbaugh, who has been quadriplegic since 2016, we saw a video of him controlling a computer mouse, playing chess on a computer with his brain. So, pretty remarkable stuff. We don't know just how significant of a setback this is. And again, we don't know how or why exactly this happened. Although, the company did say that it was able to increase the performance of this device in order to make it make it work a little better after these threads retracted. It's not clear whether they're going to be able to go in and fix this problem entirely, but they did say that it affected the data processing speeds and ultimately, the effectiveness of this device. Now, obviously this is not an ideal situation for this first human trial subject, although this is still a test. And the company had said that the whole point of this human trial was to study the effectiveness of this device. So, hopefully, they are getting some information, some data about this that potentially they can fix in the future, because Neuralink has said that it's looking to enroll more human trial subjects this year and into the coming years.

I mean, right now, young people in China are very concerned about the economy, but they're also concerned about their wellbeing. They don't like this rat race. They don't like this competitive work environment. It just does not suit well with them. It's something that we have seen on social media. And then, we have this executive or perhaps former executive from such a prominent company as Baidu, which, as you well know, is kind of the equivalent of Google here in China. When she makes remarks saying, you know, you have to be so dedicated, work so hard that you may forget your elder son's birthday or her frustration that she has to take family issues of her employees into account saying that she's not a mother-in-law, all of that creates a lot of strife among young people. So, despite what corporate China may want to see, I think the point you raise is a valid one. The delivery is so important.

And the way you do that is through a young and innovative workforce. So, perhaps this is going to cause some internal reflection. I mean, as we saw, so many young people are not really caring about how they look in the workplace, how they dress in the workplace. They're taking to social media. It's a very real movement.

Even when they know it's fake, their brain changes. We don't understand why, but it does. And it goes to your, to your point about lack of trust. And I'm already there. I -- very little now that I assume is real, it's the opposite, which perhaps is a good thing. Everybody should be using this. Dana, I mean, I use TikTok as the example because they stepped forward and said, look, we're going to adopt this. How difficult is it for any of the tech giants to be doing this, particularly given we've got, what, half the world going to elections this year, to the polls?

So, there's a whole bunch of companies who've joined together to try to create this technology. It's open source. It's open standard. It's easy to implement. And in the initiative itself that's creating this technology is over 3,000 members now. So, really, we need to get the implementations out there. And so, we were thrilled that TikTok announced today that they're actually implementing Content Credentials. And you can see it today, if a person wants to say, hey, authentically and transparently, I'm using A.I. to create an image, it's going to show up right there on TikTok as being labeled. Any and anyone who has a Content Credential, whether you're a Sony camera or if OpenAI, who's also announced that they're going to add Content Credentials to all their images, if all that shows up on TikTok, TikTok now will be able to show you that that was an A.I.-generated image.

But then we've got the big ones, Google, Microsoft, Sony, they're also exploring it. Would you agree, Dana, that we've seen some of these big tech companies falling over themselves to embed and provide tools to their users that allowed generative A.I. use? But I just feel like the safeguards that you've tried to pull a council together and getting these tech giants to adopt has been slower than their efforts to utilize these tools. Would you agree?",

As you've said, they've broken the record for remaining undefeated across three competitions for 49 games. The old record was set up by a Portuguese couple (ph) of Benfica in the '60s.

And just to run you through what they've got left, Julia, they play the Italian club Atalanta in the Europa League final on May 22.
