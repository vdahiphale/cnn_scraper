Maine Superior Court now has 20 days to weigh in on whether or not Trump should be removed from the ballot in that state.And if that decision ultimately is appealed again on January 17, after the Superior Court makes its ruling, it will then go to Maine's Supreme Court, which will have until January 31st to make its decision. Now, in a vacuum, right, this would dictate what the final decision of whether or not Trump will appear on Maine's ballot, but as we know, this process, this 14th Amendment argument process, has been very messy. And we are still waiting for Donald Trump to appeal the ruling in Colorado that would essentially supersede the Maine decision. It would because it's going to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court will ultimately have the final say on this issue if it decides to take up the case. And honestly, if Trump does finally appeal that -- or that decision in Colorado, But in Maine, it's really interesting, because we do get a glimpse into some of not just the legal arguments that Trump is making but also, it's a hybrid of the political arguments he's making. He's been railing on Maine's secretary of state as being biassed against him, saying that she is a liberal and that this is all, you know, a political witch hunt against him. The filing last night reflects some of that undertone. And it also accuses, essentially, the process itself of being tainted by bias itself. Now, we're going to have to wait and see what ultimately happens with the Supreme Court, but as we are waiting, we see multiple other states that are also trying to figure out this issue for themselves. Oregon has pushed back its deadline to make a decision on whether or not Trump should be removed from the ballot in that state. It wants more information from both sides that have filed a legal challenge there. So a lot of moving pieces, but we do finally have an appeal in Maine.

First, he says, well, I did not engage in insurrection. It's just one line, but I think he feels duty-bound to deny it. But then, really, what he does is focus on the procedural side. And I think that's where this is going to be decided. First, he says it's up to Congress, not the states, to tell us how the 14th Amendment works. Congress has not done that, other than passing the criminal law. Hence, the states are out of business. But then he says, Well, even if it is up to the states, Maine did not follow its own procedures. The secretary of state was biased against me, et cetera. Then he goes on to say, Well, even if they did properly follow their own procedures, that didn't give me enough due process. They had this one-day hearing. There was only one witness. It was a law professor. It doesn't comport even with minimum due process protections.
