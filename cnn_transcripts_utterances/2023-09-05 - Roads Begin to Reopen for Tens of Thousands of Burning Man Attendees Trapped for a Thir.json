So we call that loam right, and water, as it rains, easily absorbs into that loam or that earthy top soil. But when you`re talking about rain, that continuously falls within the desert, it doesn`t take much to start pooling up and then mixing in with that clay, creating that very muddy cement like mixture that ultimately costs so many thousands of people to get stuck and stranded in the desert of Nevada. I mean, just take a look at some of these visuals, the -- aerial visuals really speak for themselves. I mean, look at these cars, you can see the muddy tracks and you can see completely abandoned vehicles because they simply cannot drive. It is too thick. It is too difficult to navigate that type of cement, like mixture that is a combination of the water, not absorbing back into the ground. We call that in impermeable surface and the simply the amount of rain that fell in such a short period of time. Here`s the radar. And, you can see there are no flood watches in effect for the BlackRock basin. This is known as a playa. In fact, we`re going to dry things out rather quickly here over the next 24 hours. So as soon as we get the sun to rise this morning, we`ll get that typical evaporation that would happen within this playa that you see, just north of empire, that shading of white, that is a dry basin across the desert. And, it normally evaporates the water when we get that break in the rain, but that simply didn`t happen because the rain continuously fell over the same areas for a period of time on Friday and Saturday.

Troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, or thermosphere? Thermospherians, put your hands up. This layer extending from about 53 to 375 miles above Earth is home to the ISS. Outside of this past weekend`s college football season openers, on Monday, we had a different type of touchdown -- four astronauts returning from space. After a six-month stay on the International Space Station, members of the crew six mission aboard the SpaceX crew dragon capsule actually made splashdown when they landed off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. The astronaut`s mission was run as a joint operation between NASA and SpaceX and they were coming in hot. Literally, the spacecraft traveled at a speed of more than 17,000 miles per hour on its way back to earth and the exterior of the capsule heated to about 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. I`m sorry, what, wouldn`t I be burning up inside? Good question. Yes, the crew was protected at a comfortable temperature. Well, below 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Next up, a project that I am pumped to share with you. This Friday, at 9:00 Eastern on CNN, I have an hour-long documentary coming out. It`s on \"THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER\" and it`s called \"Hard Hits: Can Football Be Safe?\" I played nine years in the NFL. I have a titanium plate and four screws in my neck, so I know how dangerous the game can be, but I was blown away learning about the technology and innovation being used to make the game safer now and for future generations. Could advancements in the game one day help keep players safer by predicting injuries before they happen? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
