Phoenix hasn't dropped below 110 degrees in two weeks, and the nights offer little relief.Cooling centers are a form of refuge but burn centers say they're seeing more patients who have been injured by the sizzling concrete. With me now is Regina Romero. She's the mayor of Tucson. Mayor, thanks for being with us. We know the city opened cooling centers in early June. At the time, the plan was to open them for four hours a day seven days a week. But then this week, Tucson set a record for the city's longest excessive heat warning. So my question is, what is the city doing in addition to protect residents? MAYOR REGINA ROMERO (D-TUCSON, AZ): Well, thank you for having me, Rahel. Tucson and Phoenix are two of the fastest warming cities in this country. And extreme heat is one of the deadliest weather-related hazards in the nation. So a lot of people think flooding or tornadoes, but heat is the silent killer. So I ran -- this is my first term as mayor. When I ran, part of my platform, it was to act fast and boldly on climate change and climate adaptation in the city of Tucson. We passed a climate action and implementation plan in record time, focused on the most vulnerable communities in our city. Because the effects of climate change, the front line to those effects of climate change are seniors on limited incomes, children, low-income communities and those people that work outside. So here in the city of Tucson, we're already implementing climate resiliency strategies. One of the most important pieces of investments that we can do, besides the cooling centers, which is immediate action, but in order to be able to act on climate change, 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation. So the city of Tucson, thanks to the Biden administration in the Inflation Reduction Act, we've invested $48.9 million, almost $50 million to completely change our diesel buses from our transit system to either electric buses or CNG low-emission buses. So we're doing that. We're creating cooling centers, and basically providing this service. And -- connecting with nonprofit organizations to help our unsheltered residents as well. We're doing -- (CROSSTALK)",

The most vulnerable folks in Tucson are the ones that are the front line.So the cooling centers, we partnered with our transit system to pick up our seniors, if they call us, and take them to the cooling centers, to senior centers where there's activities they can do all day long. With children, we have a summer program where children can be taken from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. to stay in a cool place in partnerships with our schools. But also, long term, we are planting -- my goal is to plant one million trees by 2030. And that is a nature-based solution to the heat-island effect that we feel in urban centers like Tucson and Phoenix.",

The numbers aren't going up just because victims may feel comfortable reporting it either.That's not a silver lining here. It's actually that fewer people are opting to report as incidents are going up. Why do you think this is happening? Why is this so hard for the military to figure out? CHRISTENSEN: That's an excellent point. And 36,000 men and women are sexually assaulted by the military's estimates last year. That's a record high. That's despite billions of dollars being spent, years of promises. And one of the reasons is there's been a culture of denial and a culture of disbelief in the military that this is a problem. So even though their data shows there is a systemic rot within the military when it comes to sexual assault, the leadership really hasn't committed to tackling the issue. And so while we see sexual assault numbers go up, we're seeing prosecutions going down, we're seeing convictions going down. So while we have a record high of sexual assaults, we see sexual assault prosecutions drop by over half.",

A Henry County police officer got quite a surprise when he pulled over a speeding vehicle. While on patrol, he caught the Dodge Charger going over 96 miles per hour in a 35-mile- per-hour zone. When the officer approached the Charger, he quickly recognized the person behind the wheel as Henry County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Michael Yarborough. A spokesperson for the sheriff's office confirmed to CNN that, yes, Yarborough was on duty at the time of the incident but was not driving with his lights or sirens on. Also, the four indigenous children that were found in the Amazon after 40 days, they have now been released from the hospital. The children, ages between 1 and 13, were found last month in the Amazon Rain Forest following an aircraft that killed their mother and the pilot. They have been receiving treatment at a Colombian military hospital since they were found on June 9th. And finally, a 79-year-old man was hospitalized early Thursday morning after being attacked by a nearly seven-foot alligator. This happened at a golf course community in Naples, Florida. Take a look at this thing. The man told deputies he was on a walk in a golf course community where he lives when an alligator came up and bit him in the leg. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, often we do hear of scar tissue occurring after surgeries for some patients that might need additional surgeries to have the scar tissue removed.
