A lot of them spent months trying to get to the U.S. and were in South Texas. They were placed on this bus. It was a 23-hour bus ride from south Texas to California. And some of the immigration advocates saying they did not receive any food or any water on this journey. But it is important to point out that Governor Greg Abbott says that a lot of these small border towns are essentially overwhelmed. So that's why he's saying he's busing these migrants to places like Los Angeles and even blaming the President for essentially saying that he is just not securing the border. Though, the people here in Los Angeles saying that they were prepared. They were ready for these migrants. They say they were not surprised. They had about 24 hours heads up. But they say they've been preparing for months, knowing that this was a possibility, bringing these migrants to an area like Los Angeles. Here's what some of these advocates are saying.

These are not human embryos. Let me repeat this. These are not human embryos. They are synthetic models that are very similar to human embryos, but they're not actually human embryos.So, what they did try was they tried putting embryos into monkeys, embryos made in the same way into monkeys, and it did not work to start a pregnancy. So in other words, it wasn't quite the same thing. What they're hoping to do with these embryos, Brianna, or the actually, I'm correcting myself, what they're going to do with these synthetic embryo models is use them to research. For example, why do some embryos miscarry? Why are there genetic diseases? There's lots of really interesting scientific research they can do with these embryos, and they've created an image of them. It's very interesting when you look at the blue cells, those cells would go on, if this were a real embryo, to become bodily tissue, it would become blood cells, it would become muscles. The red cells would go on to become the amniotic sac. Brianna. KEILAR: Very interesting. All right, to repeat, not actual embryos. Elizabeth Cohen. Thank you for that. Boris.",

But you can see those are some of the companies that were hit already. Shell, British Airways, the BBC and the states of Minnesota and Illinois.
