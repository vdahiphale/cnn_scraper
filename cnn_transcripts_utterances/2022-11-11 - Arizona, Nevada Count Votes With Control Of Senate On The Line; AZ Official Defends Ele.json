We do have a new CNN projection to bring you.In Maryland, the Democrat David Trone had defeated Neil Parrott, the Republican there. It is a democratic hold.

So these are called races. Republicans have 211, now Democrats with this Maryland projection have 199. We still have the several seats, more than 20 seats uncalled here.But I want to go into the sixth congressional district here in Maryland. It's up here in the northwest corner of the state. You see David Trone with a 1,895 vote lead. We estimate about 93 percent of the vote is in. But why are we able to make this projection? Well, because Frederick, Maryland, a more Republican area of this district, gave their votes and actually the Republican, Parrott, was able to narrow the gap a little bit with Trone but not enough. And this is a district that Joe Biden won by 10 percentage points just two years ago and so we're able to project that the Democrats are going to hold this incumbent David Trone returning to the United States Congress. Again, that gets Democrats now to 199.",

We've been releasing around 60,000, 70,000 votes an evening. We should be reporting on a similar amount this evening. And of that amount, a little bit more than a majority of it will be mail-in ballots, early ballots that were dropped off on Election Day.In addition to that, we anticipate that we may also be reporting some of those box three votes from Election Day. So those were people who came on Election Day to vote in person and the tabulator wouldn't read their ballot, so we put it into the secure box three.

And 290,000 people dropped off their mail-in ballot on Election Day, broke the previous record for Election Day by 70 percent.So when you have these 290,000 ballots, they come in here to central count, arrived on Wednesday. So they didn't even arrive until the day after Election Day. And then we have to go through with each and every one of those and signature verify them or in other words, confirm that the signature on the outside of the ballot envelope is the same as the signature that that voter has on record on their voter registration record. So that takes time and we got to get that right, because we want to make sure that the people who say they're voting are actually the ones who voted.

But setting that aside, our job here in Maricopa County is to follow the laws and to administer this in a safe and secure way.If the state legislature wants to change the rules and say that people shouldn't be able to drop off their mail-in ballot on Election Day, they can do that. We will respect that. I just really don't have a strong feeling one way or the other on it. Just set the rules and we're going to follow them.

This is according to the registrar's office. They believe that they can finish counting about 50,000 ballots tomorrow. Now, these include drop box ballots from Election Day and mail-in ballots. There's another tranche of ballots that need to be cured. The total of those is 9,659. The deadline for that is Monday.

And the narrative that the Russian Ministry of Defense is putting out that they were able to get out 30,000 troops in good order safely and they're able to get out all their military equipment, 5,000 pieces of military equipment, they said, without loss just an utter fabrication.We were there. We were in some of the territories that were liberated over the past day or so. We were in a town where we were speaking to residents and literally still in that euphoric moment of just having had their town liberated. Outside of the town, there was plenty of evidence of Russian military equipment, not making it back east of the Dnipro River, safely, as the Russian military has said. And I think this gives us an understanding of what President Putin is trying to do in misleading as population. He's trying to play a failure and retreat as a strategic smart move that this is success. In other words, he's saved so many troops. For the people we've talked to today, this is the end of the horrors of Russian occupation and some of the stories we heard today from those people just liberated were quite chilling. A young girl, 15-year-old girl, told us that she had been taken away by Russian troops in the past few days, had a hood put over a head, taken to the basement of a building, threatened with having her fingers cut off if she didn't tell them where Ukrainian troops were. And she said - she thought she was going to be raped, she was absolutely terrified by it. And we spoke to an old pensioner, a lady who must have been in her early 80s, perhaps, and she told us Russian troops had threatened to kill her threatened, she said - they said to her to smash her brains out. So there's this euphoria, but on the other hand, people are really reliving now in this moment of freedom, reliving the horrors that they've just been forced to go through.",
