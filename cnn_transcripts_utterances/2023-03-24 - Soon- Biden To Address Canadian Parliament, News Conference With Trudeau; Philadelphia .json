It's gotten stronger in the face of challenges with China, Russia, trade and immigration. Already the trip has resulted in Canada making a significant concession on a thorny migration issue, agreeing to restrict certain migrants who are seeking asylum. CNN's Paula Newton is an Ottawa for us. So what kind of message are we going to be hearing from the president next hour?",

This is going back to whether it's Kennedy or Reagan or Clinton or Obama.He will be addressing parliament and, again, underscoring what everyone already knows. These are two of the closest relationships that you will find anywhere on the planet in terms of diplomatic relationships, shared values. All those things that bind these two countries together towards, one of the really most undefended and militarized borders in the world. Having said that, he will, the president, underscore the fact that the geopolitical landscape has changed. And Brianna, there is no escaping that, in the last couple of years, things have changed significantly in that context. And perhaps not, Brianna in the speech to parliament, but in the press conference, we will hear that the United States has asked Canada to step up to spend more in areas of things like defense spending, and that Canada has agreed to. They still may disagree on some points of interest. But again, this is part of the United States saying look, allies, you all need to step up. Things have changed significantly. And perhaps consequentially, Brianna, this is one of the most, you know, important times, arguably, since 9/11 in terms of the United States getting allies to, you know, stand behind them, but also step up in terms of those defense commitments.",

So you're dealing right up to the Arctic and going down to Mexico.And in terms of what's going on in humanitarian issues, one of them has to do with that humanitarian crisis on the southern border. Now look, the numbers in terms of whatever is going on, on our northern border here, they pale in comparison. And yet, the United States said that, look, if you want us to be able to have a more hardened border on that northern end, you've got to come to the table with something. Canada has now apparently agreed to take in migrants that would normally be sent back to the United States. They will now take them in. And that will change things along that northern border. I want you to listen now to me speaking to Justin Trudeau yesterday about the deal that's now in the works. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Masked gunmen spraying dozens of bullets at three teenagers, a 16 year old and two 13-year-olds today. Two of those victims are in critical condition. And police are searching for the shooters here. Let's talk about this with CNN's senior law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe. He's a former deputy director of the FBI. So, Andy, we're looking at this. We see the faces of the gunmen are covered, but the video is very clear here. How optimistic are you that the shooters may actually be identified?",

But the statistic that really jumps out at me, Brianna, is they've had about 350 shootings in Philadelphia just in this year, 74 of which have been fatal. If you look at where the shootings are taking place, this block, this small neighborhood in western Philadelphia is not - does not appear to be at the heart of most of the shooting activity. But obviously, they have a really serious situation in greater Philadelphia with gun activity that is leading to shootings and fatal shootings.",

So in the short term, the way to reduce the sort of criminal activity on the streets is to flood the zone with police presence.Now that means drawing resources away from other areas. But those you look at that heat map. You try to figure out where these shootings are taking place, and you just up the number of police on the street. Longer term. The strategy is doing better enforcement in terms of on the prosecution side and putting people away for gun offenses. If perpetrators know that they are facing a significant sentence if they commit a crime with a gun, they are less likely to carry guns. If they're less likely to carry them, they're less likely to get into these spontaneous shootings or planned shootings for that matter. So short term, more cops on the street. Longer term, you've got to do a better job about prosecuting people for being involved in gun felonies.",

The Justice Department is claiming or is arguing that Mike Pence, is his role, this was ceremonial. And so they're pushing back on that. We anticipate that that ruling is sometime in the offing soon, Brianna. But you know, these are important witnesses that the Justice Department believes are key to this investigation. Trying to get these people to provide evidence about what the former president's state of mind was, what he knew, what he was being told as he was pushing for these states to overturn their election results and keep him in power, even though he had lost the election.",

He's tried his best to try to keep the council that he gave to the former president.He's also, I think, because of his very overt role, perhaps in a in a position where he also may have his own exposure here as part of the Justice Department investigation. So you're right, some of these - some of these witnesses, for instance, have already gone in and didn't know that they were supposed to claim executive privilege. So the former president made this claim in some cases after some of these people already went in to answer some questions. So the issue here though, Brianna, what you're getting a picture of is the Justice Department, the special counsel in this case, Jack Smith, has really got his foot on the accelerator. He is trying to get these witnesses in. They're trying to move as quickly as they can. Because I think you and I both know that there's a political calendar that's in the works here. You know you have the former president. Already he has declared that he is a candidate. You have other candidates coming in. So the political season is upon us. And the Justice Department wants to bring a case they need to try to start moving that very, very soon - Brianna?",

In the case of Mark Meadows, we now know from the grand jury report in Georgia, we know that he pleaded the Fifth in the investigation, there by the special grand jury.And that tells you a lot, right? Because Mark Meadows was key. He was helping to set up some of these calls. He was making phone calls himself to try to pressure people to find what the former president said in that now infamous recorded call to Brad Raffensperger, where he said he wanted to find 11,780 votes, right, to try to remain - to try to say that he won the state of Georgia, which he did not. And so there are witnesses who do have their own legal exposure. And if you're the prosecutors, you have the right then and there to offer them at least limited immunity to try to get their testimony. It's not clear whether that is exactly what's going to happen. All this stuff is, of course, happening in a closed court, where we don't have the benefit of being able to see, Brianna, what is happening? But that is certainly on the table. We've seen it happen with some of the other witnesses who have gone in and had declined to answer questions where the Justice Department asked them or gave them immunity so that they could answer some questions.",

This is a big step here, right, because we are seeing the judge just poke holes in all of these claims of privilege, and this may crack things wide open for the special counsel. How big of a deal is this, Michael? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, it's a huge deal. And I think what you're starting to see some of the courts tell the Trump team they've had enough of the nonsense whether it be from the lawyer and the documents cases and now maybe to the staff that are trying to invoke executive privilege to Trump's claims. Remember that executive privilege is not a shield to hard criminal conduct behind. So you can't do something illegal and then come around and claim executive privilege. It's just meant to protect the deliberative process. And so, you know, I think that this is the beginning sort of the cracking of the dam, if you will, for these false claims that have been out there.
