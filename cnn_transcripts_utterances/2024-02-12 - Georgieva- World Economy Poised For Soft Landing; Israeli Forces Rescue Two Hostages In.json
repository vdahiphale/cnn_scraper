It is up, well, we've given back to best gains of the day, but we are still about a quarter of a percent higher. The markets and the main events that you and I are going to be talking about: A dream nearly within reach. The IMF managing director tells me the global economy is poised for that soft landing. Europe is responding to Donald Trump's threat against some NATO members. And the chief executive of Airbus on Boeing 737 Max's blowout, Guillaume tells me it makes us very humble. Today, live from Dubai on Monday. It is February the 12th. I'm Richard Quest in the UAE, and of course here, as elsewhere, I mean, business. Good evening. We begin tonight with a soft landing within reach. That's what the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva told me here in Dubai. It has been the assessment of Wall Street as well. The Dow is more than a hundred points higher, set to continue the strong rally that we've seen over recent days. Now, the S&amp;P 500, well, it may be down just today, but bear in mind that is off Friday's close and it is still over 5,000. The NASDAQ is off. Again, today, it could just be whatever reason, profit taking because it has been set in the high mark set in November 2021. The managing director of the fund says economies have weathered the post- pandemic storm. Kristalina Georgieva told me they still need to be prepared for unexpected shocks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So you can imagine when they sit down, start talking to each other face-to- face that this will be at the very center of their discussions and you see them arriving there about 30 minutes ago at the north portico. One of the other things that White House officials do say will be the center of the talks today are these ongoing discussions to try and secure the release of hostages in Gaza paired with a prolonged pause in the fighting. And this has been sort of an ongoing back-and-forth between the US, Israel, Hamas, and those brokers, Egypt and Qatar. When you talk to White House officials, they do say that this is reaching something of an endgame. They do say that there is a framework on the table. President Biden is dispatching his CIA chief, Bill Burns to Egypt tomorrow to continue these discussions to try and bring them over the finish line. One of the real impediment so far has been Israel itself, and you'll remember, Richard, Netanyahu said last week that a Hamas counterproposal was delusional. So there is still a lot of work to try and convince the Israelis to agree to something that would release the hostages, but certainly that will be a major point of discussion between Biden and King Abdullah today.",

And when you talk to officials, they acknowledge, there really is nowhere for those civilians to go and it is hard to imagine in the view of American officials how an operation could proceed there while protecting civilian lives. So this is a major, major concern here at the White House, and it is another point of contention between Biden and Netanyahu. Just add it to the list of concerns that American officials, including President Biden have with how the Israelis are conducting this conflict, you can really start to see how some of those frustrations are starting to bubble over -- Richard.",
