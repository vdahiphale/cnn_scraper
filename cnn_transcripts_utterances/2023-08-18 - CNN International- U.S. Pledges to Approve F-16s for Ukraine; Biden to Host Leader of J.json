      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster, who is back on Monday. Just ahead, the U.S. committee to approve the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as pilot training is complete, we'll discuss the impact on the battlefield.Then U.S. President Joe Biden will soon host a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea in what is meant to be a show of force amid growing threats from North Korea and China and the countdown to the Women's World Cup final has begun. England's Lionesses are getting ready to face Spain on some. Russia is blaming Ukraine for an attempted drone strike on Monday and a thwarted boat attack on the Black Sea. Moscow's Mayor says Russian air defense has shut down a drone overnight debris from the drone allegedly fell near the Moscow Expo Center. And the Russian Defense Ministry says two of its patrol ships in the Black Sea repelled an attack from an unmanned Ukrainian -- late on Thursday. Meanwhile, a U.S. official says Washington will allow the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as pilot training is complete. And Netherlands calls the pledge a major milestone and CNN's Nada Bashir is following both of those developments for us. So, Nada the F- 16s give us a sense now of the exact timeline of what we know. And also remind us why Ukraine is so desperately seeking F-16s.",

      "sentences": "Well, like in terms of the timeline, Bianca, it is still very much unclear. I mean, this training was supposed to begin this month. That was the expectation. Now of course, we've seen that there has been some delay to that training process. And of course, that is the crucial element here.The supply of these F-16s by the U.S. as European partners really depends on the Ukrainian pilots being able to fully operate these very advanced U.S. made jets. Now, we've heard from the Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson he addressed this yesterday and said that it certainly won't be before the beginning of next year. That Ukraine's pilots will not be able to operate these jets over the autumn and winter months. But of course, as you mentioned, this is a big milestone, the U.S. and President Biden have said that they are ready to authorize and approve the supply of these jets to Ukraine via their European partners as soon as that training is complete. But of course, it could take months and that is a significant blow to Ukraine's ambitions on the front line, its air defense ambitions in particular, as this counter offensive continues to grind on this was essentially a huge hope for Ukraine that this could mark a turning point for them. This could be the boost that they need over the course of their counter offensive to really make progress on that front. There has been some debate about whether or not this really is a game changer in fact, on the front lines, but of course this is a huge priority for Ukraine President Zelenskyy has been calling for the spy F-16s since the very early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So there is some progress on that front, certainly not as quick as Ukraine would have hoped.",

The Russian military released this video of what it said were its ships on joint naval patrol with China in the region. Japan expressed concerns about the patrols but China says they are in line with international law and practice.And in just a few hours, U.S. President Joe Biden will welcome the leaders of Japan and South Korea to Camp David for their first ever trilateral summit. The goal is to build a fragile truce between two of America's most strategic allies in the Indo-Pacific in an attempt to counter growing threats from China and North Korea. This will be the first Camp David summit of the Biden presidency and follows his sideline meeting with the Japanese and South Korean leaders in Hiroshima three months ago. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins me now live at the White House. Priscilla, what message do you believe that the President wants to send from this summit? What is he hoping to achieve?",

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is facing four trials which if prosecutors get their way could come at the heights of the presidential election campaign.But he and his legal team are trying to push those dates back as you may expect. Late Thursday, they asked the judge in his federal election subversion case to start the trial in April of 2026. The Special Counsel wants the trial to begin in January and team Trump says that's just too soon. Katelyn Polantz joins us now with the details. Katelyn, how is the decision ultimately made as to when the trial date will begin? And what factors do you think and this extraordinary case will be weighing on mines?",

      "sentences": "Bianca, it's up to the judge. That is first and foremost, it is always up to the judge what the judge says goes the judge in this case, the federal case against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election and January 6.She has not set a date yet she is going to look at the arguments from both sides. As you mentioned, the Justice Department has asked for that trial to begin very soon, relatively soon, pretty fast calendar having jury selected in December, and then having the trial itself to start just after the New Year. That would be the earliest date by far of any of the criminal cases that are on the calendar right now to go to trial if the justice department gets that. But Donald Trump's team in their filing last night in court to respond to that request essentially says they don't want it for another three years. That also is a very significant asks in that it is a long time for a trial. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking for a trial to start three years from the time it is charged. Typically, defendants want to be able to go through a trial to have their name cleared if they are fighting the charges as quickly as possible. But Trump's team has complaints about the amount of evidence that they say they want to go through before the trial. They say it's just too many pages of documents to read, to get ready for a trial. That would be very quick. They are also complaining about the other things that they have on their calendar. Other hearings and these other cases related to criminal indictments in other areas in Georgia, in Florida. That federal case related to Mar-a-Lago, another January 6 case and then a case in New York. But all of this, even if Donald Trump is saying this is unfair to me to have to go to trial before April of 2026. That is a very unlikely date that they would get on the calendar. And this judge has already indicated she wants this trial to move along. She believes that Trump speaking publicly to try and sway a jury in one way or another could factor into the need to have a trial early. And also the Justice Department has already argued that this trial is about the election of 2020. And that there is an importance to have the public see what the result of this is before the next election. So we'll just have to see in the coming weeks what the judge sets as the date, Bianca.",

In Sweden, you know, always so, good but you know kind of always the bridesmaid, not the bride. They've finished top four in five of the nine World Cups, including this one.
