This is EU leaders arriving Kyiv the head of a wall summit on Friday.Then the U.S. gets expanded access to military bases in the Philippines as fears grow over China's aggressive posture toward Taiwan. And multicolored dots are taking over the world of fashion. French powerhouse Louis Vuitton collaborates with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for a campaign that's creating an unprecedented buzz across the globe. Eastern Ukrainian City of Kramatorsk is under fire once again just hours after Russia's deadly missile attack on a residential neighborhood. A local official says three people were killed and eight wounded on Wednesday night strike. A rescue operation is underway right now for at least two others who may be buried beneath the rubble. To the south, officials say that Russian shelling has killed two people in and near the liberated City of Kherson. CNN's Sam Kiley described the scene earlier on.",

This was where you'll remember, there were those enormous celebrations.Just a few months ago, when this city was liberated from Russian occupation the Russians are about 500 meters in that direction, straight down the main drag on the other side of the river and they're firing into the town very regularly.",

They had just arrived to the site in Kramatorsk, where this apartment building had been struck by a Russian missile. And as you said, where these rescue operations are still very much ongoing when they heard a missile strike very, very close by.It was only about a minute or two later that they saw a second explosion. And we're talking about 50, maybe 100 meters away from where they were actually standing. They saw afterwards a huge crater that was in the roadway there. Now frankly, everyone on the team is OK, but obviously the strikes sent people in the streets running for cover. And Fred and his team were close enough that they actually got a - of dust and debris, they were that close. And their armored vehicle, the bulletproof window of their armored vehicle was hit with some debris as well. And so this is especially sort of concerning because there is not an industrial area, really anywhere in the vicinity that you might expect that maybe there are some legitimate military targets. What there is close by though is about 300 meters away; there is a hospital there where we presume that people are being treated from this earlier strike yesterday. Now we're about 18 hours in, the officials as you mentioned, said that there could be two people trapped under the rubble still, but the clock is ticking. And if you imagine that not only are these people likely hurt, but you have temperatures that overnight were below freezing. Right now they're just around freezing still. And so it's very difficult for anyone to survive in these kinds of conditions. We're still waiting to get more firm update on whether anyone was hurt or killed in this latest batch of strikes. But look, this is you know, a really concerning situation, especially since it is not clear at all, what the target may have been, if there was even any legitimate target that the Russians were actually aiming at.",

No injuries reported either in Gaza or Israel.Although there are some reports of damage to streets and homes, especially in Gaza the strikes come after a recent spike in violence on both sides. And despite calls for calm this week by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who just left the region CNN's Hadas Gold joins us now live from Jerusalem. Hadas, are we hearing anything else from the international community trying to put diplomatic pressure on the region to calm and quell this violence?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, the Secretary of State barely left the region. And it seemed as though things just sort of went back to the levels potentially not as high levels as before, but to what we were seeing before. And so as you noted overnight, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel and as Israel has a policy to respond to every single rocket.Israeli fighter jets responded with striking what they said were, as you noted, Hamas chemical storage and weapons manufacturing. We haven't heard of any casualties, injuries caused by the rockets or by the missiles overnight other than some homes and being damaged in Gaza and a street being damaged by shrapnel from the projectile in Southern Israel. Hamas also saying it fired anti-aircraft missiles Israeli jets. But as we noted so far, there was no reports of damage to the Israeli jets. It is the second round of rockets and then airstrikes just in the past week, because we had this on last Thursday after that military raid in Jenin. It is concerning if it's becoming more of a regular occurrence, because, of course, the flare ups between Gaza and Israel, those can lead to quite a bit of damage. Now, we do know that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called on his senior staff to stay in the region to continue the conversations. And we also know that he asked the Egyptians to get involved as well. He mentioned this in his press conference. And what are actually interesting are just the last few hours, the Hamas spokesperson announced that Hamas senior leadership is actually headed to Cairo. So we can only assume that this is part of these overall diplomatic push to try to keep the situation calm. Meanwhile and other diplomatic moves that are related to this region, the King of Jordan is in Washington D.C. today. He's supposed to have lunch with President Joe Biden. Jordan also playing an important role here in this region they are the traditional custodians of the holy site in Jerusalem known as the Al Aqsa Mosque compound or Haram al Sharif for Temple Mount. They are the traditional custodians of that site. They have seen as an important figure also in trying to keep the dialogue going keep the calm of some kind. And then later today, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he is going to be in France to have dinner with the French President Emmanuel Macron. And the French President's office said that during the meeting, France will express solidarity with Israel in the face of terrorism but will also address the growing tensions calling on everyone to avoid measures likely to fuel the cycle of violence. And Macron they say will express his availability to contribute to the resumption of dialogues will be interesting to see if Macron offers himself up as a negotiator to try to calm this recent spike in violence, Bianca.",

Now neither the U.S. nor the Philippines have said exactly where these bases will be. But it clearly gives the U.S., a greater foothold in that area right on the edge of the South China Sea perhaps and closer to Taiwan.We know from November when a Philippine Military official said the U.S. was looking at a number of options in the Northern Philippines are on the Western edge of the Philippines that this would give the U.S. Military a presence closer to China. And Beijing views that as provocative especially given the other steps. We've seen the U.S. recently make announcing a greater U.S. Military presence on the Island of Okinawa in Japan, just about 200 miles from Taiwan across the waterway there. This if it's in the Northern Philippines could be even closer about 185 miles or so somewhere in that range from Taiwan. And that's why China views this as such a provocative step. In addition, the U.S. Marine Corps is also or rather officially announced the opening of a new base on the Island of Guam, which is east of the Philippines. So what's known as the second island chain, an island chain used for the deterrence and containment of China and that's why this is such a big step. It is the continued ongoing pivot towards China with the ability when this goes through, and when those U.S. forces arrived in the Philippines for rotational presence there. It's the ability to put forces closer to China, especially with growing concerns over the potential for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. And it's, part of this presents the ability of the U.S. to get forces closer to China, a bigger presence in the region and it underscores to Beijing that the U.S. has its allies, has its partners in the region. And it's growing closer to those despites what it views as Chinese aggression and provocation in the region.",

They are charged with spreading corruption, on in vice, not just charged with dancing in the square, but with possibly promoting the idea of women's liberty, women's freedom, women getting to choose how they dress and who they love, and where they love that person, openly and publicly. And they were brought this couple after this video, it went viral, it was shared widely on social media, the response of the authorities was to raid their home or arrest this couple. And eventually they were brought to a very notorious judge, Bianca. Judge, Abolqasem Salavati and I say his name because he was specifically sanctioned rather by the United States. So called judge of death, because he hands down these really awful long sentences to protesters, even the death penalty at times clearly a message here from the Iranian government that it sides with hardliners but its sides with these conservative views, and that anyone making a statement against them.

So it's extremely difficult to give you accurate numbers in figures.But stories are, of course seeping out from people who have fled the country, particularly to areas in the Kurdish region of Iraq, stories of sexual assault in violence at the hands of authorities. And what's important to remember here is, of course, this ruling government, the Islamic Republic does have a conservative class in Iran that backs it and supports it. And it has been speaking directly to that class by promoting this very hard line and brutal crackdown. A crackdown that has led to hundreds of people being killed, thousands being arrested, according to rights groups and the way that they address that hardline, address that conservative element anxiety is rhetorically by saying, look, we understand if you are a religious person in Iran today and you see a woman walking in the street without her headscarf. Remember, of course, the hijab law, that's fundamental. That's what these protesters are about. If you see a woman walking in the street without a headscarf that could be offensive to you to your religious beliefs, we're going to crack down on your behalf. But there's also something else to remember here. This is an unprecedented protest movement, Bianca.
