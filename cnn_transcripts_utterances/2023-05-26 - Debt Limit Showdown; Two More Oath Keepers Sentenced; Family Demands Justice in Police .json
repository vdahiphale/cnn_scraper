That's the earliest estimated date that the Treasury may not be able to pay the government's bills.CNN's Arlette Saenz is tracking this for us from the White House, joins us now.

It really, with these next 24 to 48 hours serving as a very critical time period for that. Now, President Biden has said that he does believe they can get to an agreement, but so far there is not a clear deal in sight. There are some contours of what an agreement could potentially look like, including increasing the debt ceiling for two years and pairing that with spending caps for that same length of time.But there's still a number of sticking points when it comes to spending levels and other issues that are taking place in these negotiations at this very moment. But one thing that the president and the White House have repeatedly tried to hammer away at is stressing the point that Congress needs to act in this moment and that it's only legislative options that are available when it comes to raising the debt ceiling. Some progressives have pressed the president to raise - to use the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling on his own. But this morning the deputy treasury secretary was very emphatic in saying that that option is a no go. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this afternoon, Kenneth Harrelson will be sentenced as well. This comes after the founder of the group Stewart Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, the longest yet for anyone connected to January 6th. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is with us this morning. So, Katelyn, talk to us about what's important today. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, John, we're going to see a series of sentencings for people that are convicted in -- as part of this group of the Oath Keepers that were led by Stewart Rhodes, the founders of the Oath Keepers, on January 6th, organized, planned for that attack at the Capitol and made sure that there were people there to help support them and also to make sure that there were guns around D.C. And today the two people we're seeing being sentenced are just another set of people in that group under Rhodes. So, if Rhodes is at the top of this structure, below him there was Kelly Meggs, who was sentenced yesterday to 12 years, and then there are a series of other team leaders essentially, one of them Jessica Watkins. She was called Cap for captain because she was a leader and she was part of this conspiracy as well, not seditious conspiracy as far as her convictions go, but she was part of the group that was convicted and had a leadership role. The government is asking for, I believe, 15 years for her -- I'm sorry, 18 years for her. And then the other person sentenced today, Kenneth Harrelson. They're asking for 15 years for him. He was another team leader from Florida coming and organizing people. And the big thing to watch for today, John, is that yesterday a major moment in Rhodes' sentencing was not just what he said, but also how the judge viewed this as a domestic terrorism crime. He said it was. And with Watkins and Harrelson today, the Justice Department is, again, going to argue that these people should have their sentences much harsher because they are domestic terrorism. We'll wait to see what the judge does there. John.",

Nick, way don't you bring us up to speed on the latest developments? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this morning, Aderrien, we're told, is going to start counseling. And a family attorney tells me that there's just no way any reasonably trained officer could have made this mistake. The family believes that Aderrien came within an inch of losing his life. And a new photo that we have this morning shows the extent of Aderrien's injuries, a bandage over the hole in his chest that he has after being shot by police. All of this, of course, unfolding, according to the mother, Nakala Murry, on Saturday morning when the father of one of her other child showed up unannounced at her home irate. She was so scared for her safety that Aderrien was sleeping in the room and she was able to briefly getaway and sneak him a cell phone and tell him to call 911 to help her. And that's exactly what he did. Now, two officers responded to the scene, we're told. And one of the officers had his gun drawn when he got to the door, ordered everyone out of the house, including the mother and Aderrien, and that's when Aderrien came from around the corner, from a hallway into the living room and was shot by that police officer. Listen to the family attorney tell me there's nothing that Aderrien could have done differently to avoid being shot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This week three shark bite incidents and a shark sighting along the East Coast prompting new alerts for safe swimming. So the attacks were in New Jersey and the Florida Keys, and a great white was also spotted near South Carolina. Now, thankfully, none of the encounters were deadly. Experts say shark attacks are rare but they do happen. Let's bring in now CNN's senior national correspondent Miguel Marquez. So, Miguel, what are officials saying about being aware of sharks this summer season?",

Here at the Rockaways, you know, it is - it is business as usual, which is to mean no business at all, just but surfing, which is great to do on a beautiful day like this. And it's only going to get busier.But New York officials are concerned about sharks. They're putting more drones in the air over the beaches to watch for sharks and more ships around the beaches to make sure that they can spot sharks and get people out of the water if necessary. This follows those shark attacks that you were talking about, and others. There was one in the Turks and Caicos where a 22-year-old woman had her leg - her leg taken off by a shark. That is very concerning. She is in serious condition. They were snorkeling off the reef off of a private boat, and that's when that shark struck. They think maybe it just mistook her for prey, but they're not entirely sure. There was a young woman, a teenager, who was surfing off the coast of New Jersey earlier this week and she got bit by what she thinks was a shark. And then there was a young woman who was just wading out in the - in the water, just sitting out on the beach in Florida, and she got bit on her stomach and on her arm. So, it can happen. It is very rare. But, you know, the best advice, if you see schools of fish, if you see seals, stay away from them. Most of the times the sharks mistake people for food. Back to you.",

I'm not sure if it completely took her leg off or if they had to remove it after she was bitten, but she is in serious condition. And that was a much more serious bite than sharks usually do.
