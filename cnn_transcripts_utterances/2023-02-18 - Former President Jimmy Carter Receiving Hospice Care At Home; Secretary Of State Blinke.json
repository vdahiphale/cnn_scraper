Former President Jimmy Carter is receiving hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia. Sources tell CNN President Biden is staying in close contact with the Carter family. Let's go now to CNN's Jeff Zeleny in Washington. Jeff, what more have you learned since we've just heard this not too long ago.",

      "sentences": "Sara, we are learning this this afternoon and the Carter Center advised something that we had not known, that the former President Jimmy has had a brief series of hospital stays.He made the decision to spend his final days to enter hospice care in Plains, Georgia. That is really so extraordinary because that, of course, is where the former president has spent his entire life with the exception, of course, of his four years here in Washington at the White House as well as his military service as a young man. He went home to Plains, Georgia in his post-presidency, and that's where he's been ever since. With Rosalynn, his wife at his side for more than 75 -- 77 years of marriage or so. So the family is saying that he is going to be in hospice care. And we are also learning just a short time ago, we heard from his grandson, a former Georgia state senator, a gubernatorial candidate, who is basically in the family business in Georgia, Jason Carter. And he said he visited with his grandparents yesterday in Plains. And he tweets this. He said, \"I saw both of my grandparents yesterday. They're at peace, and as always, their home is full of love. Thank you for all of your kind words.\" So Sara, as I'm talking to former advisers to the Carter family, they're really keeping a close hold on his exact health condition. And instead, they are choosing to talk about his life, talk about really his extraordinary legacy from peanut farmer to the presidency. And it was really, you know, the post presidency, the last half century nearly of his work that has been so extraordinary. And he's been a Sunday schoolteacher. He's had a parade of people we're seeing right here now, his Plains, Georgia church. He's greeting visitors. So this is something he always did. If he was on an airplane, he was known to be shaking hands with passengers up and down the aisle. He taught Sunday school. He built homes with the Habitat for Humanity, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I certainly remember that as well. So clearly now, President Biden, I'm told, has been advised of this, and he is in close contact as well. And some interesting history between those men as well. President Biden paid a visit to the Carters on the 100th day of his presidency back in 2021. And then-Senator Joe Biden was the first senator to endorse the Carter presidential bid, back in 1976. So they have a long history there. I'm told the White House is in close contact. They share some actual former advisers. Anita Dunn, a top adviser to this president was a young adviser to Jimmy Carter. So all thoughts here in Washington and at the White House are with the Carters. But for now, he has chosen to remain in Plains, Georgia which really is the epicenter of his life, his legacy that will be felt certainly around the world, Sara.",

He did come down with melanoma in 2015 just as I was beginning my biography, \"The Outlier\" on him. And he had this, if you recall, he had this amazing press conference live at the Carter Center, where he got up on stage, and gave the news very calmly, rationally, said that he had brain cancer, melanoma that had spread from his liver, and he probably had just a few weeks to live.

But in the life afterwards, he's done remarkable things that have impacted people's lives. Can you talk a little bit about that. BURR: Oh, absolutely, you know, I argue in my biography that actually his presidency, his four years was quite successful. He accomplished quite a bit. But I also wrote that he sort of tongue in cheek was the only president who used the White House as a stepping-stone to greater things. And it's true, you know, he had a remarkable ex-presidency. Just a continuation of his presidency in many ways, doing good works. So, you know, he often joked that at the Carter Center that he wanted to live longer than the last guinea worm, and the Carter Center has spent decades now, wiping out millions of cases of guinea worm disease which a terrible affliction, and they're now, I think, in 2022, there were only 13 cases in human beings of guinea worm disease so he's almost made it. Kai Bird, thank you so much for sharing your insights. You're the author of \"The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter\" and you said something that I think is going to stick with people which is he used the presidency as a stepping-stone for greater things.

We now know some of the details of the conversation.The Secretary of State telling Wang Yi, directly that this was a violation of U.S. airspace and international law that this balloon, this Chinese balloon should fly across the United States. He also warned China about increasing and the risk of it increasing its support for Russia and also spoke about the importance of peace and stability around Taiwan. And this comes on a day when the United States has been telling its allies and partners here in Europe that it is concerned that it sees disturbing trend lines that China is, in fact, increasing its support for Russia, that it is potentially walking up to a line -- a threshold line, if you will, of moving towards giving Russia lethal military aid for its war in Ukraine. That's a concern. That was shared with European allies and partners. The concern for the United States is that the Chinese are trying to sort of sell themselves as peacemakers in a situation right now while at the same time, beginning to consider a move closer to giving that military support. I spoke on that particular issue with Ursula Von Der Leyen, the European Commission President, a very senior and prominent European diplomat. She said that there was concern about China, and whether or not it was going to increase support for Russia. They were watching closely. But at the moment, she said, it's an open question. And on that issue, this was something Secretary Blinken, very clear with his Chinese counter part of the consequences of ramping up support for Russia in its war, military support, Sara.",

But officials saying basically continuing with that message to the community that they are continuing to work with local officials as this massive clean up effort continues underway.And you mentioned the tweet from the company earlier today, basically reemphasizing their commitment they say to be in it for the long run, that they don't plan to go anywhere and even offering some free and available air quality tests for the residents there. But look, when you hear from the residents in that community that have already been through so much since the events of that day back on February 3rd, that company has a very long way to go when it comes to restoring the confidence in people for them to be able to actually keep them safe in the community. That's because of what you just mentioned a short while ago, receiving reports from several residents that they are beginning to experience things like coughing, some rashes, headaches, nausea. And they are worried, again they are worried that this could potentially be linked to that train chemical spill from just weeks ago. In response to that local, state, federal officials expected to send in medical personnel. Experts in toxicology to set up these clinics to be able to speak to some of these individuals and provide perhaps examinations, for example and what is perhaps the most the valuable asset of all which is information. Many of these residents feel that they have not been provided with all the information that they need to make a wise decision in terms of whether or not to return home which by the way, remember, they were given the all clear days ago to actually return, this after local officials said multiple tests revealed no elevated qualities of any sort of -- quantities, I should say of any harmful chemicals in the water or in the air. But again, as we said, they still have a very long way to go in terms of feeling safe in their community.

It's a miracle nobody is hospitalized now and you've got to empathizewith what they've been through in addition to the rashes and all of that. They've got property values to worry about, their clothes and their -- maybe their inventory in their stores are contaminated -- all of that. But this really strikes me as the first big toxic spill of the age of toxic politics. And as much as Governor Mike DeWine tries to manage this and calm fears and say we have tested the water so much, the air is ok. You can go back to your homes. Even his own like state senators in his own party are going on the media saying I don't believe him, because I get a sore throat. And so after, you know, the COVID debate around masks and vaccinations, and after honestly generations of pollution in the Ohio River water shed, you know, mining and agricultural (INAUDIBLE) that's been ignored by folks, you know, the folks who have to deal with it and the Appalachians being ignored, so I can't blame them for not knowing who to believe right now. And then Donald Trump is going to go down there this week. They have found, you know, the Biden EPA has a punching bag here, the slow footed response from Michael Regan. That's going to only muddy it further, I think. And we have to remind folks that President Trump rolled back over a hundred environmental protection laws, rolled back train safety laws right now, and if anything, you know, silver lining can come of this, is the scrutiny around how much, how vulnerable our clean air and water can be.

Those remarkable rescues continuing through Saturday.But the death toll is also still rising, topping 40,000 in Turkey. And among them, Christine Atsu (ph), who was found dead under the rubble of a destroyed building in Antalya, according to his agent. The window for finding survivors is, of course, closing, with less than 200 search-and-rescue operations currently ongoing. The focus now shifting to the humanitarian response effort, with thousands left homeless and in need of urgent support. The United Nations meanwhile is appealing for $1 billion in aid to support the relief efforts over the next three months. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres saying now is the time for the world to stand behind Turkey. But beyond the humanitarian response efforts, the Turkish government also faces significant infrastructure challenges. More than 90,000 buildings have been identified as either collapsed or in need of immediate demolition. And then there's the question of accountability. Turkish authorities say they have arrested 120 out of 400 identified suspects currently under investigation of allegations of construction negligence. And while the government has made clear its commitment to rebuilding the affected areas within a year, there is a growing sense of frustration and even anger here in Turkey, with many now questioning whether enough was done by the government to prepare for a catastrophe of this scale -- Sara?

It has turned to, I don't know any other way to say it, but dust. And we're looking at a picture from Hatay -- that's where I was -- and you can see some of that there. What does that mean?

We heard that they should change their codes in 1999 after a terrible and deadly earthquake in Turkey then. But we've also heard that those changes in codes were lifted by the current regime there, by the current president there at some point to try to get things going, the economy, to get things built faster. You know, is this something that we could see in the United States, in a place like Los Angeles or the bay area or Washington State where these earthquakes are numerous, and a big one, as has been predicted, is coming?",

We saw this in New Orleans after the hurricane 20 years ago. New Orleans lost half its population. And that still has not come back.
