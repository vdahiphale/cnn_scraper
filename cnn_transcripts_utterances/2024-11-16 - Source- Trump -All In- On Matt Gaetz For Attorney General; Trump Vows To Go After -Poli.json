      "sentences": "Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. You're in the CNN Newsroom, and I'm Jessica Dean in Atlanta.President-elect Donald Trump moving at a rapid clip to fill out his administration. However, there is time for a victory lap tonight. Moments ago, he boarded his plane en route to New York City. Trump will attend tonight's UFC event at Madison Square Garden, the site of one of his most memorable and notable campaign rallies. Trump also, though, facing some turbulence with some of his Cabinet picks. Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, is confronting a past accusation of sexual misconduct. Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Trump's choice for Director of National Intelligence, has a concerning history of spreading Russian conspiracy theories and propaganda. And Matt Gaetz, his choice for Attorney General, was the subject of investigations stemming from alleged sex trafficking and drug use. Gaetz resigning from Congress this week, closing the door on a House ethics investigation. And despite all of that controversy, CNN is reporting tonight Trump sees Gaetz as his most important Cabinet pick and is pressing forward to make Gaetz America's top cop. CNN's Steve Contorno is near Mar-a-Lago, where Trump has spent much of his time assessing candidates. And Steve, what more can you tell us about the specific status of Matt Gaetz' nomination and his own efforts to start lobbying Republican senators to confirm him in the role of AG?",

      "sentences": "Jessica, we are learning tonight that Donald Trump remains determined to see Matt Gaetz' nomination through. He is very aware of the coverage and the blowback that Gaetz' nomination has received since that surprising announcement.And he has heard from his allies on Capitol Hill and Republican senators who are concerned that Gaetz does not have the support to get to 51 votes in the Senate. But Donald Trump is not backing down. He is telling his allies that he will dig into this fight. He is, quote, \"100 percent in on Gaetz\". One source telling us, quote, \"He is not going to back off. He's all in.\" And as you said, Gaetz has been trying to build support on his own by calling members of the U.S. Senate, trying to, in many cases, mend fences and build bridges within a body that he has done nothing but burn bridges. He's a political arsonist, really, over the past few years, who has caused interparty fights and has not tried to make friends. Well, now he is trying to get support, as he knows that he faces a tough test ahead. Again, he does have the president's support, because, as you said, Donald Trump views the attorney general as the most important position in his Cabinet. And he wants someone who is closely aligned and incredibly loyal to him for that role. He does not believe he had that loyalty from his attorney generals during his first term. And he sees Matt Gaetz as someone who will not only oversee the dismantling of the Justice Department that he has promised, but also will be a vocal defender of Donald Trump on the media. That is an important distinction that he sees that Matt Gaetz has and what gave him the leg up over some of the other names that he considered for the job.",

And he obviously believes the Justice Department is a critical part of that. And that's why he is seeing you there and all across these different appointments he's making. These are people going to bring real change to the typical Washington picks. And of course it's going to be a little different because President Trump is going to be a different kind of president than we've seen before.

I don't think the American people voted for that. I don't see how appointing Matt Gaetz or Pete Hegseth or Tulsi Gabbard or RFK Jr., people, once again, who are wholly unqualified for these incredibly important positions, how that benefits the American people. You know what benefits? It benefits Donald Trump. How do loyalty tests benefit the American people? How do court-martialing people in response to Donald Trump's disagreeance with how the Afghanistan pull out was executed, which is now being reported, that they're looking to court-martial people over it, how does that benefit the American people?

They've enabled him. So forgive me if I'm not, you know, going to rely on Susan Collins and her being shocked about this. Talk is cheap. Let's see if she does the right thing alongside other Republican senators. And if they have the decency to say no to these unqualified, dangerous -- they're more than just unqualified, these are dangerous picks. And they're an affront to everything that our democratic institutions actually represent. Matt Gaetz -- are we really going to sit here and compare Matt Gaetz to Merrick Garland or to other people who have held the distinguished position of our attorney general in this country? Matt Gaetz is one of the most despised people in Congress. He is under investigation for some pretty horrific things, as we've already discussed. And if all of these people were so -- if it was above board, then why is Donald Trump pushing for recess appointments? Because he knows they aren't. So this is going to be a true test of whether these Republican senators pledge their allegiance to uphold their constitutional oath and actually want what's best for America and our democracy, or whether they're going to be fealty -- pledge their fealty to Donald Trump.
