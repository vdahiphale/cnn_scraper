This hour, we speak with RFK Jr.'s sister, Kerry Kennedy, who says she's outraged by her brother's decision to embrace Donald Trump.Voting companies and election officials still dealing with the fallout from the 2020 election lies. They are bracing for Election Day in November. What they're doing to try to prepare. And potentially record high temperatures and humidity expected to smother the Midwest this week. The heat so dangerous some schools are being forced to close just days into the new year. I'm Sara Sidner with John Berman. Kate Bolduan is out. CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts right now. This morning, CNN's new reporting on the debate about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris boils down to one simple question -- why, why did Donald Trump just tell voters once again that he may not show up to a debate he already agreed to? Listen to Trump's latest if. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I shouldn't say this, because if there's a debate, it would be nice to surprise her with that one.

      "sentences": "Well, look, I also will say that the former president himself really does want to debate. Donald Trump wants to debate himself. He thinks he has an obligation to do so. So keep that in mind around all of these discussions and the questions over the debate, over the debate. What it really boils down to, Sara, is each candidate is jockeying for the rules to be better for themselves and give them an edge in this debate. That's part of what we're seeing play out right now.And granted, the big picture here is that they both recognize that the stakes are so high for this debate. They saw, and we remember just a couple of months ago that June 27th CNN debate was a huge change for President Joe Biden. It was hugely important for him and what really set off a series of events that led him to end his campaign. So they recognize how this debate could be one of the final defining moments of this entire election cycle. And so that's why we're seeing so much of this discussion over the roles. Despite it seeming like a process question, there's a lot of important factors here. So I'm going to break down what exactly they are kind of bickering over, which is whether or not microphones will be shut off during the debate. So it's interesting because in the leadup to that first debate with Joe Biden in June, the Trump campaign actually did not want the microphones to be shut off at any point. However, that was something that the Biden campaign had pushed for, and ultimately the debate had that the microphones throw off when a candidate was finished speaking. Now, now that were looking ahead to this September 10th debate with ABC news, the Harris campaign is saying, look, we did not agree to those rules. We want the microphones to be on for the duration of this event. And the Trump campaign is now saying, well, actually those were the rules that we agreed to and you have to stick to them even though, of course, those are the roles that they agreed to with the Biden campaign. I'll just say, again, I recognize we are getting into the weeds of this, but the important thing is what this means. And I will say from the Trump campaign side, and we saw this in the leadup to that June debate. They recognize that having the microphones beyond and allowing Donald Trump to be able to interrupt Kamala Harris, that could be really dicey, because they really want to avoid him coming off as aggressive, as him looking like a bully, and having the microphones be shut off at certain points helps him avoid that. In many cases, I do think that they actually think Donald Trump's tone, his tenor, his rhetoric, his overall demeanor is more important than the actual substance. And so that's where a lot of this this is coming from, Sara.",

So the entire House of Representatives empowered this body with doing the investigation.We have the resources, we have the investigative staff, we have the subpoena authority, and we have the bipartisan will to do this the right way, because this is too serious of an effort for us to do otherwise.

I want to read this for you, John. That official told me that, \"We are still completely mired in disinformation. This disinformation and misinformation is something we've never had to deal with at this scale, going into an election.\" Okay, so what are they doing about it? Well, you've heard about the massive defamation lawsuits they've filed against Fox News and Rudy Giuliani and other Trump allies. Yes, they could get a very big payday from those lawsuits and they've gotten nearly $800 million last year from Fox, but they're also hoping that that will be a deterrent factor that maybe this time around if people know that you might have to pay millions, they won't spread the lies. Also, John, another company and it's actually larger than Dominion called ES&amp;S. They instituted a new policy this year to scrub all of their employees' social media. They wanted to make sure that their staff didn't have any political posts or endorsements that were on Twitter or Facebook that could be weaponized later on by internet sleuths who want to use that to attack the companies, attack the voting administrators. Also, I found this really interesting -- this company ES&amp;S, which is one of the largest election equipment makers in the country, they held a training session for their employees before Thanksgiving last year.

They say that they're going to be sending out 1,500 panic buttons to officials in five different states. You can wear this technology. You press the button, 911 gets called. They are hoping that they can deploy that if anybody gets too rowdy or upset at their polling places this fall. Hopefully they don't have to use it. And also, John, some of these companies have even brought in the big guns, DHS, Department of Homeland Security to look at their own cyber protection. They don't want their employees to get hacked or spear phishing attempts. They know that everyone is trying to get in on the action for this election, including bad actors.
