What did the president say during this phone call? Did it reassure you? And are you -- where are you on all of this? QUINTON LUCAS (D), MAYOR OF KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI:  Well, I think he made it clear last night that he is in the race. He's in the race to win. He is looking for the support of mayors, of people all around the country. And we talked about the basics, the things that are not necessarily conversations in the political media or in Washington, but the things that people are talking about in places like Kansas City and Kalamazoo, places I have the fortune of having been recently. And so I think what you see is energy from the president right now. And in response to the last discussion, I think he has said pretty clearly and unambiguously that he's in the race.",

I think you're seeing it from governors as well. And although there may be different conversations in Washington, what you heard yesterday on the call -- I was one of the people who had the chance to speak with him directly -- is that he is not only committed, but that he's looking forward to getting out on the road, spending more time with the American people to make his case that he is the competent candidate. He is the one who has a clear agenda for the future, rather than perhaps some of the more divisive political discourse on the issues lately.",

That message that he was delivering, the message we're getting from Jens Stoltenberg, the message we're getting from other leaders when they speak is going to get drowned out by the discussion about President Biden's ability to beat Donald Trump. But be absolutely sure, yes, they're worried about what happens if Donald Trump wins the election. They're worried because his -- he may undermine support for NATO. He may withdraw the United States from NATO. He may withdraw funding from supporting Ukraine. All these sorts of things are on their minds. So they are saying, however, publicly, as you would expect them to, that they want to be able to -- ready to work with whomever wins and -- who wins the election.

Now, to remind viewers, George Clooney was one of those celebrities that headlined a major Los Angeles fund-raiser with President Biden back in June. And, today, he is saying that he believes it is time for President Biden to step aside from this 2024 campaign. Now, George Clooney wrote extensively about President Biden, saying: \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\" He recounted being with Biden at that fund-raiser, saying: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'Big Effing Deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed on -- at that debate.\" He goes on to say: \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we have opted to ignore every warning sign.\" [11:15:00] This is significant, as, of course, George Clooney holds a very large platform. He is well-known, but he has also been a longtime Democratic supporter, fund-raising not just for Joe Biden, but also for former President Barack Obama. Now, it comes as you have heard these deep reservations expressed from various wings of the Democratic Party from some lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, some donors also indicating that they are concerned about what it would mean to have President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in November after that debate. And now you are hearing George Clooney, a key Democratic supporter, key actor, key activist, adding to that chorus of calls for President Biden to step aside. Now, President Biden and his team are simply charging ahead with this campaign at this moment. President Biden right now is speaking at an AFL-CIO meeting, as he is trying to shore up support among union leaders, who the campaign believes would be key heading into a November election. But, certainly, this is another pressure point for President Biden as they are having a major Democratic name call for him to step aside at this moment.",

And I think that the campaign -- everyone who saw the debate in -- a couple weeks ago have been saying to the president, we need you to prove to us that you are able to do it. And people are still waiting for that proof point. Now, I think they are doing a good job getting him out there, having conversations with people, but it's not a great sign. And I don't want to sugarcoat it. When you hear the polls that Harry Enten is saying that he is down, people know the threat that Donald Trump is to our democracy. And so when the polls are where they are, we need a couple things to help it to get easier. And a letter like that doesn't make it any easier.",

If he has decided to stay in the race, we will rally behind him, because what I just laid out for who his opponent is in Donald Trump is a stark contrast. And it's not a matter of whether Joe Biden can serve out his term or serve four more years. It's a matter of, can we beat one of the biggest threats in democracy, which is his opponent, Donald Trump? And that is why we are asking these questions, not because we doubt who Joe Biden is as a leader, but because we want our best candidate put forward. And the voters have decided at this point that is Joe Biden. And the party is just asking one question because he did have a bad night. And I think it is OK. But, for right now, the contrast is just so different. And I think we are showing it in a display right now by even having the courage to have these conversations as a party.",
