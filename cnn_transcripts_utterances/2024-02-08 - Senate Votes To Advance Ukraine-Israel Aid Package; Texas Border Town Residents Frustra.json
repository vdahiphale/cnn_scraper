      "sentences": "Yes, Texas border town residents, meantime, say they are frustrated and confused as to why politicians can't work together to pass legislation that would help alleviate the migrant crisis.CNN is covering the story from all sides. Ed Lavandera is speaking with some of the residents in Eagle Pass, Texas. First, let's go to the capital with CNN's Manu Raju. Manu, final passage of this bill can still be days away. The Senate is supposed to be on recess next week. What is next for this package? MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we expect the recess to be delayed. And we expect the major push to try to get this massive package, more than $95 billion worth of aid to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan. Something that was supposed to be paired with border security provisions, new border policies that even have been negotiated for more than four months. Republican killed the plan that included border provisions because of operations among from House Republicans, opposition from former President Donald Trump, and Senate Republicans who believe that the provisions are too weak and did not want to move forward with the plan if it had a future in the House. But today, moving forward the aid package opened the debate. And 67:32 was the vote today. And 17 Republicans voted to move it ahead. Including Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, the number-two Senate Republican, John Thune, John Cornyn, a potential future leader as well. One, the number-three Republican leader, John Barrasso, voted against it. But this plan will take some time to go through all of the hoops and the process here in the Senate. One Senator has slowed down the process. That is Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. He told me earlier today that he plans to drag this out, which could delay final passages until the middle of the week next week. That is if they continue to keep the votes. Some of the Senators are noncommittal on voting forward on final passage is. We will see how that ultimately plays out as it goes through the process on the floor. Here is also the big question, if it gets out of the Senate, what happens in the Republican-led House? The speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has been noncommittal about moving on such a package. He has called for these issues to be dealt with separately. So it could run into headwinds in the Republican House, even if it gets over the Senate -- guys?",

So there's a real feeling of frustration as the residents here feel like they are on the front lines of this. And many politicians are using this location and this issue for their own political gain.

And the other big headline is that they are still looking to identify and apprehend two other individuals that are believed to have been involved in this. So, in addition to presenting us with some still images from the video evidence that investigators have been looking at, the district attorney really trying to drive the point of the difficulty behind this investigation. The fact that they haven't been able to successfully identify everyone. There is a reason why he's doing that. It is because he has got a lot of criticism because there were five people who were initially arrested after the incident took place and they were released on bail. Listen to a bit of what the mayor had to say about the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY): The overwhelming number of migrants and asylum seekers are law abiding and they're pursing the American dream. And this district attorneys and the NYPD are partnered with each other to pursue those who break the laws in our city. This is a despicable act. It was not only an attack on the individuals who wore the police uniform but it was an attack on our symbol of justice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He faces no serious opposition to win the state's 26 delegates in the caucus that is run by the Nevada Republican Party. His GOP rival, Nikki Haley, opted for Nevada's state-run primary election. And it was really a binary choice. The state GOP said candidates could participate in one or the other. The primary was held two days ago and the result was a resounding defeat for Haley. The \"None of these candidates\" option on the ballot received more votes than she did. Joining me now is the former chair of the Nevada Republican Party, Amy Tarkanian. Amy, isn't Haley's camp -- Amy, there is -- I mean, very clearly it is a poor outcome for Haley. But then you had the current chair of the Nevada Republican Party, Michael McDonald, promising to deliver 100 percent of Nevada's delegates for Trump. which is not normally what you expect of a GOP chairperson.

It is well known that the followers of Mr. Trump were heavily pushing that campaign strategy. And so they are allowed to participate, as a voter, in both the primary and the caucus. That is exactly what they did. And I will tell you, also, the Nevada Republicans have been disenfranchised by this because your average voter does not pay attention to the nuts and bolts. They are very confused and, quite honestly, very angry. But they have all of their options walking into the primary.
