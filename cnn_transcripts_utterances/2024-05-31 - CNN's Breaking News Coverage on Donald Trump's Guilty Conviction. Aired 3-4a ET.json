      "sentences": "Welcome to CNN's special coverage of the criminal conviction of former U.S. President Donald Trump. I'm Kim Brunhuber.A defiant Donald Trump has made history as the first former U.S. President to become a convicted felon, while raising the possibility that he could also become the first convict to win the White House. After two days of deliberation, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. Sentencing is set for July 11th, and he could get up to 20 years behind bars, or possibly just probation. But the Trump team is all but certain to appeal, and for now, Trump will stay out of jail without bond. He's expected to hold a news conference outside Trump Tower later today. Here's some of what he had to say after the verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We have a country that's in big trouble, but this was a rigged decision right from day one with a conflicted judge who should have never been allowed to try this case, never. And we will fight for our constitution. This is long from over. (END VIDEO CLIP) Donald Trump's lead defense attorney tells CNN the team was prepared for a guilty verdict and plans to argue in the appeal that the jury was biased against Trump. More now from CNN's Julia Benbrook. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But prosecutors who alleged Trump was trying to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election pushed back against that argument, saying documents and the testimony of others, particularly former \"National Enquirer\" CEO David Pecker, corroborated Cohen's testimony. The jury deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. In a press conference following the verdict, District Attorney Alvin Bragg thanked them for their service.",

So this is the bread and butter of this prosecuting attorney's office.So I didn't think that there would be any decision other than guilty on all counts. The defense put on by Donald Trump's team was really about Michael Cohen. But this case was so much bigger and there was so much evidence beyond the testimony of Michael Cohen.

I don't see them making the standard mitigating arguments that you would expect from your typical defendant. And as you indicated, there are multiple, multiple aggregating factors. The fact that he has not shown any remorse, that he's not accepted any responsibility that he continues to violate the gag order, that there are at least ten documented violations of that gag order. He left court today and, again, attacked the whole process, attacked the judicial system, attacked the judge. He didn't come out and accept any personal responsibility. So I think it would be almost impossible for this judge not to sentence him to some jail time, even if it's on the lower end of the four years. BRUNHUBER: Really? Jail time? You think, I mean, you know, being a presidential candidate isn't supposed to factor into it. But I mean, the reality is the reality, right? You really think he will serve jail time here?",

Those are things that normal defendants get to do without facing very, very significant penalties for their conduct.And I think this judge has proven that he's not going to treat Donald Trump any other way than any other defendant that is in his courtroom. He's going to hold him to account and he's going to treat him in the same way any other defendant would be treated. And again, if this were any other defendant, he would be facing jail time without doubt.",

That has been their argument from day one. That has been the defense that they have asserted throughout this entire trial. And I expect that that will be the same playbook that they will run with respect to an appeal. They will make arguments about Michael Cohen and the fact that the jury relying on in their estimation, any testimony from Michael Cohen automatically nullifies the decision by this jury and renders its decision null and void.But I don't think that's going to be a winnable argument at the appellate level. It wasn't a winnable argument with this judge. And I think the reality is Donald Trump has to, like anyone else that commits a crime in the state of New York or any state, he has to be held accountable and he is not above the law.

The American people won't forget the corrupt two-tiered system of justice and will issue the real verdict at the ballot box in November.\" Now, over in the United States Senate, we did hear from John Cornyn. He is running to replace Mitch McConnell as Republican leader after the November election. He wrote on Twitter, quote, \"this verdict is a disgrace and this trial should have never happened. Now, more than ever, we need to rally around real Donald Trump, take back the White House and Senate and get this country back on track.\" Now, you're seeing there a lot of similar themes as Republicans are trying to paint this verdict as one that is political. Meanwhile, Democrats have a different approach. You heard from Senator Whitehouse, who said on Twitter, boom, in reaction to Donald Trump's conviction. You also had Senator Chris Murphy tweeting, quote, \"newsflash: it matters that the Republican nominee for president is a convicted criminal. The rule of law still matters\".

Kristen Holmes reports on possible political implications for Trump and his plans to talk about the case in the coming hours. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shortly after leaving the courthouse, after being convicted and found guilty on all 34 charges, Donald Trump announced from Trump Tower that he would be giving a press conference on Friday morning reacting to the verdict in his criminal hush money trial. Now, I have been told by senior advisors that Donald Trump is going to continue to use the same messaging that he has used since before the trial began, calling this a rigged election, saying that this was political persecution. Now, because of this messaging, they believe, this being his senior campaign advisors that this is not going to harm him in November. That instead, it will energize Republicans, energize his base. But it should be made clear that this is really uncharted territory, despite the fact that they compare this to his other legal issues, including multiple indictments, which actually helped give him a boost in both the polls and in fundraising numbers. This is an actual conviction. And recent polling showed that of people who said that they were already going to vote for Donald Trump, 7 percent said they were less likely to vote for him if he was convicted. Now, while this is not a huge number, everything is going to count in the upcoming election. Both Biden's team and Trump's team believe that this is going to be a very narrow margin. And 7 percent is especially significant if you are talking about Donald Trump's base, because his campaign believes that Donald Trump's base always shows up to vote. So whether or not this actually impacts what people do when they get to the ballot box remains to be seen. But we should hear, we should expect to continue to hear that messaging over and over again, trying to link this case to President Joe Biden and calling this political persecution.

He let both sides have their say. And the jury spoke. First the lawyers speak, then the experts in the media speak, and finally those 12 people speak. And while the jury system is never perfect, as no institution is, it's a hallmark of democracy. So I think that's the first thing that'll be written in the chapters of history later on. Then the question will be, how does the public receive this verdict? Is it going to be fractured like the country? Will there be many people who agree with President Trump, former President Trump, that it was rigged? How many of those people will there be?

The \"Wall Street Journal\" did amazing work exposing the first stories about Stormy Daniels. That's worth noting because it is a reaffirmation of how important the press is to our democracy. And a lot of us who worked on this story, you also were in receipt of some of this when you did your interview with Karen McDougal, really got a lot of blowback. When I was first exposing the rumor of the love child and the suppression of that story, the Karen McDougal details, the Enquirer and AMI, they came after me so hard.
