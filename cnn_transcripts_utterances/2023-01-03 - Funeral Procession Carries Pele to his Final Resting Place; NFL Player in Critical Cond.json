We're livein Dubai, and we begin in Brazil and Pele's final journey through the city where his legend was born. The funeral procession for the late football icon is winding through the streets of Santos on its way to the cemetery where he will be laid to rest. There will be a private funeral service for Pele's family. The 24 hour public wake that wrapped up just before the procession was so crowded. That thousands of people in line were turning away more than 230,000 mourners attended the week at the stadium according to the Santos Football Club. Brazilian President Lula da Silva was among those who paid their respects. Julia Vargas Jones has been watching all of this unfold covering this over the past few days. She joins us now live from Santos, Brazil. So many people turned away tens of thousands of people paying their respects to Pele. You were even speaking to some of these people, celebrating his life mourning him, but a legacy that is going to absolutely live on?",

Crowd of the organize the Cheering Squad for Santos had a giant drum line, massive flags, Brazilian flags, Santos flags, throwing a last goodbye the last hurrah for their King. And the people in that crowd have told me that Pele means so much more to them than a wonderful player. Yes, they're so thankful for all of his achievements for the club for the country, but also who he was as a person. This is a man that inspired an entire generation of soccer players. He paved the way for Brazil to become a soccer superpower. That kind of recognition that Pele achieved for Brazil that simply wasn't there before. It's hard to think about what Brazil could have been without the presence of this incredible player? It could have been so different, right? He was the first one to show that kind of game that art form. And the entire generation of children that were able to look up to him as a role model, a black man in the 1960s breaking those kinds of barriers was not easy at the time. And yet, here he is being celebrated on his last day that people can come and pay their respects say their final goodbyes here behind me the cemetery is the tallest cemetery in the world. There will be a mausoleum on the ninth floor we're being told where Pele will be late to rest his final resting place overlooking that stadium of Santos where he built his career Eleni.",

And then, at that point, they were asked to assess the state of their teams and both head coaches, to their profound credit. Sean McDermott of the Buffalo Bills, Zach Taylor of the Cincinnati Bengals, they both looked in the eyes and faces of those men that they were seeing and determined that they were too traumatized to go back out onto that field and play. And they made this unprecedented decision to cancel a game in the middle of the game. And that's powerful, because 10 years ago, five years ago, maybe even a year ago, I don't know that that would have ever happened. I can't remember that has ever happened. So there's this paradigm shift in regards to player health and safety. For those two coaches to make that decision to be thinking about the mental health, even of those other players, and teammates, is huge. So it's a difficult situation when you see these players in the tears and it's tough to comprehend but players are not just coworkers, right? They spend more time with their teammates for six to seven months out of the year than they do with their own spouse and family. They spend Thanksgivings and Christmases in hotel rooms, celebrating with them. They become like brothers and so to see someone like that you know, in my experiences in Eleni, I've witnessed guys have eyes rolling in the back of their heads. I've seen their arms and hands twitching uncontrollably from trauma that was occurred on the field. I've been on field with players were paralyzed, and ambulances had to come and take them off in a stretcher. And in the past those games went on. As players we were always conditioned to compartmentalize to have this next snap or next play mentality, put the blinders on, reset, focus continue on. But the fact that there's the sense of humanity now, with that event last night, again, I cannot overstate how profound that was. I think that's going to make a huge impact on the NFL, the collegiate level here in the United States, the youth levels all across the world. Putting that priority that emphasis on player safety first, much bigger importance than any game or season that could be played",

And it was after the last one where no one knew that he had a concussion during the game. But it was the next day at Eleni that his Head Coach, Coach McDaniel pulled him aside during film and said are you OK? I think you should go see the doctor. The coach reported that, that didn't happen in the past. This situation Monday Night Football, these coaches, the league executives who are assessing the situation, this game shouldn't go on. That didn't happen before. So in regards to player health and safety, I think we already are evolving. And we're witnessing this right now. But there's still room to grow.

I can tell you around 7a.m. soon after sunrise; Ben Gvir made this visit to Temple Mount known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. And he went for about a walk about for just under 15 minutes. He was accompanied by police. There were no incidents. And he left he didn't visit. Contrary to some reports he didn't visit the Al Aqsa Mosque himself. And although Jews are not allowed to openly pray on the Temple Mount, they are permitted to visit during certain times. So he wasn't breaking any laws or anything. I think the issue here is that it comes as five days after this government, the most right wing government in Israel's history was sworn in. It shows that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is either unwilling or unable to control his ministers. And I think it perhaps also lays down a marker on the part of Ben Gvir and his Jewish power party as to how they plan to, to act during the course of this government. And of course, you know, other ministers in the past have also visited Temple Mount without incident. But I think the main issue here, is that Ben Gvir, not only does he have convictions for inciting racial hatred against Arabs. Not only does he have convictions for supporting terrorism, but in the past, at least, he has advocated for a change in the status quo of Temple Mount such that Jews would be allowed to pray there. And it's this even hint of a suggestion that there could be some kind of change to the status quo that is raising hackles both among Israelis among Palestinians. And of course, in the region, as you say, we've had condemnation from Egyptians from the Jordanians from the Emiratis as well former Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The British have expressed their concerns as well. And we also of course, heard from the United States, a spokesman for the ambassador, saying that Ambassador nice has been very clear. In conversations with the Israeli government on the issue of preserving the status quo, just finally Eleni to say that Netanyahu put out a statement saying that there is no change to the status quo reiterating that position, Jews are still not and will not be allowed to pray on Temple Mount, Eleni.",

Three of the ministers representing three small parties in the coalition, essentially are committed at least their views, whether their policies end up in reality, it's something we have to watch. Committed to an anti- democratic, racist, Jewish supremacist homophobic view of where what is real should be and frankly, where it should be. So I think Ben Gvir's visit, it's certainly not the first for a Minister of Public Security. He now has a new title. He's the Minister for National Security. It isn't the First Minister of National Security, who has gone up to the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount. But given the context Eleni, given the fact that Ben Gvir has committed to changing the status quo and enshrining Jewish prayer on Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount, given the fact that he was so radical that he wasn't even inducted into the Israeli military, I think the steps have to be viewed in context.

Egyptians and Jordanians particularly Jordanians have a fundamental political stake in ensuring that the status quo and the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount is adhered to. The other interesting question which we haven't raised as, what about the Abraham Accords? Where about the relationship that the Israelis have established?

But I think, given the fact that there are so many conceivable possible fires that can be lit now, in and around Jerusalem, in Gaza, Hamas weighed in today. And they are eager to exploit the situation if it plays to their benefit and relationships Eleni between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs, which could also - the consequences.

What you are hearing though,is certainly some level of frustration with the military and intelligence leaders who allowed this to happen, who allowed so many Russian troops and, and equipment and weaponry to be essentially in the same place at the same time, especially on New Year's Eve when Russia was launching strikes of its own. It's essentially made these Russian troops an equipment sitting ducks and pretty easy targets as well. Some pro-Russian bloggers are accusing the military leaders of incompetence. Even 10 months into the war, saying that look, the lessons ought to have been learned by now that there are plenty of open buildings, plenty of places for Russian troops to station themselves so that they are dispersed and they're not concentrated in one single area. You also have pro-Russian former officials from the Donetsk People's Republic suggesting that look; the Russian military has underestimated the capability of the Ukrainian high Mar system. The U.S. supplied longer range; multiple launch artillery system that they say actually carried this out. And then you mentioned the death toll figures which are miles apart from one another. If you believe that Ukrainians, the death toll was some 400 with 300 injured, the official Russian numbers at this stage are just 63. But even a former pro-Russian official in that DPR region says that he expects that the final number is in the hundreds are at least more than 100. And if you look at the latest pictures from the scene, you can see that it is a pile of rubble, difficult to imagine how anyone could have survived this. This was what a vocational school in Makiivka was once. We also have satellite pictures which are a little bit blurry. But you can see in the center of them what was once that square there, that vocational school is seemingly obliterated. But obviously the view from the ground is much more poignant as there doesn't seem to be almost three days on now very much rescue efforts going on. It seems like heavy equipment trying to pick through the rubble and trying to count the dead. But again, we don't have any kind of confirmation from the Russian side as to how high or if that death toll will in fact increase.",

Most like the U.S. are saying that travelers need to get a negative COVID test within 48 hours of departure to the U.S. South Korea is requiring new arrivals to get COVID tests at Incheon Airport. And on the first day of this new measure, this was Monday; the authorities in Korea say that out of 309 new arrivals, they tested 61 positive cases. And they're restricting some flights until at least the end of the month trying to reduce the amount of travel coming in. Morocco going one step further, completely prohibiting any travel from China to its soil for the time being. Now there have been some studies put out one Chinese Health journal that says that in the main cities they believe that the peak of the outbreak has already been reached according to mathematical statistical models. But that they predict that the outbreak the infections will likely peak in rural areas and in the center and west of the country from the middle to the end of January and the infections will probably bloom as the study puts it due to the travel around the Spring Festival and the Lunar New Year. Other studies that have been out there have predicted that China could lose more than a million people due to COVID amid this outbreak. Ivan Watson CNN, Hong Kong.",
