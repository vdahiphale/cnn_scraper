There have been angry words, cancelled visits, and certainly a lack of communication. And that is why this moment, a handshake between the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen as such an important step forward. It came at the end of Blinken's two-day visit to Beijing. The meeting was not originally on Blinken's schedule, added at the last minute perhaps, as a sign that Beijing is ready to work with Washington more closely. Coming out of the meeting, we heard mostly encouraging words from the two sides to back that up. Mr. Xi spoke of a common understanding, adding that the U.S. and China had reached agreements. He talked of the importance of showing mutual respect and sincerity. And Blinken noted that his visit had been filled with candid and constructive conversations. Listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I came to Beijing to strengthen high-level channels of communication, to make clear our positions and intentions in areas of disagreement, and to explore areas where we might work together when our interests align on shared transnational challenges a nd we did all of that.",

And certainly, the president, the interior ministers, and others, as I said, have apologized for that inaction. Now, on the ground, many people were frustrated that they had warned the authorities, they'd warned the police. There were strange things happening in that forest, and it needed to be investigated. It ended up being Francis and private rescue mission that seemed to have unearthed this properly for the first time. And there is this awkward juxtaposition here. William Ruto, the country's President, is the first evangelical president in the country. Faith is very central to his rule. And of course, no one is suggesting that pastors will go to these lengths, but many people I spoke to said that they feel there needs to be more regulation of the religious sector in Kenya. They say that there are pastors who are taking advantage of people everyday, separating them from their well-earned money, promising things that they can't actually deliver. This, of course, allegedly what happened is a far more extreme case, and I think it should be placed into the context of the worst mass suicides that we have seen globally for many years now. And the cult following that this man allegedly developed is in line with previous instances of this kind of cults in the global context.

I mean, obviously Juneteenth celebrates the telling of American history, of black American history, which by the way is American history. What do you think that history is so important, not just for African Americans, but for all Americans? I think it's because without that history, we have an incomplete story. And we have to decide as a nation, and especially as a nation that puts on the forward face of being the symbol of democracy. We have to decide whether we're going to have the courage to live and acknowledge our full history and the history of what happened to Africa- Americans in this country, but not only what happened to them as enslaved people, but at same time, the contributions that they've made to this country, that's part of our full history.

Those works obviously have a huge impact on black Americans because as you point out, they tell a different story. You now have mainstream books where the main characters have the same perspective and cultural viewpoint as yourself, which is so powerful. Representation is so important for any African- American child.

And then you wonder if with this, you know, especially as we get pinned, this is kind of like, you know, non-literate society. Americans don't like to read anymore. Well, if that's the case, why are we so upset about these books? And then secondly, why are we so upset about these books that in particular around the world are celebrated books?
