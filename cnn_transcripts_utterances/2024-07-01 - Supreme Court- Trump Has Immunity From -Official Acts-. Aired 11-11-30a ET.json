If you're just joining us, the Supreme Court has finally released its ruling on this long awaited case, saying that Trump has immunity from official acts. In several cases, they, they cite what official acts may be, but they also leave a number of others open for lower courts to make a final determination on. We're going to be talking a lot about the legal implications of all this. Let me first bring in CNN's Van Jones and Scott Jennings. Van, as you look at this, what stands out to you?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a very concerning outcome. You know, there's a maxim that says in law, a bad facts create bad law. So when you have somebody doing such stuff, it's so terrible, the stuff that Trump did in office, it creates these bad facts. The court has come in and figure out what to do about it. It often creates bad law.Basically, the question is Supreme Court, do you more care about the unlawful conduct of a sitting president, or possibly the unfair prosecution of a former president? That's really what they had to balance. They're obviously more concerned about the ladder. And so I think politically, it's bad. It makes the Supreme Court look very partisan. They're supposed to be wearing these kind of black and white umpire jerseys or whatever. They look like they're wearing red jerseys, or even MAGA hats. It's going to go down bad politically, for Supreme Court. But it's also scary, because what is Trump going to do if Trump gets elected, and there's this idea that he can get away with even more stuff. That's really, really scary for the public, because he already ran over every norm that he could. So it seems like, I mean, it just doesn't look as politically not legally, politically, it's almost like a license to thug in a way, like, you can do whatever you want. And Supreme Court is probably going to let you get away with it. That is very frightening in this case. And so I'm very, very concerned.",

So some decisions could be made about differentiating between official and private acts. But look, this Court has stood up for the office of the presidency, and the executive power of the presidency in a way that, you know, maybe will have some benefit to future presidents. I mean, we're looking at this through the lens of Donald Trump.But, you know, the president of the United States has a lot of power for a reason. And they do take a lot of official actions. And I just, I think about a future where, you know, if it was open season on presidents for time immemorial, you know, what action would any president ever take out of fear of being dragged into a courtroom every time they did it? So I hear Van and I think there's interesting arguments on both sides of this today. I've listened to some of, you know, arguments like what Van has made. But at the same time, I do think the office deserves a lot of protection and a lot of deference because of the special place that it holds in our system. So I'm OK with it, especially because I think a lower court may have decisions to make in the future, of course, depending on the outcome of the election in November.",

They didn't.They say go through the whole process and you come back up here and then they wait 60 plus days past the buzzer, to give us this this decision, the way it's structured, this thing is going to ping pong back and forth for three or four more years. Maybe it seems like they're doing Donald Trump a favor when they don't have to. The ruling does seem to be much more concerned about unleashing the presidency than constraining the presidency. That's fine except that there's a different balance here. [11:05:02] Now you're concerned about a renegade president. You're concerned about a renegade president prosecuting someone unfairly after the fact or acting like a rogue or a thug in office. It's not clear what's the greater threat to the Republic and it doesn't seem like the majority really is taken as seriously the concern of half the country about renegade presidency in the office. I think the Supreme Court is hurting itself. There was, I believe, a way to come to a better outcome, a quicker outcome and outcome that better balanced the interest here. What I think people got to take away from this, Donald Trump has a Supreme Court that will let him do whatever he wants to. And that is terrifying.",

I actually agree with Van that I think a majority of Americans would have preferred a resolution to all this, a debt clearing before they had to make a decision on voting in November. I think he's right about that. However, on the renegade presidency point, look, the Constitution does give the United States Congress a way to rein in any president at any time they feel like it, and it's called impeachment. And he was impeached twice and he was acquitted twice.But at the end of the day, this is the wisdom of the founders. They gave us the ultimate political tool to rein in any presidency at any time they felt like. And the other people who can rein in a president are the voters. And voters in November, ultimately, you're going to look at all this and make decisions about whether they're comfortable with Donald Trump or Joe Biden, given the circumstances we know about today. So even if you're upset about the legal decision today, remember, we have political processes in place. And this is another reminder that if the Congress so chose, it could reclaim the power given to it by the Constitution to do a lot of things at any time it wants. It's not done that much lately, but it could if it felt like it.",

I think the founders really believed in something which we don't talk about much, which is called Republican virtues, not Republican versus Democrat, that even existed then. But that anyone who we would elevate, would have the virtues to preserve the Republic, that that was -- they -- you looked at the Federalist Papers, they didn't imagine that you would have people elevated that act the way that Donald Trump is acting and act the way a lot of people in public office act today.So this is a real test. I'm concerned. It's a real test. If you have someone in office who has no respect for the law, no respect for Republican virtues, no respect for the Constitution, no respect for norms. And then you have a Supreme Court that says, well, you know what, we've never before had to look at whether you could commit crimes. Supreme Court says there's some crimes you can commit. That's scary, man. That's not, I mean, you can't just hope that somehow, you know, the Senate, which is broken, is going to fix this. The Supreme Court is functioning.

And I would think that in some of these extreme circumstances, that people who are worried about this ruling keep laying out. Ultimately the United States Congress can take control of the U.S. government and throw the president out of office any time they feel like. So I guess, I'm not as worried about the extremities here.

And this is where he's going to stay, again, behind bars in this low security federal prison for four months. Now, he is of course trying to cast this as a political prosecution. And when I talked to him just a couple of days ago, he predicted that he would be even more powerful in prison than he is now. He said, I will have a much bigger impact on the campaign when I'm in prison than I have now. He was also very clear to his fans that he didn't want them spending their time writing him words of support or condolences while he's behind bars. He wants them working to reelect former President Trump in 2024. So that's sort of his messaging.

Team Biden says they believe democracy institutions, Trump trying to subvert the election is the number one issue. A lot of Democrats have said, sir, the cost of living is the number one issue.
