For certain people of a certain age, they remember, if you hear Luther Vandross's voice, like if you watch \"The Wiz,\" there's a moment in \"The Wiz\" where you hear his voice even though he's not on camera because he sings on the soundtrack.

And we start this hour with a close eye on the continuing weather threats across the country. This is a possible tornado spotted near Houston, Texas. The Storm Prediction Center has increased the tornado risk for parts of the south, while in the west, atmospheric river fueled storms are expected to bring flash flooding. This is happening after severe weather ripped through Texas. The National Weather Service confirmed five tornadoes touched down around Houston on Thursday, which damaged several homes. This waterspout was caught on camera just outside of Houston, Texas. Now 7 million people are under the threat of severe weather. So let's go straight to meteorologist Tyler Mauldin, who is in the CNN Weather Center. So, Tyler, a tornado watch issued earlier today for parts of the south has now been extended. What are you learning?",

That tornado watch you mentioned is for portions of east Texas, the majority of Louisiana, and a portion of Mississippi as well. That will continue through late afternoon. We have had confirmed tornadoes on the ground. We currently have a tornado warning just to the north of Houston for Liberty County for the next 15 minutes.This line has had a confirmed tornado on the ground. And any of this activity here across the southeast has the potential of spawning a tornado. In fact, we could see EF-2 tornadoes or higher. Those are strong, destructive, and at times long-lived tornadoes. We have a level four out of five threat here across the southeast. To put that into perspective for you, we have only had 12 other days this year that featured a level four out of five severe weather threat. So it doesn't happen very often. We're going to see the threat of severe weather continue on through tonight and then into tomorrow, as well, as this system shifts to the east. We're dealing with a couple of things here. We have a weather system that is getting its act together as it pushes eastbound, and then you add in some unstable air here across the southeast, little breaks of sunshine adding more in the way of instability. And that's going to lead to just more in the way of severe thunderstorms and the potential for large hail and tornadoes here across the southeast. It's not until tomorrow afternoon, late evening, that we see it diminish. Typically, we see the most tornadoes during the spring. That's when you think of tornado season, you think of the spring tornado season. However, we do have some secondary tornado seasons, one being in late fall and early winter, AKA December, where we see on average 43 tornadoes. This year, this is the last weekend of the year, and this year has been well above average in terms of tornadic activity. So it's very fitting that were ending the last weekend of 2024 with yet another tornado outbreak. And this is what we're going to be watching for the next 48 hours. We're already beginning to see some of the rain off of this system move into the mid-Atlantic and the northeast. That is potentially going to cause some delays for you, some issues for you if you're traveling home for the holidays. And then, as you mentioned at the beginning, we do have an atmospheric river setting up across the pacific northwest, and that is leading to some wintry mischief there across the pacific northwest. We've got the potential for strong wind as well as rain and some snowfall in the higher elevations as well.",

Putin stopped short of any sort of claim of responsibility for this fatal crash but acknowledged that Russian air defense systems had been active in the area where the plane was intended to land in Grozny. And of course, this comes as there had been drone activity in the region, Ukrainian drone strikes in parts of southern Russia, according to the Kremlin, also targeting the area of Grozny. And that had been a key area of inquiry and concern. We'd heard from the Azerbaijani officials and authorities who had said that the plane had faced external, physical, and technical interference.And as you mentioned, we have been hearing reports from U.S. officials as well as from military and aviation experts who have said that the fuselage damage, the holes and perforations in the wreckage, appeared to suggest that there may have been some sort of external explosion, perhaps, perhaps likely as well, with the impact of air defense systems. And as you mentioned, we have been hearing from some of those eyewitnesses, some of those survivors who, remarkably, were able to come out of that crash alive.

They were evacuated from the hospital. And one nurse told us what happened next.

In a new legal brief filed on Friday, he's urging the Supreme Court to pause an impending ban on the social media platform set to take effect in just three weeks.

So Donald Trump's argument here in asking for this delay on the ban on TikTok is, one, because the ban is slated to go into effect on January 19th, just one day before Inauguration Day when he is set to be sworn into office. But also because he argues that he hopes such a delay in implementation could allow his incoming administration to try and work out some sort of negotiation that could save the app.Now, of course, as you mentioned, this is putting Donald Trump at odds with the Biden administration, which filed its own brief on Friday, arguing that the national security concerns around TikTok are so great that this ban needs to be implemented on time. And they urged the Supreme Court to uphold the ban as well as its date. Now, in this brief from Donald Trump, he did not address the main questions that this case poses in front of the Supreme Court, which is, you know, the Supreme Court has to weigh whether or not they believe this ban violates First Amendment rights. But this is what Donald Trump said in this briefing. It said, quote, \"President-Elect Trump urges the court to stay the statutes effective date to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\" Now, just from knowing Donald Trump and talking to his team about this, one thing is very much clear throughout all of this is that Donald Trump recognizes that TikTok is very popular. It has 170 million monthly users here in the United States. And Donald Trump also believes that many of the young people who voted for him did so because of their use of TikTok and the videos that they saw on the app. All to say, Donald Trump has said recently, as recent as this month, that he is warming to TikTok for some of these reasons. I want you to take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We'll take a look at TikTok. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points. And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. We did go on TikTok, and we had a great response. We had billions of views, billions and billions of views. Maybe we got to keep this sucker around a little while, you know? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So unclear if that played a role, if their new relationship has played a role in this.But what Donald Trump really wants here is to see if he can get an extension on this ban if they can put a pause on this controversial ban and try to find a way for his administration to work out some sort of resolution with TikTok. One thing, of course, that we still don't know, though, is if Donald Trump is going to continue to push for TikTok to be divested from its Chinese owner, ByteDance. That is really where all of this comes down to. And that's why, back during his first administration, he had signed that executive order that would have effectively banned TikTok, then also citing national security concerns. So again, its unclear what's going to happen here. And also, the Supreme Court really is the one who is going to be making the deciding, the deciding factor here. Rahel?",

So Walmart, John Deere, Molson Coors, you just have a lineup of companies that are taking a step back on DEI.

They're not saying that diversity is bad for its business or that they don't want to continue to attract a wide range of employees. They're kind of making tweaks at the edges to try to kind of stave off some of the rightwing pressure, but certainly they're not going as far as Costco, which is just really pushing back very strongly. But Rahel, it is important to note, though, that even though you have rightwing activists saying that DEI is going away in corporate America, that is really not the case.

Companies like Synchron and Elon Musk's Neuralink, they have begun implanting BCI devices into people's brains to help people who are losing motor functions still be able to perform daily tasks. Earlier this year, I met Mark. He is an ALS patient who has mostly lost the ability to use his arms, and we saw firsthand how Synchron's Stentrode device helped send messages on his computer and even play a game like Pong. He hopes this technology can help him, can help other patients struggling as well with paralysis, maintain as much independence as possible.",

Nowadays, they're in our food, they're in our clothing, they're in the air we breathe. And now we're starting to get a better understanding of their potential impact on our health. There was a study that found people with micro or nano-plastics in their carotid arteries were twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke or die from any other cause over the next three years compared to people who had none. GUPTA (voice-over):  If you're a parent, I know you're going to understand this. DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL:  Forty-eight percent, nearly half of parents, are saying on most days they're completely overwhelmed by their stress. GUPTA (voice-over):  This summer, the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued an advisory calling parental stress a public health concern, saying that we need a cultural shift with both individual and government intervention. Parents are working more than ever, and childcare demands have only increased, leaving many families feeling exhausted, burned out, perpetually behind. That's what Murthy said. It's no secret that diet plays a major role in our health. And while we know the benefits of healthy food, the harms of ultra-processed food are now coming into clearer focus. Ultra-processed foods make up nearly 70 percent of our country's food supply. Numerous studies have found that consuming higher amounts of these foods raises the risk of obesity, but also the development of chronic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and it probably even shortens lifespan. Researchers are now trying to figure out if ultra-processed ingredients are all created equal. An alarming spread of bird flu throughout dairy herds across the United States has scientists on edge.",

There may be more hope for Alzheimer's patients than ever. A new study led by Dr. Dean Ornish found that some patients who underwent lifestyle interventions alone, like eating a vegan diet, exercising daily, practicing stress reduction, they saw improved cognition, even signs of reversal of the disease. I got to see this firsthand, meeting patients all over the country. MIKE CARVER, ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT:  This is the best I can do to stay alive. And I want to live with my wife as long as I can. GUPTA (voice-over):  We also did see promise in newly approved pharmaceutical interventions, including monoclonal antibody treatments -- Donanemab, for example -- demonstrating the ability to slow the progression of the disease. For decades, we only saw incremental progress in treating this disease. But now, I have to say, these options are giving patients new hope. This year, we traveled around the world, investigating the impact of the GLP-1 weight loss drugs. With no signs of slowing in popularity now, these drugs have given us new insight into obesity as a disease.",

My cravings went away.GUPTA (voice-over):  We now consider obesity a disease of the brain, a revelation that I think has lifted a sense of guilt associated with this disease, helped us get to a better understanding of how to treat it as well. DR. DAN SKOVRONSKY, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER. ELI LILLY:  It's definitely true that there are people out there who've said time and again, obesity is not really a disease. All you need to do is eat better and exercise more and you'll be OK. GUPTA (voice-over):  While these drugs may not be for everyone, we have seen how they can transform people's lives, physically, yes, but also emotionally. We've only, at this point, begun to unlock the possibilities. Studies have found that these drugs could be associated with cardiovascular benefits, lowering the risk of certain cancers, curbing cravings as well beyond food, like nicotine and alcohol. And I'm sure we're going to continue to learn a lot more about this in 2025. Happy New Year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
