We are live from the heart of Madrid at the iconic Puerta del Sol, where part of the city, and indeed the country, is counting down the last moments of 2024. Right now, as you can see here, surrounding me, there are the first persons that are getting the best spots of this square here. The authorities estimate that are going to gather around 15,000 people to enjoy this very special day. And as they did, we decided to be live here. Boris, because of the main character that you can see behind me, that clock tower, that is the one that is going to stroke at midnight. But it's important to say here is that here in Spain, we celebrate things a little bit different. We ring into next years in fruit style. Let me tell you why. That's it. That's the reason why here Spaniards, we believe that the grapes bring life luck. We actually call it the 12 grapes of luck. Las doce uvas de la suerte. And actually, what we do, Boris, is when the clock gets to midnight, per each bell chime with one grape. And actually, if you manage to do so, then you're in for a year of prosperity and luck. Some people believe that this is -- some believe that it is a choking hazard, in my case that I'm a slow eater. Actually, it's a race against time, but I cannot complain because actually the last years have been very good for me.

And we don't have it here on our terrace. But there are a million people down there on the Champs-Elysees waiting to see this show and what you're going to have after that light and sound show on the Arc de Triomphe is a spectacular fireworks display. And of course, if you're not feeling very well, but you do actually have here on the public terrace where we are the best point of view on this, on this fireworks display, it's going to start and it is spectacular every year. Of course, for a couple of years there was COVID. They didn't have the traditional display. It got it came back and it was amazing last year. Last year was all about the summer Olympics. Paris Olympics, of course, were coming here, so it was all about the sports lit up on the Arc de Triomphe. You had the archers, all the different athletes. Now we expect to have a sort of remembrance of that, a reminder of what happened here over the summer when Paris hosted the Olympics and it turned so extraordinary. It really was fantastic.
