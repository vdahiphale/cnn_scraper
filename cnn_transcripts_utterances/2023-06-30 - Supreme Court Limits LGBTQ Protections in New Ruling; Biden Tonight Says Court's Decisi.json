First, all six conservative justices ruling in favor of a Christian web designer from Colorado who refused to create wedding websites from same-sex couples citing religious grounds. She objected to a Colorado law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, saying it violated her free speech rights. Justice Neil Gorsuch agreed, writing for the majority, the First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands. Colorado cannot deny that promise.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Wolf. Reaction has been pouring in all day even though Congress is on recess, and, not surprisingly, the responses are falling entirely along party lines.Republicans are just thrilled with the outcomes here. They're crediting former President Donald Trump with swinging the court in a conservative direction and making these rulings possible, and they are particularly pleased with the decision to end Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program. That is something that Republicans have been fighting against in Congress. And I want to read you part of the statement from Mitch McConnell. He is the Senate minority leader. He wrote, the president of the United States cannot hijack 20-year-old emergency powers to pad the pockets of its high earning base and make suckers out of working families who choose not to take on student debt. But, Wolf, I can tell you that inside the GOP, there is some concern there could actually be some voter backlash over this issue because student loan forgiveness is popular. And so that is why you're seeing some in the GOP now pushing for legislation to lower education costs. And, similarly, the GOP has been notably a lot less vocal in that other Supreme Court ruling from today, which determined a Christian website designer can deny services to a same-sex couple. Both Speaker Kevin McCarthy and McConnell put out statements relatively quickly praising the student loan decision but they still have not weighed in on the gay rights case. And I think that just really shows you, Wolf, that this continues to be a politically tricky issue for Republicans as over the last decade or so public support for gay marriage has dramatically shifted. So, you get a sense why Republicans are reluctant to weigh in on that case. And, meanwhile, Democrats are just devastated and furious with what has transpired this week. It has been setback after setback. Democrats now, urging Joe Biden to try to come up with some sort of plan B to provide relief for student loan borrowers. They are renewing their calls to reform or pack the Supreme Court. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been especially outspoken today. I want to read you, part of his statement, because it was pretty scathing. He wrote, the fanatical MAGA right have captured the Supreme Court and achieved dangerous progressive policies that they can never obtain at a ballot box. These MAGA-captured Supreme Court feels free to accept lavish gifts and vacations from their powerful, big-monied friends, all while they refuse to help every day Americans. So, we'll see how Democrats try to use this as rallying cry in the next election, the way they did with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. But for right now, it is clear that these, last round of opinions from the Supreme Court have delivered a massive disappointment for Democrats while delivering a big victory for the right, Wolf.",

And he does in any way it end to Supreme Court says, you didn't have the power to do.And so for the average Republican out there, it's like, well, you knew it was unconstitutional and you did it anyway.

So, his whereabouts still unclear, and this is not a guy who's been publicity shy over the past months.

You know, they are critical in this report of President Biden's withdrawal timeline, saying that the withdrawal timeline for the military, the quick retrograde created challenges for the State Department, also saying that the non- combatant evacuation operation that was stood up at the Pentagon didn't have a clear lead at the State Department coordinating with them. There wasn't someone on the seventh floor here at the State Department, which is where the secretary of state sits, who was the person in the lead in terms of coordinating the crisis response to this situation. And it also paints a picture of just how the inability to put these processes in place actually impacted Afghans and U.S. allies. And I want to read to you a quote from the report detailing that, saying that senior administration officials had not made clear decisions regarding the universe of at-risk Afghans who would be included by the time the operation started, nor had they determined where those Afghans would be taken. They added significantly -- that added significantly to the challenges the department and DOD faced during the evacuation. So, of course, it's clear that there was a lot of confusion because of the lack of adequate planning that was put into place.

They effectively have a first mortgage before they have a mortgage on a home.And the result is that it puts a chill on the economy, it curbs what young people can do with their future. They can't pursue the career path that they might choose because they can't afford to. And it has untold negative consequences on our economy. And these same voices that are attacking the Biden administration for trying to lighten the load of students, they were fine to accept PPP loans, business loans. They were fine with debt forgiveness of businesses. But when it comes to young people trying to get a higher education, apparently, no, they would say the administration doesn't have that power.
