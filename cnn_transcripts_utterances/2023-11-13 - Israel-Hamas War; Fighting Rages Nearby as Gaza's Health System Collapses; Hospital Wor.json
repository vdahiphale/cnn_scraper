We are talking about the Al-Shifa Hospital, I can show you where that is, that's right here on the map right there. Now, the \"New York Times\" describes the back and forth over this as saying that this hospital has emerged as a symbol of the other side's inhumanity. In other words, each side saying, the other one is using this hospital for ill gains.What are we talking about here? Well, Gaza health officials are saying that people are dying inside this hospital because fuel and supplies can't get in, there are people dying. And \"Reuters\" has released video of babies inside this hospital right now. These were babies born. They needed to be taken out of the incubators and put down on this bed like this next to warm water which is how they could be kept warm now. Now, it is worth noting, Israel says, it has delivered full. The IDF has delivered fuel to the hospital. You can see this picture right here released by the IDF with soldiers delivering fuel to the hospital. Israel says, Hamas would not let the fuel get inside where it was needed. Now, health officials say, it wasn't enough fuel and it wasn't safe enough to go get it. One other thing, Israel says, consistently, and it said this for years, that Hamas is using these hospitals and its patients as human shields and has a massive tunnel operation system, a terrorist tunnel system, underneath this hospital. And the IDF just released video from another hospital, Al-Quds, we're trying to get this video cleared right now of what they say is a terrorist with a rocket propelled grenade launcher at the entrance of this hospital, the Al-Quds Hospital. Israel is saying this just shows how Hamas is using these hospitals as shields. Let's get the very latest. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Jerusalem in the midst of this standoff with patients. Oren, let's be clear, caught in the middle.",

You have what's happening on the streets outside of Shifa Hospital, outside of Al-Quds Hospital, where there is a heavy IDF presence, engaging in gunfights in an incredibly populated -- densely populated area. And then you have what's happening inside Shifa Hospital. This, as we've seen over the last few days, the rapid collapse of much of what's left of the healthcare system within Gaza.The Red Cross says, the healthcare system there is past the point of no return. Al-Quds Hospital, the second largest hospital, went out of service this weekend. Shifa Hospital, again, the largest hospital, all of its essential units have closed, and parts of the hospital have simply had to shut down. As you point out, the neonatal intensive care unit, whose incubators rely on generators, three babies there died over the weekend because those incubators went offline. They're now trying to keep babies there warm with hot water next to foil, that's just a hint of the condition inside the hospital as they try to somehow treat 650 patients with thousands taking shelter inside there. We have seen the images. They are horrible of what's in there. The doctors and officials there describe how difficult the situation is, trying to work without fuel, much food, water, electricity. To the point of the 300 liters of fuel, in fact we'll get to that in a second. Listen to this from the World Health Organization describing the condition there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MARGARET HARRIS, W.H.O SPOKESPERSON:  The babies aren't on life support anymore. The life support stopped. Their lungs are immature. They don't breathe normally like a normal baby does. So, there is so little time and so much need. And it -- with -- we want to make it clear to the world, hospitals should be safe havens. But they're being transformed in Gaza into scenes of death, devastation and despair. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are, or were, at least, IRGC members on the ground. The U.S. believes it's unclear how many, if any, were killed in the strikes. But this is the U.S. trying to calibrate how to respond. It doesn't want to see an escalation, but it also wants to make sure Iran gets the message that they can't keep these attacks up on U.S. forces.",

He's also a Democratic candidate running for Congress in Maryland.It's good to see you, Joel. Let's start where they ended here. An operation like these, hitting facilities in Syria used by Iran's IRGC and groups affiliated with it. I've seen this described as a significant escalation for the Biden administration. Do you see it that way? I mean, what do strikes like this in Syria do? JOEL RUBIN (D-MD), FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Yes, Kate. It's great to be with you. There's a reason why we have forces in Syria, and that's to deter the Islamic State from recommitting itself to the fight against our allies in the region and potentially striking us here at home. Now, these forces, though, are exposed and there has been a detente for a number of years. Iran's decision to strike our forces through its proxies does put the region at higher risk. I think that it's crucial to continue to ensure that there is deterrence against that. You know, the big picture of question here is what will Hezbollah do? Will Hezbollah enter the fight from Southern Lebanon into Northern Israel and really expand this into a regional war? And President Biden's decision to continue to strike outside of that theater and ensure that there is a response, hopefully gets the message across to Iran that the United States is serious and that it should not unleash Hezbollah. But this is certainly a big concern to see these strikes and to see the number of American soldiers that have been hurt. And now, clearly with those killed in action on the other side, I -- probably we'll see -- we probably will see continued strikes back and forth in Syria and elsewhere.",

RUBINBy Hamas taking this action though, what we have seen now is from Iran a real circling the wagons on the resistance movement, and an argument now that they are allies of the Palestinian rights, interested in supporting Palestinian attacks against Israel. And for Iran, they may very well see this as a moment to, not just strike Israel, but to push the United States out of the Middle East and disrupt our alliances. So, this is a very significant moment. We just saw them embraced over the weekend at Arab League meetings and Islamic conference meetings. And so, it's incumbent upon us to not let this spiral out into a direct war with Iran, but certainly they see this now as an opportunity to take advantage of rather than calm things down to expand and increase the hostility and the fighting in the region.",

There is a dispute between Israel and the people running the hospital over whether fuel was offered to help, keep it running or not, and the circumstances around it.There's also new reporting. The IDF says, it's killed a group of Hamas fighters embedded, they say, among civilians at the entrance of another Gaza hospital, the second largest hospital in Gaza. It feels like something has to give soon with regard to the hospitals and the civilians that are being caught in the midst of this. What more can the Biden administration be doing here?",
