If you celebrate I'm Richard Quest in London, at Easter, Passover or Ramadan, I mean business. Good evening. It is worth just pausing and wishing you the very best for whatever you might be celebrating if that is your religion, and joining us for tonight if it's not. Tonight, the US labor market is slowing down and the Federal Reserve now has plenty to think about with the flight of inflation. Two hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs were added in March. Now, that was bang in line with expectation. It is the smallest number in more than a year. You can see over here, perhaps in December, but it is the smallest number in a year and that is extremely significant because it shows wage -- it shows us that job growth is slowing, which is exactly what you would expect to see with rising interest rates. Wages are up 4.2 percent year-on-year, the lowest reading since mid-2021. That tells us that the pricing pressure of employment is starting to reduce. It's still too high that number, but it is moving in downward path. The unemployment rate fell a tenth of a percent and remains there in multi- decade lows. It's computed a different way, and I say this every month to you. I say this every month that it is computed in a different way so we won't take too much notice of that. Rahel Solomon is in New York and we will certainly take notice of you, Rahel. And now if I look at this, so this is really interesting, because the medicine is starting to work, and I guess, forget what they are going to do at the next meeting, the issue is whether we are going to get a rush of medicine, and suddenly, you know, the whole lot is going to be too much.",

A cooling as you pointed out, but a very gradual cooling. This is perhaps the best way that the Fed could expect to see it. Two hundred thirty-six thousand, as you pointed out, and you saw in that bar chart, which I think we can pull up for you again, that that was the lowest job growth we have seen this year, but also the lowest job growth we have seen, Richard, in quite some time. Wages have started to cool. But here is what I found really interesting, and I think we can pull this up for you, Richard. But what I found really interesting is that labor force participation, that also ticked up to levels that we have not seen since March of 2020, and we know why that data is so important. We saw almost half a million people jump into the labor force, add into the labor force, so that has to be music to the eyes of the Fed, who of course, has been hoping for more supply of workers in terms of this supply imbalance we've had in the labor force. So certainly some good news on the labor force participation side, certainly some good news on the supply side, and job growth, gradually slowing perhaps as good as you could expect in this environment.

Interesting to see what next month will bring, that said, so, this is a gradual slowing. I certainly understand your point and I should argue, by the way, that folks who are seeing a report like this and think, well, maybe the Fed will just sort of, you know, slap his hands and say, all right, I think we can rest on our laurels here, I'm not so sure about that.

At the West Bank -- in the West Bank two British Israeli sisters were killed in a shooting. A Qatari official says the country is trying to deescalate tensions through mediation. And Israel's Foreign Minister has also spoken to his Turkish counterpart who is urging calm. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz who we'll be talking to, in just a moment live in Israel. For the moment, here's her latest report, which puts it all into context. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):   A day that began with rockets from Gaza that struck a home in Sderot. No one was killed in the attack, the latest in a wave of missiles fired from Gaza in Southern Lebanon in recent days. Violence also spread to the West Bank on Friday. There, two Israeli sisters were killed and their mother seriously wounded in the shooting, described by Israeli forces as a terrorist attack. Hamas praised the deadly attack as a heroic act of resistance. In recent days, a major escalation across the region has raised fears of a wider conflict. This is the latest catalyst. Israeli Police twice stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque Wednesday. Overnight footage showed the dramatic raid. Israeli forces hitting worshippers with rifle butts and batons. Israeli Police say they entered the Mosque after hundreds of rioters barricaded themselves inside and that their officers were attacked with stones and fireworks. Palestinians in the wider Muslim world see the raid on the Mosque as a provocation, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. Condemnation quickly poured in, as well as rockets from two directions, Southern Lebanon and Gaza. ABDELAZIZ (on camera):   It all begins and ends at the Holy Site you see behind me here, known as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims or the Temple Mount to Jews, it is dictated by a decade's old agreement that says only Muslims can pray at the site. Some non-Muslims are allowed at certain times at the complex, but any violation, real or perceived that so-called status quo agreement could quickly ignite tensions. ABDELAZIZ (voice over):   And many Palestinians fear that's exactly what's happening. There have been calls by Jewish extremist groups to slaughter goats at the Mosque compound during Passover. And in January, an inflammatory visit by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Ben- Gvir drew international condemnation. He is convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. Prime Minister Netanyahu has insisted his government is not seeking to change rules that the Holy Site. On Friday, tens of thousands gathered at the steps of Al-Aqsa Mosque after a peaceful prayer service. Banners read, \"Al-Aqsa is a red line.\" Another said \"Do not test our patience.\" The US, UN, and other members of the international community have called for restraint and calm, but with two weeks of Ramadan left and the Passover Holiday underway, it remains a sensitive time in a deeply sensitive place.

Easter has coincided. And then of course, there's the larger picture here, Richard. There has been a massive escalation in the region. The catalyst for that was an Israeli Police raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque earlier this week, that, of course, was seen as a provocation by the Muslim world, again, particularly because it is Ramadan. A condemnation from the Muslim world quickly poured in, as well as rockets were fired from two different locations from Southern Israel and from Gaza in recent days. Those coming from Southern Israel was a huge barrage. So all of this mixing in at this time, and now this additional terror attack in Tel Aviv, this will absolutely be heartbreaking news for people across the region -- Richard.",

We are only getting the details just right now. But yes, if you are looking at the larger context here, you are looking at the most far-right government in Israel's history coming into place under Prime Minister Netanyahu. There are serious fears and concerns among Palestinians that that could shift the so-called status quo of one of the Holiest Sites for Muslims, one of the Holiest Sites for Jews, and that is Temple Mount as it is known to Jews, the Noble Sanctuary as it is known to Muslims. Many Muslims fearing that that status quo again, that agreement that allows only Muslims to pray at that site, people of other faiths, non-Muslims are allowed to visit on certain occasions, that larger compound, but only Muslims allowed to pray on that site. There is fear that that status quo changes. There is fear as to what it means for many Palestinians to have this most far-right government in place. And of course, we've seen that judicial overhaul and the mass protest movement that it has led to for the last few weeks. But again, you're looking at a time that is extremely sensitive. It is Passover, there was already a horrifying terror attack just a few hours ago today. This yet another one. This right now is a moment of mourning, a moment of fear, a moment of heartbreak for those celebrating Passover, and getting these news reports of yet another terror attack just today -- Richard.",

So, this could be the last time. We all hope that's not the case. This is his 25th Masters. He's won it five times. He loves it. The patrons love seeing him here. But he's got his work cut out for him this afternoon. He's got about nine holes still to play. He's currently two over par. The projected cut line is three over par. So, he has a bit of wiggle room. Everybody's hoping that he stays in the tournament and plays the last two rounds. He hasn't missed the cut here since the mid-90s, since he turned professional. So, the expectation is that he's always here but he's going to have to fight to make sure.",
