I'm Boris Sanchez alongside Brianna Keilar in our nation's capital.Luigi Mangione right now is in a federal courtroom in New York facing a federal judge amid new charges from the Department of Justice. He allegedly shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in the back, killing the father of two on December 4th. This is separate from the New York State murder charges because Mangione is now facing a federal murder charge along with other federal charges, including stalking. And this federal complaint also reveals some new details.",

He was surrounded by New York officers and also officials, even including the mayor, Eric Adams.

      "sentences": "So just some more information from court before we get to that, I'm reading here. It says that Mangione answered yes. So we heard from him in court. He answered yes twice to confirm he understands his rights and he has seen the federal complaint against him.The judge, who is Judge Parker, is reviewing the charges in the complaint. So as this first appearance gets underway, as we expected, they are now - the judge is now explaining the charges to him, Luigi Mangione answering yes twice to the judge, confirming he understands his rights and he has seen the federal charges against him. His attorneys would have shown that to him. They met with him right before the court proceeding. And now the judge is going through that process with him, as we would normally see in a first appearance. But this is quite different than most cases and anything we have seen certainly in quite some time. To your question, Boris, the notebook; the notebook is a key piece of evidence here for the FBI and for federal prosecutors. From what they lay out in the federal complaint, there is new information. And that new information has to deal with the planning that went into this, the entries that Mangione made in October talking about this. Then again, in August, where he wrote about how he waited to do this, that he's happy he procrastinated because allegedly it gave him more time to learn about things. The other thing about the notes is the focus and how he allegedly talks about the insurance companies and also talks about this one very striking quote in the pages of the notebook, in allegedly Mangione's handwriting, where he writes the word wack. And it's quoted as the word wack, W-A-C-K, allegedly referring to the CEO and saying how he would do this attack at this conference. So key pieces of evidence for prosecutors, but I thought that word was just so striking to hear that word, to hear that, to see that in that complaint. And again, the complaint really talks about a lot of the evidence that the NYPD had gathered. That evidence is now in the hands of federal prosecutors and the FBI. And the other thing now, these charges are much different. Look, certainly the state charges were very significant. He was facing life in prison. But now he's eligible because of these federal charges. He could be eligible for the death penalty. That is a decision that will be made, you know, far down the line during the Trump administration under the new attorney general, who will have to personally make that decision. So certainly a long road ahead for Luigi Mangione now that he's facing potentially the death penalty. In terms of the state case, we'll see where that goes and if he really ever appears in a state court on those murder charges.",

Let's dig deeper on this now with John Miller. He's a CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. We also have Misty Marris, a trial and defense attorney. Thank you both for being with us. Misty, first to you. I'm struck by the fact that Mangione changed out of that orange jumpsuit and he's now wearing street clothes, apparently dressed kind of a bit like a prepster. He's wearing like a white button-down shirt, a navy pullover, khaki pants. Why would his attorneys have him change before going into federal court?",

But that is what we saw happening from that helipad all the way to the courthouse.So it's likely that his attorneys made a request that he is able to appear not in that orange jumpsuit. Part of that can be to avoid prejudice down the line very often. That type of thing can matter, that they don't want the person to be viewed as guilty before stepping into trial. It is absolutely an attorney's request that was made that was granted by the judge in this instance.",

Nevertheless, quite the split screen for the New York mayor's office.John, if you could talk to us about the significance of this evidence that we'd not seen before that was included in the federal complaint in which Mangione was writing as of August, talking about insurance being his target.

      "sentences": "Well, it might, or it might work certainly to his detriment. Murder is generally not a federal charge. Generally, that's a state charge, and he's charged with murder by state prosecutors, but this is interesting. In the three-page, what they call claim of responsibility that was allegedly found on his person in his handwriting, it's addressed at the top of the page, to the feds, which means he assumed that at some point he would be tracked down, identified, captured and probably by the FBI. So that wasn't a surprise to him.It certainly came as a surprise to state prosecutors, who only learned last night that the FBI would be taking their prisoner into custody as a state Supreme Court justice was waiting in a courtroom to arraign him. But the new evidence that is cited in the complaint talks about his description in his own handwriting, not in the claim of responsibility note, but in a separate spiral notebook. Now, Boris and Brianna, he refers to this spiral notebook in the claim of responsibility, allegedly, by saying the plans are in the spiral notebook, and you can look there for that. Don't try to get into my electronics because they're pretty locked down. So he basically directs them to this notebook. But he talks about his intent, as Shimon told us, to whack the CEO of one of the insurance companies at its investor conference, saying that one and a half months, this investor conference is a true windfall, and most importantly, the message becomes self-evident. You would interpret that to say it's the investors conference. The conference is the very symbol of how the top health insurance provider company in the United States, the fifth largest company at the time in America behind Apple, Google and Wal-Mart is their meeting with their investors, talking about how much money they're making, and that killing him at what they describe in this note as the bean counters conference has its own symbolism, what does he say, because the message becomes self-evident. He also talks about the details finally coming together. I'm glad, in a way. I procrastinated. Because it allowed me to learn more about that company, the target is insurance, because it checks every box. What he's saying there is his larger problem, you could interpret that as meaning, is with the health care industry in general. But the insurance company is where all the costs and where the consumer may get shorted, where it all comes together. So in this complaint, we learned a lot.",

She was talking to the judge. And I'm not quoting here, but - so in essence, what she was saying to the judge was that she was kind of surprised by this today. And that - hold on, I'm sorry, I'm just losing - let me go back.She says she's seeking clarity about the situation between the federal district and the state case. And that she says she was prepared to go in arraignment on the state charges today in state court. And according to our producer in there, she's suggested, Karen Agnifilo suggested, that Bragg's office, this is the district attorney of Manhattan who brought those state charges, that he may have not known that there were federal charges being brought against Mangione. You know, we've been speaking all morning about just how unprecedented all of this has been. We all were gathered outside the state court, the media, because we were expecting that Mangione would appear in state court. And then at the last minute, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office here announcing that they were taking custody of Mangione. And now we're hearing from his attorney, Mangione's attorney, that she's seeking clarity about that. What happened here, perhaps completely irrelevant, but we can already see her forming some kind of defense. You know, she's going to perhaps try to argue here. I'm just trying to see one other thing here. She's also saying that Bragg, the Manhattan DA, didn't mention federal charges during his press conference. That's true. I was there. And so she wants clarity about where there are one or two investigations. And so that is the update. And last we heard that Mangione, he is still in court. The judge has left the bench. It's unclear why. And that Mangione at this moment is standing at - his attorneys and explaining things for him. And so now we are being told that the proceedings are over. Our reporter inside, Kara Scannell, is saying that everyone is walking out of the courtroom. Mangione is leaving the courtroom and that his ankles were shackled. And so now he has left the courtroom. The proceedings are over. We finally heard something from his attorney. We hope to hear more from her as she leaves here. It'll be really the first time, I mean, that we will hear from her any significance. So the proceedings are now over. We wait to hear where Mangione will be housed, where he will be jailed as he awaits trial. They were not seeking bail in this case. Certainly the defense agreed it seems that that would not be appropriate in this case, so at this point, they were not seeking bail. So he will be held in a federal jail, most likely in Brooklyn, which is known as the MDC. Interestingly enough, that is where P. Diddy is. We know that that is where other high-profile cases. We know many different defendants who have been there. So it is likely that is where Mangione will be headed towards after here to Brooklyn to the federal jail there as he awaits this trial.",

Tell us what you saw during the proceedings. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was a court - a packed courtroom. Mangione was led into the courtroom by two U.S. Marshals. He was changed from that orange jumpsuit into street clothes, a white button-down shirt, a three quarter zip navy over shirt, and khaki pants. He was shackled at the ankles and his hands were clasped in front of him but not shackled. So, he entered, he sat down, he was quiet throughout the proceeding, didn't make many facial expressions. He did acknowledge he understood his rights when the judge read them to him. He said he understood the charges against him. All times, just answering very briefly, yes, he consulted with his attorneys and at some point, he was flipping through the complaint, reading the murder, the stalking charges that were levied against him. Now, the hearing was very brief, the judge just going through the process. But the big moment there was his attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, saying that in her 30 years as a prosecutor and a defense lawyer practicing in New York, she had never seen a situation play out like this. In fact, she said she was told at 2 PM today for his arraignment on state charges and then they were shocked when they turned around and found that there were federal charges and this first presentment today in court. Now, the judge set a preliminary hearing for the middle of January. That is presuming that Mangione is not indicted before then on these federal charges. Today's charges were a complaint. The next step will be that indictment on federal charges. You know, she did note that one of these charges is - has the possibility of the death penalty. The prosecutors did not say whether they were going to seek that in this case. They didn't even respond to her allegations about how highly unusual this was, saying that that will be discussed at a future court hearing when it is more appropriate. The judge acknowledging that they didn't really have to address it today. We are waiting now for his attorneys to exit court. Mangione was taken back into custody. He will be detained for now. They did not seek bail, but we are waiting for the lawyers to step out. They're not expected to speak to the cameras at least at this point, but Mangione for now in federal custody. It's unclear when he will be in state court to respond to those 11 count indictment on those state charges. Brianna, Boris?",
