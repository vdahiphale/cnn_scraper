That's how the president of Colombia describes the incredible rescue of four indigenous children who have been missing since the first of May.Within the past few minutes, they arrived in Bogota. This is video of the children being taken off an air ambulance and that transported them from the jungle to Bogota for further treatment. President Gustavo Petro says the children appeared weak when they were rescued and received medical treatment before they boarded the plane. The four siblings went missing when the small plane they were traveling on with their mother crashed in the jungle, while hundreds of military forces and indigenous scouts were involved in the week's long search and rescue operation. The children's grandfather was understandably overjoyed after learning that his grandchildren were safe.

And the indictment even includes a photo where you can see documents, sensitive secrets meant only for a handful of our closest allies, strewn about the floor of a storage room. And prosecutors also say that on two occasions, the former President Trump shared classified information with people who did not have proper clearances. The first incident is actually something that was first reported by CNN, it was a meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey Golf Club in 2021, where he showed people information that he said was highly secretive, and that he could not declassify it because he was no longer president. He also allegedly shared a classified map with a representative from his political action committee. The prosecutors also lay out how they allege he was trying to press his lawyer about possibly lying to the FBI after the government subpoenaed Trump to get his records back. They also lay out a series of damning incidents and conversations with one of his aides, Walt Nauta, what appears that he is pressuring Nauta to move boxes containing classified materials, not only to keep them from Trump's lawyers, but also to keep them for investigators. Now, we've heard from Jack Smith for the first time Friday, and he insisted that he wants this trial to move along as quickly as possible, likely mindful of an upcoming election next year.

Why is it not extending an invitation to Ukraine to join them at the summit in Vilnius and what are some of the differences among members when it comes to this issue in Ukraine? POTHIER: Many questions, but quite central ones. I think you have different answers to that. First, they still -- I mean, there's the obvious notion that inviting a country like Ukraine to join NATO whilst war is raging on Ukraine's territory is obviously a very high risk move. And will pose immediately the question about does it mean NATO is de facto directly involved in a war against Russia. So, there is this reluctance. But I think on that, the Ukrainians are clear that, obviously, the NATO membership will be effective when major hostilities will cease, at least to an extent that you can have a clear definition of what is that NATO is protecting in terms of territory in Ukraine. However, this is the part that I think leaders in Washington are delaying, are more reluctant to officially talk about, there is still assumptions that somehow giving the NATO membership to Ukraine could be seen by Vladimir Putin as a provocation, and therefore, we should abstain from giving the membership because we don't want to further provoke Putin. The paradox with that line of thinking is that Putin doesn't need more provocation to do what he's been doing, which is war of aggression, genocide, ecocide on a huge scale or the Ukrainian territory. And I think that thinking is what basically led us to where we are, which is a southern (PH) war of invasion against Ukraine by Russia. So, hopefully, by Vilnius in mid-July, the leaders Biden, Scholz will come together and realize that the old thinking no longer applies, that NATO and that Ukraine indeed has to have a place within the Alliance.",

According to the indictment, van der Sloot claimed to reveal where her daughter's body was buried in exchange for a quarter million dollars. But after getting initial payments of 25,000, he fled to Peru and e- mailed saying he lied. I am confident that today was an important step toward accountability and hopefully justice, her father said in a statement.

Her legs were crossed. Her hands were folded. She was watching his every move.Now, originally, there was going to be a Dutch interpreter for Joran, but then he then just said to in court, my English is actually perfect. I really don't think it's necessary, the hearing proceeded. When I first got here to Birmingham, I went to Mountain Brook, which is the suburb that Natalee was born and raised in. The people there tell me they want justice for Natalee's family, and they believe that court here in Birmingham may be the first step. Jean Casarez, CNN, Birmingham, Alabama. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
