You just saw him say hello to Raphael Warnock, the Reverend and Senator.I'm Jake Tapper in Washington. This is State of the union live this morning. President Biden focused on voting rights and American democracy and advanced of tomorrow's MLK Day, though, of course here in Washington, he had a difficult week. He's now facing a special counsel investigation over the mishandling of classified government documents. My panel is here with me, though, to focus briefly now on what we just heard from President Biden from that special pulpit on this special weekend. Karen, let's start with you. This would have been Martin Luther King Jr.'s 94th birthday, had he not been assassinated, what did you make of President Biden's address?",

We've just come off a really tough midterm. Senator Warnock was the victor of one of those midterm races. And it's a reminder of like where we need to go as a country.

I appreciate President Biden showing up again and saying we aren't giving up on this issue. Yes, Dems won, but voter suppression is still a real issue.

Trump lied about not having classified documents, did not keep them in a secure location, did not comply with a subpoena, but said he had and that that search warrant which Trump forced out into the open through his legal machinations, that cited laws that Trump might have violate, including the Espionage Act.",

That's another issue we try to -- we will try to fix from a legislative point of view. But with respect to investigating President Trump, there have been so many investigations of President Trump. I don't feel like we need to spend a whole lot of time investigating President Trump because the Democrats have done that for the past six years. So no one's been investigated more than Donald Trump, who hasn't been investigated Joe Biden.

I served in the Kentucky General Assembly for over a decade, the same things happen.You have arguments, you have, you know, heated debates going back and forth. You have a lot of giving and taking to try to get to a consensus. And it's always hard to get to a consensus with a roomful of politicians. Even our founding fathers had the same type of problem. But this is the first time we had, you know, a lot of cameras and a lot of media. And it was played out in real time.
