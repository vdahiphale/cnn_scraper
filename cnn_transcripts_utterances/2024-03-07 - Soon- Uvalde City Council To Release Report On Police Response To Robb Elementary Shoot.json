CROSS: You know, I've had a couple of people come up to my wife and I and tell us that, you know, they didn't realize or that they just didn't know, and then that they change their mind. But the vast majority of this community hasn't. I mean, you solve the poll results. You saw Emanual Zamora (ph). You saw Max Doorfinger (ph) re-elected. These people do not care.

What is worse, is the question that the NTSB chair is asking.And all of this goes back to the door plug blowout on Alaska flight 1282, back on January 5th. The NTSB said in its preliminary report that Boeing did repairs to the fuselage back in September at the factory, at Boeings factory in Renton, Washington. Repair work was done near the door plug on some rivets. The door plug had to be removed for that work. And the NTSB says they re-installed the door-plug at Boeing, but not the four safety critical bolts that hold the door plug in place on the side of the airplane. Alaska Airlines took delivery of that plane in October, did 154 flights after that. The NTSB wants to know who did that work, and who was responsible for putting those bolts back in? The NTSB has asked for the documents showing that. And NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told Congress yesterday a pretty stunning public notice that Boeing had not given them the documentation of that and has not provided a list of who did the work.

Was there documentation. The NTSB says there should have been documentation for such significant work. And the real question is, was there even documentation in the first place?

The rudder controls the yacht (ph) of the airplane, how it turns side to side. You can kind of see it there. The rudder moves on the tail. It moves the tail left and right. It moves the nose left and right. If the rudder pedals are stuck, that's a pretty serious finding. And the big issue here is that United mechanics were able to replicate this issue again, three days later after this incident. And so what -- what the NTSB is saying here is that there needs to be deeper investigation into this most recent case. There's really just there's only more trouble for Boeing. And really underscores that there may be some sort of deeper issues here with the Max. They do point out that the thing that may have caused this was an actuator in the autopilot system on the airplane that's connected to the rudder. That's built by a company called Collins. I've reached out to Boeing and Collins about this. They think essentially these could stiffen up in the cold and cause the rudder to sort of stiffened up making into the pilots can actuate. So this is a key flight control system. You need these in order to land the airplane and steer the airplane as you're coming into land. And then also on the ground.",

That's according to brain tissue analysis by researchers from the Boston University CTE Center.The shooter, an Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a two-day search. He had been hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation just months before the October 2023 deadly shooting that claimed 18 lives. Chris Nowinski is joining us now. He's a neuroscientist and founding CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And, Chris, these things are always so important, I think, because we're looking for answers. And this is a report that tells us some things, that concludes that, quote, \"The brain injury likely played a role in the changes in behavior of the shooter in the months before the attack.\" He, of course, was paranoid and delusional. What kind of behavioral changes would you normally see with this sort of injury? CHRIS NOWINSKI, NEUROSCIENTIST &amp; FOUNDING CEO, CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION: Well, when you have profound damage to the white matter, like he had, it really depends on where that damage is. So no two people respond to traumatic brain injuries in the same way. And so what you mentioned, paranoid delusions are -- we have seen that before in situations like this. And here to see changes in cognition, going to see changes in emotion. And it really can be quite profound.",

But it's also important to realize that when we try to understand these sorts of horrible events, we often will say, look, an emotional trauma was the reason there was the breakup or there was bullying. We'll talk about people being on drugs that has changed the way their brain has functioned. Traumatic brain injury, both changes the structure and function of your brain.
