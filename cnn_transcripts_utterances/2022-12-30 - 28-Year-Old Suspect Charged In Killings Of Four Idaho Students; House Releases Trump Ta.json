Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy giving concessions behind closed doors tonight as he scrambles to get enough votes to become the speaker of the House. But will it work? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Sara Sidner, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, four counts of first degree murder. That is what Bryan Kohberger is facing in connection with the shocking murders of four University of Idaho students. That in addition to felony burglary. P;lice say he was arrested earlier today by state police and the FBI on the other side of the country in Pennsylvania. It caps off a six- week mystery after four students in their 20s were found stabbed to death in their beds as they slept in their off campus home. The case paralyzing a university town with horror and fear. Tonight, the police chief in Idaho saying, their work is far from over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we want to know the motive, because if they did know each other, that's one explanation.

It's hard to minimize the harm any of us with college-age students know that this hit us in a certain way as your kids are off and you think they're going to be safe in these communities and these college communities. I do want to say one thing. Another point that they made in the press conference was that they still want tips. The exact line was, anything and everything you know about the suspect. That says to me that they are, in fact, still building a case of motive. They want to know, were there connections or they want to strengthen the case about what the connections are. So, they are still asking for tips in terms of what the motive may be. That may be to build a case. Idaho is a death penalty state.

One of the things about having a surveillance team on him for four days is, if you saw him go somewhere, have a cup of coffee, get a glass of water, leave something behind, that's call an abandonment sample. They can get that. They could have gotten access to his toothbrush or something else and made that match. They would confirm that with another match later. That's would get them probable cause.

We heard about those criticisms. That's long over. They became more public. Then they went out to the public to ask for advice. I thought that was appropriate as well.

Only in the Trump administration did that not happen.Barack Obama's, President Obama's taxes were audited every one of the eight years he was president. President Biden's taxes have been audited. Why is it that when we have a president with lots of complex business arrangements, a history of cheating his business partners out of their money and he is the only president in modern history that somehow avoids having his taxes, an expression of his financial situation, audited while it's a policy of the IRS to audit presidential returns? It raises a lot of questions. And that's why the committee pursued this. I'm pleased the committee was able to get our access to these documents before Democrats left control of the House, because otherwise, this all would have been swept under the rug.

This as cases continue raging through China, but the country officially reporting the number of deaths in December is only in the double digits.OUTFRONT now, Dr. Larry Brilliant. He's an epidemiologist who worked with the World Health Organization to eradicate small pox. Dr. Brilliant, welcome. You just heard the list of countries imposing restrictions on travelers from China. Is requiring a negative COVID test enough here? DR. LARRY BRILLIANT, EPIDEMIOLOGIST:  Sara, thank you for inviting me. No, it's not enough. Especially, what -- if you ask for a PCR test, a negative PCR test two days before you get on the plane and the plane is a 15 or 16-hour flight, by then, it is pretty much not very valuable. I've seen estimates that improve your surveillance by about 10 percent. It is a good thing to do though. But far better is to also, on arrival, test people. We did this in Hawaii during the peak of the epidemic. We didn't allow anybody into Hawaii because we tested them on arrival with the rapid one-hour PCR test. The other thing you can do, and many places are doing it, and we're doing a little of it, is waste water surveillance of the airplane. Blue water surveillance and waste water surveillance of airports that are hubs. The reason for all of this is to make sure people coming in are not infected, and maybe more important, to find out if those are infected with new variants that we don't know about. That's the big risk, Sarah, of all these cases in China. Epidemiologists are on edge. It is a low probability but highly consequential that a brand new variant will emerge out of all these shots on goal. Out of all these mutations that are leading to variants in China.",
