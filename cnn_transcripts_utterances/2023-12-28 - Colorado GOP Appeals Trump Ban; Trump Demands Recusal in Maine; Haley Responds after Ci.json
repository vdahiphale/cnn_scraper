The question right now, in all of these states is, does that apply to Donald Trump because what he did in 2020 related to the Capitol riot, trying to challenge the election and block the transfer of power.Many states that have looked at this have either said, our courts are not getting involved, or Trump can stay on the ballot in some way. Colorado is the one state that has not said that, where their state courts have determined he is not eligible and that they have the ability to take him off of the primary ballot. That's what's before the Supreme Court right now because the Colorado Republican Party has filed a petition yesterday saying, please, Supreme Court, settle this. Everybody is doing different things here. And we don't think what Colorado did is fair to Donald Trump or to voters. Here's what they write. \"By excluding President Trump from the ballot, the Colorado Supreme Court engaged in an unprecedented disregard for the First Amendment right of political parties to select the candidates of their choice. With the number of challenges to President Trump's candidacy now pending in other states, there is a real risk the Colorado Supreme Court majority's flawed and unprecedented analyst will be borrowed and the resulting grave legal error repeated.\" So, we're waiting to see what the Maine secretary of state does. We're waiting to see how other challenges like these play out in other states. And the important thing to remember here, John, is that what the GOP in Colorado is asking the Supreme Court to look at is whether there is even the power for a court or a secretary of state to remove a candidate off of the presidential ballot. We're still waiting to see what Donald Trump does here, if he too goes to the Supreme Court and asks them to look at whether he is eligible, whether they can qualify him as an insurrectionist and thus keep him off the ballot.

And, of course, Donald Trump's team will have the option to appeal anything that she says. But one thing I want to point out here, of all the legal battles that Donald Trump is facing, whether or not he's going to be on the ballot is not one that they are widely concerned about. They believe, given what we have seen in various states, Arizona, Minnesota, as you mentioned, just Michigan, that ultimately he will be on the ballot in all 50 states. Now, he did mention the Supreme Court weighing in in an interview. Here's what he said about that.

They know who their candidate is. He is off doing his thing. But in terms of the actual campaign, it is led by Chris LaCivita, Susie Wiles, these veteran Republican operatives.And what they've really tried to do is manage the messaging coming out of Trump world. And sometimes that means picking up the phone and making calls, telling people, stop talking to the media, because what they're trying to do is stop those internal leaks that really plagued Trump not only in 2016 but throughout his tenure in the White House. That is becoming increasingly difficult for two reasons. One of those reasons is, as Donald Trump has inched towards the GOP nomination, I am told by advisers that people have, quote/unquote, \"come out of the woodwork\" trying to show their influence, trying to get close to the president, be part of the action, and then running off and talking to media. So, that's one part of what they're navigating. The other part of what they're navigating is the candidate himself. We have an anecdote in that story, I did this with my colleague Alayna Treene, in which he announced at a fundraiser, who do you think should be my vice president, and started just batting around names with donors, who then called us to talk about the conversation. So, it's hard to control a candidate who is out there asking a lot of opinions, as well as a large span of Trump allies who want to maybe have a shot at a second Trump administration.",

It doesn't expressly mention presidents. It talks about officers of the United States. Is Donald Trump an officer of the United States? Was he, as an -- as an ex-president or not?The weight of scholarly opinion, including those arch conservatives who wrote the definitive law review treatment of the 14th Amendment, Professors Bowden (ph) and Paulson (ph), say yes, Donald Trump was an officer. Of course the president is an officer. If the president's not an officer of the United States, who is? Not so fast say other scholars. It's the minority opinion. That was not intended to cover presidents. If it did intend to cover presidents, it would have said so. I think the better argument is that the president is an officer. But, John, the lower court in Colorado, while it found Donald Trump was an insurrectionist, said he was not covered. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed that. So, those are the kinds of thorny legal questions we're getting into for the first time because of Donald Trump's alleged misconduct on and leading up to January 6, 2021.",

They're going to have to do it because it's percolating up from all of the courts.But one very important legal matter, there's no obligation for an individual to be prosecuted or criminally convicted before the courts, perhaps up to and including the Supreme Court, make the finding that that person was an insurrectionist under the 14th Amendment. And here, John, this is probably the clearest area under the law because of the comments on the Ellipse, because of that tweet targeting Mike Pence, because of the 187 minutes of inaction, because of the findings, which Colorado did consider, of the January 6th Committee that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection. There is very powerful evidence to ground the Colorado courts finding in that regard, whereas in Michigan they didn't make a finding on that because they said, hey, in a primary, we don't have the power to make this constitutional determination. By the way, the court -- lower court in Michigan noted could be different in the general election. So, it will be very interesting to see what questions the Supreme Court answers, if any, and what guidance it provides.

I want to let you listen to what she said back then because it does mirror kind of how she dealt with this question, which makes me wonder if it was a flub or just trying to figure out, as Bakari said, putting herself in a pretzel trying not to say something that might upset the base voters. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), THEN-GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA (2015): A flag is living and breathing. And so it represents something. I think it should be in any museum setting. I think it should be at Fort Sumpter. I think it should be in those places of historical settings, not in places that represent all people. You know, if someone wants to travel to see it, that's one thing, but it shouldn't be in front of someone's face to where they have to feel it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You go back to 2010, when she was running for governor and she was sitting down with -- I can't recall the organization, but it was a patriot organization, or a confederacy organization here, and she was -- she was having issues with this question as well, trying to appease the questioners. And so you see what happened in 2015 as well and then you get to this answer. You see she kind of meanders and doesn't really have a solid answer depending on who the audience is.But if -- if I was DeSantis listening to Scott Jennings today, I would definitely just let her continue to wallow in this kind of self- inflicted wound that she created. Ramaswamy, he can only make it worse for himself and her. I don't think he has the capacity or depth to even deal with issues of race. And so I think that the individuals who -- and no telling what Donald Trump will do. You should stay out of it, which means Donald Trump probably will jump head first into it.",
