Live at the table, Maria Cardona, Scott Jennings, Ashley Allison, Scott Taylor and Jonah Goldberg.

Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. One more day, one more night, another destiny. Tomorrow, the campaign will be worlds away because you will be casting ballots, making your choice. But tonight, the two candidates are on a collision course. And they're getting one last chance to convince you that they deserve your vote. In just a couple of minutes, we're going to see Oprah, Lady Gaga, both teeing up Kamala Harris in Philadelphia.

Trump only knows how to do the negative stuff. He only knows how to go on the attack and do the polarizing stuff. And so they've created a strategy around him that leans into that.

They are talking to voters, they're talking to the voters that you are mentioning, Ashley, who were like not really sure, but then at the end of the day, it's become too much what Donald Trump is saying and doing.

It is worth 19 Electoral College votes, the most of any of the battlegrounds. It's critical, absolutely critical to both candidates.

It might take a couple more months.It is better to have multiple paths than one.
