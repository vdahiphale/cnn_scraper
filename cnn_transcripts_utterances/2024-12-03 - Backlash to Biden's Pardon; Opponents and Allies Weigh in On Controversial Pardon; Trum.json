But it's important to remember that he was guilty of these 12 felonies. You know, nine that he pleaded guilty to, three was convicted by a jury. Lots of people get leaned on by the federal government in this country. Lots of people plead guilty in difficult situations are convicted and they don't get pardons. This president in particular has been very stingy about pardons. He's only granted 25 other pardons when other presidents have granted substantially more.

It is a major achievement in their fight against the Syrian regime, led by President Bashar al-Assad.Aleppo is Syria's second largest city, and they took it in a matter of days. Here's what we know so far about what happened. Rebel fighters had been fighting near Aleppo for days, and just the day before, on Thursday, this video shows they were less than five kilometers from the city's entrance. By Friday, we see fighters arriving at the western entrance to Aleppo. You can see this distinctive arch in the background. The sunlight indicates it's late afternoon. Further along the same street, we see them racing into the city. As they enter, many are on foot. At this point, regime forces are nowhere to be seen here. By early evening, even closer to the city center, the fighters get hold of a loudspeaker and start addressing local residents, telling them not to be afraid. As it gets dark, they reach Al-Basel roundabout and take down the regime flag. By geolocating videos of this route, we can see that they are riding in the west, and by nightfall, they've taken more and more of the city. Imagery shows they reach as far north as al-Rahman Mosque. And they take the citadel much further east. On Saturday morning, the offensive gets bolder. A statue of President Bashar al-Assad's brother is toppled at Al-Basel roundabout. But now the regime is striking back. An airstrike hits the same roundabout within hours. Journalists in the city told CNN there were civilian casualties. The rebels fight on, even entering Aleppo International Airport. Still, the strikes by the regime continue, this one by the hospital. The strikes are delivered not only by Syrian airplanes, but Russian ones too, a key regime ally. As the situation on the ground continues to evolve rapidly, and with the regime's main allies, Russia and Iran, being occupied with other wars, the question is whether these rebels can retain the land they have so quickly gained. And what will this mean for the civilians of Aleppo, who will inevitably bear the brunt of this fighting? Katie Polglase, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
