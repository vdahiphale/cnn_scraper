Whether Trump and Kennedy have agreed on a job for Kennedy in a second Trump administration, should the former president win in November.What is clear is that there can be supporters in battleground states now, without a standard bearer could potentially swing an election in a close state like Arizona. In August, \"The New York Times\" and Siena College poll found Harris with the edge over Trump among registered Arizona voters by three points, 45 percent to 42 percent but that is within the margin of error with no clear leader. Kennedy drew six percent. Joining me right now is Kristen Holmes, who's at tonight's rally in Arizona. So talk more about how the Trump campaign is feeling about this endorsement and do they think this changes the race?",

But those talks really escalated in recent weeks after Kamala Harris took the top of the ticket.Remember there was a lot of talk early on the election cycle about where Kennedy actually drew votes from. Did he take them from Joe Biden? Did he take them from Donald Trump? Now, Donald Trump's team seems to think even then that there were likely some votes coming from their team. However, as Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the ticket, this became more urgent to get RFK to back Donald Trump because what they were noticing was that in swing states in particular, all the votes or at least most of the votes were being drawn from Donald Trump. And that is something we heard Kennedy say earlier today. He said, he came to the realization that particularly in battleground states, he was taking from Donald Trump and not from Democrats. And that was something that he didn't want to do. So just moments ago, we saw him take the stage in this kind of almost crazy arrival that had fireworks and music, and the crowd was cheering. It's clear he is popular among Republicans, but how much is actually moves the needle seems unclear. Here's what he said when he took the stage with Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said yes, although he also said he hadn't thought of that yet. It seems, unless that happened in the last couple of days that RFK might have had some kind of conversation or at least it might have been communicated between the two camps. We also know this came to be, as I said, is there was a sense of urgency around Kamala Harris sending to the top of the ticket. Some of the people who are pushing this the hardest were Tucker Carlson, Don, Jr., and a man named Omeed Malik, who is a donor and friend to both RFK and Donald Trump. They believe, again, that this was something that would help Donald Trump in the long run in November. So, they began pushing a sort of orbit talking to orbit before it moved to an official stance of RFK suspending his campaign, as you noted and dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump. It was kind of a strange moment. I agree, when we were sitting in that room with RFK and he said he wasn't ending his campaign. He was just suspending it, but then went on to say that he was taking his name off the ballot, reversing some of the challenges that he had made, particularly in these battleground states. Some fear what exactly he meant by that not suspending, I mean, not ending his campaign, but just suspending it, but clearly, he has something in his head there and I will tell you, I was told that he is going to be on the campaign trail for Donald Trump and with Donald Trump in the coming weeks.",

This case of him supporting President Trump. Obviously, there's nothing about Donald Trump that is anywhere close to reflecting the legacy of Robert Kennedy's father and my uncle, President Kennedy, my dad, anyone in my family. Our family believes in democracy. We believe in the fact that my uncles, one of whom laid down his life in World War II fighting Hitler over Germany, got shot down. I mean, there were many veterans who were laid to rest in Arlington Cemetery who took on fascism. And as we know in the Oath to Office, we have to protect our country in its Constitution both foreign and domestic. And I think we fought the foreign wars against fascism,, but now of course, we're waging a war, if you will, against fascism here at home, because this is a campaign by Donald Trump that wants to really terrorize people with the notion that government can easily come after them. This is so far afield from what we in the United States doomed to be part of our very makeup.

I mean, now he's been shopping himself around to both campaigns, trying to get a Cabinet position.But I think Scott is absolutely right. This creates an opportunity for Democrats to further define Republicans as extreme, as conspiracy theories, or as Governor Walz says, just plain weird. I mean, you have someone who says that he believes that there's chemicals in our water that's making kids transgender, that he things broadband is causing cancer. This is kind of the Democrats like a -- it's like a wish list, it's like a dream for Democrats. It's like continue down this path of defining the new Republican party, the MAGA party, as extremists and conspiracy theorists that are just out of step and out of line and with the American people.

I mean, the fact that his last name is Kennedy and he carries with him everywhere he goes. It makes him a draw. So, my suspicion is they're going to put them out there. But when you put somebody out there as a surrogate, you've got to live with everything they say and everything this guy says could be problematic out on the stump.
