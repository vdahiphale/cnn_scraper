Is it an issue of addition or subtraction?Overnight, Trump endorsed House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan to be the next speaker over the majority leader, Steve Scalise. Trump might want to be a kingmaker here, but could it have the opposite effect? Scalise and Jordan have been working the phones and continue to do so all weekend long to drum up support. So, let's figure out where things stand. Seeing as Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. Lauren, what are you hearing?",

In some ways, Jim Jordan was already a favorite of conservatives and members of the House Freedom Caucus, many of whom are watching Trump's endorsement closely. But on the other hand, the larger question that is looming right now is how these two candidates, Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, are going to win over some of their moderate colleagues, Republicans who won in districts that Biden carried in the last presidential election. That is where the focus is.And it's important to note that many of them this morning, according to reporting from our colleague, Melanie Zanona, are deeply frustrated and angry about this fact that these candidates are going to be talking to Bret Baier on Fox News before they are having a fuller conversation with the Republican conference. We expect that next week things could move quickly. Obviously a lot of questions on whether they get to the floor for House speaker vote. But on Monday, we expect a Republican conference meeting, in the evening, on Tuesday, a candidate forum, on Wednesday, a vote among the conference on who they want to be speaker. But the larger question of when they would go to the floor for that remains. And right now, neither of these candidates have locked down the 218 votes that they would need. Now, does Donald Trump's endorsement help Jim Jordan in the long run? Does that actually make it tougher for him with moderates? Those are the key questions this morning, John.",

Congressman Burchett, thank you so much for joining me.Have you reached a decision yet on who you'd like to endorse or who you want to support for speaker? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  No, ma'am, I haven't. I'm not really big on endorsements. I've always said that you don't really pick up friends with endorsements, just enemies. And so all my conversations are private and I feel the same way about debates. You know, you bring your side, I bring my side, and we both leave thinking we won. So, I don't really have a lot of -- I don't have any animosity towards any of those. But I've talked to both Steve and Jim at length. They're both very good friends and I'm going to listen to what they have to say. I guess I'm concerned, you know, it sounds real trendy and hip, but I am concerned about their vision for our party and our country. And my biggest concern is fiscal responsibility. We cannot continue taking in $5 trillion a year and spending $7 trillion. And we owe $33 trillion in debt. If you remember, in three months, we racked up another trillion dollars in debt. And on $33 trillion in debt, about $1 trillion of that is for interest. I mean, that's money we're just giving to the Chinese or whoever we're borrowing the money from.

I think that this is a Republican Party that is assuming that Donald Trump gets that Republican nomination. So, the closer you are queuing to his priorities, the better come for the next year.

I happen to think this public debate is a good thing for people to see the issues. And Scalise has made it clear, he wants to focus on the priorities that they were elected to do, which is reining in spending, as well as securing the border. And he also can tout the fact that he is a good fundraiser for Republicans, which is a key part of the speakership.Jim Jordan will focus on those issues, but he has really made a name for himself for Biden, and that's not going to sit well with a lot of them. And the key is to find the person that can make the case for unity, because there's been an incentive structure in place that the tyranny of the minority trumps common sense consensus building in the House, and we need to get past that and work on who can build consensus in the House caucus.",
