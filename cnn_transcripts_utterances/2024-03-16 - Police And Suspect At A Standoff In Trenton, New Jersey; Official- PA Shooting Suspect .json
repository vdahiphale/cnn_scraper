      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Reid in Washington.Breaking news, a dramatic standoff between police and a man accused of killing three people. Right now police say the suspect is barricaded inside a home in New Jersey. We'll bring you the very latest. Plus Mike Pence cannot in good conscience endorse his former boss. And he says it's not just because of Trump's actions on January 6th. Will Trump respond to his former vice president at a rally just moments from now? And unpredictable and dangerous. That's how the U.S. embassy in Haiti describes the region under gang rule. It's now arranging evacuation flights for U.S. citizens out of the country but that's only if they can reach the airport. CNN is on the ground with a live report. And we start with that breaking news. A suspect in a triple homicide has barricaded himself inside a home in Trenton, New Jersey. The suspect is identified as 26-year-old Andre Gordon. Police alleged that Gordon killed his stepmother and sister in one location in Falls Township, Pennsylvania. He then allegedly drove to another home and shot and killed the mother of his two children, and bludgeoned her mother with his assault rifle. They alleged he then carjacked a vehicle and fled to Trenton. CNN's Polo Sandoval is near the house where the suspect has barricaded himself in. Polo, what are you seeing right now?",

      "sentences": "Paula, as we speak, there are signs of some potential movement right now at this Trenton home where they believed the 26-year-old suspect and the triple murderer earlier today neighboring Pennsylvania has been barricaded. We have been listening for the last roughly hours or so negotiators here on the ground pleading with 26-year-old Andre Gordon to come out shirtless, hands up.Police assuring him that if he did so he would not be hurt. And just seconds ago, Paula, as I listened to what's happening, saw some sort of smoke coming from the area and some repeated banging noises that are coming from the area where that home is. Now, it may or may not be directly linked to this. However, the area directly surrounding this duplex in this neighborhood in Trenton has been blocked off since about 12:30 this afternoon when they, police here, received the report that the suspect involved in that triple shooting was likely barricaded inside that home with several residents. Now, eventually the residents in that home were able to escape successfully, and that led us to this standoff that's going on about three hours now, a little bit over that, I should say, between police and local, state and federal authorities that have been pleading with their suspect to bring this with a peaceful end -- to a peaceful end by either coming out with his hands up or using a phone to dial 911 indicating that he intends to surrender. So, again, as we sort of take all this in right now and to see and monitor for any and significant potential developments, I can tell you that there are signs of some potential movement here as authorities are trying to bring this to a peaceful end. And very quickly, let me just go back through the timeline. It was about 9:00 a.m. this morning when police believe Gordon shot and killed two relatives about miles south of here, neighboring Pennsylvania, and then made his way to a second home and it was after that police say that he carjacks the driver of an SUV and then made the short drive here to Trenton, New Jersey, and made his way into that home. Police have not said, have not made clear what that potential link might be between Gordon and this home, though neighbors in the last several hours have told me that this is a place where folks could potentially rent rooms. And so it wouldn't be surprising if we eventually learn that Gordon did potentially stay here at some point. But again, that brings us to this moment now about well-over three hours after the standoff started with Trenton police along with other authorities, are trying to bring this to a peaceful end and detain and arrest the man who they believe shot and killed three people earlier today -- Paula.",

      "sentences": "Well, Paula, this is one of these things that starts out very fast. You've got multiple people shot.[16:05:02] You've got a suspect involved in a carjacking. You've got a vehicle on the move. But once they placed him in that building, that multiple dwelling house, and they got what they believe is all the other people out, the whole object of the game then is to slow it down and to start that conversation. Now, the good news is they have been talking since they got there, telling Andre Gordon, this 26-year-old young man who is the suspect here, to come out, that he's not going to be hurt, that they want to be safe, too. They've talked to him about how to come out, to take him into custody. The unfortunate part is this has not been an intimate conversation. It's been largely via a bullhorn. We don't know if that's been a one-way conversation or whether he has been responding. They've asked him to call 911. I mean, Paula, in a hostage situation if you're the negotiator, even if it's just a barricade situation where the suspect has no hostage, you want that conversation to be one-on-one. You want it to be by phone or in-person, but you want that conversation to be direct and two-way. At this point, it sounds like they are three hours into this. It sounds like they may be unable to make direct contact. You can see the tactical people that were employed early on getting people out. So at this point they have to consider the possibilities, which is he could take his own life. That is not the ending they're looking for. They could convince him to come out, or at some point, not knowing what his status is, they might have to do a controlled entry to see if he's OK, where he is, and what the situation is. And I think that's a little bit of what Polo is talking about now in terms of there is some movement there. So we'll have to watch that closely and see where that goes.",

But once you're talking about an assault weapon with two to three rounds of 765 rounds, that's a very powerful round. You could shoot that and that can travel through walls, through other things. So it's a military style weapon. And as you can see from the pictures, this is a tight neighborhood.The houses are close together. You know, garages and alleyways, not the kind of place you want any bullet traveling, let alone a high- powered round. So extraordinarily dangerous going into that environment or trying to control it with that outer perimeter and then the inner perimeter. There is -- you've got a good team there. You've got the Trenton police, you've got the SWAT team, you've got the Mercer County Rapid Response Team, you've got federal authorities offering tools and assistance. So there are remote ways to work this with robots and other things that can give you a look around inside the house. And sometimes that's how you find out that the suspect is alive and still barricaded, or that the suspect has taken his own life. It's better to start remote and stay remote if you can. But at some point, as Chief Ramsey will tell you, sometimes the circumstances don't allow that. And at some point you actually have to send regular human being cops with the best protective gear in. The default is usually the time is on your side, though, and to keep it slow.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a complex investigation simply because of the array of criminal activity that's taking place across two states. But most of that activity are things that would be prosecuted at the state level. You're talking about homicides, carjackings, there is of course a federal carjacking statute, but it is likely that state or local prosecutors in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey will conduct those prosecutions and the investigations, the crime scene investigation and the other investigation they need to do to put those cases on.This is all if we walk away at the end of the day with a subject in custody which as Chief Ramsey just said is really only about a 50-50 prospect at this point. So we'll have to see. I agree with John and Chief Ramsey that, you know, they are at the point where time is on their side. Usually at this point in the day, there's typically a perceived advantage for law enforcement to basically hold the scene until nightfall because once under the cover of darkness, it's a little bit easier to get a tactical team up to the entrance of the breach point or the entrance of the building without being seen by the subject inside, and with a weapon like an AR-15, you know, anyone -- there's a large range around that building in which you could be struck with lethal fire from the inside with a weapon like that. So a lot of things to consider. A little bit surprising to see if they try to resolve it right away. But we could be here for a while.",

Following the shootings at approximately 9:01 a.m. Gordon drove to the unit block of Edgewood Lane, Levittown, where he forcibly broke into a residence after which he shot and killed 25-year-old Taylor Daniel, with whom he has two children. At the time of the shooting, there were four other individuals present inside that home, one of which was injured after being bludgeoned by Gordon with the assault rifle. She was transported to Jefferson towards DAU campus for her injuries. At approximately 9:13 a.m. Gordon committed a carjacking at gunpoint of a 44-year-old man from Morrisville at the parking lot of the Dollar General on Bristol Pike in Morrisville. The operator of the vehicle did not suffer any injuries. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Was it another person he was hunting for or was he trying to seek some kind of shelter or something? We just don't know the answer to that.But they would debrief it and get as much information as possible whether or not they believe he's still in the house. And if so, where? Is he in the rear of the house? Because they were able to get on the second floor, make entry and get people out. So someone in that house apparently probably called 911, told them that they were upstairs. They were able to get them out safely. Obviously, if you're in the house on the first floor, you'd have to hear what's going on, yet they were able to make entry and get those people out safely. So whether or not he's still in that house is, you know, always something that you have to consider. But they certainly would have asked whether or not they believe he was there. How was he armed, all those kinds of questions. You know, one thing that's interesting. He's only killed or injured women so far, you know, at both those locations. The one grandmother which he struck with the weapon, but there were males that were there. Now granted they were supposedly hiding or whatever, I don't know if he had an opportunity to kill a male but this is definitely something that interests me to find out. You know, the targets were all women. And whether or not that means anything are part of his grudge or gripe that he's got against the individuals that he killed, I don't know. He carjacked the individual who's a man, didn't harm him at all. So that'll all be something that as the investigation proceeds, there'll be digging into. But right now they've got to make sure they can get their hands on him at some point in time and again, it's a very dynamic scene going on right there.",

So we're in a relatively safe area to be able to show you. The home itself is the red brick face duplex that you see off in the distance here, about 100 yards from where we're standing. And that's where for the last 90 minutes from our vantage point and our perspective, we've been able to hear law enforcement personnel using effectively a bullhorn to communicate with the suspect who they believe is inside, identified as 26-year-old Andre Gordon. We have heard negotiators repeatedly ask him to step out of the home, shirt off, hands up, assuring Gordon that they do not want to hurt them, that they want to bring this to a peaceful end. About 30 minutes ago or so, we did see some smoke -- some -- a bit of smoke that was billowing from the area in front of the home. Also heard some banging noises. But since then, we really haven't seen or heard anything else. Important to point out that investigators said that they have no reason to doubt that he's inside, but really until they're able to have eyes in the interior of this -- of this home, they will not be able to finally confirm that or that he's even still alive.

O'CALLAGHAN: I have to tell you, Paula, it's incredibly unusual. In my experience, that given where obviously we know the Southern District of New Yorke had some cases, most prominently the Michael Cohen case. And presumably, some of these documents are coming from their cache of documents that we're developed in their investigation of that case. But that case has been long over. Michael Cohen has already served his jail sentence and he's back out. And so I find it difficult to understand what it was that prevented the Southern District from giving the Manhattan D.A.'s office whatever they we're asking for that was relevant, either inculpatory information or exculpatory, frankly, and, even more importantly, for the defense. In my experience, and as a Southern District of New York prosecutor, there was a strong rivalry with the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Frankly, the only time that you would keep information from another prosecutor's office that is representing to you that they can use it either in a case that's already charged or further investigate is when I thought I still had investigative evidence to pursue.
