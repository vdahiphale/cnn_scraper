The two longtime American allies have had chilly relations with each other in the past, the legacy of Japan's brutal rule in Korea until 1945. But over the last year there has been a thaw in relations with encouragement from the Biden administration.So what came out of the summit and what does it mean for security as the Asia Pacific faces a rising China and a provocative North Korea? My guest is Danny Russel. He had a long career in the State Department that culminated during the Obama administration when he was the top official on East Asia Affairs. Today he is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Danny, welcome to the program. Good to see you. So as I mentioned, you can't overstate the historic nature of this summit. Let's talk about what came out of it. One, the expansion of military cooperation such as joint military exercises and new crisis hotline, real time sharing of North Korea missile warning information by the end of this year, in addition an annual summit between the nations, and tighter economic cooperation. How significant is all of this in your view?",

The details of the various agreements and the various processes are important. The agreement in principle among the three that they share in effect a common security that a threat or an attack on one implicates the national security of the other.That's important, too. But there are two other things that I think matter a lot. First of all, this is sort of the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it all is a tremendous amount of interaction, interoperability, inter-cooperation among the governments of the three countries. Each one of these governments is pretty powerful, whether it's militarily, economically, technologically. Combined it's really quite awesome. And I think the breakthrough between Japan and Korea has opened the door to authentic and sustained cooperation. And that's sort of the second part that by institutionalizing Japan, Korean cooperation in the context of the U.S., both the alliance and technology and economics, I think it creates a framework that will meet that detente which of course we know is fragile. I think it can make more durable, make it possible to weather inevitable changes in administration which happens in democracies.",

It's about shaping the kind of world that Americans and Koreans and Japanese want to live in. It's not an anti- China coalition.",

Today she is the director of the Afghanistan Policy Lab at Princeton University. Adel Raz, thank you so much for joining us today. So since the Taliban's takeover two years ago, they have issued 51 bans against women.

Do we have a road map? Do we have a plan? Do we have principles around those engagement?Because since day one Taliban have arrived, they have become more brutal towards women of Afghanistan and the constant feedback we are receiving is that, well, we're hoping they're going to change the next morning and the next morning, and the prediction that women of Afghanistan are making is they will not change, they will change for the worse. So if the international community, including the U.S., does not have a clear objective of that engagement, if there is not a clear coordination among the international community on how to engage, why to engage, what is the results and what is the outcome, and where do we -- what is our goal?

That's not surprising given the volume of state propaganda cascading out over the air every night.At the same time I met people who denounce the war, who felt that the declaration of war against Ukraine, the invasion of February of last year, was not normal in the words of one opponent of the war that I spoke to. He could not explain to himself why President Putin had done this other than to rally the country yet again. He's done this through successive wars in Chechnya and Georgia and elsewhere.

When you're in Moscow, apart from the billboards seeking recruits for the war, when I was there also for the Wagner mercenaries, apart from that there is really no sign of the war. The restaurants are full, the city is functioning, everything seems to work. People are sitting in cafes enjoying themselves.And what President Putin has done is he -- and that's why I went to Siberia, is that he has tried to concentrate recruitment in remote areas of Russia. Where I was in Ulan-Ude is 3,500 miles from the front. Yet the war is much more present there than it is in Moscow, in all those graves with freshly turned earth and the faces of dread that I saw at the airport of young soldiers beginning the journey toward Ukraine with their tearful families around them. And what he is doing, President Putin, is offering contracts of $2,500 or more a month to people whose salaries generally speaking are more in the $400, $500 a month range. So he's buying people to go fight and die. And the 20 percent number you cited just reflects the fact that he has been able to keep the war at a distance. And there are just a lot of Russians who feel they have to get on with their lives, try to get by and are tired of it. The headline was the forever war. And I think one of the things the West may have to come to terms with in the coming months is that this is going to be a very long conflict. That the counteroffensive on the Ukrainian side is not probably going to resolve anything in any decisive manner, and that we could have some form of frozen conflict such as President Putin managed to contrive in Georgia. Now the question then remains of what such a frozen conflict -- whom such a frozen conflict would favor but I think it's soon anyway that barring a surprise that the West is going to have to start thinking about that question very deeply.",

Next Sunday, I'll delve into this topic with a new special, \"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, ITS PROMISE AND PERIL.\"We'll discuss both the scary and the exciting elements of A.I. starting with the former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt. We'll sit down with the man known as the godfather of A.I. who left a top tech job so he could talk freely about its threats. I talked to the great film director James Cameron about how he harnesses A.I. in his movies and we will even look at the use of A.I. in art. Take, for example, this piece called \"Unsupervised.\" It is currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The artist, Refik Anadol, trained an A.I. model using data from more than 200 years' worth of the museum's art collection, which included nearly 90,000 works of art from over 26,000 artists. The machine is always learning and imagining new artworks. If you watched for a hundred years, you would not see the same screen twice. I sat down with Anadol and the museum's curator of paintings and sculpture, Michelle Kuo, to discuss this extraordinary work. Here is a piece of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It's not just using everything that's out there as other kinds of machine learning models are doing right now.And the other thing that Refik is doing is basically working very, very hard in concert with the machine learning model to create the shapes that you see. You might just get noise if you were to yourself say, here's a generative A.I., I'm just going to plug all this information into it. You might get stuff that doesn't make any sense or is chaotic or doesn't visually resolve into anything. So, that to me is what is so sort of mind-blowing about what you're doing.",
