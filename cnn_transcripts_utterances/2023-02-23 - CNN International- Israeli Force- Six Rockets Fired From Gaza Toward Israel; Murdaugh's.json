And as you say, these numbers were injured.We're talking about more than 100 injured according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. More than 100 injured due to live ammunition and almost 500 in total injured, including those who were injured from inhalation, from teargas and also from shrapnel. So this was obviously a very, you know, a bloody raid. And then subsequently, we had six rockets fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel. Israel retaliating with airstrikes, which it says were targeting both a weapons storage from Hamas and also a weapons manufacturing site. Now you've read in the introduction the condemnation of the concern from the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process. We've also seen condemnation from the Saudis, Jordanians, Egyptians and the Emiratis. And the United States State Department also putting out a statement saying that it's extremely concerned by the levels of violence in Israel and the West Bank. Now, we've reached out to the IDF to get some more details as to just how so many people came to be injured. This, of course, did happen in the old city of Nablus. It was during the day, as we said, around 10:00 a.m. it started. Many people were shopping in the open market there in the old city. But we're trying to get further details as to just how it came to be that so many people were injured as a result of the Israeli security forces raid yesterday. Max?",
