And as you can see it's already happening, streets turning into rivers there.Temperatures in Atlantic City are above freezing at the moment but that is going to soon change. They're expected to plunge more than 20 degrees later today, so very clearly, there could be some real serious additional problems ahead. And millions of Americans are trying to head home or head out for the holidays. This massive weather system is stopping many people in their tracks. The snow, the rain, the ice, the winds, all -- have already caused thousands of flight delays and cancellations at airports across the country. And the ripple effects are nowhere close to over yet.

They say there's so many hardships that they've already gone through. This is just another one to add to that pile. I want to show you what they've been doing. They've been sleeping on the sidewalk. They have now picked up essentially all of their blankets and folded them to use possibly for tomorrow again. But as you see, there's many, many people who were not able to get into the shelters last night. And that's because a lot of these migrants did not go through the immigration process with border Patrol.So, because they didn't do that, they were not allowed in the city shelters -- the convention center. Some of the hotels in the schools, they had to be at a nonprofit, and the nonprofits, they were over capacity. So, what happened overnight here is that there was a bus. I want to show you that first. And so overnight, just some people here were able to get on the bus to warm up for a couple of minutes. I talked to one migrant who told me. Look, I was waking people up and telling them, you're going to die. You need to get on that bus. Thankfully, we haven't seen anyone lose their lives right now. We're just seeing a lot of people coming to get food. There's residents here in El Paso who brought Pandolce, who brought Tamales, the traditional Mexican Tamales for Christmas, and the sweet bread. And, of course, all of these migrants so thankful for the residents that decided to do this this morning. This has been extremely helpful for them, because of course, they just needed anything to be able to warm up. But these are difficult circumstances. It was a very difficult night for a lot of these migrants. But the bottom line is that they want to be here and they will do anything they can for a future here and for their children, Kate.",

The CDC says that they are seeing what could be an uptick in Strep A infections among kids. The concern being that this could lead to more severe disease than your typical strep throat. So, what is going on with this?Joining me right now is Dr. Megan Ranney. She's a professor of Emergency Medicine and Associate Dean of Public Health at Brown University. It's good to see you, Dr. Ranney. Invasive Strep A is how they're describing it. What do we need to know about this, and why is the CDC alerting doctors to this right now? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE: So, back in the early fall, we started seeing a small increase in the number of what we call invasive Strep A cases in Europe. Those are now being reported in a few states in the U.S. And so, the CDCs advisory basically tells doctors, hospitals, laboratories, to keep an eye out for this. It's not yet a full-blown outbreak here, but it's giving us a heads-up. Here's the good news for parents. We're all struggling with a horrible season of viruses. This invasive group A Strep is still quite rare. It is far more common for our kids to come down with flu or RSV or COVID, or some other piece of viral crud that we're all dealing with. But it is an alert to kind of keep your eyes open. So, here's the thing that parents need to know. First is, if your kid is sick, if they have a high fever, if they're not able to keep down fluids, call your doctor and bring them in to get tested. Second, group A strep is treatable. There are antibiotics that work to get it better. And the third thing is the best treatment is prevention. Get your kid up-to-date on all their shots because viral infections increase the risk of getting this invasive group A strep and make sure they wash their hands, stay home if they're sick, all the normal things that we already know how to do.",

This -- with a wave of cold and flu, there is the shortage that we were seeing of common pain meds for kids.Dr. Ashish Jha from the White House, he was on this morning and he said that it's not a supply issue.

The number of adults getting the new bivalent booster shot. It's pretty bad. I think it's about only about 14 percent of people eligible have gotten that updated shot.

That's the new bivalent booster and that's good, you know, but we need more Americans to do it. And I think there's still -- people are learning about the fact that we have you know moved from getting your shot once and being done to really needing that annual shot. I don't count on my flu shot from last year to protect me this year. Same thing for COVID. Keep protect your -- keep count on your shot from last year to protect you this year.
