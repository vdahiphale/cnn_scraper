And Fani Willis, her father, takes the stand. What happened in the Georgia courtroom today and what are Willis' chances of staying on the election interference case against Trump? Good evening. Thanks for joining us. A lot to get to tonight. When he first was running for president, Donald Trump told CBS News, I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me. Well, tonight he is sitting on an even bigger mountain of it, $355 million more imposed today in New York's now successful civil fraud case against him and his two adult sons. On top of the $83 million he has to pay for defaming E. Jean Carroll, the woman he - a federal jury said he sexually abused. So in the span of 22 days, the former president is now on the hook for about half a billion dollars. In today's ruling, the judge credited former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for testifying truthfully in a trial whose genesis dates back to Cohen's appearance before a congressional hearing four years ago.

We don't know what happened to this protester, but an independent monitor says some of those detained have been released.The cause of Navalny's death remains unclear, but President Biden and world leaders today immediately pinned the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin quoting from President Biden, he said, \"What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality.\" Clarissa Ward has more on the man who stood up to Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For three years, Alexey Navalny had been languishing in Russian penal colonies. Sentenced on charges of extremism, his real crime, taking on Russian President Vladimir Putin and exposing the rampant corruption of Russia's political elites. Navalny's lawyers warned that the brutal conditions and solitary confinement were taking a toll on him. Still, he managed to communicate to his followers and loved ones through social media. On Valentine's Day this year, as he had done every year, he posted a message to his wife, Yulia: \"Baby, everything is like in a song with you: between us there are cities, the takeoff lights of airfields, blue snowstorms and thousands of kilometers. But I feel that you are near every second, and I love you more and more.\" Hours after the shocking news broke, Yulia Navalnaya addressed world leaders at the Munich Security Conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, Alexey Navalny's Wife (through interpreter): (Foreign language) I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family and with my husband. They will be brought to justice, and this day will come soon. (END VIDEO CLIP) WARD (voice over): Defiant and determined, just as her husband always was. A staunch critic of Putin for more than a decade, Alexey Navalny had dodged death before. Collapsing on a plane from Siberia in August 2020, after being poisoned with a deadly nerve agent, Novichok. The flight was diverted. Two days later, a comatose Navalny was flown to Berlin and saved by a team of German doctors. The CNN investigation with Bellingcat found that a team of FSB operatives had been following Navalny on trips across the country for years before poisoning him. We located one of the men accused of the poisoning and tracked him down to his apartment in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WARD (on camera): (Foreign language) CNN. My name is Clarissa Ward.

I'm sad to be here, but I'm happy that I get to talk a little bit about Alexey. Here's a man who is charismatic. He was funny. He was a terrific father. He loved to debate. He loved to talk about politics. He and I became fast friends. And although we didn't have the same mother language, I think are common language was through humor.
