You add Kennedy, look at this, you end up with a tie in Arizona, a tie in Pennsylvania, and that lead gets cut down to six points in Nevada. So, Kennedy could, in fact, be a spoiler for Donald Trump, at least according to this poll.Of course, I will note, Phil and Poppy, he's not the only potential third-party candidate who could play a role. Joe Manchin, of course, announced that he's retiring from the Senate from West Virginia. There's thoughts of him running as a No Labels party candidate. Look at this, 10 percent of registered voters said that they may, in fact, vote for him.
