And the reason why I do think to answer your question, I will get a shot at him is because he won't listen to his lawyers, ultimately.He has a very short term ability to be compliant with anybody's advice. And he'll listen for a little while when one of us will say something on a debate stage or someplace else that he'll want to respond to. And he'll knee jerk react in response. So yes, I think maybe the third or the fourth debate will finally see him. Because I also think that voters will start to worry a bit about it in terms of not showing up and defending his policies.

Both former Trump lawyers will stand trial together next month after requesting a speedy trial. The judge rejected their request, split their cases. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us now from Washington, D.C. Zach, what are we watching today for the second hearing. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTERThey wanted unsealed witness interview transcripts from those who talked to the special grand jury that recommended charges and they want to know the names of the unindicted coconspirators referenced in the indictment itself. And so these are all part of the legal maneuvering that we typically see as defendants are ready to go to trial. And as you mentioned, Powell and Chesebro are slated now to go to trial on October 23. But one overarching question here today. And then something we're going to be looking for is whether or not the judge does address what this means for the other 17 codefendants in this case, including Trump, what the timing of their potential trial might look like. It's likely prosecutors are going to try to get some clarity around that today from the judge, as he addresses these motions from Powell and Chesebro. But a lot of moving pieces, and really a lot of questions still in the air here, especially as far as a trial, potential trial for Donald Trump in Georgia.",
