There are emotions that are high, but they have been nothing less than peaceful. They have just stopped the traffic flow. And part of that is because they want people to see that disruption is part of the way they're going to protest because they are feeling pain.

We're getting some evidence of the toll. This is taking on the Russian side. We know, for example, that Wagner, that private military company is very active around Bakhmut, continues to be so.We have satellite imagery that shows a rapidly expanding cemetery used for Wagner mercenaries in southern Russia showing that between November 24 and January 24, 14 additional rows of graves seem to have appeared there. So that gives you the sense of the cost of this war in terms of the people involved in it on the Russian side. That strategy of taking small towns in the absence of being able to take big population centers, like Bakhmut continues. We're seeing the Russians active around Vuhledar, which is just to the south of Bakhmut narrative, the city of Donetsk. We're also hearing this morning a report from the local Ukrainian governor, that a smaller town called Kostiantynivka civilian deaths, there are three he says because of a missile strike by Russia that hit civilian buildings. So this continues to be a brutal grinding war, a combination of missile strikes and that ground offensive. And in a midst that as well, we're seeing glimpses, Kim, of the sort of top of the range of Russia's arsenal, that aerial assault that we saw in Ukraine, on Thursday included according to the Ukrainian Air Force, two Kinzhal type hypersonic missiles. These are the types of missiles that Ukraine simply cannot shoot down, they do not have the air defense capability to do that. This is why we continue to hear calls including for the Ukrainian Air Force to accelerate the provision of those patriots that have already been promised and other sophisticated air defense systems. This as President Zelenskyy continues to call for those timelines to be pressured in terms of bringing tanks to Ukraine for that ground offensive in the east.

      "sentences": "Now at this point, we don't know specifically what killed Tyre Nichols but medical experts tell CNN he probably died of internal injuries from blunt force trauma.CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us more of the possible injuries Nichols might have suffered. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is just horrific to watch. Even as a trauma neurosurgeon myself, I've never seen anything quite like that. You don't -- you often see patients who are brought into the hospital. But you don't see that that sort of just horrific beating that he took over those several minutes. When you look at the sort of thing, there's obviously so many different injuries that he could have sustained at the time. I think one of the areas that people probably paid a lot attention to was just all these blows he took to his head, and to his face. He was restrained at one point, taking fists to the face and he was being kicked in the face when he was on the ground. What can happen sometimes is that the brain is the one organ in the body, that when it's starting to swell, it really has no place to go because it's encased by the skull. Every other organ in the body can swell a little bit more easily. Brain swelling can start to take place and one can start to lapse in and out of consciousness as seemed to be happening with with Mr. Nichols. I watched the videos alongside medical examiners from around the country, and that was the area that they really pointed to was these blows to the head. But it's also worth noting that he's a pretty skinny guy from we understand. And there were kicks to the body, to the torso, to the chest, as well. And any of those organs may have actually sustained damage and started bleeding as well, could have been suffering from internal bleeding at the time that all this was happening. And that brings us to the next point, which I think is critically important. When you look at sort of the timeline of what was happening there, it was around 8:33 or so 8:34 when you see this last kick that he sustained, and then he is handcuffed and he's dragged over to the car. And then it's -- eight minutes later before we see EMS even arrive, but it's not until around 9:02. So 20 minutes after that, 21 minutes after that, almost half an hour in total before you see a gurney arrive. So you have a critically ill man who's lying on the sidewalk, sustained all these injuries. Hard to say the extent of the injuries are even how serious they are at that point. Obviously, they are serious. But what exactly is the most serious is difficult to ascertain. And it's a full half an hour before he's really assessed. You hear at various times that it's going to take a while for the ambulance to get there. And that's obviously very problematic. He needed to be in a hospital. Whether or not it would have made a difference, ultimately, that's hard to say. And we'll get more information, you know, probably over the coming few days as to exactly what caused his death. We don't have a firm cause of death yet from the County Medical Examiner. But watching that video, looking at that timeline, you can get really get a sense of what happened to him and what happened to him in the days that followed.",

BEN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY: There's a brother who said four or five days before this happened to Tyre that same Scorpion unit confronted him while he was in his car going to get pizza, and he said that they used all counter profanity against him. They threw him on the ground, talking about where the drugs and where the weapons. TODD (voice-over): And Crump said the officers pointed a gun at the man's head.
