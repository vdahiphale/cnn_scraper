And it's no coincidence he's making these moves with the midterm elections less than three weeks away. This afternoon the president is expected to announce he's authorizing the release of another 15 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency stockpile. Gas prices have dropped significantly from the peak this summer. But they are still higher than this time a year ago. And they know it and are taking note. Let's start at the White House. Jeremy Diamond is there. What are you learning that the president is going to say today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden is expect to announce 15 million barrels of oil to be released from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.That would round out the 180 million barrels of oil the president had pledged to release last spring to try to stabilize oil markets and bring the price of gas down because of the effects of the war in Ukraine. Now of course, the U.S. is also dealing with the effects and will be dealing in the future with the effects of this 2 million barrels per day of production cut from OPEC+. That was announced just a couple weeks ago. To put this 15 billion barrels of oil in perspective, the U.S. on an average day consumes about 20 billion barrels of oil. So to be clear, this is not going to have a dramatic effect on gas prices or on oil prices. But it is intended to try to send a signal to oil markets and also to, of course, American voters, who will head to the polls in three weeks, if they haven't already voted by mail. Crucially, the administration is also announcing a plan today to purchase more oil to replenish the reserve, which is low at 400 million barrels. Beyond that, of course, the U.S. is saying it is possible it could do additional releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should market conditions call for it in the future.",

So the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release has gotten the most attention but the more significant thing the administration has done is essentially announced a price floor to replenish the reserve.What that means for oil producers is they might be worried right now, if a recession is imminent, that oil prices would crash. This is what's happened in the past. It's part of the reason they might be holding back production. Oil prices are high today but if we see them go way down again, as we saw in early 2020, maybe they're going to lose their shirts. So this is a form of insurance so they limit the risk of losing a lot of money by setting a price floor for -- it's a bit counter intuitive. But basically the idea is it should encourage energy producers to drill more. That's what Republicans have been asking the administration to do.",

I mean, the point of this Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to safeguard national strategic interests, right?If there's a war, if suddenly the military needs more petroleum products, for example, it's not really designed to get gas prices down for the benefit of consumers. That's how it gets used but already, as Jeremy pointed out, we've drawn down this reserve quite a bit. I think it's about at half its maximum authorized capacity today. So if we continue drawing it down, maybe it will be OK. But if there is an actual national security emergency and that oil is needed and it's less available, that carries some risk.",

Absentee ballots, some of the numbers have come in, some 22,000 so far. We've talked to the folks at Georgia State. They say the vote has been going fast and smoothly.

But the way Rubio has been running, the way he ran on that stage last night was pretty much in line with the right wing of the Republican Party. Val Demings, her job last night was to show she could go toe to toe with an incumbent senator. I think to a large degree, she did that. She seemed prepared.

He said we've been setting up and transferring the powers and instructions and authorities from the civilian authority to the military authority. But we're going to do this, we're going to run this area jointly. Significantly, he said, we have now transferred most of the joint civilian-military command to the east bank.

This new announcement on martial law, it specifically applies to the four territories illegally annexed by Russia. But there's a provision there that suggests further crackdowns could be coming inside Russia itself. Given Putin's two-decade playbook of using military setbacks in order to further introduce repression at home, I think this is something to watch very carefully. He may be preparing for more extensive crackdowns inside Russia itself. [11:25:00] BOLDUAN:  General, what do you think this martial law actually will do? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, first of all, a declaration of martial law probably gives him of more cover, let's say, legitimacy of oppressive measures for the people who are causing problems for him. But also, it's the way Putin operates. The more demonstrations there are, the more he uses these demonstrations and efforts to strengthen his own authoritarian grip. It's true that the Russians are losing in Kherson. But how much, how soon and what's the cost to Ukrainians? But I think the evacuation of civilians, that's a very bad sign. That's just more ethnic cleansing by the Russians, one more way to get rid of the Ukrainian people who had the courage to stay there and try to hang on their homes.

To General Clark's point, ethnic cleansing, I think that's a fair word, when you are forcing mass movement of civilians, including forced deportation of many civilians now, from areas of Ukraine that have been occupied by Russian troops into Russia itself.
