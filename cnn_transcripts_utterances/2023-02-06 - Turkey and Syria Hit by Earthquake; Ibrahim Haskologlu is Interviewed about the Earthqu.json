In fact, three others flew across the continent, or parts of it, during the Trump administration. However, those were only discovered, those flight paths, after Joe Biden took office. CNN is off the coast in South Carolina where U.S. teams are now looking for remnants of that balloon and collecting them. You see some pictures there of what they brought back. First, however, to that story of this morning. Frantic rescue operations right now in Turkey and Syria, desperate ones, to try to save lives. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, she is in Istanbul, Turkey.

So, if you see that on a tweet, the person is probably not as accurate as someone who calls it a magnitude earthquake.But when you get a 7.8, we don't talk about really the epicenter. It's almost an epi line because an entire part of the country ruptures. A large expanse of the land ruptures or can even slide against each other. And this is called a slip strike, which means one land was here, one of the plates here, another plate was here and they go in opposite directions, or one goes in one direction. Here are the aftershocks pretty much in a line. Now, this was the initial quake and the initial shaking, 190 kilometers across, more than 100 miles of ripping of the land. That fault moved more than 100 miles in that direction. Not at one time. It may have only moved a couple of meters, a couple of yards, but for the longest time we're not talking about the focus or the epicenter, all along that line that I showed you in red, that's where it shook. That's where the land moved. Right between the Anatolian Plate and the Arabian Plate. And you would expect it because it's right there. That's the line and the area I drew a little bit ago right along those two plate boundaries. There has been a 7.5 earthquake aftershock after that, but really not even along this fault. A little bit farther to the north, about 60 miles or so. So, we'll have to see what that does. We know that that has already caused damage as well in a separate shake. Guys, back to you.",

So, I'm going to just do very limited motions to let you know behind me you may be able to see very much in the distance there are some Coast Guard vessels that have set up a perimeter. We're roughly three miles off the coast of the Myrtle Beach shoreline in South Carolina at the moment. That perimeter is set up. Within that perimeter, that's where the recovery efforts are taking place.According to a U.S. senior military official, we're talking about 47 feet of water, which is a lot more shallow than they had anticipated when they shot down that suspected Chinese spy balloon. We're told that they're going to use Navy divers, as well as unmanned vessels, to try and bring the structure up. They'll put it on a salvage vessel. They'll take that then back to the Quantico area so intelligence officials can examine what they bring up. I can tell you that also last night, in the north Myrtle Beach area, we saw what seemed to be items that were being brought up, but CNN was not able to independently confirm. We did reach out to the U.S. Navy to see if, in fact, that's what those U.S. Navy officials were bringing up, but they would not confirm it for us.

Did they take this down because of that risk, or did they take it down in part because of concerns about political fallout here in the U.S.? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think most of the concern had to do with whether or not shooting this spy balloon down earlier in the week could cause harm to anyone on the ground, at least based off of, you know, the statements that we got from numerous U.S. officials. When President Biden came off Air Force One, I did ask him to elaborate on some of the recommendations and advice he got from his own national security officials. And he put a -- he emphasized when asked about - about the timing of - of the downing of the balloon, he emphasized really that they were focused on the safety of those on the ground. That being said, that runs up against, we're seeing some political criticism from Republicans and it comes ahead of the State of the Union that we know the White House wanted to focus on his economic agenda.
