Gaza's second-biggest city, Khan Younis in the south, is bearing the brunt. Scores of wounded are streaming into hospitals.

Eyewitnesses report multiple strikes, and a nearby hospital says it received 90 bodies on Tuesday. A spokesman for many says many people are still trapped under the rubble.

Meantime Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting the idea of an international force responsible for Gaza's security once the war is over. He says only the Israel Defense Forces should control the disarmament of Gaza and Hamas. The Biden administration publicly says Israel is heeding US warnings to try and limit civilian casualties in Gaza but privately not everyone in the White House agrees.

MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: None whatsoever. John, what I'll tell you is, you know, a nation's values normally drives a nation's policies, which drives a nation's strategy. So when you're talking about the values of what we're seeing in Ukraine, a sovereign country. A nation that has territorial boundaries, that has been invaded by another nation, that interferes with their conduct of their government, it would seem to me that the United States' values says that's not right. The freedom and democracy is an important thing for all nations, and we should stand up for that. Especially the point about the fact that Ukraine has so many connections with the United States, going back to several accords where we promised to help them, with security, once they gave up some of the things that they had during the period they were part of the Soviet Union. So, no, this would be a violation, in my view, of our values, but it's also something that would be a portrayal of another country on the world stage by United States policymakers.",

I believe that the requirement for training in combined arms operation was not going to be met with a pieced together training opportunity by the West, to help Ukraine have an army of a couple of hundred thousand soldiers going into the offensive on multiple fronts. At the same time, Russia transitioned from the offense to the defense. The defense is much easier to execute. But again, I go back to the point that I think Ukraine has learned a lot of lessons.

New details about the special counsel's planned legal strategy ahead of Donald Trump's federal election subversion trial next year. Prosecutors say they plan to present evidence that Trump's continued support for Capitol rioters helps to show he intended to inspire violence on January 6th as part of a conspiracy he led to overturn the 2020 presidential election. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has the latest now from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, we didn't really start out in the record territory, but boy, we got there in a hurry. June, July, August, September, October, and now November were all records. By a large margin, in some spots. And yes, November of 2023 will take this line and push it all the way into record territory. There is very little, if anything, December can do to not make 2023, the entire year, the warmest year on record globally, because we are so far above where we should be. In fact, some days, we're even 2 degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above normal. There was a little bit of a perturbation here in October and into November, but now we are so far above the old line which was 2016, another El Nino year. Now, 2023 is going to be the warmest year on record, for sure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Critics, though, say carbon capture is expensive and kind of unproven. The draft also had several suggestions for phasing out fossil fuels, including the choice for parties to either phase out rapidly or in, quote, \"orderly ways.\" The first draft does leave plenty of room for negotiators to water down these proposals, as happens every year. Meantime, climate activists are confronting heads of oil and gas companies at the summit. Protesters are calling for the complete end of fossil fuel use. This comes amid reports that a record number of people linked with the fossil fuel industry were registered as delegates for COP28. Four times higher than previous years, you know, when an oil executive wasn't the president. Here's more now from one protester. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL ROSE JACKSON, \"KICK BIG POLLUTER OUT\" SPOKESPERSON: There are more fossil fuel lobbyists here, seven times over, than official indigenous representatives. They're here, unchecked, roaming free, and we're here to say it's time for big polluters to no longer be allowed to write the rules of climate action. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
