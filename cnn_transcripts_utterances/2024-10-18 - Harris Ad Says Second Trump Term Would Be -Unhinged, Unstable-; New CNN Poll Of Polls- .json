      "sentences": "There are 18 days to go until the election. Nearly 10 million Americans have already cast their ballots, and the universe of persuadable voters is narrowing. Vice President Harris is seeking them out by doing interviews in non-traditional places, podcasts, radio shows, even Fox News. And this week, she has pretty much taken up residency in those blue wall states.Joining me now is one of the architects of the Harris Battleground State Strategy, Campaign Senior Adviser David Plouffe. Nice to see you. Thank you so much for being here. Let's talk about those blue wall states. She is in Michigan today. Does the campaign, do you now believe that those states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, that's the most favorable path to victory? And is the Sun Belt more out of reach at this point? DAVID PLOUFFE, SENIOR ADVISER, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: Not at all. I mean, we have multiple pathways to 270, Dana, that I think is really important in a presidential race. So when you look at, you know, Nevada and Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, they're all incredibly close, as are the blue wall states. So there are seven states that are going to come down to a very small margin, and we're trying to reach every voter we can. That's voters who haven't yet decided who are going to vote. Voters that we think are going to support us, who haven't decided whether to vote yet, and want to close as strong as we can. So, no, we think all seven states now remain incredibly competitive, and Kamala Harris has a pathway to winning each of them. Let's talk about the messaging in order to reach those sliver of voters in all of those seven key states. Your campaign, the candidate herself, gotten a lot more aggressive in going after Donald Trump's behavior. Just one example is a new ad from your campaign I want to play. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm glad you asked about data, Dana. We're obviously not going to do things that are not consistent with how we think we will win this race with the voters that will decide it. So I'd say a couple things. First of all, we just read this morning, Trump's own campaign is saying the reason that he's canceling appearances, he won't do a town hall on your network, won't do a second debate is because he's exhausted.So this is important. I've worked in the White House. It's the hardest job in the world, and I think it raises real questions. If somebody can't handle the campaign trail because they're so exhausted, whether they're fit to be president. Now, that ad, all the other messaging we're doing, and I think you just have to watch him every day. He is more unstable, more unhinged, and he's got a plan in Project 2025 that wants to give him unchecked power. Someone like that needs guardrails. He's saying he doesn't want any guardrails. We're also making sure that all the other people who worked for him, former chiefs of staff, national security advisers, defense secretaries are in our advertising. So the people say the people closest to him say this about him, but we're very much connecting it to the average person, which is someone like this wants to enact a reckless tariff and tax plan that would add thousands of dollars to the average middle class family's tax bill. He tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act 60 times. He wants to do it again. You're going to pay a big price for his instability and the fact that he is after unchecked power. So when we talk to those swing voters that are still deciding, the notion, we're trying to paint a picture, one of these two people is going to be in the White House. When you think about Donald Trump, increasingly unstable, desirous of unchecked power, how's that going to work out for you?",

Republicans have spent $21 million on ads focused on LGBTQ rights.In particular, one-third of total spending just this month has been on trans ads, warning Americans about trans people. You are too young, but I remember in 2004, I covered the George W. Bush re-election campaign. They successfully used same-sex marriage as a wedge issue, and it helped them win Ohio. And we're hearing concerns from Democrats that these Republican ads on trans issues is the 2024 version of that. Concern that you're not responding. Why not?",

So huge hypocrisy here. What we see from voters is they are more concerned about their pocketbook, about their health care, about leadership qualities.The other thing I'd say is this is very revelatory about who Donald Trump and his campaign are. Their focus basically, the majority of their campaign right now, is on two inmates and their health care, which courts have said they need to be provided, and Donald Trump's administration paid for.

And that's always what matters most to me and any political professional is what's actually going to cause somebody to decide to vote for you who wasn't, or what's going to cause somebody to vote for you that wasn't. I also think presidential campaigns generally have been successful when they're about big things, and Donald Trump right now is about very small things, which I think is a big contrast with how Kamala Harris is closing this race.",

One, this is still a race in seven battleground states. They're not saying the three blue wall states are more important than the four Sun Belt states.We don't know if they're treating them equally in their minds, but they are in terms of spending. So this late stage in the campaign, the fact that there are still so many routes to the presidency, that is key. I thought on the trans issue, your questions, they're so key. Thinking it back to 2004, that gay marriage question in Ohio. Yes, it's a different time a couple of decades on, but it is resonating out there and worrying some Democrats. He is saying and this isn't new to them. They obviously know this because they do focus groups every night. All the dial testing saying we don't think it's going to drive the vote. So my question here now is, are they truly -- do they believe it's not driving things or are they worried if they defend it? That will create even more issues for them.",

It's a different time.I'm struck by one thing I learned this week. One voter said, January 6th happened since the 2020 election. It was not part of the last election. It's a part of this election.
