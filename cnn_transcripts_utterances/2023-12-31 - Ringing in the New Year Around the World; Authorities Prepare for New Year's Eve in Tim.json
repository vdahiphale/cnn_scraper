Now, the U.S. military says that this was in self defense, and the way they describe it is that this commercial vessel that was transiting the Red Sea was trying to be boarded by these Houthi rebels who were in small boats.They called for help from the military, the military sent two helicopters. The Houthis fired on these U.S. helicopters. The U.S. helicopters shot these boats, sank them, and killed all of those aboard. So this is the first time that the U.S. actually targeted the Houthis in this act of self-defense. But it is an escalation and a continuation of what we have been seeing in the Red Sea for the last several weeks, which is the Houthi rebels trying to target commercial trade in that region, commercial ships, merchant ships. That's a major concern for the White House because this is such a critical shipping route. And in fact, the owner of the ship, Maersk, had just started re-going through the Red Sea, as this was happening. Now they have said that they will suspend transits in that sea for the next 48 hours. But certainly, the Houthis are not the only Iranian proxies that the U.S. is concerned about. You have seen the U.S. carry out air strikes in Syria and Iraq against these proxy groups who have targeted U.S. troops. They have not taken strikes in Yemen against the Houthis because I think the White House is very seriously concerned about escalating this crisis even further, so this is certainly an issue that President Biden will still be dealing with as we enter the New Year. Now, we do know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be traveling to Israel and the Middle East next week, certainly at the top of his agenda are these continued discussions with the Israelis about shifting to a lower intensity phase of their conflict in Gaza. The U.S. would like to see that happen soon. So this is certainly a very large issue that remains on President Biden's plate heading into the New Year, Paula.",

ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  No, I mean, look, I think -- I think President Biden has it just right. This is a very delicate situation, and certainly it's a lot of seriousness that needs to be taken on the approach here. You have a very important trade route. You have commercial vessels, quite large commercial vessels as well, moving goods in and out of the area and out of the route. And you have to insure that trade is happening in a way that protects the area and that is getting people goods they need. So the U.S. is seeking the absolute right approach, carefully engaging, obviously, what happened earlier was self-defense. This idea that the president or the White House does not take Iran seriously is completely false. I mean, Iran is clearly a danger to the region. Clearly, their abuses of civil rights and human rights of their own people can disturb everyone. The president has been very forceful against the entire government, the authoritarian government that Iran is really pressing on, and really I think hurting, not just their own people, but the entire region. So we have to take what's happening with the Houthis and their attacks on commercial vessels very seriously. And so, I really support the president and the president's approach.",

So we're happy to have a conversation about what actually works on the border, funding, additional support for border patrol, technology, but immigration reform is important.

I came to the U.S. as a young child. I became a citizen in my early 20s. Our immigration system is broken. This is also a country that was largely built on the innovation and the hard work of immigrants, who built this country. And so, this idea that somehow we're doing to demonize immigrants today is not right, it's wrong. We want and need real immigration reform. We should have this debate openly in this country, but this idea of somehow linking it to the conflict in Ukraine is incorrect. Quite frankly, it's shameful. Immigration deserves its own robust debate in this country. We're ready to have that. There are real solutions, by the way, which are bipartisan.

And we saw a red heart in the center. You could say it's a symbol of love, peace and prosperity for the New Year to come. And then on the other side of the river at the Lotte Tower, the fifth tallest building in the world, a dazzling light display, and for the more traditional, the ringing of bells, a way to usher in the New Year. And I should point out it is already 2024 here in South Korea. And for many families, it will be a day spent together honoring elders as well as having a bowl of warm soup with rice cakes. Paula, I hope the New Year for you brings health, happiness and lots of prosperity. Back to you.",

But given the nature of the population in terms of the number of people, where they're congregating, past concerns about New Year's Eve, the NYPD can put time, place and manner restrictions on how those protests occur. So, you're free to rally and protest. That's your right. But if it is disruptive to, say, crowd control or the ability of the crowd to move safely or the ability of law enforcement to protect the crowd, there can be restrictions, including up to arrest, although no one wants it to get to that.

Does law enforcement and emergency responders know what's going on in real time to be able to protect the crowd?There is so much activity now, so many lights, so much fun and so many crowds that sometimes it can be hard to know what's actually happening. And that's, I think, the sort of biggest fear when it comes to the ability of law enforcement to react. So, that's why we talk about things like see something, say something, be cognizant of your environment, be cognizant of your ability to move around and other issues like that if you're in big crowds tonight, or you can stay home, like many of us, and wake up tomorrow at a reasonable hour.

But even if it did, understandably, it wouldn't be in the mood for celebrating. 2023 was the worst year in modern day Israel's history since it was founded in 1948.This, of course, owing to those Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 200. There are still more than 100 people being held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas and other groups. But as 2023 comes to a close, there is cautious optimism that we could be inching towards talks that could see another truce coming into effect, and some or all of those hostages being freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. This, of course, would be done via Qatari mediation. If a truce were to come into effect, it would also bring welcome and very much needed relief to the Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip, where, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed. Those figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. At the same time, there is a humanitarian disaster unfolding there. There is hunger. There is disease. There is overcrowding. And a truce would not only allow humanitarian aid to go into the Gaza Strip, but would also provide relief from the fighting that has caused so much death and destruction. Of course, just because things are bad doesn't mean that they can't get any worse. But as we move into 2024, there is at least perhaps some hope that things will get better in the coming year.

This year, he has a gigantic war behind him, which, alternately, he's trying to tell people isn't really affecting life that much. And on the other hand, he is urging them to be united. And I think that's the message. I looked at every minute of his relatively short speech. And, you know, here are the headlines, firm, unshakable. What unites us is the fate of the fatherland. We are united in battle. And never back down. So, I think what he's saying is he's trying to look like a winner to his people, even though you have enormous casualties right now and on the Ukrainian side. And then also, he's trying to say that the country is united in a way that it never has. And he really needs that because even in Russia at this point, it is hard to convince everybody to support this war. There are some people who oppose it.

It's an enormous number. So, Putin obviously doesn't want to talk about that.And the other problem is that they have to get more troops into the meat grinder. And so what they're doing is trying to avoid an all-out mobilization. Remember, the last time they had even a partial mobilization, people fled the country. There were a lot of people who tried to avoid the draft. So, right now, that's his dilemma. He needs to get more troops. Where he's going to get them, Paula, is from the poorer areas of Russia, not from the big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, where people might, might protest.

And it's the primary purpose, I think he would argue, of mothers that they sacrifice their children for this war. It's a pretty brutal message, but I think that's what he's trying to do.",
