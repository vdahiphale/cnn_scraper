Defense officials say the administration will supply Ukraine for the first time with cluster munitions.This weapon is banned in nearly all Western nations because of the risk to civilians. A cluster munition is made up of a canister that contains anywhere from dozens to hundreds of smaller bombs. The danger is that oftentimes for a small percentage, those bombs do not detonate immediately as you see in this attack that Russia launched in Kharkiv, Ukraine last year. That could pose a danger to civilians for many years to come. Both Russia and Ukraine have used cluster munitions in this conflict. As we wait for the briefing to begin, let's turn to CNN's Nada Bashir in London. And, Nada, the issue here seems to be that the Western view is Ukraine needs these munitions to help break through those entrenched Russian positions in eastern Ukraine, multiple lines of defense, minefields, trenches, etcetera. How are Ukrainian officials and now Western officials making that case?",

It's something that President Zelenskyy has been pushing for and requesting for some time now.But this anticipated turnaround by the Biden administration, it's really coming in response to the situation on the ground. We know the cause that Ukraine is in the midst of its weeks-long counter- offensive. But that counter-offensive is A., not going as quickly as Ukraine's Western allies had anticipated. But also the gains being made by the Ukrainian Armed Forces simply aren't as substantial as the U.S. and other NATO Allies would have hoped. And we know that Ukraine is -- Ukraine is burning through its weapons stockpile. And that is a significant concern because that is, of course, simply not sustainable. And that, as you mentioned, is something that Russian officials themselves have picked up on -- have pointed out. We've heard from Russian -- from the Russian ambassador to Belarus speaking about this. He said the hawks in the West have realized that the much-advertised counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces did not go according to plan. So, they are trying at all costs to give at least some impetus to it. In fact, it is a move of desperation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. So, this is really the result of the realities on the ground in Ukraine right now. U.S. officials had not necessarily been considering providing these cluster munitions to Ukraine in a serious way up until a few weeks ago when Ukraine did launch its counter-offensive and U.S. officials began to realize that Ukraine might not have enough ammunition to sustain it through the end of their counter-offensive. Enough to get them through the war in Ukraine.Now, the reality though, is that this -- the U.S. has these munitions in its stockpile, but they also only have so many of those munitions. And so, it is unclear whether this is simply going to be a temporary measure to hold them over until more ammunition is supplied to them more conventional ammunition so that they don't need to use these cluster munitions, or whether this is a more long-term solution. But it is a very controversial move. And it took the Biden administration quite a long time to get to this point. Ukraine had been asking for months and months for this ammunition saying that the Russians are using it. Therefore, they should also be able to use it. And arguing that they would not use it in civilian areas. But they say that it can really have a big impact on their operations on the battlefield. They do believe that because you can hit larger areas and more concentrated targets of Russian troops with these munitions that it could help them break through those Russian defensive lines. And now, U.S. officials do seem to agree. Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder, he said yesterday that he does believe that these could have a significant impact in allowing Ukrainian forces to hit Russian personnel and also engage in anti-tank attacks. And so, this is something the administration has kind of come around to, but it's mostly been by necessity. The Ukrainians are burning through artillery ammunition. And the U.S. has a very large stockpile of these cluster munitions. So now, they're looking to tap into that stockpile. Of course, U.S. allies are not necessarily thrilled by it. But U.S. officials also say they've had extensive conversations behind the scenes with some of those allies who have signed on to that ban on cluster munitions. And they say that they have managed to alleviate some of their concerns, Brianna.",

This is short-term gain for long-term risk to civilians later, especially since this is territory that Ukraine is trying to take back. But tactically, as Natasha mentioned, the Ukrainians in this offensive are burning through ammunition faster, almost the NATO countries can supply it.So, this could give them as much as another month of fighting time before the winter sets in. And that can be crucial in terms of winning back square miles on the battlefield. Long term, it also gives them the opportunity to take back more territory by the way they operate the same artillery munitions that are right now, launching and hitting one discrete area. Instead, these multiple little bomblets spread out, can punch through armor, take out more personnel. So, from Ukrainian perspective, the more that they gain, the more likely that NATO countries are to stop saying, oh, this counter-offensive is going really slow. And the more likely they are to make long-term pledges to keep this battle going.",

The other thing that the Russians did was they allegedly took out that bomb in that dam in the south, which flooded a large area that the Russians then no longer had to defend, and they could move more of their defenses north. So, Ukraine is facing an entrenched enemy that is also well-reinforced. And Moscow just said it's going to be calling up tens of thousands of more reserves so, I have --",

And for those hundred days, President Biden, the entire national security team, our embassy in Moscow, our Secretary of State, myself personally have been invested in trying to bring him home safely.Second, I had the opportunity this morning to meet with Evan's employers at The Wall Street Journal and the personal representatives of his family to talk about the latest status in his case and our efforts to bring Evan home. Third, we did see the comments from the Kremlin that there have been contacts between the U.S. and Russia regarding Evan and other unjustly detained Americans. It is true. And we have said that we remain in contact with Russian authorities at high levels on these cases to try to figure out a way to bring unjustly detained Americans home, including Evan. We have also made clear for months now, even before Evan was detained as we were dealing with Paul Whelan, that we are prepared to do hard things in order to get our citizens home, including getting Evan home. I do not want to give false hope. What the Kremlin said earlier this week is correct. There have been discussions. But those discussions have not produced a clear pathway to a resolution. And so I cannot stand here today and tell you that we have a clear answer to how we are going to get Evan home. All I can do is tell you that we have a clear commitment and conviction that we will do everything possible to bring him home. With respect to the question of whether the recent actions by Prigozhin and the fallout from that creates new openings or opportunities. I can't say that I have perceived that directly. But of course, this is a story that continues to be written day by day. So, we will have to see how things continue to play out in Moscow. In the meantime, we're going to stay laser-focused on doing everything we can both directly with the Russians and then with other allies and partners around the world who are invested in his safe return to try to get them out as soon as possible.

Last year in March, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, she described those munitions as \"exceptionally lethal weaponry, which has no place on the battlefield.\" So, how do you square those comments with this decision?

And by the way, Ukraine -- the democratically elected Government of Ukraine has every incentive to minimize risk to civilians because it's their citizens. It's Ukrainians, who they are trying to protect and defend.This is not Ukraine taking these and going and using them in the Middle East or in Southeast Asia, or in some faraway land. They're using them on their territory to defend their territory. So, we believe that they're highly motivated to do this. And beyond being highly motivated, they have to directly answer your question provided these assurances to us. In terms of the ambassador's comments and other comments that have been bandied about, let me just say that the use of cluster munitions by Russia in this conflict is completely unacceptable on multiple counts. First, they are using them to attack a sovereign country in a flagrant violation of International Law. Second, they're using them specifically to strike after civilian targets, not only military targets. Also in flagrant violation of International Law. And with this weapon system, as well as other weapons systems, we have identified war crimes committed by the Russians. Third, and critically, there is a big difference between the type of cluster munition being used by Russia and the type that we would provide to Ukraine. As I mentioned before, ours have a maximum 2.5 percent dud rate. The dud rate of Russian munitions is between 30 and 40 percent. And just so I don't get this wrong, I will read it to you. The Department of Defense assesses that during the first year of the conflict alone, Russian-fired cluster munitions deployed from a range of weapon systems have likely expended tens of millions of submunitions were bomblets in Ukraine. And then the final point, I think this is an important point. When I talk about what Russia is doing with cluster munitions, I'm not making an argument which says they do it so we'll do it. The argument I'm making is that Russia has already spread tens of millions of these bomblets across Ukrainian territory. So, we have to ask ourselves is Ukraine's use of cluster munitions on that same land actually, that much of an addition of civilian harm given that that area is going to have to be de-mined regardless? So, that is why when we look at the situation today, as opposed to a year ago, and when we look at what Ukraine would be doing with these weapons as opposed to what Russia is doing with these weapons, we see a substantial difference. It doesn't make it an easy decision. And I'm not going to stand up here and say it is easy. It's a difficult decision. It's a decision we deferred. It's a decision that required a real hard look at the potential harm to civilians. And when we put all of that together, there was a unanimous recommendation from the national security team and President Biden ultimately decided in consultation with allies and partners and in consultation with members of Congress to move forward on this step.",

And so far, we have found that when Ukraine provides assurances to the United States about the use of its munitions it followed through on that in terms of the limitations and constraints it's placed on those. And we expect the same in this case. And I just want to underscore. Again, I know I sound like a broken record. But the idea that Ukrainian men and women fighting for the armed forces of Ukraine want to willy-nilly use these things in a way that you're going to harm Ukrainian citizens, which is somewhat implied in the questions, I find you know at odds with their fundamental desire to protect their countrymen and their willingness to put their lives on the line to protect their countrymen, so that's all --",
