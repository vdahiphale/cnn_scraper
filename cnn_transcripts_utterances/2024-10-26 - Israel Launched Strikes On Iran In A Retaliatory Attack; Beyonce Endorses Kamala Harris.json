The Iranian army says that two of its soldiers were killed in the attacks. The Israeli military said it hit, quote, precise military targets and did not include energy infrastructure.

We begin though with Matthew Chance in Jerusalem for us and Matthew, you've been following all of the developments this morning, Iran says the strikes caused limited damage.

But look, I mean, I think the fact that limited damage was sustained was intentional on the part of the Israelis that they didn't want to kind of go all out and attack, for instance, nuclear research facilities or energy infrastructure facilities. And they kept the targeting to military sites.And so what the Israeli Defense Forces, the Israeli military, say that they struck were missile production facilities, aerial defense batteries, surface to air missile installations, things like that, designed, according to Israeli military officials that I've spoken to this morning to send a message to Iran as a response to the attack that was carried out by Iran on October the first with hundreds of missiles being thrown at Israel's air defenses that so it was a message. It was symbolic on one hand. On the other hand, what the Israeli defense officials are telling me is that it was also a very practical set of strikes, because it degraded Israel's, sorry, Iran's ability to carry out air defense, you know, kind of operations, and to strike Israel in the future, and it sets the scene, according to Israeli military officials, for a future possible strike that would allow Israel to operate more freely, they say, inside Iranian airspace. But there's no getting away from it. This could have been much broader, much wider. In fact, it ended up it was quite narrow, targeted just at those military installations, and that's not necessarily a bad thing in terms of what the Iranian response will be.",

So, Christian, I am told from senior Israeli officials that they do expect some sort of response from Iran, they say it could be even imminent, but they are hoping, given in the -- given the limited scope of this strike by Israel, and given the pressure that they expect to see from the United States and other regional players there on Iran, that that response be indeed very limited and can lead to more deescalation.

      "sentences": "It is, but from different sources, and it's sort of like a strike retaliation strike, you know, it's essentially a plan that's been heavily influenced by the United States. As you see, Israel has taken, you know, more than three weeks to design its so called self-defense retaliation, and the reason, I think, for that is because they've been in heavy negotiations with the U.S. to keep it in a way that doesn't massively escalate. Because oil infrastructure, nuclear infrastructure would have been a whole another level of targeting an attack, and would have created so much more ripple effects around the world that that could have been seriously, very, very risky. And clearly all sides decided that at this time that is not what they wanted or needed to do right now.So what we're in is this process of reestablishing deterrence. As you know, Bianna, Iran and Israel have been in this shadow war for many, many years, Iran, through its proxies around Israel, Israel through its human intelligence sources and cyber inside Iran, whether blowing up centrifuges at Natanz, whether, you know, assassinating either, you know, nuclear scientists, or lately the is the Hamas leader. So I think what we're expecting is this response from Israel, potentially, as you know, as the others said, a small response from Iran, or no response from Iran, and then for all sides to say, well, this now is reestablished deterrence for the moment. Clearly, the United States has a huge amount of interest in how this goes. They don't want a wide regional war. Iran does not want and cannot afford a full scale attack from Israel. It is definitely the weaker partner in this, in conventional warfare and everybody's trying to deescalate. Meantime, you know, Gaza is exploding, and so is Lebanon. So there are more pieces of this horrible puzzle to resolve.",

Dozens of people have been killed even in the last 24 hours, and that is what first the attack on Israel, then the year of massive attacks on Gaza is, you know, firing up the whole region. And it's not an accident that the Secretary of State was in the region, in Israel and in Qatar and in other places, and in London, meeting with Arab foreign ministers, Allied foreign ministers, just ahead of this Israeli response, and to brief everybody on what they're trying to do in the last few months of this administration.",

I mean, there were concerns that energy infrastructure like oil terminals, oil facilities, nuclear research facilities would be struck, in fact, that didn't happen.  [06:35:00] And what the Israelis did is to limit their strikes to military installation, specifically according to the Israeli military missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile installations, and striking Iran's aerial capabilities. And they said they did that for two reasons, first of all, to send a message that the strikes against Israel would not go unanswered. And so, there's a symbolism to this, but there's also a practical reason that these targets were selected according to Israeli defense officials, saying that it basically degrades Iran's capability to strike at Israel in the future and degrades their ability to counter it further, Israeli airstrikes if they're deemed necessary in the future. It's been criticized in Israel by one opposition figure, saying that these strikes did not go far enough, that the targeting should have been much broader and much wider. But others in Israel have said that military logic has prevailed, and that this is a retaliation which was necessary, but not one that draws Israel further into a conflict directly with Iran.
