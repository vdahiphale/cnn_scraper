Calls for calm in Paris after a teenager is shot by a police shot dead. French President Emmanuel Macron says there is no way to justify the 17 year olds killing and the officer who fired the fatal shot is being held in detention. Here as President about to unveil a new centerpiece in his reelection campaign, well Bidenomics resonate with American voters. The conflict in Sudan is threatening to destabilize the region. 10 weeks on I'll speak with the Norwegian Ambassador to the country. And Chicago, Illinois had the worst air quality in the world on Tuesday, all from the wildfires burning out of control north in Canada. We'll show you how extreme weather events can affect your wallet. Welcome back, wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome. This is the second hour of \"Connect the World\" with me Becky Anderson. Kramatorsk targeted by Russia yet again, unlike the horrendous attack on a train station in the early weeks of the war, civilians are killed. Among them, 14 year old twin sisters the faces of the innocent now war victims. So tonight we ask is this strike a message from Russia's Military that its war tactics aren't changing, even after that startling aborted insurrection this past weekend? Ben Wedeman was back with us this hour from Eastern Ukraine. Nick Paton Walsh is in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Let's start with you. You were on the scene very soon after that missile strike last night, Ben. What do we know and what are you hearing on the ground?",

And we saw very distraught relatives seeing that body bag come out there still others waiting for news of loved ones inside. Just a moment ago, I saw a rescue worker showing a woman a damaged cell phone that perhaps belonged to one of her relatives. We understand that there are still several workers from the restaurant that have still to be accounted for. At this point, more than 60 people were injured in addition to the death toll of at least 11. Among those 60 injured was an eight month old baby now. Becky, we were in that restaurant having lunch just day before yesterday. It's the most popular considered the best restaurant in Kramatorsk. There were lots of soldiers, lots of civilians, there were children there even people and brought their pets. So anything hitting that restaurant is going to cause mass casualties. Now last night, we heard President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that it was believed that what hit the restaurant was an S300 surface to air missile. But what's -- since then is that in fact, it was in Iskander, the Russian missile. That is a hypersonic ballistic missile, which is very accurate and has a very large payload, which would really explain the extent of the damage here. It's not just the restaurant that guy got hit. We think it hit actually the kitchen. That's why so many of the staffs are dead, injured or unaccounted for. But this entire area, there are shops, there's a jewelry store around the corner. There's a post office nearby now in front of me you can see it, there are residential apartment buildings, so the damage is massive. And for the people in this city, it's just yet another worrying reminder of just how close they are to the frontlines. They're only about 35 to 40 kilometers a day and every day you hear the air raid sirens go out, you hear distant explosions, sometimes of very nearby, Becky.",

This is their tactic, they often, you may sometimeswonder if it is a rare moment of accuracy from their weapons, I have to tell you, I've spent more times looking at Craters from Russia munitions that have wildly missed their targets than actually seeing them strike them accurately. But a very familiar Russian tactic is to fire into civilian areas, often at times of frustration on the battlefield, where they're losing elsewhere, perhaps in the hope they might disrupt military operations or just cause adequate distraction within the town's infrastructure, somewhere like Kramatorsk, to slow down a war effort, but a lot of the time to just to terrify the local population. There's not just in this war, we've seen it in pretty much every war, the Russian Military flights from Chechnya through to Syria. So there's nothing sadly new about this tactic. But it doesn't mean that the deaths in some way are excusable, this is just how Russia -- war despite the fact it often tries to suggest that its targets are indeed military and hit with precision that is just repeatedly shown to be nonsense, Becky.",

Now that is somewhat undermined by the fact that the Air Force were indeed involved in trying to slow down Wagner on the highway to Moscow. And that Surovikin appeared on television on Friday, telling everyone to stop. The report suggests that this may have been a forced change of heart, the Wall Street Journal. The two elements in its report are to suggest that Sergei Shoigu, the Defense Minister, and Gerasimov, the Chief of Staff were, in fact meant to be captured by Prigozhin. And also, the report suggests that, in fact, the Russian intelligence services had prior knowledge of the report, and I'd be speaking to a European intelligence official about that. And he referred to the Surovikin's suggestion that he had advanced knowledge and the plot to potentially capture Shoigu and Gerasimov's, something that was more in the realm of speculation. Now, he said that there's still a lot of fog around all of this and time will really tell he said about what exactly Prigozhin's motivations and plans were. But in terms of prior knowledge, the official did say that officials in the Russian security establishment may have known about it, they may not have told about it, they may have decided to help it succeed. And they may have had prior knowledge, what happened may Putin lose prestige and if that's what the factions wanted, then that is what they got. Now, you wouldn't speculate if a purge might occur in the Russian security services, but he did say that turmoil would certainly continue to follow. So, a lot slowly emerging here, but also to clearly Western officials, we're going to have a field day, suggesting disloyalty amongst other Russian top brass and getting Moscow to essentially tear itself apart after a catastrophic weekend, Becky.",

I would wonder what the morale of Russian armed forces would be after they saw the events on the territory of their country, when they saw this very unstable and covered reaction of the law enforcement agencies of the armed forces of the President of this country. Yes, they will probably resume their tactics of attacking the civilians by the missiles. They're already producing the new missiles wave, unfortunately, the components coming from some western countries. So the western countries should be very particular at trading with Russia, so they impose more sanctions and today on dual use technologies should be very particular about trading with Russia, because every dollar every year they earn trading from your countries.

On the other hand, though, he has pressures from other Ministers like Defense Minister, Yair Golan who really want to go even harder against the settlers. And at the same time, he also has the Israeli public and the Israeli settlers. And this latest round of the Israeli settler rounds against Palestinians came in direct response to that terrorist attack that killed four Israelis who were at a restaurant and at a gas station. So he has this balancing act and essentially, that's what he was trying to make these recent statements where he condemned the West Bank raiders and said that it's unacceptable to me that when your blood is boiling, and people are murdered in the cruelest possible way that people give themselves free rein raid villages start fires, it's absolutely unacceptable. He said that calls to grab land illegally, there have been a group of seller especially known they're called the hilltop use who will go and try to put out outpost by on their own. He says that those are not acceptable, saying that they should be done in a legal way. But he has repeatedly reminded people that settlement construction has doubled under his watch that he promotes settlement construction. More than 4500 new settlement homes have been approved in the last few weeks. This is despite the major protests from allies like the United States. So, Netanyahu trying to make this balancing act, what's interesting what we're hearing today about these four Israelis who were arrested, they were arrested by directive of the Minister of Defense who's the only one who can sign off on these sorts of administrative detention orders? Now administrative detention means that they have been arrested without charge and the intelligence on them is essentially held secret. This is something we often see more often use on Palestinians for security reasons. It is very rare to see it being used against Israeli settlers. But the Senior Official was telling me that they know that these four people have been involved in the recent acts of violence in the West Bank in the last week, and that they have essentially intelligence that they believe that they may do something again, and that's why they've come under administrative detention. Again, a very unique thing to have Israelis be placed under administrative detention, but goes to show you how there are some strains of the Israeli government who are very much appalled by this really recent settler violence. The strongest statement, of course, from all this coming from the Israeli security agencies the idea of themselves, who even equated this recent round of settler violence to acts of terror, Becky.",

So the ceasefire is not holding up. Let me also add that a ceasefire for one or two days doesn't make much difference. It lets people rest, it lets them to regroup. And then the fighting stands again. What we need is a much longer ceasefire that the both sides that everybody commits to, so that we can start the humanitarian assistance in a serious, large scaled up manner, that we get access to all parts of the country. And that this sets the kind of the stage for a political process that can deal with the, you know, the more economies or contextual issues so that we can have in any -- trouble.",

You are calling on theinternational community to do more at this point; the UN has extended its mission. A number of Sudanese leaders have actually called for the resignation or the removal of the UN Special Envoy in Sudan, of course at this point. But I mean, realistically, what do you think? What do you believe the next steps should be by the international community? It frankly looks as if the international community has run out of ideas at this point.",

Now only a single protester is behind it. And he has been fighting in Swedish courts for three months for the right to hold the demonstration. Swedish police say the decision was made in accordance with the right of freedom of expression and poses, \"Little immediate security risk\". Well, the demonstration coincides with the beginning of the Eid al-Adha, one of the most important holidays in the Muslim calendar. This is taking place as Sweden, of course attempts to join NATO, those attempts being held up by member states, Turkey, a majority Muslim country. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh standing by in London, you've spent years covering Turkey from Istanbul, of course, for us as well. You're in London at present. We've seen Quran-burning protests in Sweden before that have deeply upset the Muslim community around the world, not least those in Turkey and the Government of Turkey. Has there been any reaction from Turkey? And does this have the potential to further aggravate talks on Sweden's accession to NATO?",

One new picture to show you of the debris from the Titan submersible that imploded last week killing allfive people on board we are waiting and watching the Canadian Coast Guard. Unload pieces of the sob at a pier in St. John's. The passengers were going to view the wreckage of the Titanic on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean when they lost contact with their mothership and the sub imploded. This debris was found not far from there. These images just coming into CNN. Well, more than 80 million people from the U.S. Midwest to the East Coast run the air quality alerts as smoke from Canadian wildfires sweeps across the border. A video posted to social media from the U.S. State of Wisconsin shows the smoke is so bad they can't see the sun. Canadian authorities say that 200 wildfires are still burning out of control making it Canada's worst fire season ever. And in Chicago and Detroit, they had the worst air quality in the world throughout the day on Tuesday according to IQ air. Well, extreme weather can also wreak havoc on the economy. And now our reporting, so far this year losses have exceeded a billion dollars due to extreme weather events. Let's bring in Bill Weir to talk about the financial impact of this severe weather. And just give me some examples of what you've seen that really sort of captures this financial and economic toll from severe weather events.",

They're using rolling blackouts to try to manage that demand, filling it in with the renewables when they can. But overall, the demand and just basic economics makes it more expensive for everyone as these cooling, peak cooling demands hit Texas set a record yesterday for energy demand as well. And the worst is yet to come this big heat dome, the new phenomenon we're seeing is they just sit and just torture people for weeks at a time. So, we may not see an end to this big one in the middle of the U.S. until next week.",
