He took the bait every time as they sparred over some of the biggest issues in this election, including immigration and abortion and the economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it is a poll of those people that watched the debate. So just keep that in mind as we get to these results.Our first results here in our exclusive flash poll, who won the debate? The overall number here overwhelmingly Kamala Harris did. I'm going to look at my e-mail here, 63 percent. You see there on your screen say Kamala Harris won the debate, only 37 percent say Donald Trump won the debate. And that is quite different than the expectations going into this among this group of debate watchers in this poll. We asked folks going into the debate, who do you expect to win the debate? Well, it was 50-50, 50 percent expected Harris, 50 percent expected Trump to win the debate. That was before the debate. And we just showed you where it ended up afterwards, 63 percent to 37 percent. And take a look at this, Jake. This is a complete reversal from what we saw in June. Compare these numbers to Biden. In June you see that it was 67 percent to 33 percent, two-thirds thinking Trump won only a third thinking Biden won a complete reversal in just a few months.

And I'm thinking about earlier when we were talking and I was struck recently in the last couple of weeks just watching Trump in his normal campaign world on the stump, in interviews, and he is progressively slowing down.He's progressively not able to really even make his own normal kind of cases that he would make about all sorts of issues. And that was on display tonight. I mean she was really helped by Trump just not really being able to kind of take it to her on virtually anything. And in a way, her biggest weakness might have been that when you give her something that she's not prepared for, she may or may not be able to address it. But Trump never did that. He only gave her things that would be very obvious that he would say on the debate stage. And I think that's one of the main reasons that she was able to just kind of quite impressively actually take a lot of preparation and just spit it right out on that debate stage, almost exactly probably the way her advisers wanted her to.

In 1960, Nixon was the vice president. The criticism of John Kennedy was that he was too young, too callow, too inexperienced.After that first debate that went away because people thought at the very least that Kennedy showed that he stood up and was Nixon's equal and perhaps his superior. 1980, Jimmy Carter, a lot of concern. Was Ronald Reagan too big a risk? And after that debate, people were reassured. They didn't like Carter particularly, and they were reassured we can take this jump into Reagan. In \"The New York Times\" poll over the weekend, three times as many people said they needed to know more about Kamala Harris than said that about Donald Trump. And I got to think for a lot of that, 28 percent of Americans, that they were reassured by what they saw tonight. So I think that it gives permission to support her for people that had doubts.",

Vance used, the word platitudes when he talked to Kaitlan Collins about how he describes the ability of Vice President Harris to articulate her platforms. It's what is demanded of the incumbent versus what was actually provided by a former incumbent. She is expected to talk in very granular detail. Trump had many, many bald assertions, and yet he believes that he was successful in that endeavor nonetheless.The other issue is, is this important idea of managing expectations. She has described herself from the very get-go since she's actually taken the top of the ticket as the underdog, in part because Democrats do not want a performance like this to have people believing there's no reason to lean in. They can lean out. Everything's in the bag. They know there is still the uphill battle of trying to overcome a number of factors. So I think in many ways these are polls show you that even though this was a successful endeavor I think arguably and objectively for the vice president, she still has to overcome this -- I can't tell what the language and coding it is to have her define herself still.",

We saw seven million jobs created, two-thirds going to minorities and to women. We saw HBCU funding hit a record level and made the funding permanent. We frankly saw research on sickle cell anemia accelerated. What we didn't see in this debate was who is Kamala Harris? We've seen her change her position time and time again, and tonight we have no clarity on her position. She's now for fracking when she was against it. She now wants a border wall when she was against it. The border czar herself certainly did not go to the border for three plus years. She's had three years to tell the American people who she is.

This is really interesting. Among the candidates' favorable andunfavorable ratings, take a look here at what we found. Before the debate Harris's favorable rating was at 39 percent. After the debate, among these debate watchers, her favorability rating went up six points to 45 percent. Donald Trump actually ticked down two points among these debate watchers from 41 percent favorable to 39 percent favorable. That's about roughly the same. That's not a 2 percent tick down there. It's not huge. But I do want to note, Kamala Harris's uptick driven a lot by independent voters. She was minus 17, more unfavorable than favorable among these debate watchers, going into the debate, and independent debate watchers, they were plus nine for her favorability coming out of the debate. So a big movement change on her favorability with independents. Take a look at when we asked debate watchers about the confidence in the candidates to lead the country, the ability to lead the country, and the confidence that debate watchers have in that. This is really interesting because even though she was the clear winner in the debate among debate watchers, take a look, 32 percent say a lot of confidence in her, in her ability to lead the country and 36 percent say that about him. She's a little bit better among those who say some confidence in the ability to lead the country. If you add the allotment of some together, they're both at 54 percent, and so they're quite even on this score, which I think is pretty interesting. And then who had a better plan for solving the country's problems? Harris won on this score among these debate watchers as well. 42 percent say Kamala Harris had a better plan for solving the country's problem. That's compared to 33 percent who said Trump. And look, Anderson, 22 percent, 1 in 5 of debate watchers says neither of these two had a good plan for solving the country's problem.

However, however, advantage Harris on a couple of very significant points. David Chalian noting that where she jumped up was among independent voters.We knew coming into this debate that the largest audience of people, the largest percentage of people who said they were open to changing their mind were people who self-identify as independents or as moderates. So the middle of the American electorate, the people who live in the suburbs, the people who maybe voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, aren't, you know, incredibly partisan. They're looking for solutions. They're looking for pragmatism. So the fact that her movement was among independents, who had the better debate about solving the country's problems, she came into the debate at a deficit with Trump on the economy. It's a different question, that question of solving the country's problems, but it shows she made progress with people. Are you a president? Right. That was her biggest challenge. Nobody knows the vice president, whether it's Mike Pence or whether it's Dan Quayle or whether its Al Gore. You know, you're trying to rise from vice -- whether it's Joe Biden. You're trying to rise from president to vice president. You have to prove I'm ready for the first job. It is clear, it is clear that she cleared that bar tonight. Now that does not mean that she's not still in a very competitive race. But if her progress tonight was among independents, now the question is, can you carry that momentum forward. We count votes eight weeks from tonight. Still close, still competitive. But in an election that we all expect is going to be decided on the margins, tonight anyway, the question is, can she hold it?

But the polling we've seen shows that a lot of undecided voters want to know more about her and her policies. Do you think she did enough to stake out ground on that for voters tonight? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I do, and I -- I think she did that in two ways. First, she did talk about the specific policies, whether it's her plan to invest in building more housing, whether it's her work to try to increase tax credits for families with children. She obviously endorses and supports the bipartisan border bill, which would do a lot to fix the problems at the Southern border. But I also think there's probably a lot of voters that, you know, just hadn't seen Kamala Harris in a setting where she could look commanding, where she could appear as a president. And that's what she looked like tonight. She was presidential. She was commanding. She was in charge of that stage. So, I think voters do want to hear more from her on policy specifics. And I thought she did a good job of articulating how she's going to invest in the middle class, grow the economy from the middle out. But I just thought she looked like a president, and Donald Trump kind of looked like a puddle by the end of that debate. There was only one president on that stage, and it was Kamala Harris.

One of the questions we asked these debate watchers is that classic question of who do you think cares about people like you, if you will?And take a look at these results from our instant poll. Who better understands problems facing people like you? Before the debate, 39 percent said that about Harris, 43 percent Trump. And look at how that flips for Harris. After the debate, 43 percent of the debate watchers say that she understands problems facing people like them; 40 percent say that about Trump. Now, this is margin of error stuff, but you can see directionally that she made up some ground in that category. That is not true when it comes to the economy. And this shows, even though she won the debate overwhelmingly in the minds of the voters, look at the economy here. Who would you -- who would better handle the economy, is what we asked. Going into the debate before the debate, 37 percent said Harris; 53 percent, Trump. After the debate, again, margin of error stuff here. But numerically, she lost a little ground. Thirty-five percent said so after the debate that she would better handle the economy; 55 percent said Trump. And we know that is one of his strongest suits across the polling in this election, and he seemed to hang onto that piece in this debate tonight, according to our poll of debate watchers. And finally, did the debate change your mind? Did the debate alter your presidential preference? Take a look at those bottom numbers. Eighty-eight percent of Harris supporters said, nope, nothing here changed my mind. Only 78 percent of Trump supporters said that. You see there, 17 percent of Trump supporters said they would reconsider their choice. Six percent said -- of Trump supporters that their mind is changed. Now, we don't know how that's changed, necessarily. It's not necessarily to her. But I just think it shows that bottom number, that 78 percent, 10 percent less than what Harris had, of his supporters say it has no effect. But that means, you know, 23 percent there or so, 22 percent believe that this did cause them to reconsider or change their mind of Trump supporters.
