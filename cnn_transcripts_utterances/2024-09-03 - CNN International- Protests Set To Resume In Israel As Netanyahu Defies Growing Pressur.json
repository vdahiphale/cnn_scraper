      "sentences": "Well, the Israeli Prime Minister is defiant despite the mounting pressure that he is facing here in Israel, as hundreds of thousands of people over the last couple of days, not only in Tel Aviv, but across the country, have been taking to the streets, demanding that he prioritize the release of the hostages, striking a ceasefire deal over any other aims of this war. And despite that pressure, last night, we saw the Israeli Prime Minister doubling down on what has become a major sticking point in these negotiations, and that is who will control the Philadelphi Corridor, that strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement.The Israeli Prime Minister, he came up with this demand after the initial framework agreement between Hamas and Israel in early July, saying that Israeli troops needed to retain control of that corridor. Hamas has said that Israel needs to withdraw from there in order to get into a ceasefire agreement. And so, that leaves these two sides at a standstill, and it also really deals quite a heavy blow to the hopes of so many Israelis, some of whom I spoke to in the streets of Tel Aviv yesterday, who had hoped that the deaths of these six hostages could potentially be a catalyst to a deal and to getting to a deal in terms of changing the Israeli government and the Israeli Prime Minister's position on this notion. Because it is important to note that even as the Israeli Prime Minister stressed the security imperatives of retaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, his Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, has said in multiple cabinet meetings now that he believes that the Israeli forces could withdraw from that corridor in order to get at least several dozen Israeli hostages out of Gaza, and then, if necessary, could return to Gaza and take over that corridor once again, without dealing a blow to Israel's security. But, the Israeli Prime Minister and the majority of the ministers in his cabinet disagree with that position, and they are showing no signs of changing, despite what we've seen in the streets over the last 48 to 72 hours.",

Yesterday, the President here at the White House was asked whether he believes that Netanyahu has done enough to try to get this ceasefire and hostage deal across the finish line, and the President answered very bluntly by saying \"no\". Now, the President also, a bit later in the day, was asked if he plans on speaking to Netanyahu any time soon. He said that he eventually will speak with him, but did not put a timeframe on that.It comes, as Jeremy was noting, Netanyahu is facing significant pressure from within his country to do something to try to move these hostage talks along. Now, the Israeli side, as you heard Netanyahu's comments, really bristled at the President's suggestion that the Israeli Prime Minister hasn't done enough. They said that they've approached these negotiations with seriousness. A U.S. official responded to that by saying that the President has made clear he believes Hamas is responsible for the latest deaths of the hostages, but they also believe the Israelis need to act with some urgency in these talks. The President had assembled his national security team yesterday to chart the path forward, to try to make some progress as it relates to these hostages and ceasefire talks. The President himself has said that he thinks that they could soon present a final deal to the two sides. What the administration and the U.S. officials have been trying to work towards is bridging the gaps between Israel and Hamas. But, even as the President is expressing this optimism, it remains entirely unclear if a plan will be presented that would be acceptable to both sides. We know that officials who have been involved in these negotiations have been working the phones in the wake of the deaths of those six Israeli hostages, including one Israeli American. National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, yesterday, spoke with Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, as well as the Qatari Prime Minister, to try to move these conversations along. But, at this point, it really remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to come to any type of agreement at a time when both have remained dug in on their positions.",

His visit comes as the Catholic Church seeks to grow its presence across Asia and strengthen ties with other religions. At least 11 people have been killed in China after a bus crashed into a crowd of students and parents outside a school. State media quote that the police is saying 13 others were injured. Authorities say that the bus went out of control at an intersection near the school in China's eastern province of Shandong. The driver has been taken into police custody. In a CNN exclusive, we have learned that the U.S. has seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's airplane. The U.S. says that the jet was acquired in violation of sanctions, among other criminal issues. Venezuela's government accuses the U.S. of piracy and escalating aggression. Now to a mass prison break attempt in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has left at least 129 people dead. This happened early Monday at the DRC's largest prison in the capital city. Authorities say that women were raped and several prison buildings were destroyed by fire. The country's Interior Minister held a crisis meeting Tuesday to address the incident and says that an investigation is ongoing. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo, who joins us live from Nairobi. Larry, first, let's just talk about what we know about how this happened.",

And a fire also broke out in the prison's administrative building. It burned through some food depots and the hospital as well. And most tragically, some women were raped in this Monday morning incident.There has been some horrific videos shared on social media.

Now this, of course, is an issue where the Vice President has typically lagged behind former President Donald Trump. So, they're trying to seize on it now, especially a week before the presidential debate.Now, the Vice President in this ad, again, focusing on the affordability of goods, but she is also going to be focusing on this on the trail, yesterday, along with President Joe Biden, appealing to labor groups and union workers, again, the economy, a strong theme there, and tomorrow, heading to New Hampshire to talk about small businesses, entrepreneurship and innovation. She teased some of this last week, saying that she wanted to propose tax credits for small business startups. So, this has been a trickle of economic proposals from the Harris campaign, as they in some ways try to distinguish their messaging, aware that prices are still high for Americans, but that their campaign is proposing how to lower that, and that affordability is front and center on that. Now, again, I should go back to President Joe Biden, who will be utilized on the campaign trail to send this message as well, especially in those blue wall states.

      "sentences": "This is an issue, Rahel, that Donald Trump has struggled with to articulate, to really pick a side on for over a year now, and especially because he does have -- he tries to play both sides of it sometimes. When he is around his allies and some of his more conservative audiences, you hear him take credit for stacking the Supreme Court with three conservative justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. But, he also often tells people, you have to think about politics. You have to win elections. And so, this has been an issue that he has really tried to straddle.But, we did hear some -- a new part of this last week, when he was asked first in one interview with NBC News about how he would vote on Florida's abortion referendum, and essentially the referendum would help get rid of the six-week abortion ban that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had put in place, and issue new protections around abortion. Now, Donald Trump, at first, said he thought that the six-week ban in Florida went too far, that it's not enough time, and that led many people, particularly many of those allies that helped put him in the White House in 2016 during his first campaign. It really angered them. You saw a lot of statements coming out from pro-life and anti-abortion groups, kind of criticizing Donald Trump on it. Then his campaign told everyone, no. That doesn't mean that he is not going, he is -- how he is voting on this referendum. He then was asked about it again on Friday, and he said that he plans to vote \"no\" on the referendum, essentially saying that he would keep that Florida six-week ban in place. So, he kind of went all over on this. But, again, I think that this has been a massive issue for Donald Trump, something he has struggled on, and one that they know is going to play such a huge role in November. And so, this won't be the end of that conversation, Rahel. SOLOMON: I mean, Alayna, a huge role in November, but it also may play a huge role next week on Tuesday during the debate. I mean, how are they preparing for? They will inevitably be asked about -- he will be asked about his position. I mean, how are they preparing to handle that question?",

She is a woman. She can speak to some of this from that background.But, look, they know that this is going to be one of the most hotbed issues at the debate. Donald Trump has been preparing for this debate behind the scenes, and abortion is absolutely one of those issues that they are kind of fine tuning and working on with him. I think one thing to keep in mind as well, Rahel, is that a lot of this plays into the broader picture of another area where Donald Trump is struggling, which is the widening gender gap. We have seen that really become even more of an issue for the Trump campaign with having the Vice President now at the top of the Democratic ticket. This is something that they recognize, and they know that abortion plays a big role into that, and that abortion rights are very popular across the country. So, this is something that they're fine tuning behind the scenes. And I think there is no question that his kind of waffling on abortion, particularly his answers when it comes to the Florida referendum, is going to be a major issue at the debate, and one that they need to kind of sort out over the next few days before they hit the stage in Philadelphia.

We've talked to providers here and people who help out, help women who need their funding for abortions, and they told me, because they deal with a lot of young women who don't really follow the news that closely, as we all do here, and a lot of them were saying that they had no idea actually. They weren't paying that close of attention to the fact that this six-week law is now the law of the land here in Florida. Again, it only went into effect on May 1. And Florida had been a place since the other crackdowns of abortion, a lot in the south, right, where there is complete bans. So, some of these groups were helping fund people to come down to Florida, actually, and get an abortion, which happened to me, go up until 15 weeks, until a few months ago. Now, it's down to six weeks.It's very strong, and it's -- now we're dealing with this whole debate, this amendment, which is going to be fascinating to see. It needs to get 60 percent to pass, which is not going to be easy. Polls showed it consistently getting support well over 50 percent, but in between, some poll showing it gets over 60 percent, some show it does not. SOLOMON: Oh, interesting. So, this may really come down to wait and see sort of how the voters decide. It's not really clear, it sounds like. One thing Mitch that's interesting is obviously a lot of our focus has been on the presidential election, for obvious reasons. But, one thing that hasn't gotten as much attention as some of the Senate races. Democrats have said they believe that they'll be able to hold on to their majority in the Senate despite some pretty tough races this November. I'm curious how this issue, specifically of abortion rights, is impacting the Senate race there in Florida.",

They see this as one of those races. They don't really expect to win. The Democrats do. But, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has made abortion rights front and center from the very beginning of this campaign for her.It's interesting, because with the state now becoming much more red the last few years, roughly a million more registered Republicans and Democrats, the folks who were supporting the abortion rights amendment know they can't rely strictly on Democrats to pass this, right? So, they're being very strictly neutral and not trying to get partisan. But, Democrats like Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, are fighting hard into this, leading into this, trying to get Republicans who maybe would vote the party line, not only to support Amendment Four, but to support her, because, in fact, she is going to be much better, in her opinion, on reproductive rights than Rick Scott would be.",

Then it's every month since then, every year since then, more Republicans have committed the state.You mentioned COVID. COVID had a lot to do with that. We saw people leaving states like Illinois, New York, coming to places like Florida. So, there has been a real seismic change in our politics here, from being the quintessential swing state for so many election cycles to this year we are not. [11:40:00] This is a big deal for the folks in Palm Beach County to have this event with Senator Amy Klobuchar being a top surrogate for the Harris campaign today, because, in fact, they have -- it is not on the radar like it has been for so many election cycles.

Donald Trump in 2016 won by just one point over Hillary Clinton. He only won by three points over Joe Biden in 2020.So, even as recent as four years ago, this was a really big battleground state, and it's just the last couple of cycles now where we're not one of the top seven, right? Georgia has superseded in the south here as a state where everybody is competing for. So, yeah, abortion rights this year, because it's on, what, 10 states are also voting for this, the Kamala Harris. It's one of the good issues for Democrats.

And then, on the Republican side, we've heard from Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio against it. And the GOP ticket, former President Trump and J.D. Vance are against it as well.What's notable here and sort of unusual is not that a foreign takeover is getting scrutiny. It's that it's a foreign takeover from a close U.S. ally. Not even during the height of the trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan in the 80s and 90s did we see a takeover from a Japanese company get blocked. And I spoke to Michael Leiter, he is a partner over at Skadden Arps, and he told me that it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify national security risks that justify opposing the merger. He told me it is much, much easier to see the political risk here. And he said it's regrettable that the politics appear to be driving this debate here. So, more to come on this front.

However, the fear is that it actually could rise. As you mentioned, there are apparently still people who are trapped underneath the rubble and the rescue crews trying to get to them. This regional military official also says that at least 219 people are now confirmed to have been injured in these strikes. Now, he says that the rescue crews and the search and rescue crews are still on the grounds -- are still trying to get people out from underneath some of those buildings.You were also saying 10 residential buildings apparently damaged, and that, on top of the fact that a hospital in that area was apparently badly damaged as well. They believe that as many as 18 people could still be trapped somewhere underneath there. And of course, they fear that with that, the death toll might continue to rise, as we get into the evening hours. Now, to recap all of this, the Ukrainians are saying that it was two Russian ballistic missiles that struck this military educational facility. They say that there was actually an air raid siren that went off, an air raid alert that went off, but that the time between when that alert first happened and the striking of the missile was so short that people simply didn't have enough time to get to these air raid shelters, and that is why the toll is as bad as it is. Now, the President of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is obviously extremely angry about this whole situation. He came out earlier today, and he was actually one of the first to confirm that this attack had happened. And he once again called for the lifting of restrictions on longer distance strikes with Western weapons inside Russia, and also for more air defenses for Ukraine. That's something that the Ukrainians have been calling for a lot, of course, really for the past over a year, and they say that they badly need longer distance air defense systems, like, for instance, the Patriot, because, of course, ballistic missiles, like the ones that were used in this attack, extremely difficult to shoot down four air defense weapons, and those longer range air defense weapons, like, for instance, the U.S.- supplied Patriots are the ones that can do that. So, right now, a lot of grief, a lot of anger on the ground here, and the leadership of this country already saying that they will have revenge for this against the Russian army, Rahel.",
