That, the day right before Super Tuesday. Of course, a pivotal date when voters in several states will have a chance to pull the lever, possibly for Trump or others in the Republican primary and it's much sooner than the April 2026 date that Trump's defense lawyers had asked for.That's just one of two major developments today in one of two election subversion cases against Donald Trump. The other of course in the state of Georgia, Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is on the stand today. He was there for three hours so far in a hearing to move his case to federal court, his actions after the 2020 election under the microscope in that Georgia indictment, and in the spotlight during questioning under oath on the stand today. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is here. Let's begin with that federal case, March 4, 2024. Trump had wanted it for more than two years after that, April 2026.

He said, look, Judge, with this accelerated timeline just about six months away, I will not be able to provide effective counsel to the president. He said it this way. It will deny President Trump the opportunity to have effective assistance of counsel. So, they're already laying the groundwork that this isn't enough time here. The judge basically said I am not taking anything else into consideration here. The quote was. \"She's setting a trial date, it does not depend and should not depend on the defendant's personal or professional obligations.\" So, she set that March 4th trial date without any real consideration of what else is going on for the former president.",

He is expected to say that much of the conduct that he has been charged with was carried out in his capacity as an officer of the federal government because he was still president during the time when he and his allies tried to overturn the 2020 election results.Remember, Trump has actually already tried this move. He did it in New York in the hush money case. A federal judge there rejected that argument. You may recall, however, that may not be the case in Georgia where Trump is facing 13 counts because for Trump, taking the case federally could have several advantages. And also the charge is very different than in the hush money case here. For one, jurors. A trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia withdrew from a much wider jury pool than the current case in Fulton County where Trump is not popular, to say the least. Case in point, former President Trump earned 26 percent of the vote there. Just 26 percent of the vote back in 2020. And there is as well, another benefit for Trump, and that is judges. He has appointed four of the 15 judges on the Northern District of Georgia District Court bench. That would give him a decent chance of getting one of his own picks for the trial. We should note that Trump drew one of his own judicial appointees in the classified documents case. That, of course, being judge Aileen Cannon. And another factor here. If this moves to federal court, there is the chance that Trump could pardon himself if he is elected president again. He could have that authority, Jim.",
