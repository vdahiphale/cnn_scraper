How he did on stage and how he's doing in new polling from one key battleground state.Also, breaking news, new reporting on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the outreach he made to the Harris campaign and what he wanted in exchange for endorsing her. And later, my conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders, what the former Democratic presidential candidate has to say about the campaign and the current candidate should be running. Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the former president's speech on economics today in North Carolina. It came after days where Republicans all but begging him to drop the personal attacks on Vice President Harris and stick to policy. Today, he did, but only to the extent that he, Donald Trump could. He spoke about inflation, insurance prices, credit card debt, and said that if he's elected incomes would soar, savings would grow, and homes would become affordable again. There weren't many specifics which in fairness can be said for many things, can they say. But to the degree, there was policy talk. A lot of it drifted quickly to trash talk.

And this is a problem. He clearly is somebody who feels like he had a race in hand. The candidates changed at the top, now he's in a very, very close and pitch battled for this election. And he's resentful and maybe just a little bit unsettled by that. And for that reason, he's not necessarily a great asset when he's out there on the stump.

I mean, Kamala Harris has got him in an incredible choke hold that's really driving him to the point of insanity and driving his campaign to the point of paralysis.Here's two things that I can tell you. One, is you know, you underestimate Kamala Harris at your peril and Donald Trump is finding that out now. Two, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" I think put it best that, that the GOP have a candidate problem. They have a candidate problem in Donald Trump. To your point, earlier, Trump can't help himself, but to be Donald Trump and the more people see of him, the more they're turned off by him. There's too many people as they put it that don't like Donald Trump. And he's got no path to growth. Actually he has -- he needs new customers and has no path to growth right now. So, that's why he's hitting a ceiling in the polls and all of this sort of is frustrating him. And the other thing I would add is, you know, he's totally having a meltdown because all of his attacks against Kamala Harris are being undermined by the facts. You know, the economy is the strongest it's ever been, it's the envy of the world as \"The Wall Street Journal\" put it, you've got inflation down, border crossings down, crime is down.

He's there reminding the American voters that despite what Vice President Harris is trying to say, she has been living in Naval Observatory for the last four years. She's been working out of the White House, in the executive office building. I mean, she has been part and parcel with all the things they don't like, despite, God bless Ashley for flying the flag, but the fact is that most Americans do not feel like the economy is working for them right now. We saw unemployment tick up in the last labor Jobs Report. Most Americans still feel like they're stuck they're not going ahead. Wages are not keeping up with the increase in the cost of goods. And despite the fact that inflation may be leveling off a little bit, prices are still stubbornly high for most American families right now when they fill up the gas tank, when they go to the grocery store.",

So, there's parts of the country where I think he'll play well, there's Biden parts of the country where he will do well and he'll go there and I just think that they are more effective if they're apart, but they will spend some time together. I anticipate that Friday will feel more like the passing of the baton where she will acknowledge the legacy of the Biden-Harris administration, but start to lay out a vision, her own vision.

I think what you're seeing is just a natural tightening of the race, which is where we always thought it's going to be. I mean, if a year ago we all probably would have thought that we're going to look at a single digit net popular vote. We're probably going to see a very tight race in seven battleground states and that's really what we're seeing right now. So, Democrats are coming home. That's really not much of a surprise.

MICHAEL SCHERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": They did not meet the Harris campaign did get the message. It was sent out through intermediaries and has not responded really. There's no interest on the Harris side for this meeting, which is a big contrast to the conversation that started with Trump actually, hours after that assassination attempt last month. They talked on the phone. Kennedy flew to Milwaukee, met with Trump on the sideline of the Republican Convention there. Kennedy right now finds himself saying he's in it to win it. He's in it for the long haul. He has campaign events planned, but actively seeking out alternatives, talking to both of these campaigns and trying to figure out if there is a way that he could broker support from himself before the election into some sort of a policy rule. If he's not going to win the presidency and his polls have been falling through the summer, can he broker that in some way to get a role in the next administration to focus on the issues that he cares about.",

There was concern within the Trump orbit about him getting confirmed by the Senate, what you need to do if he was a Cabinet-level official.And there was also concern about whether they could trade an endorsement in some sort of explicit way for a promise of a position whether that would have legal complications. Now, the conversation since with Trump, I think are ongoing and we also report in the story that Kennedy was down in West Palm Beach earlier this week. He won't comment about why he was there if he was there or whether he met with Trump, but we know from the Trump side, they think this is still an open conversation about whether they might get an endorsement from Kennedy going forward and Harris has made the calculation, Democrats and made the calculation that there's not really an upside right now. [20:20:18] Although, I would note, I think it's important for yours to note that his polls have dropped recently just as Harris' polls have gone up, which suggests that if he gets out of the race, he is going to benefit Trump because the people still supporting him are the people who were already on the Trump side of the fence. So, there is some risk here of Harris not engaging. The best thing probably for Harris right now would be for -- if the polls basically stay where they are is for Kennedy to stay in the race through the election and bleed off some of these Trump voters.",

What's happened since Harris has gotten in the race is the third party's candidates generally -- Jill Stein, Cornell West in particular, who are candidates of the left they've deflated, but so has Kennedy's support among Democrats deflated and what is left with is this sort of vaccine-resistant kind of conspiratorialists who are the core of his base, who would likely be Trump voters if they were not Kennedy voters. So, it would certainly serve their purposes right at the moment that he's in the race. Earlier in the race the third parties were, I think a disadvantage to Biden, right now with Kennedy, I think he's a disadvantage to Trump, but I will say this, whatever they do, don't put him in charge of the National Park Service because I think a lot of bears would be really uncomfortable with him in charge over there.",

I mean, he actually polls often better in some of the southwestern states, areas where you have many larger pockets to libertarians or folks who are less connected to the political establishment. So, his impact on the race does vary state to state. But generally speaking, it's been impacting Trump more and that goes back to even the spring. Now, it was a larger impact when you had RFK getting upwards of 15 percent or so in some states. Certainly, his impact has dwindled precipitously since then, and I'd expect that actually goes down even further. You traditionally see third-party candidates poll significantly better than they actually perform on election day. A lot of voters who are kind of fed up with politics when they're answering the poll, but they actually show up to vote, they stick with one of the two major candidates.

It's going to be obviously how they're feeling about the economy. I think it's going to be larger attitude about how they're feeling about their overall wellbeing in the world.

The United States, in my view, should not be providing another nickel to Netanyahu and his war machine. That's my view. President Biden disagrees with that.
