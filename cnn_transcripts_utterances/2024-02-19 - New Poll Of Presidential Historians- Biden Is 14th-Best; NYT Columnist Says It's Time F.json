Today is President's Day, so we have new rankings of every single American president by a collection of academics and historians. They put the 45th president at the very bottom of the new poll.I love how the whole panel is looking very closely to see how this is. They put Trump last there. Abraham Lincoln first, Joe Biden 14th. The professors who compiled the power poll president say Biden owes his standing to his predecessor. Quote, \"Biden's most important achievements may be that he rescued the presidency from Trump.\" But the polls for this November's election showing Biden consistently trailing Trump despite the near universal thumbs down on Trump's legacy from historians all across the aisle. President Biden is facing just token opposition for the Democratic nomination. But with six months until the Democratic Convention in Chicago, some Democrats are increasingly worried about him being at the top of the ballot. A piece this weekend by liberal New York Times Columnist Ezra Klein crystallized the issue for many in the party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not the whispers you hear privately and behind the scenes. And yet there doesn't seem to be any indication that Biden will be stepping aside. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENTSo, but the reality here is, as MJ I'm sure would agree with being at the White House every day, there's zero of this conversation in the -- among the people who matter. I put Joe Biden at the top of that list, a few other advisers. So this is outside chatter here. And they basically say, Democrats are going to have to sort of suck it up and deal with it. He is going to be the nominee. And once there is a choice, they believe people will come around. That might be true to a point, but the piece that Ezra was talking about, he believes it should go to the convention, throw it open to the wild and sort of see what happens because conventions historically are about fighting for the nomination. There was a big discussion among a lot of strategists and Democrats over the weekend, how dangerous is that? Is it more or less than this? I would be stunned if that would happen. But you have to leave open your mind to the possibilities since so many people are talking about it.",

In fact, it's the total opposite. There's, like, this sense of dread. They don't want to see that rematch anymore again. And I think it's for a number of reasons. There's obviously a lot of nervous energy about President Biden, a lot of feelings about former President Trump. I also think that there's just a lot of like heaviness in the news right now. It is just a fact that people are wary of, you know, the war in Israel, the war in Ukraine, all of the headlines that they're seeing, like there's real fatigue.

And so he's leaning on that in his pitch to black voters, as well as his family legacy of civil rights. Something else that I think that he can lean into is this economic argument. I can't underscore enough how great the economic anxieties are among black voters. So one of the Kennedy supporters that I met at a Black History Month event yesterday in Brooklyn, a Kennedy event, he was telling me that his family business, he almost lost it during the pandemic, the Sugar Hill Club in Brooklyn. And over the years, he's had many Democratic politicians in that restaurant, and he felt like he couldn't lean on them when he needed them most in order in order to gain some access, some resources.
