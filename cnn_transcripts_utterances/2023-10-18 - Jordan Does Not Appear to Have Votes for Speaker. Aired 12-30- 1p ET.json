And then Dave Joyce -- Dave Joyce is the Republican who is pretty openly trying to coordinate this notion of giving Patrick McHenry, the temporary speaker, more power.But in this particular vote, where they are right now, he said he would vote for Jim Jordan. He cast his vote for Jim Jordan. I want to bring in Manu Raju to talk about what we have seen so far.

      "sentences": "Yeah, I spoke with Jim Jordan repeatedly this morning and the last thing that he told reporters is that if he did not succeed on this second ballot, his expectation and his hope, what he asked Republican leadership to do, is to try and put forward that resolution to empower Patrick McHenry because it's something that Jim Jordan is opposed to, but he wants to sort of put the pressure on Republican members to decide what they want to do. Now, we have heard from repeated sources that we expect that at some point, there will be a resolution introduced to empower Patrick McHenry, and likely that it would come after Jim Jordan had failed to get the speakership. But it's really interesting because Jim Jordan is really trying to cast this as a clear black-and-white decision between either giving him the gavel or what he's calling a coalition government. And that is essentially meaning he believes that if Republicans join with Democrats to empower Patrick McHenry, even for a short period of time, that that is not what Republican voters sent Republicans, the majority, to do. His argument is that that would be a problem. His argument is that that is nor Republican leadership. But obviously, he does not have the support.So, we're going to be watching closely on the floor what happens in the moments after this ballot. But Jim Jordan told us earlier he wanted this resolution to come to the floor. He wants to put Republican members in the position of having to decide whether or not they are supporting a temporary empowerment of Patrick McHenry, which he thinks is a coalition government, or whether they are going to back him. We should also note though that if this resolution is introduced, Republican leaders have two days, two legislative days to bring it up. So it's very unclear -- very unclear what he would do. TAPPER (voice-over): So thank you, Lauren. While Lauren was giving us the latest, Congressman Jordan lost another vote. I believe that we heard from Congressman Mike Simpson from Idaho voting for Steve Scalise. Again, a lot of Scalise allies really upset at the way Scalise in their view did not get a fair shake. Let's listen for Indiana's Congresswoman Victoria Spartz coming up in one vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Victoria Spartz did flip, but that's still 22 votes against Jim Jordan from House Republicans. By the way, not for nothing, look at Hakeem Jeffries there on the top there with 212 votes. (LAUGH) HUNT (voice-over): Yeah. TAPPER (voice-over): Closer to the speakership than he has ever been. (LAUGH) But still close but no cigar. In any case, David Chalian, Jim Jordan farther away from the speakership than he was yesterday. He had 200 votes yesterday. Today, he has 199 and he had 20 votes against him yesterday. Today, he has 22 votes against him today. You know, I don't know really what's going on with the House Republican Caucus, but I feel like I can safely predict that Congressman Jordan is not on the path to the speakership. CHALIAN (voice-over): Certainly not on the path, and I'm not one big for predictions, Jake, but I would imagine, if he were to go to the floor for a third time, he would have more no votes come here because a part of what we were talking before, not that goodwill built up in the conference the way, frankly, Kevin McCarthy had. HUNT (voice-over): Yeah. CHALIAN (voice-over): At the beginning, even though it took him 15 rounds, part of what got him there was that he was largely responsible for getting a lot of those members into their seats over the many years. That's not something -- that's not a chit Jim Jordan has. And I just want to note something, you mentioned Congressman Jeffries at 212. Total unanimity among the Democrats. We were talking about Pelosi before, I'm not sure that she would have totaled -- we saw her, when she became speaker, she actually lost the last time she became speaker, 15 Democratic votes. Like, she was more of a firebrand even within her own party, as people were saying (ph). That is not -- Hakeem Jeffries has not been sort of framed successfully in that way by Republicans yet in the (inaudible) that they think there is any danger in being totally unified behind their leader here. You were talking about the generation, the torch passing, that's one benefit of the torch passing here perhaps. TAPPER (voice-over): Yeah. One House -- one former House Republican just texted me. This is as bad for Matt Gaetz as it is for Jim Jordan. Gaetz would have been celebrated by the base. Now, even the base will turn on him because of the chaos he has created. Although, I don't know.
