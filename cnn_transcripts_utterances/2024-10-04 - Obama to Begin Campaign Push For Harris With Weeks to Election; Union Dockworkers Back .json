Any moment now, Harris will speak to voters at an event in Detroit, and then later she heads to Flint, Michigan. Both areas are crucial for Democrats looking to win that important state in November, and with just 32 days until the election, it is all hands on deck, as former President Barack Obama sees it. He's set to begin a major campaign push for Harris next week with several key battlegrounds to visit before November 5th. Let's take you now live to CNN National Correspondent, Eva McKend, who is following the Harris campaign in Flint, where the Vice President is expected later.

He has been used to great effect in other Democratic campaigns, essentially to attack democratic complacency.We heard a preview of this from Michelle Obama during the Democratic National Convention when she passionately argued to Democrats, listen, don't get cute before Election Day. This is not the time to be in your feelings if you don't hear directly from the campaign asking you to get out and vote. You need to get out and vote anyway because this election is too urgent, so I suspect that we're going to hear a similar theme from former President Obama next week in Pittsburgh, before he launches his battleground race.",

I can't help but think about the headline from Axios this morning.Axios, one of those influential Washington sites, their morning newsletter had an item called the disappearing Bidens, pointing out that since Joe Biden exited the presidential race, he has been relatively in -- I was invisible, but he has been off the trail. He has not been doing as many public events. He's not been doing many interviews. That item landed this morning about two hours before the jobs report. So I can't help but wonder if that factored into this as well, his sudden appearance in the briefing room. And I'm glad you mentioned that comment that he made about the Republicans claiming the numbers are fake because that is something we continue to see from Trump and his allies, a rejection of data and facts.

The key about this is that Biden, the economy is stronger than Trump acknowledges. The economy is actually stronger than what most voters actually perceive. And that's because the economy tends to be a lagging indicator. They don't feel positive about it for months after the numbers turn around.So what Biden is trying to say right now is pay attention. Employment is up, inflation is down. I kept my promises, so the timing is perfect for him. Frankly, Harris should have just delayed the abiding (ph), the chance to have the spotlight. And one more thing, I can't see the video. I can only hear the voice. And so as I'm listening to him, I'm thinking, wow, he really does sound tired. But I'm also thinking he sounds very pleased.
