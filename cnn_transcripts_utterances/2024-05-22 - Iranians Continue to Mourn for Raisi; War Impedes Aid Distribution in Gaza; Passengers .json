Just a short while ago, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could be seen leading those prayers. Iran announced offices would be closed and a public holiday observed for the day of mourning. Iranians also gathered in the Grand Mosalla Mosque on Tuesday to honor the late president after his body was flown into Tehran.

And we have had some information from the chief of staff who was on one of the other helicopters on Sunday. There were three helicopters within the convoy, and he was on one of the other helicopters. He said that the weather was fine when they left the area where the VIPs had been inaugurating that dam project, and they left about 1 p.m. It was 45 minutes into the flight where they then said that there was a cloud and the pilot of Raisi's helicopter, who was in charge of the convoy, said that they had to ascend and increase altitude to try and avoid the cloud. It is then that apparently Raisi's helicopter disappeared. The helicopter pilots that the chief of staff was in went back and tried to circle round and search for that helicopter. But was unable to see it, was unable to descend because of the cloud. And also, we understand, then could not make radio contact. Now, one of the other passengers on board with the late president, we understand one of the Friday prayer imams, he was able on the ground to answer a phone call from the pilot. He was -- he said they had crashed. He was severely injured. And we understand from the chief of staff he was alive for a further three hours before he, too, died. Now, those on the ground who saw the condition of the bodies of the other passengers said that they all died immediately as that plane crashed. So, these are the sort of details, Max, that investigators are going to be looking at very closely.
