But really it comes down to two main reasons why they are holding one of their final rallies of the cycle in the state of Texas. The first one is just persuasion. And the second is getting out the vote, two important thing that any campaign has to do in this final stretch -- stretch.With 11 days to go, the campaign does believe that there are some voters that are just starting to pay attention to the race, the winnable, the persuadable voters, and with early voting already underway, they believe that reaching some of these voters as they are sort of in the middle of their decision making process that is going to be a top priority for the campaign. And this is precisely why they have chosen Texas as the Vice President is wanting to discuss the issue of reproductive rights. They know that because this is a state with one of the most strict abortion bans in the country, they can use this as sort of a symbolic, powerful backdrop for her to make that contrast. And essentially say, look, this is an America that I envision. And in contrast to that, there is Donald Trump's America where, thanks to him, some of these abortion bans were able to go into place. And that's also why we're going to see some of these families that the campaign whose stories they want to promote. They're going to be on stage speaking about what they say are some of these devastating experiences they have gone through because of these bans. And we know that -- that is actually going to sound pretty familiar if you have been watching some of the more recent Harris ads. Take a look.

Anyway, look, we had our new CNN poll, right, that had a tie between the two of them. That is part of a larger pattern that we are seeing across the data right now. So this is Harris versus Trump National margin.You know, we got the CNN poll showed a tie. That matches \"The New York Times\" poll out this morning, also showed a tie. If you like Donald Trump, look, \"The Wall Street Journal\" has him up by three. You like Kamala Harris, maybe you prefer \"Ipsos\" or \"SAY24\" that's a bunch of academics working with YouGov, that also has Harris up by three. But the bottom line is that this race is very, very close, circling right around a tie in the national vote. And indeed, that is so much different from what we saw either four or eight years ago in elections involving Donald Trump. So let's take a look at the Trump versus Democrat margin on October 25th. Right now, Harris is averaging about a point advantage in the national polls. Four years ago at this point, Joe Biden was so far ahead. He was up by nine. Hillary Clinton was also pretty far ahead at this point in 2016, she was up by six. And keep in mind, no Republican has won the popular vote since George W. Bush back in 2004. These polls and the average of polls really does raise the possibility, not just that Donald Trump could win in the Electoral College, but he could potentially win the popular vote be the first Republican in 20 years. Of course, we'll have to wait and see on that.",

That is 11 percentage points more of the public has an unfavorable than favorable view of her.Look, Donald Trump's always been underwater on this metric. He was at minus 12 back in September. Now he's at minus 13. So the gap between the two of them has absolutely closed. Now this is well within the margin of error. Harris was considerably more popular than Trump back in September.

Now Elon Musk did not respond to requests for comment, and a Kremlin spokesperson told \"The Wall Street Journal\" that the only communication that Musk had with the Kremlin was one phone call where musk and Putin discussed, quote, space as well as current and future technologies.Musk works very closely with the U.S. government on a number of different national security and space projects. He has also, of course, risen as a major figure in President, former President Donald Trump's campaign. A new filing show that Musk has poured $119 million into his own pro Trump Super PAC, spending nearly 44 million this month alone. And yesterday, he again awarded two new $1 million prizes to registered voters in both Michigan and Wisconsin, despite the fact that the Justice Department had already warned that those payments may be illegal. I want to bring in Russia and cyber expert, Dimitri Alperovitch. He is the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a geopolitics think tank. Dimitri, thank you so much for being with us. I know that you've got some questions about this contact between Putin and Musk. And we did note that the Kremlin said there's only been this one call back in 2022. But break down for us, if you will, the concern that national security officials would have here in Washington if those conversations did indeed take place.",

We rely on him on that. But -- but also with Starlink, which is this incredible low Earth orbit satellite communications network he has created that is providing communication services, not just to consumers, but to government agencies.
