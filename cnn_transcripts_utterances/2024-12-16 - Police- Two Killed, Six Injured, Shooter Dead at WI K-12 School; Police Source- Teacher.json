And if you were just watching the screen and you saw that caravan of dogs walk by and you thought perhaps they're therapy dogs, you would be right, heading there to the area where we know that family members and kids have been as they're awaiting reunification. Joining us now, we have former FBI profiler Gregg McCrary and former Boston police commissioner Ed Davis. And we also have former FBI agent Bryanna Fox. Gregg, you have the ATF saying it's running trace on the weapon that was used in the school shooting. Tell us a little bit about that and also sort of what your expectation may be as we await that.",

When we have these juveniles that do the school shooting, most often the gun is in the home and they get a hold of it. But we'll, you know, we'll find out eventually exactly where that weapon come from. So that's one narrow piece of the investigation that's going on right now.",

I heard something there.One was a teacher, one was a student, but there are a number of victims right now who are in surgery and they have really tough injuries. This is the expectation, right?

      "sentences": "No question. This is a very difficult time. There was a slight mistake there in the reporting where too many people were getting involved in the information chain.And there's something called the fog of war, which we all experience in situations like this. The old adage is the first information you get is always wrong. So it's really important to think about the fact that these incidents, the places of importance change as the incident unfolds. So the first place will be at the scene of the shooting. And then there's a period of time where you need to transfer your intelligence gathering and trusted sources into the hospital emergency room and maybe the operating room to get the best information to the commanders that you can when something like this is happening. That's where we are right now. And we don't know how long the emergency room and the operating room is going to be the center of attention. But then we'll go back to the scene, processing the scene. And also one focus is the command center that's set up. And so all of the information is supposed to flow in there. And, you know, things like the identity of the shooter, they're going to be very careful on right now because of the slight mistake that happened. So we may be delayed in getting really good information on that for a while.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bryanna, I think that's so key. Obviously, in the communities where this happened, it's so important for them to know something of the why and to try to maybe make some sense of this. I think, ultimately, it's hard to ever make sense of this. But trying to understand so that you have some information of value, like you said, that can prevent something like this from happening in the future. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Because when we think of some of the things that schools have adopted, whether it is locks in doors or the way they've changed doors or the way they've changed procedures. I think, for instance, in the case of the Athens shooting, we actually saw a door lock that was very helpful. We've seen that in other shootings. We've also seen things that, quite frankly, don't work. Can you just talk a little bit more about that?",

But that being said, we also know that there are a number of these tragedies that have occurred where we have put into place these preventative measures and it wasn't sufficient to prevent the shooting from occurring. So I think doing more research on that to know which of these things are the most effective, research tends to suggest over and over and over again that access to guns is the biggest predictor of being able to commit a shooting. And so limiting that access, particularly for kids that are people that are saying they're making threats, they are disgruntled. They have a reason that they would want to undertake this.Being extra proactive, a lot of times we hear that this was something that was coming. You know, people heard about it and a lot of times people didn't say anything. But there are certain measures that seem to be a lot more effective than others. And having that awareness and putting our money and policy towards those versus the less effective things, I think would be a good move forward for our country.",

My heart and my prayers are with the students, with the staff, with the family and it's with the community of Abundant Life Christian School following this morning's tragic shooting. You know, as a parent myself and as a pastor, this tragedy hit especially close to home for me. So my thoughts are with Pastor Tim Fluttery (ph) and his congregation in this time of intense worry and grief. But I am so grateful to our first responders for their quick action and for the continuing help to reunite students and families, because everyone deserves to feel safe in our community, especially in our schools. And I just heard from my daughter today for the first time, and it's a hard time. We're asking for prayers from all around our nation to please lift up our community at this time.",

We've seen 83 school shootings this year by CNN's count. The most we've seen since CNN kept track of them. I wonder where you think this is going if we haven't really seen action taken on this.",
