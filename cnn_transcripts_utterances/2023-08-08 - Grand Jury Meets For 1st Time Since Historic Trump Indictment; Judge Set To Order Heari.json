She wants a hearing by the end of the week. What's in dispute, they aren't truly that far apart, the prosecutors and defense lawyers for Trump, on what to do with sensitive information that the prosecutors might hand over to Trump's team before the trial. But there are a lot of things that both sides have said -- that they're arguing that they want the judge to weigh in on. Trump's team is saying he doesn't want all the information the Justice Department sends over to be locked down and he wants to claim free speech as well. SCIUTTO: Katelyn Polantz, thanks so much.

But also because the optics of this kind of move are so damaging for a campaign. You don't change your quarterback in the middle of the game if the game plan is going well. But it hasn't been going well. The polling has been troubling. The fundraising is not at the level they expected. And the message has been inconsistent. Now Governor DeSantis is turning to another trusted adviser, James Uthmeier, to run his campaign. This is his current chief of staff in his governor's office. I'm told he's incredibly trusted within the governor's inner circle. It's a tough inner circle to break. It's basically him and his wife, but James has had the ear of the governor for quite some time. He's also been the architect of many of the cultural battles and controversial moves that DeSantis has made as governor. Now he comes to the campaign trail. It's unclear what changes we can expect going forward. James doesn't have any experience running a presidential campaign. That's been one of the knocks on the political operation of the governor to date. He has not surrounded himself with seasoned veterans. As they move to this next stage of the campaign, it will be interesting to see how they turn a new leaf and get by this month-long reset they've been going through.",

That's according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.That big number made public as consumers brace for another potential rate hike as policymakers try to keep inflation in check. CNN Business Editor-at-Large Richard Quest is here to break it all down. Richard, that's a large number, especially when you think of the exorbitant interest rates folks face on credit card debt. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE &amp; CNN HOST: It's the canary in the mine, if you will, Jim, that things are not good or they're not that brilliant because it's up 4.6 percent just on the quarter. When you think about credit card debt and higher interest rates, you have two options that people can basically follow. Number one, they stop spending because they can no longer spend on their credit cards. They've maxed out. In that case, the economy slows down and the consumer gets exhausted. Number two, the higher interest rate that's required, the greater payments, that takes money out of discretionary spending and that also slows down the economy. Whichever way you look at this, the effective higher balances on credit cards means a slower economy in the future. There's one other piece of news to bring you, Jim. Remember, the economy is like a jigsaw puzzle. It's a series of different individual pieces that, together, create a picture. The first piece we got this morning was on the credit cards. But also the number of people taking money out of their 401(K) retirement plans for hardship reasons. Now, that is very significant.",

There are actually parts you can buy online and then make your own gun. The problem for law enforcement, of course, is that these are often untraceable. They don't contain serial numbers. Now, back in 2022, last year, the ATF, which oversees firearms enforcement, they updated their regulations essentially defining a ghost gun as a firearm. That was followed by lots of litigation. A federal judge in Texas had ruled that the Biden administration had overstepped its bounds in issuing those new regulations.

      "sentences": "Sure. It was a surprise to an extent. And I will explain exactly why I think it came out this way.First of all, you had Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's third appointee, joining the three liberals on the court. Dissenters were Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh. Chief Justice John Roberts often does move over to the left, especially as a preliminary stage of litigation like this. But Justice Barrett was a little bit more of a surprise. She hasn't normally done that. But in a few cases, in the most recently completed term, she did edge a little bit to the center. And I think she is also trying to show that she's taking an approach that isn't always going to be in lockstep with her brethren on the right wing. But this is what I want to caution our audience, because is that this is a very preliminary stage of this dispute. We don't have any kind of ruling on the merits as yet. And all the Supreme Court has done is say just wait, let the dispute play out. It heeded the solicitor general's argument here on behalf of the Biden administration that ghost guns are causing an explosion in crime, there's a real public safety issue here. You know, just keep everything in place while the litigation proceeds. One last thing I want to mention is that the ruling itself came from an individual Texas judge. It was allowed to stand, the lower court ordered that -- that blocked the federal regulation was from a Texas judge. And then it was -- that order was reinforced to an extent by the Fifth Circuit. I think this Supreme Court is showing more and more impatience and scrutiny of individual judges, and especially the Fifth Circuit in some of its rulings saying, look, you're going too fast, too far. Let's go at this slower, And I don't know if, in the very end, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett will side with the Biden administration and its defense of this important regulation. But at least it's indicating that it wants to first hear all the arguments before any radical change is made.",
