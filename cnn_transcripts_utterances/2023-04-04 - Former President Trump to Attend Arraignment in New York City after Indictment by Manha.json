      "sentences": "Yes, this may be something that new edition to the legal team doesn't want to see. But I am told that Trump is itching to speak about his indictment today. Obviously, he's not scheduled to do so right now while he is here in Manhattan. He is not expected to speak until he returns to Mar-a-Lago tonight where we do know he is going to speak to a ballroom with hundreds of his supporters, his surrogates, his allies who are expected to gather there tonight.But I'm hearing from people that Trump really wants to talk about this today while he is here in New York. And if two weeks ago when he had initially claimed he was going to be arrested, which, obviously we know did not happen at the time, there had been this idea of maybe having Trump speak outside the courthouse after that arraignment happens in just a few hours from now. That idea was scuttled for security reasons. There were concerns about that and those considerations. But now I am told that Trump is eager to speak. He hasn't done so since he arrived here in New York. We just saw him going in behind closed doors at Trump Tower last night. So it remains to be seen, because what we do know is that in hours Trump is going to be here in this building behind me. That is where he is going to be a turning himself in here in Manhattan, the first ex-president in our nation's history to face criminal charges. Right now he is at Trump Tower, as Don was noting, preparing for this unprecedented arrangement, and we are expecting him to appear in court as a criminal defendant in the 2:00 p.m. hour today. After that, as we noted, Trump is going to return to Florida give a primetime speech at Mar-a-Lago scheduled for 8:15 p.m. eastern tonight. Overnight, the judge ruled he will not allow TV cameras into the courtroom during the proceedings. There was opposition from the Trump legal team. But in his order, the judge did acknowledge that this arrangement has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention, saying \"The populous rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.\" CNN's senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz is here at the courthouse. Shimon, obviously, the New York Police Department has been gearing up for this for days now. We've seen barricades put in place. There are lines of reporters snaking around the courthouse waiting to get in. What are you seeing from over there at your vantage point?",

I've covered some of the biggest trials here, and this is such a different atmosphere than what I've ever, ever seen covering any cases here, from Harvey Weinstein to the DSK when he was arrested and ultimately dismissed. There's just something very different here because you don't get this kind of a presence for a criminal defendant that's about to enter court and be arraigned, and when you look around, it's just surreal.Let me just show our viewers. Yes, you have all the security here, and we see more court officers now arriving. What's happening here is that a lot of this, the court staff, the court officers are now running security around the perimeter of this courthouse with all the barriers here, the NYPD is here as well. And then you've just got all these cameras. Everyone here just waiting for Donald Trump to arrive. Everyone just hoping to get that shot of him surrendering. We expect him to surrender here in just a few hours. And he's going to be just up the street here. This is Hogan Place. This is where the district attorney's office is. He's going to walk through the doors. It's going to be brief, and he's going to go upstairs. And once he walks through those doors, he will be under arrest. He will be under arrest and taken into custody. And then the processing begins. But this is just such a surreal atmosphere here right now, given the history of this event. And many of us here have covered cases here before, but nothing, nothing like this before. This kind of security, this kind of presence, this kind of media presence, and it's early, Kaitlan. It's still early, we're going to have several more hours before we see the former president here. And honestly, the security around here is just going to increase as the hours go by.",

The article said Blanche would be the lead. But then Tacopina texted to the \"New York Law Journal\" that you can be sure that when the bell rings, he, Tacopina will be handling the major crosses and summations and so on. It's just going to be a process of learning to work together if the team stays as it is.The former president has every right to change his team as he's going along.

It's a very interesting issue, too detailed, probably to go into here. And then I think they should file a motion to dismiss and or disqualify Mr. Bragg. It's unprecedented and should be unprecedented from an ethical standpoint to have run for office and campaigned specifically targeting the conviction of a particular American citizen, Donald Trump. One of the things that Mr. Bragg said in his campaign was, whoever has this job, are they going to convict Donald Trump? Convict him? There wasn't an investigation going at the time, no allegations against him. That's just dead wrong. It shows a conflict of interest, and I think that should be a motion.And finally, I think that they should file a motion to recuse the judge, find out how this judge was assigned to the case. I don't believe in coincidences. This judge was on the Trump Organization case, the Bannon case, and now this case. And there is an historic practice in this district attorney's office, unique among all in the state for judge shopping through a process of picking a judge to supervise the grand jury, and then having that judge preside over the case, a handpicked judge. They swore about eight years ago that they had stopped the practice, but I think it needs to be investigated through a motion for recusal.

Of course, one of the most notable days of his time as the district attorney here in Manhattan. And as Shimon has been reporting here on CNN, there has been an increased security presence around the district attorney himself. Obviously, he has been the target of attacks from Trump and his allies and his advisers, who have been saying that they believe this is a political prosecution that is underway. Bragg has pushed back on that. And of course, he has made this decision, though, and there are major questions about it.

They are now gathering and nailing down things like notes, texts, emails, photographs, documents from Donald Trump's assistant, Molly Michael, about what he was doing, who he was meeting with across a really crucial amount of time in Mar-a-Lago when he was is there as they're looking into the possible mishandling of classified documents, and also the potential that Donald Trump was trying to obstruct the Justice Department from getting all of those documents back.And the other thing. The reason why this story, we keep hearing about subpoenas in this Mar-a-Lago investigation over and over again for the course of this investigation, but the reason why this is different now is that it's quite clear that the prosecutors are nailing down details that they may already know and how have, including not only are they asking for documents being to be turned over, they're subpoenaing people into the grand jury that they spoke with before, that the FBI interviewed a year ago. Now they're locking in that testimony into the grand jury in what signals -- what could be something leading up to a potential set of charges or maybe a decision at the Justice Department whether to bring charges in this case.",

But we also know what the Justice Department has been doing to secure evidence from Donald Trump's defense attorney, Evan Corcoran himself. And that, from what we understand, may be separate from this pursuit where they're securing the evidence from these other witnesses. Evan Corcoran, we know that the Justice Department believes, was being used by Donald Trump to potentially commit a crime. And they got him to turn over records. They got him back in before the grand jury to testify.And one of the things I am also hearing from sources is that the grand jury activity doesn't stop with Evan Corcoran and with these recent subpoenas. There's going to be a steady clip of people either coming in or turning things over in the coming weeks. And the thing that puts this all together is that this is all about Donald Trump. This is about what he did, what he saw, what he knew, and what he decided to do with those documents once the Justice Department said you need to turn them back over. Don and Poppy?",

That will happen here in New York as we are getting new reporting about Trump's mindset and whether or not we're going to hear from Trump while he is here. CNN's Kara Scanell joins me back here this morning as we were outside 100 center street where Trump will actually be booked and arraigned. And a few hours from now, I had heard that Trump wanted to speak the kind of an itching to make his case publicly about this indictment. We always want to speak tonight, but now you're hearing that he is actually going to be speaking or he's expected to do so inside that courthouse today.",

And he's also, expect to see something after and he said he doesn't know what he's going to say.But, you know, I think we've heard a lot of the President saying that this is, you know, political prosecution. He's called it a witch hunt. So, it might be something along that (INAUDIBLE). He also said that he expects Donald Trump to enter his own plea of not guilty. He doesn't think it will go through and attorney. You know, of course, everything can change in the moment. But that is the thinking heading into this today. There is another meeting with the legal team this morning. But that's kind of where their heads up.",
