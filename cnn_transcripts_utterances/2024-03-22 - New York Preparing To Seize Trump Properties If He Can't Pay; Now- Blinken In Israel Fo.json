Donald Trump has just three days to post a nearly half a billion dollar bond. And if you can't find the money, New York Attorney General Letitia James is making preparations to seize some of his marquee properties, filing judgments in Westchester County, home to Trump's golf course and private estate north of Manhattan. The A.G. is already filed papers for seizures in Manhattan where Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, several other properties are located. Trump's increasing desperation as the clock ticks down apparent in his social media posts. This one posted around 2:00 a.m. last night, it runs 180 words. It's all in caps. It calls the judge a, quote, political hack. The attorney general, corrupt and racist. And the legal process, totally unconstitutional. Kevin Frey, Washington reporter for New York 1 is here with me now. Kevin, good morning. Thanks for coming in.",

When you think about the decisions that are going to be made here, just in these next couple of months in terms of trying to figure out a way to fix the humanitarian crisis, while also allowing Israel to continue to exist.

You can see the radar very busy. So it could see some snowflakes flying, Milwaukee, Madison, all the way to Detroit and the Chicago suburbs. This is going to gather some strength this weekend. So, we're talking about ski country, northern New England, big time snow totals expected there. It will stay rain and the potential for flooding exists across the major east coast city, so that I-95 corridor, it is going to be wet. Look at the timeframe here, Friday evening through Saturday evening. So, you expect 36 hour timeframe here basically to be sock in with heavy rainfall. Now across extreme southern Florida, two to four inches just for Miami-Dade. Yeah, that is going to be a wet start to the weekend as well, both of these systems working together to create a very unsettled weather pattern across the entire eastern seaboard. Here's our radar, low pressure located across the central golf, pick it up. A lot of moisture and both of these are going to work together to create that flash flood risk that I mentioned across the East Coast cities. So look out, New York, Boston, there's the snowfall for northern New England. We're talking Vermont into Maine as well as New Hampshire. We could measure that in excess of a foot. But in terms of rain, this is where we are anticipating the concerns. Look at D.C. in that shading of yellow, too, according to the legend. That's two, maybe upwards three inches locally, of course, urbanized flooding possible and some ponding on the roadways. Here's our secondary storm system. This ones for the end of the weekend of that is going to bring more snow to Minneapolis, the potential for blizzard conditions, as well as this starts to draw and cold air from the north.
