And the polling shows it, right? Look, abortion is a very personal, private, and emotional decision for a lot of people. But I think, overwhelmingly, when you do talk about all of the circumstances that can happen when someone is pregnant, all of the risks involved, people really do agree that the government should not interfere in these most-private personal moment. Especially when you have people that have a non-viable fetus and are having to make that decision about whether they need abortion care. We are seeing in other states doctors turning them away from help until they are septic or until they are hemorrhaging. And they are -- leading to death and trauma. And Arizonans do not want that. They want patients to be safe. They want pregnancy to be safe. And they want people to have the final say for themselves when it comes to their pregnancy outcomes.",

Iran has vowed to retaliate, which could happen as soon as this week, according to sources. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today with his war cabinet and also met with senior defense officials to discuss the potential threats. We have CNN's Natasha Bertrand joining us now from the Pentagon. All right, Natasha, the White House says it's monitoring the situation very, very closely. They're not the only ones. We actually saw the Dow respond here dropping more than 500 points. There is fear that this could actually affect oil prices if there is some kind of retribution from Iran on Israel. What are you learning about us officials and how they're preparing?",

      "sentences": "What we've just learned, Brianna, that the Pentagon is also surging additional assets to the region in order to bolster deterrence as well as to increase force protection for the U.S. troops who were stationed in Iraq and Syria and the broader Middle East.We know that the Pentagon has been trying to bolster, in particular, air defenses for these units, especially because they came under attack by Iran-backed proxy forces over 100 times between October and February. And the fear, of course, is that Iran-backed proxies, as part of this broader retaliation that Iran is apparently planning, could target U.S. forces as a part of that. Now, as of right now, the U.S. is not anticipating that Iran is it's going to directly attack American troops because they are trying to calibrate their response and not bring in the U.S. to a broader conflict and force the U.S. to respond very forcefully. They don't necessarily want to escalate this in an extreme way. But still, just in case, the Pentagon is sending these additional assets to the region were told now. This all comes, of course, as the U.S. has been in direct consultations with the Israelis, with the Iranians, to try to lower the temperature altogether. But it comes as a direct result of that Israeli airstrike on what Iran says is its consulate in Damascus. And we're just getting your reporting in as well that U.S. officials were pretty frustrated with their Israeli counterparts about the lack of information that Israel actually gave to the U.S. before carrying out that strike, which was likely, and as we see, it has been extremely provocative, especially in a very tense moment in the region. And according to a U.S. official, the U.S. was not informed of this plan by the Israelis to conduct the strike until those Israeli planes were actually already in the air. And of course, by that point, the U.S. didn't have time to move the additional assets or any kind of force protection into the region that it might have liked to. And so they're all bracing for a potential Iranian retaliation at this point. It just remains to be seen what exactly that's going to look like -- Brianna?",

According to two groups tracking drug shortages since 2001, drug shortages are now at a record high in the U.S.And they found a lack of supply for several hundred drugs that treat conditions like cancer and ADHD.

      "sentences": "In some cases, it's because demand has gone up. We've seen that with the ADHD drugs situation. Although that's not the only reason. There can also be manufacturing issues that play into this situation.Most commonly, drugs that fall into shortage sort of fit one category. They are often older medicines that have lost patent protection, so they're less expensive. Nonetheless, they are still complex manufacturing and they have to be done under these pristine conditions. And so they're very expensive to make. But the companies make less money from them. And so often you see that they want to prioritize drugs that they make more money from. And this causes a lot of issues in the manufacturing process for these medications. You see companies even going bankrupt in the generic drug space, which has led to a lot of disruptions. So oftentimes when there's a shortage, the government will allow importation from another country, for example, or hospitals will try to swap in different doses, but those can lead to dosing errors. That's also really just a Band-Aid on the problem. And they say broader fixes need to be made, like increasing seeing transparency.",

Sentiments still isn't back to where it was before the pandemic hit, but it's sharply higher, up from the record lows almost two years ago when inflation was at a 40-year high.
