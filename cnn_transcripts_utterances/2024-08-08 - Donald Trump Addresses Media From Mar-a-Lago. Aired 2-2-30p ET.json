Do we know what he's going to be talking about here? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jess and Brianna, we don't actually, no. We've asked several times about what exactly the focus of this is. No straight answers yet, just that Donald Trump wanted to talk. But also told that he's going to take questions. Obviously (AUDIO GAP) latency. We've been burned before on that front. One of the narratives that we have heard from the Trump campaign when it comes to Kamala Harris (AUDIO GAP) won't sit down for an interview, that she won't take questions from the media. So, it is likely that this is going to play into that kind of narrative, why he is here, why he wants (AUDIO GAP). The other reason is because he has been largely out of the public eye for roughly a week. His last big campaign event was last Saturday in Georgia. He doesn't have another rally until tomorrow night. (AUDIO GAP) that's at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time, so it's a late night rally, and this is a way to try and get involved in the media narrative. But of course, we're watching closely. We have a lot of questions for him, particularly (AUDIO GAP) in the race has changed since the last time we saw him publicly.",

Jeff, I'm curious just your take on this, because you've been out on the road. You were there at one of the rallies this week with the vice president and Governor Walz, and now we're seeing the strategy from Trump to try to get some of the spotlight back.",

Vance was campaigning there as well, really calling out the fact that Vice President Harris and her new running mate Tim Walz, have not done interviews yet. I think you can probably give the Minnesota governor a bit of grace on that, since he's barely 48 hours in, but the vice president it is a legitimate point. She's not done many interviews. They are riding this wave of energy and enthusiasm, but at some point they will have to answer questions. I'm not sure voters actually are clamoring for this as much as we certainly are. We think the American people deserve answers to these questions, but look, they clearly are trying to steal back the attention here and goad the Democrats into sitting for questions, which has not been her strong suit in the past.",

We just had the virtual world count what? 48 hours ago?I think that it matters in context, looking at the time frame here, this is still a really fast process. But in addition to that, she is having those conversations. She's just not having them with traditional media. She's having conversations with various influencers. She's having conversations and sitting down with the TikTok crowd. The way that young people and a lot of demographics view media today and where they get their news from is vastly different than it was one or two campaign cycles ago. So, she's meeting people where they are, and she's having those conversations. Will she do it with traditional press? Absolutely, but I -- perspective that's probably going to happen closer to the DNC convention, and definitely afterwards.",

Look what happened yesterday, she met with anti-Israel protesters and left open the door to an arms embargo to one of our greatest allies. Then today, we see a spokesperson come out and say, oh no, no, no. She doesn't really mean that. That's why it's so important for her to come out and start addressing some of these issues that her campaign has been walking back on her behalf.",

He's the person who regularly decides that the media is not worth anybody's time and likes to attack the legitimacy of media in general.So, to in that same vein, try to push Kamala Harris and the Harris- Walz newly appointed ticket to do media immediately.

But then there's this issue of, did he dodge a deployment to Iraq? And I mean, I spoke today to someone who totally does not agree with him politically, who's not going to vote for him, said he'll campaign against Walz, but served with him for more than 10 years, and said that that is a lie. And I wonder if you think, though, if it still might be quite effective, and if it will matter in the context of Kamala Harris.",

Vance has said, in addition to a lot of the military nonprofit organizations, veterans groups, who have called out what he has said, have pointed to the fact that this is a problematic conversation.",
