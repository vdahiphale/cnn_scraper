We're going to ask the voters. Plus, just in time for Christmas, a judge rules that the women Rudy Giuliani defamed with his election lies can start trying to collect that nearly $150 million he owes them right now. Good evening. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Anderson tonight. And first up, why the former president's legal team today asked the Supreme Court not to bypass an appeals court and quickly take up the question of whether he enjoys legal immunity for his actions as president. A decision you would think that any defendant facing charges, which might be invalidated, would want ASAP, except perhaps this defendant, who is running for president. We're going to talk in a moment with our legal panel about that and how the Supreme Court should handle last night's unprecedented Colorado Supreme Court ruling that the former president is an insurrectionist and does not belong on the state's primary ballot. President Biden was asked about that today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is all part of the Trump legal team playbook. They want to slow walk this because what they're trying to do is right now the trial is scheduled for March 4th. If they can keep pushing that trial date back, that increases the chance that this trial would start maybe after an election. And, of course, if Trump were to actually win re-election, he could ultimately get his DOJ to dismiss these charges here because the lower court here found that Trump was not immune from this criminal prosecution. And even though they lost at that lower court level, they still want this appeals process to play out. The DC Circuit of Appeals is scheduled to hear the arguments on January 9th. Trump's team wants to keep that in place because then that would sort of push the Supreme Court hearing this off until later, whereas the special counsel wants this to go immediately before the Supreme Court.",

Chief Justice Roberts has already spoken to the question about whether an officer of the United States is limited to just appointed officials as opposed to all officials under our United States government. And the answer is, it's limited to appointed officials, generally speaking, unless there's some reason to vary from that, which means that if you want to cover, for example, members of Congress, the constitution explicitly says so. And if you want to cover the president or the vice president of the United States in other places in the constitution, you explicitly say so.So, for example, you don't impeach members of Congress, you can only remove them by operation of either the House or the Senate. That was the case that came before the Supreme Court quite a long time ago. And it's generally thought that officers, therefore, should be limited only to appointed officials, not elected officials, because the president is an elected official. Generally speaking, the default position should be that he is not covered by that language. In any event, those Section 3 of the 14th Amendment doesn't explicitly cover the president ...",

Congress acted in this area in the 1870s and ultimately, it repealed what was a procedure to determine whether or not somebody had supported insurrection by virtue of being a confederate. And there was a writ that was required to be issued in order to deal with precisely that question. Alternatively, Congress can pass a criminal law, which it has, to indicate that someone engaged in insurrection can be prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned. It's notable here that Jack Smith explicitly declined to bring insurrection charges. That should have been a clue to the Colorado Supreme Court to stay out of this. They chose not to.",

Is it a judge?The only law that's still on the books, as Bob said, that Congress has ever passed is the criminal law, criminalizing insurrection, which specifically says, if a person is charged and convicted with this, he is disqualified. That has not happened here. Instead, Colorado tried to sort of take this state-level proceeding that's not really made for this type of insurrection determination and force a square peg into a round hole.

You know, the qualifications for office for the presidency of the United States are relatively simple and are set forth in the Constitution -- is the person over 35 years of age? Have they been 14 years a resident of a state? Is the person a natural born US citizen? That -- on the natural born US citizen issue, that's created a few wrinkles along the way. For example, is John McCain -- was he eligible to be president because he was born in the Panama Canal zone when his father was an admiral serving there? The answer seemed to be pretty clearly yes, that he's a natural born US citizen, just as if he had been born actually on the territory of the United States.Ted Cruz, that issue came up. That's a little bit more complicated, but ultimately the thinking is he also qualifies as a natural born US citizen. Again, on simple things, you leave it to the states. They -- there will be a gathering consensus. What's a very bad look, I think we all can agree, is if a state Supreme Court in a split decision 4:3, which is likely one that could be replicated anywhere else in the country, gets to decide whether somebody is or isn't an insurrectionist and, therefore, disqualified from the ballot. I think we can all agree that really ought to be something that is a thing decided with guidance from Congress, where we can get a single answer nationally about what the results should be. Now, ultimately, here, it's going to be left to the United States Supreme Court to decide that. I think they will take the case. I think they will decide it. And hopefully, it'll be decided on a non-partisan basis or a bipartisan basis in something approaching unanimity. I mean, I'd like to see.

Jack Smith is saying, let's skip that and go right to the Supreme Court. And Donald Trump's team identifies a real weakness in Jack Smith's position which is this. Jack Smith will not say, in court or in his briefs, that the reason he wants to speed this up is because he wants to try Donald Trump before the election. Instead, what Jack Smith gives us in his brief is a bunch of sort of vague gibberish where he says, well, delay is bad and speed is good, and we need speed because it's important because we don't want delay. And Donald Trump's team quite effectively says, that's not a specific reason. They have to give a specific reason. That's just vague. You shouldn't grant it unless they say the specific reason. And I think Trump's team knows full well there's no way on earth Jack Smith will never acknowledge that it's the election.

Let's be clear. He hasn't been convicted yet. And so, I look at that and I go, well, look, we showed that it was an insurrection. I fully believe it was an insurrection. And if he violated that, he violated that. He should be kicked off. At the same time, politically, as a politician now, I do think it's probably not going to hurt him. I don't think it necessarily will help him. It's not going to hurt him. And I frankly would love to see him lose at the ballot box.
