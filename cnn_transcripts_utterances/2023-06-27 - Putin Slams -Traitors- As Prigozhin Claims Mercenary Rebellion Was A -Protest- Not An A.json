Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking out publicly for the first time since the end of a short-lived insurrection which rattled his grip on power and threw the country into uncertainty. In a nationwide address. Putin lashed out of those who organized the uprising by Wagner Group fighters, but did not mention leader Yevgeny Prigozhin by name.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): An armed rebellion would have been suppressed in any case. The organizers of the rebellion despite the loss of adequacy could not fail to understand this. They understood everything, including that they resorted to criminal acts to divide and weaken the country, which is now confronting a colossal external threat.

And with the flags and emblems of Wagner PMC. They were all happy when we came in when we passed by. Many of them still write us words of support.

Putin has heard about his falling ratings about the, you know, the popular despair at this and what's more -- he's heard that his speeches have fallen flat. His attempts to be inspiring and sound firm.People joke that he looks like an automaton that is that the real Putin or was that an A.I.-generated Putin? So, he is angry.

It also wasn't shared widely with U.S. allies.It was shared with some British officials but not with all of NATO. And Ukrainians were also not the recipients of that intelligence before the events over the weekend with U.S. officials concerned that those communications could be intercepted. Now when it comes to where Prigozhin is right now, state department spokesperson Matt Miller said the U.S. does not have an assessment as to where he is over the weekend, of course. The expectation was that he was headed to Belarus after President Lukashenko brokered the deal that brought down deescalated the situation. But so far, officials from Belarus have not said that he is there and U.S. officials have been weary to project what his actual goals were over the course of the 24, 36 hours when he carried out that attempted insurrection.

And a fully dedicated effort would have meant bombing and mass destruction.So, I don't think they even had the option of a clean surgical arrest of Prigozhin. You know, the Russians just don't do that well. If you think back to the 1991 coup to so many terrorist encounters, and showdowns with the Chechens and others, they constantly fumble. Their special services are not very adept. So, there really wasn't an option to just arrest and silence him surgically. It would have been a bloody mess.

His own aides were making a recording of this meeting, in addition to the folks working on that auto biography. But even though he knew he was making a record of this conversation, former president was -- as you can hear on this tape, surprisingly casual when talking about some of our nation's most sensitive secrets, he admits of this information that he is sharing with others in the room who do not have proper clearance or any clearance at all. He acknowledges that this is classified information that he could have declassified it when he was in the White House, but that he no longer had the power to do so.Now in public, the former President has repeatedly said that he didn't have these documents, that is not actually that document that he is referring to in this tape. But one interesting quote that you can hear on the CNN version of this tape that was not included in the indictment, is that the former president said these are his papers. And so, he's insisting that in fact, whatever he appears to be showing the other people in the room, or the papers that he alleges, will vindicate him in terms of Mark Milley's comments about Iran. Now, this tape is expected to be a central piece of evidence for the special counsel. Now another aspect of the tape that was not included in the indictment is former President Trump and at least one of his staffers mocking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private e-mail server. Now that's of course not really pertinent to a criminal case. But in the court of public opinion, it does appear to be hubris. Paul Reid, CNN, Washington.",

CNN's Nic Robertson reports on the Wagner Chiefs long and complicated relationship with Vladimir Putin.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voiceover): From Putin's chef to a billionaire powerful mercenary boss. Prigozhin's rapid rise to the Russian President's top off books, military enforcer seems over. Saturday, Putin indirectly branding Prigozhin a traitor, saying he was leading an armed insurrection. The tipping point in escalating tensions, Prigozhin sending battle hardened Wagner mercenary fighters towards Moscow. From an undisclosed location, ostensibly on his way to exile in Belarus. Prigozhin denied he wanted to overthrow Putin. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, CHIEF OF WAGNER GROUP (through translator): We marched in demonstration of a protest not to overturn the power in the country. ROBERTSON (voiceover): Prigozhin's point, his beef not with Putin directly, but with his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Whom he blames for starting an ill-conceived and badly executed war in Ukraine. And wants to strip Prigozhin of his troops. PRIGOZHIN (through translator): As a result of intrigues, ill- conceived decisions. It was planned that this unit would cease to exist on July 1st, 2023. ROBERTSON (voiceover): Wagner, PMC grew in the shadows of Russia's 2014 war in Ukraine. Following that got bigger supporting Russian troops in Syria. Precisely, when Prigozhin joined forces with Wagner is a well-kept secret. His connections with Putin had helped him get catering contracts for the Russian military in Ukraine. Prigozhin's real value to Putin rocketed in Africa. Secretly winning influence in countries including Mali, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya. Making big money on gold, diamond and other deals on the side. It was Prigozhin's private fiefdom shared with Putin, whom he always wanted to impress. But Wagner and Prigozhin were still in the shadows. The Ukraine war changed that, Prigozhin went public had victories, potentially please Putin by taking ground in Bakhmut. But then, hubris took hold. He began to bite the hand that once fed him. Criticized Putin's Defense Chief, Sergei Shoigu, making a big noise, claiming he was being shorted on ammo and his fighters were dying. His powers reach the pinnacle Saturday. Adoration from the crowds before Putin pushed him into exile in Belarus. And if there were any doubt, how irreversibly the pair have fallen out, Putin again late Monday, labelling him a traitor. A measure of how much Prigozhin is now under Putin's skin. He won't even say his name. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And the measure of Putin's weakening grip on power. He didn't round up Prigozhin Saturday, when he had the chance. Leaving him free to keep up his critical anti Defense Ministry drumbeat. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.",

Just yesterday, the S&amp;P Global, reduced growth forecasts from 5.5 percent to 5.2 percent. Joining Goldman Sachs, UBS and J.P. Morgan among others in reducing estimates.The property sector remains a drag on the economy as developers struggle to complete pre-sold projects and the local government debt burden comes into focus.
