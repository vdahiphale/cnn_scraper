A 54-year-old Colin Gray faces second- degree murder charges and eight counts of cruelty to children in connection with a shooting at Apalachee High School Wednesday, where four people died and nine others were wounded. His son, Cole Gray, has admitted to the crime, telling investigators, quote, I did it. A decision is expected today on whether Donald Trump's sentencing in the New York hush money case will be delayed. Trump's legal team has requested it to be put off until after the election. Right now, sentencing is scheduled for September the 18th. Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump was speaking about his multitude of legal cases whilst on the campaign trail this week. He told a crowd at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday that -- excuse me -- Democrats, in his words, are trying to throw their political opponents in jail. He then said, quote, two can play at that game. Now, the kickoff to early voting could be delayed in North Carolina, where a judge is ordering a temporary pause on ballot distribution today. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants his name removed now that he's dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Donald Trump. His request was ultimately rejected by the Superior Court, but Kennedy was given 24 hours to appeal. The State Board of Elections has instructed counties to not send ballots just yet, but they could also go out this afternoon unless an appeals court orders another delay. Allegations from the U.S. Justice Department that several right-wing media accounts are spreading Russian propaganda have prompted YouTube to take them down, including those of Tenet Media and its co-founder, Lauren Chen. Tenet and Chen are linked to an alleged Russian scheme to interfere with the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the allegations by trolling Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on Thursday. More on the story from CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Vladimir Putin responded to a U.S. crackdown on alleged Russian election interference with more election interference. The Russian president claims his preferred candidate was Joe Biden, but -- VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): He was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to endorse Ms. Harris. Well, that is what we will do, too. We will support her. And also, she laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means she's doing well. TODD (voice-over): Putin's comment drew a sharp rebuke from the White House.",

TODD (voice-over): This comes as CNN learns the identity of a Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department says was funded by Russian operatives as part of a Kremlin-backed campaign to influence this year's U.S. presidential election. A U.S. official briefed on the matter tells CNN that company is Tenet Media. Prosecutors say Tenet Media, with Russian money, hired right-wing social media personalities to fuel Russian narratives. Among those stars, content creators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, and Dave Rubin. Combined, those three have about six million subscribers on YouTube alone. Pool once interviewed Donald Trump on his podcast. Benny Johnson interviewed Eric Trump.

This is the borderland from which Putin was preparing to expand the war into Ukrainian territory.He was preparing to launch a new offensive against our city of Sumy, and we have turned the tables and are pushing the war into Russia through our counteroffensive. Today we control an area of more than 1,300 square kilometers in the Kursk region, and this includes 100 settlements. A significant part of this territory was abandoned by Russian troops. They simply fled when they saw our forces approaching. Of course, a significant part of the territory was taken under control by our forces in the battle. So far during the first month of our operation in the Kursk region, the Russian forces have lost about 6,000 soldiers killed and wounded in Kursk only and added tens of thousands of Russian troops in other war zones. Thanks to our actions, there is currently no threat that Russia will launch a new offensive operation on our territory against the city of Sumy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So that is how they are justifying this. He then goes on to make an argument, Max, that he has made before, which is that essentially what Ukraine has done in sort of stabilize that front now. So that is how they are justifying this. He then goes on to make an argument, Max, that he has made before, which is that essentially, what Ukraine has done in launching this operation over into Kursk has essentially made a mockery of Western fears of Russian red lines. They have invaded Russia. And we see, obviously, stepped up Russian aerial attacks and the offensive on the Eastern Front ongoing, but nothing really out of the ordinary course of this war. So he's saying this really does undermine the whole issue of Russian red lines. He said, we need to hold to our values, not what he called in this speech, red lines soaked in blood.",

It's about the limitations on using them on Russian territory.So we don't know exactly what's in the detail of this new aid package. But what Ukraine is now really pushing for is to be able to use long range weapons, long range missiles on targets inside Russia. And so far, the U.S. is still holding back on that.
