I just want to show you where I'm standing right now. What you see behind me is an iron dome missile defense system. That's what the Israelis used to intercept some of those rockets that are shot from the area of Gaza. And of course, for this battery, as for the many others around here, it was a very busy night. There were dozens of rockets that were launched from the territory of Gaza. A lot of them were intercepted. One did land in a town called Sderot, which is not very far at all from where I am standing right now, very close to the border with Gaza. And then of course, there were those airstrikes that the Israelis conducted in Gaza as well overnight. The Israelis are saying that they hit tunnels that the Palestinians, specifically Hamas, used for logistics. They hit what they call research and development areas as well, of course, Hamas developing new rockets all the time as well. And Hamas says that the Israelis also hit a hospital and that there was some damage done there as well. They're obviously condemning all of this and vowing to fight back. And then you did have those strikes also in south Lebanon as well after those rockets were shot from there yesterday. The Israelis are saying that they hit some Palestinian infrastructure there as well. So very tense here on the ground.

There are state entities that can look into that, the state's highest court can look into it, the bar can look into it. There are various ways to deal with it.

And if the reason you don't report is because you're afraid of how it looks, maybe you shouldn't accept it.Again, I don't think it has any influence or impact on the work of the justice.

A lot of people have raised questions about the court, talks about expanding the court, talks about term limits, talk about limiting the jurisdiction of the court. So, I think that justices need to be careful, because it's not all about just your individual conduct. Whatever you do, whatever you say, it affects the rest of the justices, it affects the reputation of the court. And I think if you look at recent polling and the judges generally should -- I would say, urge them not to look at recent polling.

You know, Nashville prides itself on being an open, welcoming city. This -- I think this could hurt business, I'm part of an effort to bring major league baseball to Nashville. I don't know how that's going to affect our efforts in terms of how people around the country look upon this city. And I know that, you know, by and large, the people that I know here, I love them. They've been great to me and my family. But this is just not a very good story for the city of Nashville. And I think it's very unfortunate.",
