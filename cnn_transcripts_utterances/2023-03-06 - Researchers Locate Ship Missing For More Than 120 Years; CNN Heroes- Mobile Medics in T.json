OK, so this bag is ready to go. Making sure we have the right equipment, the right medication. We have enough medications and supplies for hundreds of patients. From a trauma dressing to a Band Aid or a Tylenol to antibiotics. This mission will be completely self-sustaining. The buildings have been substantially damaged, so you can`t stay inside. It`s too dangerous. So it`s wintertime in Turkey. Yesterday it was 5 below. So we`re going to be sleeping in a tent, eating MREs. This is not going to be a good time. I`ve got eleven sort of dinners and I`ve only got two breakfast. I get hyper focus. If I get there and I forgot to pack it. You`re not running to the story. You need to make sure that you`ve got everything you need. We have to be really careful not to cross the border into Syria. When I put a team together, we need to do a zoom call prior to the mission, so we`re all sort of on the same page. My goal is to find where we can do the greatest amount of good for the most people in the time that we have. We need to find a safe place to be. What if somebody forgot their sleeping bag? We don`t speak the language, so I need to find some interpreters. So these are the things that run through my mind as I`m getting ready to go to the airport. There`s just a whole lot going on.",
