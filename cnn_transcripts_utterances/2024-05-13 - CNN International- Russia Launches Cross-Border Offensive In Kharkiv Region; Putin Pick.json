      "sentences": "Michael Cohen really very calm and collected, very relaxed, Rahel. He has been on the stand for about 90 minutes now. He is really detailing in his testimony the extremely close relationship he had with Donald Trump, in particular, how he would keep Trump informed on every decision he made. He would often meet with him multiple times per day. Their offices were very close in proximity.And now, what we've gotten to in the testimony is Cohen talking about all of these catch-and-kill schemes that he worked hand in hand with the National Enquirer's David Pecker to orchestrate. So, at one point, Cohen testified how Trump said bluntly, you handle it, when there was a story that arose about a doorman at one of Trump's buildings accusing Trump of fathering an illegitimate child. Of course, that story later turned out to be false. But, Cohen did detail how they work to pay off the doorman. And now, in the last few minutes of testimony, Cohen is talking about that catch-and-kill scheme as it pertained to the Playboy model Karen McDougal. And what he is documenting here is how he constantly updated Trump about the discussions with McDougal and the National Enquirer. He is talking about how Trump wanted to constantly stay informed as to how the negotiations were going. Remember, they eventually paid off Karen McDougal $150,000, although that was by the National Enquirer. I don't think Donald Trump ever paid them back. But, this is all laying the groundwork for what will be Michael Cohen's portrayal of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal because that's the only deal that's at the center of this case. And presumably after this McDougal testimony, we will hear Michael Cohen testify just how involved Donald Trump was in the Stormy Daniels deal, because prosecutors, they need to prove that Trump knew about the deal, that he directed it to protect his presidential campaign, and they need to really prove how Trump was intimately involved in that decision to reimburse Michael Cohen with the payments being labeled as legal fees and instead of what they actually were because that's where the falsification of business records charges come into play. So, Rahel, what we're seeing here is really a very careful and methodical questioning from the prosecution. They started off asking about Michael Cohen's background, trying to get him to be a believable witness for the jury. And now, they're getting into the heart of this case, talking about the other catch-and-kill deals. And then next, we should be getting to Stormy Daniels. Rahel.",

He is a former federal prosecutor, who was assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Gene, good to see you again.

But, this is a good start. It's just the beginning. And if he has been matter of fact and he is not running his mouth and giving narrative answers that are really not called for, that's a good sign.One thing I want to say though, in the direct exam, I'm curious as to whether the prosecutors are going to impeach Michael Cohen with some of his lies under oath, his inconsistencies and other things to take the sting out of cross-examination. But, I have to say this, if Michael Cohen does reasonably well during direct and cross, this is very bad news for President and Trump -- Mr. Trump. If he falls on his face, Michael Cohen does, and does poorly or mediocre, then we could have a hung jury or an acquittal because you've got to connect the invoices that I call \"Souffle\" invoices with the election scheme.",

You are under oath. You lied to the court. I would bring that out and impeach my own witness, so that on cross, it doesn't have as much of a stain. I don't know if they're going to do that. I don't think they did it with Stormy Daniels. If they did not, they probably should have, but that takes the sting out of it, and it also builds credibility for the prosecutor because you're not hiding the warts that your witnesses have. You're not hiding that your witness has some credibility issues. You're embracing it.So, what -- to me, the key is the corroboration of the documents with Mr. Cohen's testimony.",

That is perhaps evidenced by the fact that this shakeup came during Russia's first major cross-border offensive since really the early stages of this war. The battlefield is really being run by the head of the Armed Forces. But, the Defense Ministry, this was a major deal, not least because Sergei Shoigu, the outgoing minister, is a real veteran Putin loyalist. He has been Defense Minister for 12 years. Before that, he held a different government ministership since 1991. So, a really long-standing core Putin ally.So, removing him was certainly a big decision, and putting in an economist really signals that Russia wants to tighten the links between the war and the economy, really subordinate its sort of economy to the war effort, something that we've already seen. And I think there was also an element of Putin perhaps cleaning house after a corruption scandal of the defense ministry. But, anyway you look at this, this was a major move. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Center stage but already on shaky ground. This was to be outgoing Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's last victory salute. Much less ceremony, the Kremlin's announcement of his replacement Sunday. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESPERSON (Interpreted): Today on the battlefield, those who are more open for innovations, more open towards a quick implementation of the innovations win. That is why it's natural that on the current stage the President to take a decision for civilian to be in charge of the Ministry of Defense. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The nominated civilian is Andrey Belousov, a career economist and former First Deputy Prime Minister. That choice coming as the Kremlin made a rare admission that defense spending is approaching Cold War levels, its factories pushed to their limits amid sanctions and the labor force decimated by war. MARK ESPER, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Russia is moving to a war economy and it is true. Seven percent of their GDP now is focused on defense. They're on a war footing. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): That demand for weapons unlikely to slow. Ukraine frantically evacuating civilians in the Kharkiv region this weekend, as Russia launched a major cross-border offensive Friday, taking advantage of a narrowing window of opportunity as Kyiv waits for promised U.S. aid. An official video from a Russian military brigade purportedly showing a massive glide bomb hitting the Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): The idea behind the attacks in the Kharkiv region is to spread our forces thin and undermine the moral and motivational foundation of Ukrainians' ability to defend themselves. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Russia's attack on Kharkiv may also be an attempt to form a buffer zone. This the aftermath of what Russia claims is Ukrainian attack on a residential building in Belgorod. Russian state media reports more than a dozen dead. Russian lives, the other spiraling cost of Putin's war and Shoigu's legacy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Calls from top American officials are growing to prevent a major ground invasion of Rafah by Israel, but Israel's operation seems to be pressing ahead in northern Gaza. People are fleeing intense shelling and gunfire targeting the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel says that it's trying to prevent Hamas from regrouping there. And in southern Gaza, a UN agency for Palestinian refugees says that more than 360,000 people have fled Rafah. And the devastation in Gaza comes as top U.S. officials warn that a major full-scale invasion of Rafah could lead to widespread civilian casualties. As we can see here, CNN tracking this development from -- these developing stories from all angles. Scott McLean joins us live from Istanbul, and Alex Marquardt is with us from Washington. Scott, let me start with you, this heavy fighting in the refugee camp, Jabalia, what can you share with us? What are you learning? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey Rahel. Yeah. The Israelis say that they dropped bombs on 120 targets over the last day alone, and they're focusing on three areas, of course, Rafah, in the south, there is one area in the central Gaza, and in the north, it's the Jabalia refugee camp. This is an area that the IDF ordered to be evacuated early on Saturday morning. And the IDF says that there has been close range fighting there. We also know from new videos just coming in that there have been bombs dropped as well. You can see smoke billowing over the skyline. And we have also seen videos of families trying to kind of figure out where exactly to go as drones buzz overhead, and the sound of gunfire can be heard in the distance as well and in the not so distance also. There are some people who say that, look, they're going to stay put, and that's pretty hard to understand until you consider things like what we saw overnight Friday into Saturday morning this weekend when people in northern and southern -- or in central Gaza, excuse me, say that bombs were dropped on homes at two o'clock in the morning without any warning at all, killing dozens of people. And we know that many of the victims were children as well, who were brought to the hospital, whose bodies were brought to the hospital, in many cases, completely covered in soot. Even ambulances in northern Gaza say it's difficult to drive around. They say that they have been targeted in some cases by the IDF and this is not unprecedented. We saw this, in some cases, early on in the war as well. The IDF also says that it is coming face to face with Hamas fighters in Rafah in the eastern part of the city and also near the border crossing, of course, on the Gaza side of that border crossing. And Rahel, when you watch the videos coming in from our CNN stringer and from other sources as well, you hear many of the same things coming from people. They say that they are exhausted from moving around. They're struggling to find food. They're often only moving around for the sake of their own children. One man said that if it wasn't for his kids, he wouldn't be moving at all. He said death would be more honorable than this humiliation. And many also have doubts about the safety of the areas that they are going to. Even that humanitarian zone along the coast, some people think that it is not -- it wouldn't be out of the bounds of Israel to strike in or around that area even. That's an area where at last count there had been 360,000 people leave Rafah for that area and others. And so, there are plenty of tents popping up. But, there is very little in the way of infrastructure to support that volume of people, who by the way, may be there for quite some time now. Rahel.",

They want to block a Russian-style foreign agents' bill. The Parliament's legal committee approved the bill before it goes for a third reading in the full assembly. The law would require groups receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents or face heavy fines. In Baltimore, Maryland, authorities will attempt to demolish a portion of the Francis Scott Key Bridge later today. The bridge collapsed on top of a cargo ship after the ship rammed a pillar, killing six people. Officials plan to use small explosives to make cuts in the collapsed structure in order to free the ship. In the U.S., pro-Palestinian protests forced changes to some universities' weekend graduation ceremonies. Pomona College in California moved its ceremony 30 miles away after days of protests. Meanwhile, at Duke University, about 30 students walked out as comedian Jerry Seinfeld was introduced as commencement speaker, some of them waving the Palestinian flag. And a Nigerian official tells CNN that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have left the country after a three-day tour. Prince Harry and Meghan wrapped up their visit to Nigeria on Sunday with basketball charity events in Lagos. The trip was linked to Prince Harry's Invictus Games. All right. He was once one of Donald Trump's closest advisors. Now, Michael Cohen is on the witness stand against Trump. Cohen's testimony is seen as a key part in the New York prosecutors' hush money case against the former President. He testified about getting hired by Trump and keeping the former President updated on all aspects of his work. Cohen said that he was quote \"required to keep Trump updated and spoke to him several times a day.\" He was also asked about his relationship with David Pecker, the former boss of the National Enquirer. Let's bring back in former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi. Gene, good to see you again. So, it's been about 30 minutes or so since we last spoke.

Now, I think some of the takeaways from these series of polls is that Biden is really struggling to connect with his own coalition, and that's what we've been seeing over the last several weeks, and these polls show that.Now, I want to just dig into some of the main themes that we found. One is that, with this coalition, Biden is evenly splitting younger voters and Hispanic voters with Trump. And he also received -- Donald Trump received 20 percent support from black voters in a head-to-head matchup with Biden. And these are some of the key things I think that you should be paying attention to, because in my conversations with the Trump campaign, this is exactly what they are trying to do. They're trying to undermine and undercut Biden's support with these key different demographics, with younger voters, with Hispanic voters, with black voters. And we're showing that that strategy is paying off. Now, other takeaways from these polls show that Biden is really struggling with a lot of dissatisfaction over his handling the war in Gaza, his handling of the economy, and also the overall direction of the country. These are tough things for him to try and turn around ahead of November. And I also think, just to give you a sense of how the Trump campaign is feeling about these polls, they feel very good. We saw his advisors this morning, people like Jason Miller, touting these on social media. He was sending -- I got a text from him and some other Trump campaign advisors saying these polls and these numbers are really good for us. So, I think that just again underscores that this is a troubling thing for Biden. However, of course, we're still a little less than six months out from the election. Things can change. And we can't always take too much away from these surveys. But, I think your point at the top there, that these have largely remained the same.

This is like a rescue center with many, many hundreds of volunteers are arriving here to help the way they can. Some goes into the water with their boats, with their jet ski to find people, to find pets, to give a food to the people. But other, they just come and cook. They give hot beverages. They give coffee. They help with the animals. They just wait there for people to arrive and ask for a rescue. They -- you have doctors giving massages to the people. You have a pharmacy giving leptospirosis charge and all sorts of medicine.This doesn't stop 24 hours a days and it won't stop for probably more than a month because the water don't go down, because the water is still going up because he is still raining. It doesn't stop and probably will keep raining even tomorrow and for many days. So, the situation won't get better. The water is still not going down. But, when it does, like probably for more than a month, we will see what those waters are still hiding inside. Dario Klein, CNN, Porto Alegre. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Yet another round of severe storms are expected to drench already waterlogged ground, and that includes parts of Texas where hundreds of people were rescued during torrential downpours last week.Let's bring in Derek Van Dam, who joins us from the CNN weather center. Derek, I mean, more water is the last thing that a lot of these people need. What's the latest here?",

And really, what's happening right now is just this training effect of showers and thunderstorms, not to mention the widespread severe weather, but this rain that's moving over the same locations for several hours at a time. And at the moment, we have some stronger thunderstorms moving through the western portions of the Florida Panhandle. There was a tornado warning that has been dropped.But, nonetheless, we still have severe thunderstorm warnings in place, as some of these winds have exceeded 80 miles per hour, roughly 130 kilometers per hour. So, definitely another round of severe weather in the cards for the Deep South that has just been ravaged lately with such intense weather. Now, we focus in on Texas, and this is the area where we have, of course, had flash flooding recently. But now, we have the threat of severe storms, including hail and strong winds as well. So, the greatest risk, Rahel, today, two-inch size in diameter hailstones falling from the sky. Can you imagine that? San Antonio all the way to Houston. You have our greatest threat of large hail but it doesn't stop there. It extends across portions of Louisiana, including New Orleans, where you see that kind of hatched area. Now, it's not one storm that's going to bring this round of wet weather across the Deep South. It is several storms. So, we're going to take you right through Tuesday with another round of showers and thunderstorms. So, that will continue, the flood threat, and of course the possibility of strong to severe weather. So, Rahel, difficult day across the south Gulf Coast.",

Cohen's testimony will be crucial as prosecutors try to show that Trump tried to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Now, last week, Daniels was at the center of the trial, testifying about the alleged sexual encounter that she had with Trump in 2006. And we also heard from a former Trump White House aide who testified that the former President often signed checks without reviewing them. So, where do things stand at this moment?Let's bring back in CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider. Jessica, set a scene for us both of what's happening right now and where we are in terms of the larger trial.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Like you said, Rahel, we're probably getting near the end of the prosecution's case here. Michael Cohen is their main star witness. They said that they might call one more person after Michael Cohen. But, Michael Cohen is really the entire prosecution's case, all wrapped into one person. He has been testifying all morning long. And probably the most interesting part of the testimony this morning is that prosecutors, they once again played that audio tape of Trump and Cohen. And it's -- Cohen admits that he recorded it without Trump's knowledge. But, in that audio recording, they're discussing that $150,000 payout to Karen McDougal. Of course, that money was eventually paid by the National Enquirer.But, you hear on this audio recording and the jury heard it in prior testimony, they just heard it this morning, Trump orders at one point, pay in cash. And then Cohen explains, that was to avoid a paper trail. But, prosecutors, they're using this as just yet another piece of evidence that Trump was extremely involved in every transaction that Cowen worked on. Cohen has already testified this morning. He says Trump was a micromanager, that he was involved in every facet of the business, every payment. He was always apprised as to what was going on. So, all of this is laying the groundwork for what will soon be Michael Cohen's testimony about the Stormy Daniels hush money deal because that is at the center of this case. We have not gotten into the meat of that yet, presumably very soon. And we'll hear that Cohen will testify likely that Donald Trump was very involved in that deal, because prosecutors need to prove that Trump knew about and directed that deal to protect his presidential campaign. And prosecutors also need to prove that Trump was intimately involved in the decision to actually disguise the reimbursement payments as legal fees to Cohen, because that is where that falsification of business records charges come into play. So, Rahel, we're watching all of this unfold. It doesn't yet look like Michael Cohen has gotten to the heart of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal, but they are moving ever closer to it as they kind of wrap up the Karen McDougal payoff.",
