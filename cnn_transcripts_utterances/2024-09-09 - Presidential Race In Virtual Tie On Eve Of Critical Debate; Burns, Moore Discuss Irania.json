I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6evening, just a day away from a critical presidential debate, and polls are showing that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, neck-and-neck. Meanwhile, new insights on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza from the MI6 and CIA chiefs over the weekend, as both conflicts see further escalation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heading to the U.K. for what is known as the U.S.-U.K. strategic dialog. And Venezuela's opposition leader fleeing to Spain, seeking asylum after his nation's highly contested election. Well, they have never met face to face before, at least, but they will just one day from now in Philadelphia. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump set to square off in a hugely consequential U.S. presidential debate, happening just days before people in some states can start casting ballots in early voting. Well, the Democratic and Republican nominees are heading into the debate in a statistical tie. You can see it here in the latest CNN poll of polls, no clear leader. Harris has been spending the days leading up to the debate in Pittsburgh, in the western part of Pennsylvania, an area considered crucial for both candidates if they want to win the battleground state that ultimately may decide this election. Trump spent part of the weekend revisiting his false claims about the 2020 election and threatening on his Truth Social web site to imprison any election officials who, in his words, cheat in counting this year's results. So, I'm joined this hour by Eva McKend, who is in Pittsburgh covering the Harris campaign, and Steve Contorno watching the Trump campaign from St Petersburg in Florida. Right. Eva, let's start with you. How is Harris preparing for what is and I'm going to use the word again. This is a hugely consequential event, of course, for both of them.",

He's -- she is also been in conversation with Hillary Clinton as well as President Biden, who both have extensive experience debating the former president.

And then, also, what we hear from her surrogates, at least, is that this is a new generation, right? The former president represents more of the same on due in part to his age.

However, it is also created this risk of him focusing too much on Joe Biden, who is no longer his candidate. When you watch him speak at rallies and in media appearances and taking questions, he is often fixated on Joe Biden, in a way where he laments that Biden isn't still his opponents, in ways that that sometimes seems like Biden is still his main rival in this race, and not necessarily focusing his efforts and attention on Harris. So, certainly, the country is feeling the effects of the last four years in a way that the Trump campaign believes will be beneficial to him at the ballot box. However, as far as articulating a case, he is still struggling to move on from Donald Trump, or, excuse me, from Joe Biden to Vice President Harris.",

But they also said that they believe that the whole incursion, the Ukrainians remaining on Russian territory, really put a dent in Vladimir Putin's narrative that Ukraine will, at some point, inevitably be ground down by the much larger country, by Russia with its much larger forces.

And the Iranians, of course, so far, are denying transferring any sort of weapons to the Russians, at least officially. But one of the things that we are indeed seeing is a massive uptick, or considerable uptick, in the amount of missiles that the Russians are firing towards Ukrainian territory. Some of those are cruise missiles, which have been crime for a very long time. But one of the things that really -- we have really picked up on is the notable increase in the use of ballistic missiles, and that, of course, is something that the Iranians do produce in great quantities. So far, there's nothing to indicate that any of the missiles that have been fired by the Russians are Iranian made missiles, or even missiles with Iranian technology. But certainly, the Russians do seem to be using a lot more cruise missiles in general, of their own making, and in parts, also, the Ukrainians say of North Korean making on the battlefield. One of the interesting things that we also got today, by the way, was the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. He was asked about all of this, and all he said, Look, not all reports of such nature are true. But he also did say that there was deep cooperation between Iran and Russia in many fields. And then, he said, including the most sensitive area. Of course, that's something that could mean missile technology. But of course, also something that could mean drone technology as well.

We have a color table in here that indicates the coldest cloud types, meaning the highest of elevation of these clouds, and that is the purple. So, we are seeing this storm strengthen as the thunderstorms bubble out from the middle of it, and it is poised to move over that warm water and strengthen as it does. So, right now, Weather Prediction Center, I should say, National Hurricane Center, actually forecasting a Category 1 landfall near the Louisiana coastline Wednesday into Thursday, but could feel effects by Tuesday evening. In fact, will be a lot of rain associated with this system, and, of course, the storm surge and wind threat as well. Check out this photo. Different story. This is the fires that are ongoing over the Western U.S. This is a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. That is when the updrafts associated with fire weather become so violent that they actually create their own clouds, their own weather, and often create showers and thunderstorms, creating lightning and additional fires down the line. So, that's what's happening over parts of the southern California state. In fact, we have had just this very warm summer from June to August. All these red dots are actually the warmest locations on record for that summer period. And if we look globally, we're talking about Copernicus, the European climate monitoring system, saying that we are on track to once again, the warmest year on recorded history.
