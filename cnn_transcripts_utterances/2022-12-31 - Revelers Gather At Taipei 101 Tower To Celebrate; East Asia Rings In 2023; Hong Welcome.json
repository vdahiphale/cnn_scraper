You can see the strobe effects of the star ferry fleet and the face of the Hong Kong convention center turning into the countdown fall. Down below me, scores of revelers, well-wishers out on the streets. It was just a few days ago when Hong Kong gave up on all of those social distancing requirements that put a cap on gatherings.

Look, Paula, as you know well, as we've been reporting and talking to each other for the last couple of years, but especially this last year, 2022 was a very tough year for Hong Kong.Hong Kong was at the mercy of its worst ever COVID-19 outbreak, at the mercy of a zero-COVID policy that disrupted people's lives and livelihoods. It shuttered businesses, it temporarily closed schools, it separated families, it sparked an exodus of many people leaving the city. But we have turned a corner. A lot of those tough pandemic rules have gone away. I've been looking in awe at the crowds down below on the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui, TST, the district here in Hong Kong, all walking up and down the harbor. They were there to just take a look at the incredible laser beam light show pyrotechnic display. These were scenes you would not see in the last couple of years in Hong Kong. And it was only until a couple of days ago when we got rid of the remaining social distancing restrictions. Yes, a mask mandate remains in effect. If you come and visit Hong Kong, you got to wear your mask. But Hong Kong is open and Hong Kong is ready to welcome travelers and friends of Hong Kong to come back and visit. And that is all adding up to this sense of renewal, of hope, of beliefs that it can become Asia's world city once again. It will be tough, needs to reclaim that title, but I believe Hong Kong can do it. And that's something to look forward to this year. Paula?",

So, in a certain sense, there's a celebration of his life and his going to heaven.And Pope Benedict, by the way, himself said many times, you know, he had plenty of occasion to talk about his own death, and he said he almost was looking forward to it. He thought it would be something heaven would be something like his childhood home, he said. He gave an interview, full length interview, in 2016, Paula, the book is called \"The Last Testament.\" So that was back in 2016, but he died in 2022 last day. And Pope Francis is currently in the Basilica, as you say, doing the vespers, which were already organized for New Year's Eve. He will afterwards, Paula, come out here to the Square to see the nativity scene. So people are kind of gathering for that purpose.

You know, one thing people don't realize is they actually had a close relationship. They are very different people.But Pope Francis had a lot of respect for Pope Benedict, as did a lot of progressives in the Catholic Church who liked to make this big distinction between conservatives and progressives. But remember that Pope Benedict was a sort of towering intellectual figure for the Catholic Church. And whether you necessarily agreed with some of the things that he thought of or not, even cardinals who consider themselves more progressive had a great respect for him. And I think, in fact, that's why they elected him Pope after John Paul II. He was the only person who could fulfill -- fill those shoes. Paula?",

And if there's truly one night in Bangkok, you don't want to miss, it the one that's happening tonight. Now, CNN's Will Ripley has, like me, spent some time in Bangkok. He knows it well. Let's bring him back again. Will, good to see you. I know you're in Taipei. We're talking about Bangkok now because it's their moment right now. They're known for its nightlife.

I was just there recently.And, you know, even though their tourist numbers are down from what they were -- Eric is laughing at me here. Yes, he knows what I'm talking about. Eric, our producer here. Anyway moving -- changing subject. Happy New Year, everybody. Now, if you're in Bangkok right now, yes, the number of tourists is down from what it was pre-pandemic. But still, I thought it felt remarkably normal. From the entrance at the airport to walking around, and the streets are crowded, the businesses are open. And yes, they'd like to see more visitors, and they're hoping that 2023 will bring more visitors. I don't know if we have the live signal that gremlins have been hitting our technical system all night long, but I can tell you that if you are along the riverfront tonight, whether you're at River Park or whether you're on a river cruise, you're seeing a spectacular fireworks show. Bangkok truly is one of Asia's favorite destinations to ring in the New Year, and I'd love for us to be able to show it to you, but instead, they're going to show both of us, Kristie.

There are places where you can sit, and you can meditate, and you can watch the sunrise in silence, or you can see the sun rising as you're walking home from a nightclub.I mean, Bangkok literally is one of those cities that offers a path for everyone. No matter why you're there, no matter how you want to celebrate, you can do it there. And so, that's why we're just going to continue to tell you all about it. Unfortunately, we can't show it to you right now because our signal isn't working. But I can tell you that here in Taiwan, we saw fabulous fireworks here at Taipei 101 tonight, and it was truly just spectacular. Five minutes at an altitude of more than 1500 feet, nearly 500 meters above the Taiwanese capital, they had a show that went on and went on. And now to my right, I see a small army of street sweepers cleaning up the central Taipei. It's really extraordinary how quickly the crowds move out and they get this place tidied up, despite the fact that more than a million people were expected out here, despite the fact that we've had some inclement weather. We've had some rainstorms. It was a gorgeous site there in Hong Kong where you were as well, Kristie. First time in several years that you were able to see fireworks like that in Hong Kong, it must have been just incredible and almost emotional to feel somewhat back to normal finally, after all that the world has been through these last few years.",

Whether it's Taipei where you are, Hong Kong where I am, where it's happening right now in Bangkok, when you see fireworks light up the sky, as you see live on your screen from Bangkok, it is an emotional moment.A number of people are able to travel into Thailand to see this as guests of the kingdom, as well as the people who call Thailand home. And there are so many different areas from which you could see this spectacular site in Bangkok, whether it's from the banks of the iconic Chao Phraya River or from one of the many skyscrapers there. You mentioned one of these sky bars that are available there. From there, imagine seeing these sites up in the skies above Bangkok. I was there a couple of years ago to go to the King Power Mahanakhon, which has quite famously, one of these clear platforms that are multiple, multiple stories.

Like it's very, very difficult for me to step out one of those things. I know that they say it's very secure. They have bridges that are like that. I've never walked across one. Heights get me a little bit.I have to give kudos to my team, Eric, Tony and John Ace (ph), because while I was in Ukraine, they were up on top of the rooftop of Taipei 101 shooting our story about the fireworks. And they literally had to strap in using these belts that you're, like, dangling off the side. I mean, this is not for the weak hearted to get up there. Now, that said, I'm going to take it as a challenge and try to get up there at some point as well, because maybe 2023 will be all about facing our fears, about overcoming obstacles in life. 2022 had a lot of them, for sure. No matter where you were in the world, it wasn't always the easiest of years, but we are now in a fresh, brand new year. It's a chance for a fresh new start.

I think street food is probably one of the most fun ways to experience any country, whether it's the night market here in Taiwan, where people go and hang out late at night at the night market. You can get vegan food at the night market here if you're vegan, because there's a lot of Taiwanese vegans and so they have, like, fabulous selection of street food that's vegan. And then, you can also get plenty of meat if that's what you like as well. It just really -- I think if you're traveling in the New Year, make sure that you don't just go to stick at the tourist spot. Get out there to the markets, hang out where locals hang out. You're going to have an authentic experience. That's what it felt like out here at Taipei 101 as well. This is where so many people like to come to celebrate New Year and to get ready then for the Lunar New Year that they'll spend with their families out here. It's party time and the parties are happening all around us here in Central Taipei. Kristie, I can hear them. I can hear the bass from many different nightclubs as we stand here.
