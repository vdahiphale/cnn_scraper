      "sentences": "It is 8And let's get right to the news. Today, Donald Trump's former chief of staff, retired Marine General John Kelly, warned in an interview with \"The New York Times\" that Trump fits the definition of a fascist and prefers what he called the, quote, dictator approach. Kelly also recounted to \"The Atlantic\" magazine that Trump praised Adolf Hitler and envied the loyalty of Hitler's Nazi generals. This is consistent with what Kelly told me for an interview published in March this year. Kelly said Trump told him Hitler, quote, did some good things. Have a listen now to how Vice President Kamala Harris framed these remarks in the choice voters face in the upcoming election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side-by- side in the Oval Office, and in the Situation Room. Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable. And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The audience will include Democrats, Republicans, and independents,all of whom say not only do they tend to vote in November, but also that they remain undecided and persuadable. We should note that Trump declined to take part in a proposed debate with Harris on CNN, as well as a CNN town hall of his own. Joining us now to discuss, CNN's Kevin Liptak live in Washington, D.C. And I wonder, if the vice president clearly took a moment today to respond specifically to these latest eyewitness accounts of Donald Trump's praise for Adolf Hitler. Remarkable as it may be, but firsthand accounts from his former chief of staff. Do we know how she plans to connect that to her broader message at the town hall tonight?",

Well, returning now to Kelly's remarks. The retired marine is more than just a former top officer. In fact, he reached the highest rank in the marines, four-star general, and former White House chief of staff. He also lost a son, a young marine lieutenant, to a landmine in Afghanistan. He's a Gold Star father. Now, General Kelly is telling \"The Atlantic\" that while Trump was president, he said, quote, I need the kind of generals that Hitler had, people who were totally loyal to him that follow orders. This is quite similar to remarks that he made to me for a book that came out in March where he said, well, but Hitler did some good things and he pointed out loyalty issues with his own generals that he said wish were more like Hitler's Nazi generals. We should note that the Republican nominee Trump, is set to speak as well this evening, just a few hours from now. CNN's Alayna Treene is tracking his campaign. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Good to have you both on. I think the comments bear repeating. I'm going to quote from what General John Kelly told me for my book that came out in March regarding Trump's praise of Hitler, he said the following he said, and this is quoting John Kelly. Well, but Hitler did some good things. I said, well what? And he said, well, Hitler rebuilt the economy. But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, sir, you can never say anything good about the guy, nothing, Kelly recounted. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison. Kelly went on to say, its pretty hard to believe he missed the Holocaust, speaking of Trump. Stephen Collinson, that is not the first time we've heard that Trump has praised Hitler and the loyalty of his generals. And, of course, it's not the first time Trump has said something that in any other time would be considered -- well, just unsayable by a candidate for the highest office. What does it say that Republicans are sticking with him through this? And, by the way, I should note, this is General John Kelly who is sharing a firsthand account as Trump's chief of staff as to his comments.",

      "sentences": "Well, Republicans are intimidated by Donald Trump's power. If you want to have a career in the Republican Party, you have to follow the line of Donald Trump and praised Donald Trump. We've seen that repeatedly over the last eight years.Those comments are disgusting and they're absurd and they raise very profound questions along with many of other Trump's recent comments about what it would be like in the White House if he wins a second term without many of the guardrails that he faced in his first term in terms of more orthodox establishment, Republican advisers, he's left no doubt that he's going to put people in positions of power who will do exactly what he says. But at the same time, there's another question of whether this will have a political impact on this election. You know, Donald Trump tried to overturn an election to stay in power. It seems unlikely that a few comments as egregious as they are going to change the minds of his supporters, even if they, you know, give some voters pause who are more moderate, who are thinking about showing up for the election. If you look at the polls, the issue of democracy is in low single figures terms of the concern of voters compared to other issues. That perhaps is not what the Harris campaign would like it to be, but it's the fact.",

      "sentences": "What we should note, Stephen Collinson, right, is that this is not just Trump. Looking back to the dictator from the middle of the last century Donald Trump has a habit, a quite consistent one, for years of praising the autocratic leaders of several of America's biggest adversaries. That includes Russia, China, then North Korea.This was just last week. Put the quote up on the screen. Trump told his supporters that Xi Jinping is brilliant, that Vladimir Putin is tough, that Kim Jong-un thinks Obama was a real jerk, a real jerk, and I think he's the real jerk. And by the way, Kim Jong-un loves making nuclear weapons. This is the way he speaks about the leaders of America's adversaries who also happen to be autocrats. Can we connect that those statements that infatuation it seems as described by Trump's own former senior advisors -- can we connect that to the way that Trump would govern as the commander in chief? COLLINSON: I think you can definitely connect it and say that's exactly how he'd like to govern. Donald Trump admires strongmen who operate without restraints to whom all the other people in the government pay feasance and loyalty. He'd love to be able to govern like that. His praise for those strong man is absolutely antithetical to what American governance is supposed to be and against the Constitution, and I think that is why so many people are concerned about a second term, which is openly said he would dedicate to retribution against his enemies, that he got the government, the civil service, the Justice Department that he'd go looking for generals that wouldn't as Kelly was talking about in the New York Times article be loyal to the Constitution, but would instead be loyal to him. There is no at least in modern American history and I think probably across the span of American history, there has been no American president who has come into office saying these kind of things. And who is clearly of the belief that he has unlimited powers as president.",

And it was only through the last-minute intervention of someone like John Kelly that that didn't happen. So one can imagine a second term where he doesn't have folks like that around him.Ron, Harris has chance tonight to make the case to voters and particularly the ones you were describing, not just about this, but about why she should be president. But on this particular issue, what do you need to hear from her tonight to change the minds of those voters?",

      "sentences": "Well, I don't know if its so much changing the minds as enveloping them and bringing in more of the voters who are uneasy about, about Trump. Look, I thought that I wrote last week that she probably waited too long and October to kind of enlarge the frame and raised the stakes of this election, they put a lot of focus on introducing her to voters and they put a lot of focus on trying to convince voters she would fight for them on the economy that all of that is important and she has made significant progress on it.But when you reach the end of the line, Jim, as we saw again in an economist poll today significantly more Americans say they were better off in the Trump presidency before COVID than they are toward the end of the Biden presidency. And what that says is that if you have a conventional election on who is going to be better for your bottom line, it is going to be very hard for Harris to win. But there is no reason for that to be the dominant question in the election, especially as you see, the kind of comments from Trump about going out after the enemy from within. John Kelly, describing him as someone who is fundamentally fascist and not in agreement with the Constitution. I mean, heard job, I think above all, is to raise the stakes in this election. There's a political analyst saying Mike Potter is or who is calculated using data from catalysts. There are 91 million separate individuals so people who have come out to vote against Trump or Trumpism since 2016, only about 83 million have come out to vote for him. The voters at the edge of that coalition have not had the same level of urgency or feeling of risks that they had in 2020 as reflected in the fact that his retrospective job approval is going up. Her job, I think is to remind them that there is more that comes with electing Donald Trump, then potentially lower prices on gas and groceries and to raise that sense of alarm in the broadest definition of the MAGA coalition.",

You can watch the presidential town hall tonight moderated by my colleague Anderson Cooper right here on CNN airs live 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 2:00 a.m. in London. Well, a deadly attack on a state-run defense company has rocked the capital of Turkey. You can hear the gunfire there. At least five people killed, 22 wounded, this at the aerospace industry's headquarters near Ankara. A social media video verified and geolocated by CNN showed the moment an explosion rocked the area. After the blast, a person holding a firearm is seen running it. See there in what appears to be a parking lot, turkeys interior minister is blaming Kurdish militants and says the two attackers, a man and a woman were killed. Salma Abdelaziz is following the developments from London. Salma, quite a deadly attack and the kind of attack, terror attack we have not seen in Turkey for some number of years.",

If you don't mind, I just want to go back to that social media video that you were airing just moments ago in break it down a little bit just to see how intense this attack was.You can see in that video that huge explosion, this plume of smoke going up in the air and then you've seen individual who's moving through that area with a gun, you hear the gunfire going off. This is happening in broad daylight at this aerospace company that is state owned, that was described to me by one analyst as the crown jewel of Turkey's defense industry. It is a company that provides fighter jets, drones, other military supplies to Turkey's army. So it's very much attack on the very heart of Turkey. Several people killed so far I know the death toll has gone up more than a dozen people killed, several people wounded. You mentioned the two attackers that authorities say were killed, a man and a woman. Investigations are underway to identify who they are, but already authorities are pointing the finger at PKK, that Kurdistan Workers Party. There has been a longstanding conflict between this organization, the PKK, and the Turkish government. And everyone in Turkey is pointing to the timing of this attack, Jim, because just 24 hours ago, President Erdogan's ally issued an olive branch to the PKK. He appeared to signal the possibility of talks of negotiation, something that could have put to bed a conflict thats been ongoing for decades now. President Erdogan has vowed to go after those who are behind this attack. He says the attack targeted the very safety of the nation and its peace.",

And that has meant that it has simply not been on the front pages the way that the war in Sudan should have been. And then of course, on top of that, you have the fact that it is just so difficult, not just for journalists, but for human rights organizations, international aid agencies to get inside the hardest hit areas and particularly to get inside Darfur where there was as you alluded to, a genocide perpetrated from 2003 to 2005 and where many fear that the worst could be realized once again, Jim.",
