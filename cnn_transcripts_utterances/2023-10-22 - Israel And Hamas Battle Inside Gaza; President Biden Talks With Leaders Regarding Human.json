Erin, we'll talk to you in a hot second. So, we begin with our special coverage with the quickly escalating developments in Israel and Gaza. And a warning, some of you might find it very disturbing. These are graphic images coming up.New fighting today inside Gaza. Israel Defense Forces say they clashed with Hamas fighters, marking only the second confirmed Israeli operation in the enclave since the beginning of this war. But beyond that skirmish, it has been another bloody day across the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes ripping through the enclave with deadly results. One Gaza hospital saying they are being overwhelmed by the number of bodies. Videos obtained by CNN showed dozens of dead wrapped in shrouds surrounding the hospital. The morgue already filled to capacity. And while in the West Bank, a rare Israeli strike targeted a mosque to thwart what the IDF called an imminent terror attack. The Palestinian Authority called it a dangerous escalation. The IDF is vowing to increase its aerial assaults in Gaza ahead of a potential ground incursion. And with the bloodshed mounting, this afternoon, President Biden held phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pope Francis and leaders from Canada and across Europe. The White House says Biden and Netanyahu have agreed there will be a continued flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. And today, more critical aid arrived there. CNN has confirmed at least 14 relief aid trucks carrying urgent supplies entered the enclave a short time ago. I want to bring in now my colleague Erin Burnett in Tel Aviv. Erin.",

So, they admit they did that and they say that it was a target because that's what was happening next to it. And I want to go to our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, because he's on the ground south of here in Sderot, Israel.Nic, where you have been for two weeks. So today we saw something that we haven't really seen before in there were actual clashes inside Gaza between Hamas and Israeli forces. So, we knew special forces had been in there, but this is the first time at least I understand that there had been actual clashes. What more are you learning about what happened there?",

I think what we're seeing, and this is an indication of it, the fact that there was a clash just over the border inside of Gaza, an unannounced incursion, a small incursion, a limited incursion to prepare the way for a potential bigger movement of troops into Gaza.This was a situation where Hamas saying they were able to engage this IDF unit and the Hamas claim that they were able to hit a tank and a couple of the heavy mechanical diggers that typically are used to prepare the way for troops to follow on if there's a larger incursion because there's a border fence. Because there's a border wall you need these big diggers to clear away, make sure that there's no bombs and mines that have been placed obstructing the movement of troops that may follow on. So, in this situation, one IDF soldier was killed, three were injured. We don't specifically know what the final objective of this limited incursion was going to be, other than to this sort of limited objective to prepare the way for other troops. Neither do we know when a full incursion might come. What we've seen along the border today is an extreme readiness of troops to go in, but it doesn't seem that they're, from what we can see, that they were quite at the border just yet, but clearly this unit was over the border and that was new and that was different.",

It was more sustained, more consistent, perhaps just 15 minutes ago.But in terms of your question there, I think that it's, you know, I think that for the troops at the moment that are waiting at the border, this is a moment where they don't know when the order's going to come, that they expect it to come, but it's not clear when it will come.",

We have seen progress on both of those fronts.We saw the two American women from Chicago released on Friday. We've also seen today some of those trucks moving towards the southern Gaza Strip. So, I understand from two sources that there has been some pressing from the Biden administration side to the Israelis to get them to allow for more time to make advances on both of those fronts. Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked about this earlier today on a Sunday morning show. He said that this is a decision for the Israelis to make. He kind of skirted around the question. President Biden was also asked about this on Saturday. He just said that he is speaking with the Israelis. Erin, we have gotten denials from the Israeli side. They say that there has been no pressure from the Biden administration to slow their, what appears to be an imminent ground incursion into Gaza. The U.S. and the Israelis are certainly trying to give the impression that the U.S. is not dictating anything, not telling the Israelis what to do. But at the same time, Erin, we have heard repeatedly from the Biden administration that there are significant concerns about the humanitarian issues, that while they support Israel's efforts against Hamas, that they are very concerned about getting those hostages out and getting that aid into Gaza, Erin.",

After 10 minutes, the terrorists came in and threw grenades into the bomb shelter. My son was positioned close to the door or to the opening. So, when they threw out, threw the grenades, I know that from his friend that survived this told us that he threw grenades out with other friends that were there. One grenade wasn't thrown out, and it bombed into the bomb shelter. After that, the terrorists came in and dragged three of them outside. My son was one of them. I saw the video. It was very hard to see it. It took me a moment to realize what had happened. They were dragging him and pulling him, he tried to resist, but he couldn't. So, I think he was really smart after that. He understood that if you would resist, then they might kill him so he stopped resisting. And you can really see how he's like, he's dragged, and then they take like, his hair and like, pull him through his hair to the truck. And this was very -- it was hard to see it. Very, very hard to see it. His friends told me afterwards that the terrorists went inside and killed everyone. Out of the 27, three were captured and kidnapped and seven survived. All of them were hurt. Two of his best friends were murdered that day and two of his other friends lived to tell about it. which is amazing. So that's --",
