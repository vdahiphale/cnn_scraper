Also a growing standoff between the West and China.

There are a number of issues on which they've had to collaborate, top of the list of course is the war in Ukraine, coordinating the West's lockstep approach to supplying Ukraine with weaponry, to supporting them through financial and humanitarian aid.And also of course to trying to mitigate the spillover effects of that on the economy, the global economy and particularly right now as we head into what is expected to be a very difficult winter in Europe, to helping Europe weather that storm. So that support for Ukraine does not wane. So talking about Ukraine will be top of the agenda. But I'm told that this is a relationship that was very much forged through that cooperation. There was of course that August debacle over the submarines that blindsided the French, bringing relations frankly between the two countries to their lowest point in two decades as the French president at the time recalled his ambassador to Washington for consultations, but all of that is very far from the minds of either side at this point. You saw the full pomp and circumstance very much on display, and President Biden explaining essentially why he chose France for this first state visit, talking about democracy, talking about the shared struggles together.

President Biden of course recently met the Chinese President Xi Jinping on the side lines of the G20 Summit in Bali.President Macron, he is expected to go to China sometime early next year so they will be consulting on that. And there are also some differences to iron out, particularly the French president has been talking about these tax credits for electric vehicles here in the United States.

We really heard there the French president echo what Joe Biden had said in his speech, reminder of course that historic alliance, the fact also that so many of those values principles and against around which they're united in their support of Ukraine were the very foundation of both republics off the French Revolution at the time the American war for independence.The alliance, the friendship is that a lot of focus on that and the fact that this should help them look ahead and get past the hurdles they both acknowledged existed, because of course there was that point of gathering together to support Ukraine. But then there are the consequences of the war. And they're being felt, Bianna, very differently here in Europe than they are in the United States, specifically energy prices. Given how dependent Europe was on Russian supplies of natural gas, it's been is a huge hit. And of course these are issues that matter greatly at a national level. At a time when inflation is high, prices are rising and people are finding it difficult to meet those costs. Electrically for European leaders, these are extremely sensitive issues. For the time being European countries have the stocks that they need to get things through the winter, even if we're all being told to be careful and winter is expected to be chillier than normal in terms of the amount that people could spend on heating themselves. Still, beyond that, as that war drags on, Europe can see itself being penalized in a way that the United States simply isn't. Add to that of course the Inflation Reduction Act that Emmanuel Macron spoke about very forcefully yesterday to congressional leaders saying that it was hugely problematic and in fact risked fragmenting the unity of the west on Ukraine. So this will be at the heart of the discussions that right now are behind the meeting those closed doors. Much less about the alliance, much more about the nitty-gritty of what now divides them and what Europe hopes to see some movement on -- Bianna.",

All 100 senators need to agree to schedule a vote and that is critical given there's little time between now and next week when the strike could almost certainly happen if there is no agreement here.Now what Chuck Schumer, the majority leader has proposed, is to have a vote on the railway agreement that would implement what was agreed to back in September between the railway workers and the industry that was silent on the issue of paid sick leave. But also an amendment that would mandate a week of sick leave for those rail workers. But Republicans also want their own amendment being offered, too, to delay that December 9th deadline to avert a strike for about a month, trying to force the negotiators to the table. But in order to get a schedule on a vote on the underlying agreement and those two amendments, all 100 senators have to agree and there is no agreement yet. Just this morning the number two Democrat, Dick Durbin, indicated that they're still waiting for Republicans to sign off on this deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): I talked to Chuck Schumer this morning about it, and he's still waiting for a sign from Senator McConnell that he's ready for us to call this measure. It takes bipartisanship to get to the measure. It takes bipartisanship to pass it. So we can't do it without the help of Republicans. The Democrats stand ready to back the president. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: But the reason why there is not much time is not just the December 9th deadline but the impacts across the economy could certainly be felt as soon as this weekend if there is not an agreement and a passage of this bill in the Senate. So the senators typically leave on Thursdays which means a lot of pressure to get this done today before they head home for the weekend, guys.",

They did that because they were concerned by adding that, it could actually scuttle the underlying agreement because Republicans support is very limited on this issue.It's unlikely at the moment to get the 10 Republicans that would be necessary in order to meet that 60 vote threshold to pass that amendment to mandate seven days of sick leave. There is some Republican support. In fact Josh Hawley, Republican from Missouri, told me that he will support this amendment. But getting to 10, a different question.

But now a latest poll from Marquette University shows Democrats about evenly split as to whether they want him to run again.But that's up five points from September.

And I got to tell you, the more you look at this, these workers, I think, have a case that would break the hearts of anybody.The big rail industry has been making so much money, billions of dollars in profits even just this past quarter.
