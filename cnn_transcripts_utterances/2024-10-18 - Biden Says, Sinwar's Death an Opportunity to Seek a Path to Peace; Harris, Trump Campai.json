I'll speak with Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project.Good morning on this Friday. I'm Erica Hill in New York in for Jim Acosta. Thanks for joining me in the CNN Newsroom. This morning, gripping new details and videos in the death of Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar. Israeli sources say this was actually just a routine military operation in Southern Gaza at a chance encounter that led to Sinwar being killed. Three militants shot at Israeli forces, and when one of them retreated into a building Israel's military sent in this drone. The video here, pretty remarkable, it actually captures Sinwar's final moments, wounded sitting amid the rubble alone in a chair. He appears to be holding a piece of wood, throws it at the drone. This video from the IDF capturing, of course, the final moments of what was a year- long manhunt. As you can see here, Israeli tanks firing into that building. DNA testing would later confirm the man you just saw sitting in that chair was in fact Sinwar. Now his death has massive implications across the Middle East and certainly when it comes to Israel's war in Gaza. This morning, President Biden meeting with German leaders in Berlin is calling once again for a ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The death of the leader of Hamas represents a moment of justice. He had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands. I told the prime minister of Israel yesterday, let's also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it's certainly a welcome development, especially from the allies that President Biden is meeting with here in Berlin today. All of the U.S.'s allies across Europe have been working feverishly for the last several weeks to not only reach a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon but also for several months to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation has been worsening for the better part of a year.And certainly there is a belief among allies that the U.S., because of its billions of dollars in aid and support that the Biden administration has provided to Israel, that it has the most powerful bully pulpit to potentially nudge Prime Minister Netanyahu now closer to a deal. And U.S. officials are more optimistic that the fact that Netanyahu and Biden appeared to be in agreement in yesterday's phone call, as well as in their public statements, that there's now cautious optimism that perhaps such a diplomatic off ramp is still within reach. But for the Biden administration overall, the jigsaw puzzle here has a lot of potential pieces. Of course, reaching a hostage deal to free those hostages still being held in Gaza is top of mind. But then there are also broader efforts at normalization, and then, of course, diffusing tensions with Iran, where officials say retaliation by Israel is still likely and expected, Erica.",

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly seems to be the direction that he's hinting towards. I mean, he's issued a statement within the past 24 hours saying -- you know, calling on Hamas fighters to surrender, to hand over any hostages that they may be holding, Israeli hostages, there were more than 100 of them, of course, still in the Gaza Strip, and an exchange. He said he'll let them live.And so that's the sort of olive branch that the Israeli prime minister is holding out at a time that I think he says could be a window of opportunity for a change in the negotiations, a change in the wall, possibly the beginning of the end, in his words, of the conflict in Gaza. That's been reflected as we've been reporting by Israeli allies, the United States and others as well. I mean, the problem, Erica, is that the other side of this equation, Hamas, are not playing ball. I mean, there's been a statement from them in the past couple of hours acknowledging for the first time that Yahya Sinwar has indeed been killed by Israeli forces, but it's a very defiant kind of statement saying that there will be an eventual victory for Hamas. Another statement from senior Hamas political leaders saying that the hostages from Israel will never be released until Israel has stopped its aggression against Gaza and against the people of Gaza. And so these aren't the kind of words which indicate that the Hamas group is on the verge of some kind of capitulation to the Israelis. And, of course, that's part of the problem. You know, Sinwar is dead. That's the truth. That's the new truth of the matter. What we don't know is what kind of leadership, how hard line it's going to be, that will take over the group now.",

Matthew Chance, Kayla Tausche, thank you.Also joining me, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, his son, Sigi, is an Israeli American who was kidnapped by Hamas and is still being held in Gaza. Jonathan, it's good to have you here this morning. As all of this is sinking in, I know that you two were somewhat hopeful on the heels of this news yesterday. The fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu said it could be a window of opportunity, how much faith are you putting in that this morning? JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE:  Yes, thank you for having me. Look, it's not really a question of faith. I think, you know, really all sides, including Israel need to act and not just make statements. You know, it was somewhat encouraging, but it shouldn't be a case for Israel or for the intermediaries about what might be possible now. They absolutely have to seize the moment. The world today is different than the world yesterday at this time. The head of the serpent, so to speak, has been cut off. Israel, as its army says, has achieved that war aim of decapitating, degrading Hamas as a military organization, as a governing organization. And so there really are, at least from the Israeli side, no more good excuses for our government to not do everything it must be it through negotiations or other means, barring just pure military action, to get them home. But, again, we've heard a lot of lip service from our prime minister and his ministers about getting hostages home. Now is the time with all the urgency in the world to actually do it.",

And it wasn't just to see some of his friends go back to New York and be able to do Fox and Friends, like he did this morning, he has an opportunity to fix a problem that he has. It ain't about public policy. If you care about one of the major public policies, you've already run to your corner. But the difference with the persuadable voters now is his likability. So, I'm sure his professional team told him to go there, lighten it up, tell some jokes because the dinner itself would not get to those voters, but all the clips after that dinner of him being more lighthearted and trying to land those jokes that he was saying, even though there was reports last night that he was fighting back and didn't want to do those, he wanted to do a campaign speech, but I give him credit, he tried the jokes. They just didn't land because he needs to come off as more likable with these persuadable voters who don't really want to be with Kamala Harris, but they don't think he's likable.

She now gets to go to these events and say, like, I went into the lion's den as it's some sort of badge of honor. Donald Trump does it every day, takes reporters' questions, been on CNN tons of times, not necessarily the most friendly environment. So, good on her for doing it once. She should be doing over and over and over and over again. And, listen, I'll just take issue with one of the things Chuck said about why Trump was there. Look, Trump loves the Catholic faith, loved Catholics in America. He's been attending the dinner for a very, very long time. You noted he made some comments about his sister attending the dinner, his sister being a big support of the archdiocese. He has a personal relationship with Cardinal Dolan. And there's a big distinction here between the two campaigns. The Trump campaign is doing very well amongst catholic voters. You just had the Harris campaign with an incredible faux pas and Trump made kind of light of it at the dinner last night about Governor Gretchen Whitmer giving fake communion and a TikTok video, and which really struck Catholic voters is wrong, and he made a joke about that. So, you know, Trump is actively courting Catholics where Kamala Harris is kind of actively ignoring Catholics by her -- most illustrated by her not showing up at this dinner.",
