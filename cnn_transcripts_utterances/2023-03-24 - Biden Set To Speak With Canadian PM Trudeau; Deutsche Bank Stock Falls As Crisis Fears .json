I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening. Any moment now, President Biden is set to hold a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa. They are expected to highlight their shared ties amid difficult global and geopolitical landscape and they are expected to speak about their joint efforts on issues like supply chains and the opioid crisis. In the last hour, Biden delivered an address to Canada's Parliament. He said, the two countries will always be partners. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. There is no question. Look, when you talk to US officials in the lead up to this 27-hour visit across the border, they made very clear, the President intended to elevate the importance of a relationship that is very long standing, is very critical, and yet sometimes can, at least on the Canadian side, feel somewhat under appreciated. The President very clearly making an effort throughout the course of his remarks to Parliament to try and reverse that as US officials see as a misconception. However, there were threads in that speech that underscored that there are clear challenges in the relationship, challenges that were addressed beforehand in the closed door bilateral meeting and they are pretty significant ones, and they span the array of issues, whether it's the economy, trade, certainly security issues as well, Haiti, which has been a point of tension between the US administration and their Canadian counterparts, trying to figure out pathways forward. Now in advance of the meeting, they did reach an agreement on an immigration proposal that the Canadians have been pushing the White House or the Biden administration for in the weeks leading up to this moment, it didn't seem like they were going to actually get there. They did clinch that agreement, which is important domestically for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. What they came up with on some of the other issues, we're just getting the joint statement right now that we're reading through, but the President making clear that where there are disagreements, where there are challenges, they address them as friends, they address them in an effort to actually work together and find a resolution, not in an adversarial manner, or even in an overarchingly challenging manner. That will be something both leaders are expected to get into at the press conference, obviously, a significant number of questions about both what happened today and just the broader geopolitical landscape, which the President very much wanted to center this visit on given their alliance. Canada is a G7 member country, so we'll see how that goes when they take questions. One thing I would note, these are two leaders that their aides say are genuinely close, do have real warmth to their relationship, call each other \"Joe\" and \"Justin\" and I think you'll probably see that on pretty vivid display here in a little bit -- Zain.",

And US Border Patrol did not do anything to enforce that area and Canada continued to take in migrants directly from the United States into Canada. Our understanding is that that will end, but in exchange, Canada will take at least 15,000 migrants directly from Central and South America, and that was its compromise with the United States. And it really shows the shared common purpose for this visit, these two countries were able to come together and reach a deal not just on migration, but other things having to do with Defense spending, as Phil alluded to. There were issues with how much Canada was spending on Defense and how quickly and it seems that Canada has put more on the table in terms of more money and a quicker timetable. But I think, you know, Zain, one thing is for certain, and perhaps Phil will even agree. You know, when you look at Joe Biden sitting up there in Parliament and giving a speech, there is probably no friendlier place and that includes Congress. He is among friends. He feels the comfort of being able to do that. And that likely made it possible to have so many policy deliverables today. I can tell you, US administration officials kept our expectations quite low for weeks, and what we will now hear from the press conference is more substantial that we were thinking even in terms of Haiti, of aid to Haiti, even though that aid will not include Canadian boots on the ground, but we continue to await that press conference that Phil is at right now.",

In the meantime, other stories that we are following: Global banking concerns spread to Deutsche Bank on Friday, as shares closed eight-and-a- half percent lower in Europe. It dragged down other bank stocks and the broader markets as well. The DAX closed down about 1.6 percent and the CAC 40 fell 1.74 percent. Deutsche Bank's slide follows problems at Credit Suisse, which has since been taken over by UBS. In the US, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have rattled the market as well. EU leaders tried to calm investor nerves. The heads of 27 EU countries met in Brussels earlier. They said in a statement that the banking sector is resilient and that it has strong capital and liquidity positions. Speaking earlier, German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz said he has no concern about the health of Deutsche Bank. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator):   The banking system is stable in Europe and the European Union, and the Eurozone has regulatory structures in various areas, which implemented strict rules and that paid off. It puts us in a situation where we can say that the European banking regulators and the financial system are robust and stable. Deutsche Bank is thoroughly reorganized and modernized its business model, and it is a very profitable bank. There is no reason for concern whatsoever. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Credit default swaps, they are the insurance of debt against default, surged really thisweek really over the last three days and so, we've seen this big falls in share prices in terms of Deutsche Bank being down at everything at 14 percent at one stage. It has pared back some of its losses. It closed the day down eight-and-a- half percent, but the big head scratcher really is why is Deutsche Bank being punished more than most of the sector today? Now, this is a bank that we have spoken a lot about in the past, it was a very troubled bank. In 2016, for example, the IMF actually dubbed it the world's riskiest bank. There were scandals. It needed a huge restructure, but Olaf Scholz is right, it has come out the other end of that. This is a bank that has returned to profit. So why is this bank being punished? And I think this goes to the issue we've seen for the last few weeks really, ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, I think it comes down to confidence and a complete collapse of that and investors looking at which is the next weak link. Credit Suisse was a very weak link and it buckled under this sort of pressure.",

It also had very long dated Treasuries on its balance sheet.It didn't undergo annual stress tests, like many of the big European banks do, and all it took was a bank run for it to have to sell some of those Treasuries at a loss, and then you had a real crisis on your hands and more people pulled their money out, and you've got a big bank run. In Europe, it's a bit different. With Credit Suisse, there was a crisis of confidence, largely based on the fact that this was a bank that had so many scandals under its belt and wasn't profitable, and was in the midst of a big restructure. So any kind of issue with investor confidence was going to drag that bank down. Now, we are looking at just the contagion effect, and what is so interesting is we've had so many messages now from Central Bank Governors, from governments, from regulators stating that these banks undergo very strict checks in Europe, all of them undergo an annual stress test, all of them have to meet very strict capital and liquidity requirements. But if confidence gets so weak, and people pull all of their money out of a bank, well, any bank will struggle with that.

It is possible that more needs to be done by Europe as a whole in terms of ensuring deposits, maybe that's what it will take at this stage, but it might just be another choppy day of trade and Deutsche Bank just happens to be being pummeled the worse and I'm sure we'll get more of this next week, so it doesn't seem to be over yet.",

It's more about investors getting comfortable with headwinds facing specific banks with idiosyncratic issues. You know, there are some commonalities there, but this is not systemic, and I think that's important to stress. What we have going for us is policymakers that are very sensitive to the risks, they really have been ever since Central Banks began their aggressive tightening policies. We're really three for three -- the Bank of England stepped in last fall, and really worked quickly to stem the crisis around a UK gilt yields and pensions. And then of course, we saw the United States step in and essentially create a new credit facility and do everything it could to address the problems among some regional banks, and of course, we saw the Swiss National Bank step in last week. So we have policymakers that stand at the ready to perform, to create effective policies to target issues, and I think that that's really the key takeaway, just we need to keep stressing it because it is a competence issue.",

And so they have changed their guidance going forward. So that suggests to me a sensitivity to the fact that they may need to stop hiking rates, they may need to do that now. So certainly, I think policy tools that are targeted at directly stopping the issue or addressing the issue at hand is important, but I think also that realization that they may need to stop hiking, and they may even need to start cutting rates, that is the other part of the equation.",

Some of it was peaceful, much of it was peaceful, but it was those extraordinary images of the rubbish being set alight, the barricades going up, the scuffles with police that have of course, been quite shocking ever since that march took place. What we're expecting over the course of next few days are more of those spontaneous small scale protests that we've seen for much of the last week. But the size of yesterday's demonstration, the anger of parts of it, the violence of some of it, really have I think, prompted the government this morning to make that call to Buckingham Palace to suggest Emmanuel Macron said out of common sense that the visit should be postponed. And this of course, ever since the unions announcing that the next big day, the 10th day of planned protests and strike action will now come on Tuesday with no doubt a repetition of some of those scenes we've seen today, and bear in mind that Paris is really not looking its best. There are some 10,000 tons of garbage still out there on the streets of the French capital. It's seen better times. I think, all of that taken together was just considered that the disconnect as well between the images of a State Visit, Emmanuel Macron has contested as he is right now, holding a State Visit for King Charles III was just too out of touch really with what we're seeing on the streets of Paris. And again, that anger really focused on the person of the President, who has for a long time been described by his detractors, by unions, by those on many sides of the political spectrum as representing really only the rich. That is the criticism that he is really been lobbying for ever since the yellow vests. And this time as well, the main criticism of many people is that this particular reform, they say, will penalize the blue collar workers more and that is part of the protest movement. You see it in the placards. You hear it in the chants. You hear it when you speak to people. And I think that disconnect between the demands and the view that they have of Macron, combined with what we can imagine the State Visit would have looked like suddenly didn't seem like a terribly good idea -- Zain.",

On this side over here, you see protesters with Palestinian flag. They're increasingly concerned about the uptick in violence in the region about the increasingly deadly raids by the Israeli military. And this is not unusual. You would expect anytime the Israeli Prime Minister visits London to see a protest like this. What is unusual is this demonstration right here. To see protesters, we the Israeli flags demonstrating against the visit of an Israeli Prime Minister. That is unusual. But they tell us they're echoing the sentiments that they're hearing on the ground in Israel. Hundreds of thousands of people who take into the street in recent months outrage at a judicial overhaul legislation that's being pushed by Prime Minister Netanyahu that these protesters tell us will threaten Israel's democracy. Will erode the checks and balances of that country. Will game Prime Minister Netanyahu autocratic-like powers in these protesters tell it what they want to see is Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speak up and speak out against the happening on the ground. And use this opportunity, use this three-day visit to really condemn Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions and the push for this judicial overhaul. But I can tell you, that is unlikely to happen. The U.K. and Israel signed a trade agreement, a new trade agreement just a few days ago. So, these protesters aren't too hopeful that there's going to be condemnation coming from 10 Downing Street. They say Prime Minister Rishi sunnah is going to carry on with business as usual. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
