We see him on the video. He's at the car with the door open. He's getting something out of the car. Now, the police are going on alert now, which is, he sees the police are here, he's getting something out of the car. What is that? The first officer says, show me your hands. What does he do with this object? He goes behind his back. He's shifting it from hand to hand. He then cups it in one hand, and he moves towards the officer who's saying, show me your hands. Pivots left towards the other officer. Now, the first officer is holding a taser, that's a non-lethal weapon. That's bright yellow. He runs towards the officer who is holding the gun, which is the lethal weapon. And then in the last frame that we saw on our video, notice he -- he's got his hands cupped together, extended forward, as if he has a weapon and he's charging at her when she fires. Remember in the background, what do we see? We see a little boy and a woman with a laundry cart moving very slowly, so that's another issue. So, it's an incident that happened very fast. Nobody involved in that incident, particularly these two officers got to play it back on slow motion while it was happening. They're making instant decisions.

Most of these incidents, the person has a weapon, but in -- somewhere between 20 and 36 percent of these incidents it's a fake weapon. It's a simulated weapon.

Just to remind our viewers, so he was originally charged, as you mentioned, with involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. That charge was dropped. The law enforcement source told me that that's because investigators discovered that the gun that was used in that shooting had been modified.Now, I will read you part of what the prosecutors said in a filing in June. This is so important. They wrote that, the charges against Alec Baldwin were dismissed without prejudice because of possible malfunction of the gun. If it is determined that the gun did not malfunction, charges against Mr. Baldwin will proceed. Now, the FBI looked at that and initially said that, look, it could not have gone off if someone did not pull the trigger. What state officials did in New Mexico was send this to an independent examiner who, essentially, came to the same conclusion of the FBI. I'll read you part of their new report that we just got our hands on. They say that, Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings, and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver. So, on one hand we have prosecutors saying that, look, if this report determines that the gun did malfunction, we're going to charge Alec Baldwin. We're now learning the report says just that.
