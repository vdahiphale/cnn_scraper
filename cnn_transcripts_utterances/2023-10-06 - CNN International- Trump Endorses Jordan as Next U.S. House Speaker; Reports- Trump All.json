Of course, his flame throwing brand of politics as well as the fact that he's the face of the Biden impeachment inquiry is going to be a tough sell among vulnerable members, particularly in those districts that were won by Joe Biden. And one GOP lawmaker who's a lot -- a moderate told CNN that he is not anxious to support Jordan's and that challenge is that he built the monster that's part of the problem.And remember, Jordan was a cofounding member of the Freedom Caucus, which was home to many of the members that ultimately voted to oust Kevin McCarthy. But Jim Jordan knows he has his work cut out for him. He has been making calls specifically trying to win over those moderates and part of his pitch, I'm told, is that he is the best position to try to unite the conference, in part because he has the ear and respect of that Freedom Caucus. And one other group I would look out for is the moderate members who were loyal to Kevin McCarthy. Because a lot of bud, bud between Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, the other Republican who's running, has happened over the years. And Jim Jordan was really a loyal ally of Kevin McCarthy, particularly in January during the speakers race. And so that could really go a long way in convincing at least some of these members to get behind Jim Jordan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well be sure to catch Christiane's full interview with Hillary Clinton, airing Monday on Amanpour. That's 1There are damning new reports about Donald Trump's handling of classified information after you left the White House. ABC News and \"The New York Times\" cite sources who say the former president allegedly discussed details about U.S. nuclear submarines with a member of his Mar-a-Lago club months after leaving the White House. That person is Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt, who then shared the information with dozens of other people, including foreign officials and journalists. Trump reportedly shared details on how many nuclear warheads U.S. submarines can carry and how close they can get to Russian submarines without being detected. CNN has confirmed that federal investigators have interviewed Pratt, and it could be a witness in Trump's classified documents trial. But the allegations were not included in special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump. A Trump spokesperson, put out a statement saying: These illegal leaks are coming from sources which totally lack proper context and relevant information. The Department of Justice should investigate the criminal leaking instead of perpetrating their baseless witch hunts while knowing that President Trump did nothing wrong, has always insisted on truth and transparency and acted in a proper manner according to the law. Australia's former ambassador to the U.S. is downplaying the alleged breach. He says Australian service members have been serving on American submarines for years and the countries share weapons technology. But CNN military analyst Lieutenant General Mark Hertling tells Anderson Cooper there's still a lot at risk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: He knew exactly the kind of information that has been given to others. They can certainly take steps to try and fence the information, fence the capabilities, sense the type of secrets that have been given away. That's happened multiple times. We look at spies that have given information to foreign governments and there's that reaction of the intelligence community or the military or the State Department to try and mitigate the risk that concur with this. But you never expected out of a president. I mean, he's giving secrets to people and carrying secrets into his home where, you know, everyone that that is read in to classify document signs a piece of paper that says I will not divulge this because each of these secrets have something to do with national security and divulging it could cause either grave or serious harm to the United States. And it appears that there have been incidents with President Trump just willy nilly giving that because he wants to appear big. You know, there have been times on CNN where you all have asked me questions that I've known the answer to because of my background and because of secret information I had. But I'm not going to give it up. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Ukraine says  a three story residential building was destroyed in Kharkiv whilst two more buildings were damaged. Nine people were wounded in the attack, which also started a fire that was eventually put out.Meanwhile, Ukraine is also reporting a massive drone attack on its Odesa region. The drones sent -- or set several vehicles on fire and damaged port infrastructure on the Danube River, which Ukraine uses for grain exports. All that is coming on the heels of one of Russia's most horrific attacks since the war began. Kyiv says a Russian missile hit the village of Hroza, on Thursday, killing at least 51 people. It happened whilst the victims were holding a wake for a fallen Ukrainian soldier. President Zelenskyy, who attended a meeting of European leaders in Spain, pleaded for more air defenses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I believe that today it is impossible to protect people, especially during the winter, except by air defense. To protect people who died absolutely tragically because of this inhuman terrorist attack. 50 civilians were killed during the funeral. Russia does this every day in the Kharkiv region and only air defense can help. And so, Europe has a lot of its own issues, different challenges. But from Ukraine's point of view, the key topic was air defense. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I think what we're seeing here is a consistent pattern. You know, when the drone -- when they Russians first began using drones, they had a limited supply. They got 400 or so from Iran. But we now know that  with Iranian help, they're manufacturing themselves.So you're seeing consistently today, 33, 25 of them shot down by the Ukrainians. So you're seeing this consistently growing larger number of drones coming in and consistently again targeting the grain export facilities in the town of Izmail on the Danube but also shutting down the ferry across the Danube to Romania. Awfully close to Romania, and that's been giving Romanian politicians a great deal of concern as well. But I think what you see when you see that strike and Kharkiv and some new numbers have come in now and the casualty toll has actually gone up there now significantly to 23 people and one 10-year-old boy killed in that strike, 11-year-old baby injured there. That's quite close to the that big strike yesterday. So again, it's about Russia putting this psychological pressure on the northeast of the country where they've been trying to press against that frontline. And of course, Russia right now is looking to test Ukraine and see where they are other -- where they're not willing to fire a lot of ammunition because they're concerned about supplies maybe not coming in. So I think I think the picture when you look at it is this consistent, increasingly consistent and higher number of drones being used effective at shooting some of them down. But to what Zelenskyy said yesterday and to what U.S. Secretary of Defense said a couple of weeks ago when meeting with allies and partners about supplies for Ukraine, air defense, air defense, air defense, that's the critical thing --",

In fact, the ceremony was breaking up when this drone attack happened. The Syrian Arab News Agency -- that's the official news agency of the Syrian government -- is putting the death toll now at 89. Among them, 31 women and five children who, of course, were family members and the relatives of those who were graduating at that ceremony. The current number of injured has put at 277.Now the U.K. based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that as many as 123 people were killed in this drone strike. However, at this point, neither of these numbers, the claims can be verified. Now, it's presumed that the drones were launched from Idlib province in the northwest of the country, which is controlled by a variety of opposition groups -- although none of them have claimed responsibility. And the Syrian government has announced three days of mourning and flags to be flown at half mast as well. And of course the Syrians are vowing revenge on the what they call the terrorist group or groups that were behind this attack. And as you mentioned, we've seen a series of Syrian government strikes on the northeast -- or northwest of the country, killing as many as 12 civilians. In addition to Turkish drone strikes on Kurdish targets in the northeast. And of course, it's important to keep in mind that Syria is the battleground for a variety of international forces. In addition to the Syrian government, there are Russian troops, American troops, Iranian advisers, fighters from Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes on Syrian targets. So this is definitely a country which doesn't get much attention in the news these days, but it's very much the seen for what is essentially a proxy war between a variety of regional and international powers -- Max.",
