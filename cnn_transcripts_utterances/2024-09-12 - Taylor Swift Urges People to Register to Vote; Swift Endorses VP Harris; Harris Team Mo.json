Well, let's just point out something that I have been noting all along during this campaign, and that is the underperformance that both Joe Biden and now even Kamala Harris has among young voters.All right. So, this is the Democrat versus Trump margin among voters age 18 to 29 or under the age of 30. You go back four years ago at this point. Look, Joe Biden had a 28-point advantage. A 28-point advantage over Donald Trump. Now, you look when Joe Biden dropped out of the race, he was up by just seven points. Now, Kamala Harris has improved on Joe Biden's standing. But look at this. She's only up by 15 points. That is significantly less than Joe Biden was up at this point among the youngest voters in our electorate. It's only about half the margin that Joe Biden was pulling in. So, Kamala Harris will absolutely welcome in the support of Taylor Swift if she can move young voters at all. Because the bottom line is Kamala Harris is, in fact, not doing as well among young voters as you might expect a Democrat to necessarily be doing based upon history.",

And what we're going to do here is look at the Democratic advantage over Republicans in voter registration. This is party registration registering as a Democrat, a Republican or unaffiliated.Look, if you go back to September of 2020, look, among active voters in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So, Democrats, look at that, a 559,000 voter edge over Republicans. You jump now. Look, Democrats still have an edge. But look how much that's dropped. It's now just 169,000. We're talking about the Republicans closing the gap by nearly 400,000 voters in just a four-year time span. You go to North Carolina, it's the same exact trend, right? You go back to September of 2020, you see Democrats with a 415,000 voter edge, and now they still hold an edge, but it's just 128,000. And of course, both of these states were determined by less than 100,000 voters back in 2020. So, the bottom line is Republicans have been doing a significantly better job of registering voters than Democrats have been doing over the last four years and getting folks to switch over from Democratic registration to Republican registration. So, yes, Kamala Harris would definitely welcome the idea if Taylor Swift could bring in some more younger voters, Democratic leaning voters in the electorate. Because the bottom line is Republicans have been doing a heck of a lot better job of registering voters than Democrats have over the last four years.",

Hillary Clinton did that, didn't work out as well. But there is this kind of masculinist approach where you're going to what's called the manosphere, which is a bunch of podcasts that are really aimed at men. He's trying to get -- bring in a lot of the so-called bro culture, and it does to have an effect.A lot of young men are saying that they don't feel the Democratic Party sees him in a good light. They think the Democratic Party sees all men as being, quote/unquote, \"toxic.\" And that's starting to have an effect. And so, I think Kamala Harris has an opportunity to make up some ground here because I know her personally, nobody more enthusiastic about young men being successful than a former prosecutor.

It happened with tanks, it happens with HIMARS, ATACMS, F-16s, and now, the ability to use some of those weapon systems, particularly the ATACMS long-range missile system inside of Russia.And it's a battle, right, because this administration is concerned about escalation with Russia, specifically that this becomes a conflict between the U.S. and Russia as opposed to between Ukraine, backed by the U.S. and its allies, and Russia. And you have these various little decision points here, right? Like, will Russia read this system as so advanced and the use of this system to attack Russian territory as, in effect, a U.S. attack on Russian territory? That's been the issue. Now, the criticism, and you're seeing it now from, for instance, within the president's own party, Jeanne Shaheen, but also, close U.S. allies, is that they've worried about that with every weapons system come around to providing that weapon system, it's helped Ukraine and it hasn't led to an escalation. So, you do have criticism from some inside the U.S. alliance that this has been a slow process. Here's Senator Jeanne Shaheen saying, in light of Putin's increasingly horrific attacks on civilian targets, it's time to lift restrictions on the use of long-range U.S.-provided weapons to allow Ukraine to reach high value Russian military targets. The point being there, right, Russia is certainly using its territory to rain down missiles, not just on military targets in Ukraine, but on people, right? Civilian infrastructure. It's killing civilians in their homes, kids, families in their homes. So, the argument is, why put these handcuffs on them, right? And I'll just tell you, John, it was interesting to see the U.S. secretary of state next to the Polish foreign minister just a few minutes ago, where Secretary Blinken said, OK, we've always been adapting, we may adapt again here. The Polish foreign minister said, hey, we've always thought it's OK for Ukraine to use weapons on Russia to stop war crimes, right? I mean, that's not mincing words. They're saying Russia's, you know, devastating Ukraine in so many ways. They shouldn't have to face these kinds of restrictions. So, this is the latest chapter in a long story.",
