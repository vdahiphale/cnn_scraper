But first, let me tell you about what was unfolding right here in this Baltimore neighborhood last night when shots rang out. It was supposed to be a very familiar scene, something we're seeing all across the country right now.People were gathered for a block party. People were having a cookout, gathering celebrating the holiday weekend, and that is when police say that shots rang out shortly after midnight. Tragically, two young people are dead, including an 18-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man, and dozens more were injured in the chaos. They are recuperating at local area hospitals. Now we've been here on the scene for a few hours, and I have been watching as police officials are still combing the area, going little by little, every step around the sidewalk, in the glass here collecting evidence, talking to people. The mayor and local elected officials have also been here talking to people who live here. This is a public housing complex, and the mayor told us earlier this morning that this is a community that has been through a lot in recent years. But for that same reason, they have also done a lot of work and they've come very, very far. And so they celebrate that, that is what they were doing here last night. Because they've made progress in recent years, the mayor is pleading with residents here to come forward and share any information they might have about this incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT (D), BALTIMORE: I want the parents and the brother and the sister and the children of the people who pulled the trigger to be the ones to say \"they did this\" because we all have to treat this incident like it was our own family members who lost their lives, who was shot in this incident. That is how we should be treating this incident. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Some will agree, some won't agree with it, but you have to understand that training with everything that is going on his country, we are trying to make sure that police officers are operating in a space that is legal and they are following policy, and they are doing what they're supposed to do. A training academy, a state-of-the-art training academy, in my opinion, is 100 percent needed.

Portions of that road and another interstate were shut down as floodwaters moved in. Fortunately, I-55 has since been reopened, but the National Weather Service is asking people to limit their travel. A scheduled NASCAR event on the city streets and a Chicago Cubs game are now delayed because of these conditions. And this flooding in Chicago right now is part of a storm system that has millions at risk of severe weather this holiday weekend. You see all of that yellow in the center of the map. From the Rockies to the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, people are expecting damaging winds, hail, and potential tornadoes as well today. It comes as dangerous heat continues for some 63 million people along the Gulf Coast. Meteorologist, Allison Chinchar has been following this from the CNN Weather Center in Atlanta. She filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: That's right, Boris. Over a hundred million people are under the threat for severe weather for today across two separate areas. However, the threats remain the same. We are talking damaging winds, the potential for some hail and we cannot rule out the possibility for some tornadoes. We're talking cities like Nashville, Louisville, stretching over to Washington, DC, and even down towards Atlanta. There is also the potential for some flooding because a lot of these areas had rained yesterday, and now, we are getting it all over again, especially portions of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. But even areas of the southeast are still likely to pick up some additional rain showers today, and then, all of this begins to shift a little bit further eastward for tomorrow. So still dealing with some areas of rain across the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and down to the Southeast, but we also have a separate area here across the Midwest for Monday. But the threats themselves remain the same, still talking damaging winds and hail to be the main threat. Another concern going forward is actually going to be the heat not just for today, but really over the next several days in two different areas of the country, one across the Southeast, where we have heat advisories in effect and some excessive heat warnings out to the West. This is where temperatures could exceed the 110s or even possibly get into the 120s especially across Death Valley. Temperatures here are expected to continue to rise into Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, even stretching as far north as Oregon and Washington where we do have the potential to break some records. In fact, Boris, over 30 cities have the potential to break some records, not just maybe today and tomorrow, but well into Tuesday and Wednesday of the upcoming week as well. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The one thing I'll ask as my heart continues to ache for not only this community, but for those who would have been impacted is for folks who have information, come forward. Don't just rely on the Baltimore Police Department and our federal partners to solve this crime. These are events that are about celebration, about coming together, that are intergenerational, and should be sacred to our communities. And when a few decide to go and literally create a mass shooting, it is completely unacceptable, and I ask folks in our community to step up, whether they are your sons, your son's friends, your neighbors, folks that you know online, information that you think you might have, please ensure that you do the right thing, particularly for the victims who have lost their lives and their families who will forever be impacted by this particular day.",

This cannot -- cannot -- be the society that we are expected to live in. We have to do better. We've done what we've could at the state level to try and find ways for it to be harder to get guns into people's hands, but this is the problem with too many guns in too many hands of people that make life and death decisions. It is not okay. Something has to give. This isn't how I anticipated this Sunday. For the 28 families that were directly impacted, I am so unbelievably sorry; to the hundreds that witnessed it and who will forever be changed, I'm sorry. And for the thousands and thousands of Marylanders who on this day will have to think about the mass shooting that occurred here in Baltimore, this isn't sustainable. Something has to give.

He talked about gun manufacturers and accountability at every level. He said, \"We will find those responsible and bring them to justice.\" On that point, the acting police commissioner, Richard Worley asked for the public's help.

He said that this is not just a Baltimore problem, and not just a city problem. He said that this is a problem across the entire nation. And as you mentioned, he focused on the issue of gun violence. And he said he wants this mass shooting to be treated as any other mass shooting across America, and I thought that that was striking because you know, all day we've been hearing about this community and whether or not there have been problems here in the past, but he said this community has actually made a lot of progress, and he is encouraging them to come forward and share any information. Police said that they are still combing through the evidence, combing through the videos. They also confirmed they now know it was more than one shooter.

I made a normal call to Governor Ducey to determine what was going on, no pressure. So Pence is campaigning against the former president.

Remember, the January 6 Committee has made criminal referrals here, including the pressure campaign on the states. The former president is also alleged to have pressured the Department of Justice, to have procured false electoral slates, to have pressed Pence, and when Pence wouldn't go along to have incited or given aid and comfort to an insurrection, the special counsel is looking at all of that, and this report about pressing Governor Ducey fits into that pattern. The January 6 committee has said, it presents overwhelming evidence. I do think it is a strong case and that the special counsel is likely to charge the former president.",

It's typical in criminal cases that prosecutors attempt to secure the cooperation, often, the cooperation of those who themselves are very high up in an alleged criminal scheme.After Donald Trump, Giuliani is one of those who appears based on the publicly available evidence to be most culpable. Typically, in this situation, this kind of initial conversation, what we call a proffer is followed by immunity. Often, if you have a culpable individual, by a plea bargain, so we'll need to see what happens next with Mr. Giuliani.
