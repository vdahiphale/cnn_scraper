The report concludes a yearslong probe of the Florida Republican on allegations, including sex trafficking and drug use. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing. CNN's Tom Foreman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FMR. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  It is a horrible allegation and it is a lie. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Having sex with a teenager, paying for sex, using illicit drugs, accepting improper gifts and dispensing special favors, those are just some of the accusations that have swirled around the former Florida congressman. Matt Gaetz has always denied them, saying political enemies and even extortionists have pushed the claims.",

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  A member of Congress wanted me to stop an Ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old. Did he do it or not? I don't know. But Ethics is looking at it.

Authorities are still trying to nail down the shooter's motive, but information is now coming out about her family life. Court documents show that her parents were divorced and remarried multiple times, and that she moved between their homes every two or three days. \"The Washington Post\" reporting those details. There's also this photo from her dad's Facebook of her at a gun range in August. Authorities aren't sure how she got hold of a weapon to carry out the attack, but, as law enforcement investigates, the community is mourning. Hundreds of people gathered outside the Wisconsin state capitol last night for a vigil and to express their grief. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These incidents continue to happen week after week, month after month, year after year, decade after decade. And, sometimes, you ask yourself, when will this stop? When this incident happened, I was on the road traveling back from out of town. And I was just broken, and started getting phone calls from parents and kids, and decided that we would hold a community vigil and bring people together to start the healing process in our community. Yesterday, about 600 people came to the vigil. We wanted to make sure that we prayed for those that was impacted by this and wanted to just bring everybody together to start the healing process in our city.",

One of our community partners who was a former mayor was at the vigil last night. And I watched his daughter, who goes to that school. And she was in tears. And then there was a grandmother who -- a child that we buried right here in this community by the name of Anisa Scott was killed in gun violence. And her grandmother whispered in my ear yesterday and said: \"My sibling\" -- her siblings -- \"My grandbabies are afraid to go to school.\" And so this has really not only impacted the kids and the staff at that school, but it's impacted kids and families throughout our city. We're going to try to do everything that we can to lend a helping hand and then utilize our lives and let our kids know that we love them. And enough is enough.

      "sentences": "Well, this morning, we are breaking down the science behind brain rot and the impact excessive phone use can have on your brain.Be honest with yourself. Are you guilty of that? I know sometimes I can be guilty of it, especially when I look at usage on my phone at the end of the week. Earlier this week, we asked you to submit your questions about what overconsumption of online content can do to our bodies, our brains. Now CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is on call and back to answer your questions. All right, Sanjay, so we saw a lot of versions of the first question. Anne asks: \"What to do if you think you or your child is addicted?\" DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, a lot of questions about this. And I will answer in part as someone who's reported on this for some time, also a student of the brain, but mostly Pamela as a father of three teenage daughters. I mean, it's something that we think about all the time. First of all, just the term addicted. A lot of people don't like to use this word in part because the strategy for addiction is often abstinence. Stop doing whatever it might be that you're addicted to. Just not possible with these devices, whether you're a kid or an adult. We're very dependent on them, but they can become problematic, which is a real concern. And some of the things that people look for, is it interfering with your daily life? Is it interfering with your sleep? If you're a kid, is it interfering with your grades? One thing that a lot of experts in this area point out is that these devices and social media is often used as a way to self-soothe or self-care. And it sort of gets at these bigger questions, I think, for parents. Why is your kid needing the self-soothing? Is there something else that can be done? So it's a big issue. It's a growing issue. I think for a lot of people, there are some practical ways to approach it. Catherine Price, who's thought a lot about this, written a book about it, she says, every time you pick up your phone, you should essentially ask yourself three questions:  What for? Why did I just pick this up? Why now? And what else? What else could I be doing? I think it's interesting because it just creates a break in your thinking so that you're not just mindlessly picking up the phone. Also, another practical thing -- again, I say this as a parent -- is that you can set up time limits on your kids' phones. You can set up time limits in terms of how much they can use it, but also the hours at which they can use it, so making sure, for example, it's not keeping them up at night. It's a struggle. It's a balance, I will tell you, having gone through this, because kids are -- again, they're dependent on it sometimes for their own studying and for their own interactions with their classmates. So you got to find that balance.",
