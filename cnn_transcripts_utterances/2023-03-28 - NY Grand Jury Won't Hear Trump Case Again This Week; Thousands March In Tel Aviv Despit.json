So, the next time that they will take up -- but will not be hearing evidence on the Trump related case this week. The next time they will take that up will be Monday.So, the grand jury, which normally meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, we know they were in yesterday. They heard from David Pecker, the former chairman of \"The National Enquirer.\" They're not meeting on Wednesday and they will be in on Thursday, but they won't be hearing any Trump-related investigations. So, the next time that there will be an opportunity for them to either hear additional evidence or potentially if the DA Alvin Bragg decides to go forward to seek charges, they could be hearing evidence related to then be asked to take a vote on the indictment as soon as Monday. So, at this point, we're not expecting any other activity related to the Trump investigation by the grand jury this week -- Boris, Bianna.",

      "sentences": "Thousands went on strike yesterday, which prompted the Prime Minister to delay votes on the overhaul and allow time for debate. But one thing Netanyahu made clear is that this pause is only temporary.Meantime the country's largest labor union is threatening to strike again if the legislation is revived. Dennis Ross is a former U.S. envoy to the Middle East, and he's a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Dennis, it's great to have you on. So, a pause from Netanyahu, but he also made clear yesterday that he believes this overhaul is in fact necessary and he only got the sign off from the far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, when he was promised the role of really essentially controlling the country's National Guard. So given that do you think that this will be something that protesters will accept? DENNIS ROSS, FORMER U.S. ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST: I think the protesters are going to watch and see what actually happens right now. And by that I mean, is there a dialogue a serious dialogue that takes place today? President Herzog posted both the government and the opposition together for the first time directly. There were indirect talks before under his aegis, never direct talks. I think you're going to find those who've been leading the protests, they want to see how real is this dialogue. Many question whether it will be real. I suspect actually, it will be. And I think the reason I say that is because, you know, we are seeing unprecedented action like we've never seen before. Reservists won't report for duty. You're looking at the largest labor federation, the Histadrut, agreeing with the leaders of the banking and the business sector for the first time ever to have a general strike. Universities shut down. All this came together and I think that's one of the reasons I think that Netanyahu made the decision to do a pause. I think so long as people perceive this to be a genuine dialogue, they may not stop demonstrations generally because they're going to want to keep some leverage. But I think they're going to wait and see what happens.",
