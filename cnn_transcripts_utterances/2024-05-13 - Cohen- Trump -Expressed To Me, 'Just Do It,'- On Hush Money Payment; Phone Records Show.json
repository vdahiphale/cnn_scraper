Meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out.\" This is really dramatic testimony. And Cohen said he spoke to Allen Weisselberg at the time, telling him that he had the ability to do so and asked if AMI could then pay Daniels. This is really the core of the entire issue here. He's made a series of damning statements about Trump, saying that he was concerned only about the affair allegations hurting his 2016 campaign, not his family or his marriage. At one point, allegedly asking Cohen how long he'd be on the market if Melania Trump let him go. We're joining -- joined now by David Schoen. He was former President Trump's attorney during the second impeachment trial. David, welcome. I wonder what you make of the fact that Michael Cohen is testifying today. He has landed some punches. Of course, this is direct testimony, not the cross. And that's obviously going to be ahead. What has struck you from what you've learned today?",

And the prosecution recognizes that he can make or break their case with Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen, on the other hand, also -- not on the other hand, thesame end -- is a savvy guy. He has a real agenda. He hates Donald Trump for a number of reasons. And you can be sure that he really prepared for this. As you said, it's direct testimony. Cross-examination by any halfway decent lawyer would be absolutely devastating. But I'm not sure it's enough just to make Michael Cohen a bad guy. Because he's coming in with a lot of details. The problem for witnesses like Michael Cohen -- one of the problems I think, besides other prior inconsistent statements and other credibility -- credibility attacks, is he goes a little too far. I don't know that the jury is going to believe when he says Melania Trump finding out about this wasn't a concern to Donald Trump. Now, if they've already heard witnesses about how close the relationship was. Stand in the window and wave to her and that sort of thing. So the problem is witnesses like this go a little too far, try to make the case. And I'll wrap it up one second. I think that the prosecution feels in this case, given what's going on so far, that they really need Michael Cohen to make out the number of elements -- elements of their case. And so I think he's going to address all of those things.",

It was no concern of a husband whether or not his wife was bothered by any of the allegations.Again, there's also a political angle today, is there not, that unhappy wife or one that might be vocal about her unhappiness about the allegations, could pose a political problem. Let me just focus one thing you said. I think people often are hearing about the animus and the bias and the hate. Is it useful to the prosecution to try to compartmentalize and say, look, yes, he hates him now. Yes, there's the animus now. But at the time, when this was done, to where we're actually looking at, here is the point they want the jury to look at. And this is the time when he was the ultimate people pleaser.

He is serving, I think, until July of this year for really a case separate from this.But he was talking about who should pay this money. Weisselberg expressed some concern because he had some obligations for his grandchildren and beyond. And Cohen said that he and Weisselberg told Trump that Cohen was going to front the money for it to which he was appreciative. And Cohen said, Trump stated to me, \"Don't worry, you'll get the money back.\" So were at the point in time, while were talking about, to your point, the larger issue, not whether there was, in fact, an alleged affair or whether the Daniels allegations were truthful, but whether there was a falsification of the business records. And before I let you go, on this point I do wonder how you would approach a cross of, say, a Michael Cohen compared to a Stormy Daniels. In both instances, the defense wants to prove them to be liars. If it comes to Stormy Daniels, her being a liar means a wildcard that might incentivize you to pay her off. For Cohen, they're going to use the line to try to make their case. How do you approach differently?",

And things that have transpired since, they've colored his testimony today.But with Cohen, I think the focus really must be on the specifics of the prior inconsistent statements. And not only that, he made those prior inconsistent statements when he had a real incentive to hurt Donald Trump and to help himself, if he could at the time. And notwithstanding that incentive -- in other words, he was told by his lawyer, if you have anything on Donald Trump, now is the time to do it. You've said you don't want to go to jail for even a day, give them Donald Trump, to the feds, for example, first up. And he just couldn't do it, because he said it wasn't true. And so I think they would go into that. That's what he said to his lawyer at the time. And then waived privilege.

Defense attorneys, again, argued this is to protect his family. Prosecutors arguing this is all done in an effort to help him win the White House, which is why falsifying business records, which has -- we haven't actually gotten to that part, yet -- it is being charged as a felony. But back to this point about Allen Weisselberg, it is something that prosecutors are going to have to address with the jury. If there were three people involved in this alleged conspiracy, why haven't we heard from one of them? And of course, we know it's complicated. Now, Cohen has said he sent an email to Davidson, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, to show we're moving forward with the deal and to ensure that she gets paid.
