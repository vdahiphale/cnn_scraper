But what does this mean for the war in Ukraine, does anything change?KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): You know, very chummy, very performative. That's the key question that you just raised and the answer at the moment is no. Look, in Moscow we saw the leaders of China and Russia perform, pose as peace brokers, they were playing up and touting China's plan for peace in Ukraine. As reported, this is a plan that calls for the end of sanctions. It calls for a ceasefire, calls for talks. It does not include any call for Russia to withdraw from occupied territory, it was drawn up without the involvement of the Ukrainians. It has been roundly criticized by the West, again criticized by the U.S. and NATO. And overnight, we also heard from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who added that a ceasefire was not in his country's interest. Now, in addition to the overtures that we witness for peace in Ukraine and Moscow, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, they also emphasize their ever-deepening relationship and it was on full display at the start of the state dinner on Tuesday, the two leaders raised the glass for a toast and that we heard from Putin, he proclaimed that Russian Chinese relations are at the highest point ever. And we also heard from Xi Jinping who touted their close economic ties, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): We have signed a joint statement to deepen our comprehensive partnership and strategic engagement as we enter a new era and a joint statement on the development plan for key areas of Chinese Russian economic cooperation for the period up to 2030.

So, how is China responding to that right now? STOUT: You know, we -- it's very interesting, we had these two parallel summits involving two Asian leaders with China's Xi Jinping in Moscow and Japan's Fumio Kishida in Kyiv. He made that surprise visit on Tuesday going to Ukraine to visit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The question was posed on Ministry Foreign Affairs spokesman on Tuesday about the visit, this was the response from MOFA. The spokesman said this, the international community needs to stick to the right path of promoting peace talks and create conditions for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. He goes on to say, \"Japan has hoped to do more things that can help de-escalate the situation, not otherwise.\" The parallel visits that have been underway underscored the deepening geopolitical divide in Asia, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Of course, Japan is a close ally of the United States. Fumio Kishida the Prime Minister of Japan has been very vocal about the conflict there.

For instance, because they learn from a wide range of information that reflects real-world biases and stereotypes, those sometimes show up in their outputs. And they can provide inaccurate, misleading or false information while presenting it confidently.\"I know that, all about that.

And that's why whenever you put a question into the Bard box, it actually gives you three responses to kind of limit its liability, and it's constantly disclaiming that no, you should not be looking at this for facts. So what can be useful for pulling up, you know, a group of opinions or culling (ph) together information, you want a specific thought? It might not work that well. Which his exactly what happened at the embarrassing launch of Google Bard last month, when they first debuted it, and it got an answer wrong in front of everybody. But still, I think this is exciting, though, because finally, we have -- we have competition. You know, after an age of monopoly in technology, where Facebook ruled social networking, and Google ruled search, we have real competition in the A.I. market, which can benefit users with better capabilities and benefits start-ups as they all vie to offer the best developer platform.",

That's also why it ended up behind and ChatGPT launched last year and sucked up all of the attention in the space.And you know, Bard and ChatGPT could become an alternative to search, because instead of having to dig through a ton of results, you'd actually be able to get responses right away. But only to very generic questions. And that's why I'm more excited about what's going on in the start-up scene. They're actually using these A.I.'s and fine-tuning them for special-use cases bringing the utility where people actually need them, rather than having to paste an answer into ChatGPT or Bard and then copy it out and put it somewhere else. You know, start-ups like Grammarly from SignalFire's portfolio, it's a grammar and writing assistant. It actually just works wherever you write: in your text messages, in your e-mail, and gives you those kind of tone and clarity and grammar suggestions where you need them. So I think what's really exciting is the fine-tuning of these platforms to specific use cases and bring the utility out of the search engine, out of the box, and bring it wherever people actually need it.",

There's a lot of sensationalist fear that suddenly, these robots and computers are going to come alive and kill us.Honestly, they're still learning. They're kind of in their adolescence right now. And more exciting is how we finetune them. You know, I think if we make a general-use A.I. that's good at everything, that could be a little bit more scary. But by building specific finetune models for very specific use cases, they get better fast. And they can actually answer without getting confused, the way that Bard does. You know, our friend (ph) SignalFire, we built our own A.I. to help us find the best start-ups. And you can't ask ChatGPT what the best seed stage (ph) company is. It's going to tell you what's most popular or what had the most press coverage. You have to have human, in-the-loop feedback, where you do these feedback cycles where the human teaches the A.I. what's right and wrong. And what we need to rely on is that all of these major platforms are doing that finetuning, are keeping those safeguards there, and are making sure that this technology does not get out of hand and instead, takes away some of the ordure and boring parts of life so we can get back to focusing on what makes us truly human; our creativity and our ability to curate what these A.I.'s give us.",
