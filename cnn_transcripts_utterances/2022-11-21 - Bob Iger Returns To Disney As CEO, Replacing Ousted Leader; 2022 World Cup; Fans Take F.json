Those are the markets and these are the main events. A massive shakeup at Disney as the Board puts Bob Iger back on top. Elon Musk decides to reinstate a handful of controversial Twitter accounts. And it is the first full day of action at the World Cup in Qatar. We'll take you there. Live from New York, it is Monday, November 21st. I'm Rahel Solomon in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, a stunning return to power at the biggest business in Hollywood. Bob Iger is coming out of retirement to run the Disney Empire. His successor, Bob Chapek is stepping down after a tumultuous two years. Shares of Disney jumped on the news now up over six percent. Now, Iger is a legend in the in the entertainment industry. He ran Disney for 15 years, and during that time, the company bought Pixar, Marvel, and the \"Star Wars\" franchise. He also launched the streaming service Disney+. Matt Egan is with me now from New York. So Matt, what do we know about what was behind this decision? Because it was just in June that the Board unanimously extended Chapek's contract for three years and so from June to November, this is a pretty dramatic 180.",

      "sentences": "It really is a dramatic 180. I don't know about you, but I love a good plot twist, and Disney did not disappoint here.You could almost hear the collective shock in Hollywood and Wall Street and in the media circles when this came out late on a Sunday night here on the East Coast in New York. Stunning development, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that employees at Disney were so surprised that when Bob Iger sent the e-mail internally, a lot of them didn't know if it was real or if his e-mail account had been hacked. Wall Street also caught off guard by this with the stock up by six or seven percent this afternoon. Investors certainly liked the fact that Iger is back. As far as what changed here, you know, I think we have to remember that Disney is having a terrible year. This is actually on track to be Disney's worst year since 1974, despite the fact that the stock is up six percent today, and two weeks ago, Disney really unnerved investors by reporting worse than expected results and swelling red ink at Disney+, the streaming division. Losses more than doubled to $1.5 billion in a single quarter. One analyst told me that there was growing unease on Wall Street about the strategic path that Bob Chapek had Disney on. Specifically, the laser-focus on all out-subscriber growth no matter the cost. That might have worked when interest rates were at zero and the economy was booming, but we are in a very different world right now. We have recession fears. Interest rates are rising rapidly, and the media industry is in turmoil. So Disney decided that they want to go in and go back to a trusted hand to steady the ship during these turbulent times and it is hard to think of anyone who has a more impressive resume than Bob Iger.",

The company saw a bump in streaming customers as a result. However, he soon faced a lawsuit with actress, Scarlett Johansson over pay, and his perceived silence over Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay Bill, well, that led to protests by some employees, many of whom considered the law discriminatory. Earlier this month, Disney stock dropped as losses in its streaming division deepened. Sara Fischer is a media reporter at AXIOS and joins me now. So Sara, we just walked through some of the turbulent times for Chapek there, but I wonder, is it completely fair to blame all of this on him? Certainly, he could not have predicted the timing of COVID. The Don't Say Gay Bill presumably was his decision. But I just wonder if all of the troubles that Disney has had the last few years, if it's fair to place this all on him?",

You know, under Chapek's reign, Disney has surpassedNetflix at one point in number of total subscribers across all of its streaming services. It has been able to pull its linear networks out of a whole, thanks to the reemergence of live sports. So, it's not like it's been a total fiasco. I think investors reacted very negatively to Disney's earnings because what they were looking for was a growth in profits, trying to get streaming more profitable, not necessarily just increasing the number of subscribers. But the other thing I'd note here too, is that it's not Disney alone. All of the major entertainment companies are going through layoffs right now, many of them are struggling to get their streaming services to be profitable and that includes CNN's parent Warner Brothers-Discovery, as well as Paramount Global, Comcast, et cetera. So I don't think it's fair to pin this entire thing on Bob Chapek, but I do think his early blunders, the ones that you noted with Scarlett Johansson, with the Don't Say Gay Bill, it didn't help him in this regard.",

One, there have been reports that it wasn't culturally the right fit, but also I think it's hard for Bob Chapekto walk into this role, when you know, he is trying to fill the shoes of Bob Iger. Bob Iger didn't really come out in huge support of Chapek during some of the most tumultuous times, like the Don't Say Gay Bill. So it was hard for Chapek to become that cultural fit. But on the other hand, leading up into earnings and talking about having a rosier outlook, you know, I don't think that Disney was doing anything that was particularly egregious compared again to its competitors. I also think that in terms of the widening losses at its streaming service, you know, he has continued to say that he expects it to become profitable in 2024, which has been the long-term guidance ever since they launched it under Iger in 2019. And so while I do think that Bob Chapek is to blame for some of these things, I think some of it is things that he could not have necessarily helped.",

You know, I feel like even just last year, a few years ago, it was all bets on streaming, the future was streaming. And now, we're sort of in a different phase in the economy where folks, Netflix, for example, folks are realizing that it can't just be growth at all costs, sort of walk me through sort of what you're seeing in the larger landscape.",

But I don't think that's what ultimately dealt the blow to Bob Chapek's career at Disney. I think it was, you know, to the things we've pointed out before, not the best cultural fit. He was trying to come in at a time when the economy was very weak, and he was replacing the shoes of Bob Iger, which a lot of these investors including some of those activists absolutely loved.

Amazingly, I remembered him, he remembered me and I wanted to know what he thought about being here and with all the stuff that was going on. And he said, \"Pointedly, it's just about the football. That's all that matters.\" So that was his perspective. He just couldn't wait to get into the game and to cheer on his team and I'm sure, he ended up having a wonderful afternoon. But if you speak to, for example, the Iranian supporters, it's not just about the football, they realize that there is much more to life than just a game. And of course, we know what they've been dealing with back home with the protests, which have turned violent and deadly and for which so many demonstrators who are protesting against the regime are paying for it with their lives. And so many of those supporters were wearing, you know, freedom t-shirts. Many of them didn't want to be speaking with us or they didn't want to be seen speaking to the media, so concerned were they that regime spotters were monitoring them in the crowd. But we did speak to one couple who said that they were happy to be speaking with us, they now live in California, so they weren't so concerned about their safety, but they were really, really hoping that the players could send a message to the demonstrators that they were with them, or at the very least, they expressed some sympathy or solidarity, and they said it will begin with the Anthem. So when those Iranian players so pointedly did not sing the National Anthem, many Iranian fans in the crowd seemed to be cheering. They seemed to be quite jubilant about that and that really was just an extraordinary moment to bear witness to, a reminder that it is a beautiful game, but there's much more to life than just football. And I think even though the Iranians got hammered today, I mean, they really got taken to the cleaners, losing six-two.

They bring an awful lot of fans and support to the World Cup. They are playing well in this game there. As you say, they're one-nil up against Wales. We've got just about a third of the game to go, there's about twenty-eight, thirty minutes left. And from what I've been able to see, they are worthy of their lead. If they can hang on to it, it will set up a blockbuster clash against England on Friday, which is the day after Thanksgiving. That is projected to be the biggest ever television audience in the United States for a game of soccer. The USA against England, you know, potentially for the domination in this group, Group B. So that's really been interesting to see how that plays out. Of course, we'll see if the Americans can hang on to that. But you know, they've changed a lot in the last eight years. They've got a lot of the world's top players right now. Even President Joe Biden acknowledged that when he called the team and spoke to them over the weekend. I mean, a lot of those guys are big stars in Europe and in the Premier League. So, they definitely have made big strides, big improvements. The other game tonight, really, really disappointing for the African champion, Senegal. It's really been never that an African team has done really well in the World Cup. And every four years we're wondering, is this going to be the year? Is this going to be the year? Senegal coming in as the reigning African champions, unfortunately, without Sadio Mane, their big star who is injured and who has had to miss the tournament, and they clearly struggled losing to the Netherlands, who are one of the fancy teams from Europe.

So I want to start with what Mary Daly was just talking about there, the labor market, because it is still very strong. Right? The unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent. But one thing we hear so much from Chairman Powell is that he and the Fed believes that they can create some slack in the labor market by pulling from job demand, job vacancies rather than actually creating job loss.

On the other hand, Larry Summers and Olivier Blanchard have come out and said, look, we've looked at all of the data and that's a great theory. It's just never happened before. And I think the data is pretty clear on that. So it's something that works in theory better than in practice.
