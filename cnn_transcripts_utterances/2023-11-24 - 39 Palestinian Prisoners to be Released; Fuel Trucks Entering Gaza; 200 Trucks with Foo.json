      "sentences": "Well, look, Becky, earlier this week, Israeli authorities released a list of about 300 Palestinian prisoners who could potentially be set to be part of this initial tranche of prisoners released as part of this truce agreement. We are expecting, as part of that first phase, 150 to be released over the course of the next four days if that truce continues to be upheld.And today, we are expecting some 39 Palestinian prisoners to be released. They will be released from two prisons southeast of Haifa and transported to the Ofer Prison, which is just in the distance behind me near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. And they will be held there until the Israeli authorities are able to confirm the safety and security and the safe evacuation of those 13 Israeli hostages who are set to be released from Gaza by Hamas. Once that is confirmed, and once they are confirmed to be safely in Israeli hands, there will be Red Cross checks for these prisoners at the Ofer Prison. And once that is complete, at some point later this afternoon or this evening, they will then be able to cross this Beitunia Crossing and return to their homes. Now, of course, it's unclear who exactly will form that first 39 set of prisoners released in that initial list of 300 names. We know, of course, that many of them were young men, teenagers between the ages of 16 and 18, not charged with serious offenses. But for many, it's unclear whether or not their loved ones, friends will be in that initial batch of 39 prisoners who are released. We yesterday spoke to one family who are hopeful. that their niece, Israa Jaabis, will be released. We heard yesterday from the (INAUDIBLE), she was detained back in 2015, charged with attempted murder, according to Israeli authorities. They've accused her of attempting to harm soldiers at a checkpoint near East Jerusalem when her car set fire and exploded. She and her family have long denied these allegations. They say this was caused by a faulty gas cylinder in her car, but she remains in Israeli prison at this current point in time. And we spoke to her uncle yesterday who said they are hopeful that she may well be among those names released over the next four days. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TALAL SAYYAD, UNCLE OF PALESTINIAN PRISONER ISRAA JAABIS (through translator):  Israa has so far spent eight years in prison. And in that time, she has suffered a lot. We as Palestinians are used to injustice, but it's not just about Israa, there are many other women, many other prisoners still in Israeli custody. Her son, of course, is desperate to hold her. Imagine not being able to hold your mom in your arms for eight years. He's been able to see her in prison, but they're always separated by a glass barrier. It's the same for her parents. They're very emotional right now. We're only human with emotions.",

This is a community of about 440 on a good day and another 10 Thai workers who were, you know, guest workers in Israel were also murdered that day who worked on the kibbutz. We all knew.

And we don't have answers for any of these desires or hopes of the little girls because we don't know when their dad is going to come back. We're doing everything we can. What we do know is that we can't go home. Our kibbutz, like many kibbutzim in the area, was totally destroyed by Hamas terrorists and the looters in Gaza on October 7th.

So, in practice, this probably means that for a lot of these families, they're not going to hear from the U.S. government until the hostage is physically out of Gaza. Now, I should note, some of these hostages are believed to be dual American Israeli citizens. So, it's very possible that they end up hearing first from the Israeli government before they hear from the U.S. government. We do expect that the White House will be very, very careful about this. You'll recall last month when the two American women, the Raanans were being freed from Gaza. We really didn't hear anything from the White House until the two women were safely out of Gaza.
