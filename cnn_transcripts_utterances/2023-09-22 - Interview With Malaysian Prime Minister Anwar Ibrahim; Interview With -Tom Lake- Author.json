I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York, closing out a week of reporting and interviews from the United Nations General Assembly. The war in Ukraine and defense of democracy took center stage with the Ukrainian president even urging an end to the war in order to focus on other global challenges, including the worsening climate crisis and rising inequality. But no-shows included Russian President Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the French and British leaders. Rising Chinese power and influence in the Indo-Pacific region, a big focus for my first guest, Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia. Balancing relations with both China and the United States. We spoke about all of this, including his own incredible journey from protest leader to political prisoner to prime minister. Just under a year ago, after a long time in waiting, Ibrahim became prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But all have the same complaint, that they were made to feel like beggars, not victims of exploitation. They need to wait years for little money that does not meet the needs of their children. JOKENCIE JEAN BAPTISTE (through translator):  Do you know what hurts me the most? Every time you call them, the way they treat us it's like, they treat us like we're nobody. NEWTON (voiceover):  Jokencie Jean Baptiste says she and her son have been victimized all over again. First, fighting for paternity test then financial support, submitting receipts for expenses to the U.N., waiting months or years for money that arrives sporadically or not at all. If money is granted, the U.N. decides how she should spend it.

Andreally, she and her co-workers did this report unprompted. They really just wanted to take a look at the state of the agency. And there's a great quote in that report that really illustrates just how poorly NASA had tried to bring women and people of color into the program at that point. I don't remember the exact quote off the top of my head but it was something along the lines of, you know, NASA had sent three women into space. Two spiders and one monkey. You know, it was -- it just really painted a grim picture of diversity at the agency. And then, ultimately, after that report came out, she was fired and called a disruptive force. Now, NASA tried to backtrack and say, it wasn't because of the report. But ultimately, that did shine a light on what she had found. And it was getting to the point where NASA really couldn't hide from this problem anymore. They were getting a lot of questions internally and externally about why they hadn't brought in women and people of color up to that point.",

You know, when they came on board, they were offered up for interviews, the entire class was offered up for interviews, and this was 35 people that the six women were part of. And the press only wanted to speak to the six women and the astronauts of color who had come on board. So, they knew how much scrutiny they were under. And I think a very poignant quote that Sally Ride gave when she first flew, before she flew to space, was that she -- her biggest fear was that she was going to mess up. And I think a lot is loaded in that statement, which is that, you know, she knew that she would be representing not just herself, but all of women when she went to space for first time. And I think that's true of anyone from an underrepresented group, is that you are standing for everyone else that's like you. And so, she knew that if she messed up, the press were going to write headlines, you know, woman messes up in space, not Sally Ride messes up in space, but woman messes up in space. But fortunately, you know, they did such an amazing job and they really helped to pave the way for the women that came after them because they were so adept and capable of what -- of their jobs.",

You know, during the early days of the shuttle, it really was a very celebratory time and there was also kind this idea that NASA could do nothing wrong. And so, as the shuttle kept launching, you know, we were adding on payload specialists, we were adding on politicians to flights. And then, obviously, we famously flew a teacher on the Challenger flight. And before that happened, we were about to fly a journalist. So, you know, it was a very different time before Challenger flew. And then, once it did fly, you know, the -- everything changed. You know, the -- NASA had to completely re-evaluate its safety procedures and its protocols, and it transformed the agency into its new era, a new era for the space shuttle. So, I really see the Challenge accident as the end of a chapter and the beginning of a new generation for the space program.",

And I think, you know, the Artemisprogram, which you've mentioned, is very unique and that it's the first time that NASA has really made the stated goal of sending a woman and person of color to the lunar surface. I don't think they've really made that statement for any other of their program. They never dictated who would -- who they were going to fly. So, that's a really interesting evolution in the space program. Some might agree with this, some might not, but it does go to show that this is top of mind for the space agency. And, you know, I think it's interesting because we do have a bit of way to go in terms of reaching true parity. Less than one-sixth of the women -- less than one-sixth of the people who've gone to space have been women. And women of color, the statistics are pretty abhorrent. You know, we have quite ways to go to catch up. And so, I think it's really quite inspiring that NASA is making that a goal. And I think it's also an important lesson that relates back to the six and the first woman who came on board. When the 1977 selection process happened, you know, the selection board made bringing people of color and women top of mind. They were very clear to when they advertised the program that they wanted a wider array of people to come on board. And because they made that a priority, it dictated how they advertised and who they advertised to. And that ultimately led to their success in bringing much more diverse crew of astronauts into the program. So, it just goes to show that when you make it a stated goal, it makes it much more easier that you will be successful.",

I would say one of the biggest things that the six were able to do for NASA is to simply pave the way for more women to come after them.You know, they didn't have mentors that astronauts now have, you know. But ever since the six came on board, you know, they experienced what it was like to get pregnant while an astronaut. And so, they were able to share their experiences with other women who came on and then, also wanted to get pregnant. So, that's ultimately what pioneers help with. They can -- they make the roads slightly easier for the ones who come after them. And I know, speaking with some of the astronauts today, that they're incredibly grateful for that because they are able to have that history of women behind them so that they have all these experiences and they have all that support for any of the problems that they might when they're in the field.",

And you know, it just -- it's illustrative of the fact it's still quite a male dominated industry. And so, it was really important to me to find a story that centered women in space because it's been very important to me as a space reporter to find the other women around me. You know, even space reporting is a pretty male dominated field. But as I progressed in this industry, I found more and more amazing women who report on space as well and find -- having that comradery with them has been one of the most, you know, valuable things in my life. And I imagine for other women in this industry, it's also valuable knowing about the women who came before them and paved that way. Knowing it's valuable for me and it's inspiring for me too. And so, that's ultimately what I hope this gives to everyone who's, you know, realizing that they're not alone and that there's others just like them.",
