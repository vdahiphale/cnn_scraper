      "sentences": "Let's get some perspective now from CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton.Colonel Leighton, thank you so much for being with us. I was curious about something Netanyahu said when he was giving his remarks. In announcing the ceasefire vote, he said that he believed that \"the IDF accomplished enough in Lebanon, and that it was time to turn to a political solution.\" Despite that, you had protests in Israel outside the defense ministry and even members of the governing bod there arguing that the war shouldn't come to an end. Do you think Israel accomplished all it needed to? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well Boris, that's a great question. So from Netanyahu's standpoint, he needs to make a move where he goes in a -- in a different direction so that he can, as he mentioned in his speech, refurbish the military and concentrate on Iran. Plus, he also mentioned that he's awaiting deliveries of U.S. weapons systems, at least I presume they're U.S. weapons systems. He mentioned that that was one of the factors involved here. So there is a military calculation and a logistical calculation in this. I think he did accomplish quite a bit. He and the IDF accomplished quite a bit in terms of military objectives. The difficulty with fighting a foe like Hezbollah is that that foe is one that can change quite a bit. And it can also blend into the scenery, so to speak, and become something else for a while before it resumes its activities. So we have to expect Hezbollah to do just that, to go, in essence, to regroup, retrench and then come back in another form or in a in a modified form as the months and -- and weeks go on here. But I -- having said that, for the moment, the IDF has accomplished a major series of goals to include the decapitation of the leadership of the Hezbollah leadership. They have gone and, in essence, decimated the entire organizational structure. And they've weakened it from a weapons delivery standpoint as well. But as we say, all of that, the other thing to keep in mind is that there have been rocket attacks from Lebanon, presumably all of those from Hezbollah were allied groups. And those are the kinds of things that the Israelis, of course, have to deal with. And they have to have, in essence, discover what their tolerance level for this is. Obviously, the protesters do not believe that they've done enough. But the IDF is, in essence, moving in a different direction, based on the political direction that they'll be receiving from the cabinet.",

      "sentences": "So that's -- the Litani River boundary is based on U.N. Resolution 1703, Brianna. And that was done in 2006. And it was never really implemented to the extent that it should have been.It's, in essence, creating a buffer zone for northern Israel. And it allows the Israelis to bring the citizens that live in northern Israel back into their into -- their residences, into the villages that they inhabit. So this key significance is that they get this zone and the Lebanese Army, which has had difficulty controlling Hezbollah, to say the least, as a role in it of augmenting the U.N. forces that are already stationed in southern Lebanon. If the Lebanese Army can do that successfully, that will help the Israelis help them secure that northern area. But there's a risk involved here. The Lebanese Army is not at the same standard as the IDF. And it is also basically at the behest of Hezbollah and other political factions within Lebanon. And it may not be the most reliable partner to ensure the kind of security that Israel needs. So this is a risky move for Netanyahu, but it's one that he feels he needs to make, mainly for logistical and political reasons. SANCHEZ: Colonel Cedric Leighton, appreciate the analysis. Thanks so much for joining us.",

There was a ligament, a ligature around her neck, and it had been pulled so tightly that she was strangled. She was sexually assaulted, this little 6-year-old girl. There was blood in her underpants. And that blood was determined to be unknown male DNA next to the blood. And so I interviewed -- during our documentary in 2016 for CNN, I interviewed the forensics investigator who headed up further DNA testing on her underpants, on her pajama bottoms.

And I remember Angela Williamson told me at the time that the issue was that when you test these things, that DNA is eaten up and then you don't have it for further testing.

But there are ways for an administration to get around that.During Trump's first term in office, he went through long stretches without having any press briefings at all. And sometimes when his press secretaries did have briefings, people would stand in the back, pro-Trump propaganda outlets would stand in the back and shout questions. So this could change in a variety of ways. I think change is inevitable when it comes to these briefings. Trump has signaled he wants to do things differently. It could be great, you know, a greater variety of voices. But it could also go sideways pretty quickly, right? Let's take what Donald Trump Jr said there. Imagine if a January 6th advocacy group comes in, someone with a podcast, who believes that the January 6th attack was orchestrated by the FBI, was some kind of government plot. Imagine a voice like that interrupting the briefings and going off in an alternative reality. That -- that would be the danger. That would be the downside risk here. But certainly, you know there are some podcasters and some new media voices that produce rigorous reporting and should be able to be a part of the press briefing system. I think the biggest-picture story here, though, is that the press briefings are oftentimes not the best way to break news and make impact. In this new second Trump term, some of the most impactful reporting is going to happen at the government-agency level. You know what's happening inside these agencies. And you're not going to get answers about that from a podcast. That's going to require investigative reporting.",

I don't expect that to change in a meaningful way. I'd be very surprised if it did. But bringing in additional voices is something Trump tried before, and it does make sense. You know, the question, of course, is always about whether this is about information or affirmation, right? If Trump just wants propaganda artists to shout positive comments about him, then that's not informing the public. That's just about affirmation.
