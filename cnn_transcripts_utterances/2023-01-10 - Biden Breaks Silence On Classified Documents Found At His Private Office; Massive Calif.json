Further north up in Santa Barbara, the flood water just overwhelmed the sewer system and that ended up with sewage on the streets in Santa Barbara. And also, you know, drivers just trying to drive where they shouldn't be driving because frankly, they just don't know any better. So we've seen quite a few rescues, people being plucked out of their cars.

It's expected to crest tomorrow at more than 27 feet. And as you said, it's not over. We're in a bit of a lull right now, a calm, but there is a lot more storm to come. The National Weather Service actually put it rather poetically, they said that the next in the seemingly endless parade of storms is going to roll in from the Pacific within the next day or so, that's going to hit mainly Central and Northern California with so much more rain. Now, the Lieutenant Governor here says this is all an example of climate change extreme weather. But you know, here's the kicker, really the kick in the teeth, much of California has been suffering from severe drought. But all this water is not going to reverse that, you know, when you get tons of water in a short space of time, that doesn't change the big picture.

He immediately closes it and they call the Archives. They've given them full cooperation. I just want to say the \"VP Personal\" label that may explain why it was packed up, it may indicate it was an honest mistake. So Nevertheless, there are these 10 classified documents found.
