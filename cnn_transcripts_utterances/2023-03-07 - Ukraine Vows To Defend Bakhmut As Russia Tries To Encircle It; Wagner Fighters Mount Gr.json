Well, the fierce battle for Bakhmut raging for months, has now turned into urban combat with Ukrainian troops fighting on the streets. Russian forces have been making gradual gains. New video shows fighters with a Wagner mercenary group taking down a Ukrainian flag and planting their own flag on top of a tank monument in the eastern part of Bakhmut.Still, a Ukrainian presidential adviser says the defense of the city has achieved its goals, and is seen as a great strategic success for Ukrainian forces, a sentiment shared by one military spokesman.

They say they have nowhere to go and have no money. It's very hard to survive there, he says. It's not life. It's survival. Drinking water is a big problem. Walking to the well is dangerous, he says. Shells landing on your head all the time. All he now feels, he tells us, is fear and sadness. Everyone here knows how hard it will be for Ukraine to hold on to Bakhmut.

And, the decision comes after intense consultations in Ankara on Monday where there is six opposition parties, formerly known as the \"Nation Alliance\", with the party seemingly struggling to come to a unanimous agreement until the very last moment.Now, while President Erdogan's ruling \"AK Party\" has in the past capitalized on the apparent disunity of the opposition alliance, this year's election could prove decisive, and high on the agenda for the opposition is, of course, criticism of the government's response to the devastating earthquake in February which killed more than 46,000 people in Turkey, and left hundreds of thousands homeless. Members of the opposition have been vocal in their criticism of the government's preparedness and response, while some have highlighted apparent failings in the country's construction standards. From the outset, President Erdogan has been clear that his government is aiming to rebuild the affected areas within one year. But, experts have also launched criticism against the President's plan. Turkey's Union of Engineers and Architects warning that such plans are simply too hasty, with further geological investigations needed to ensure that the rebuild operation is actually safe. But, while the earthquake response may be the focal point of this year's electoral debate, there is also the question of Turkey's deepening economic crisis, which has already pushed much of the country into financial ruin. And, while Erdogan may be able to bank on presenting himself as a beacon of stability, growing discontent in the country may provide an opening for the opposition after more than two decades out of power.

So less than 25 percent of costs I'm only at .5 percent of fat which is actually quite different than the genocide. (INAUDIBLE) is less than 10 percent of carbohydrates. And so what we think is that we took these value bank. But it's a large database of patients from the U.K. for British patients. And we look for patience more than 45 percent of fat who have completed a survey in the last 24 hour where they would report following this low carb, high fat. Their diet And we compare. We're patient on a normal standard diet. And what's interesting? GSG we found that compared to sort of patients n the normal standard diet. Those that we're when having their than (INAUDIBLE). the commercial numbers were actually. There was association with a high level of cholesterol. And they also had twice more events -- cardiac events and 2 times higher risk of cardiac events, such as heart attacks, or even strokes or blockages in their arteries.

Because Keto (INAUDIBLE) really restrict diet, carbohydrates to less than 10 percent, low carb high fat diet can be less than 25 percent. It really depends when to restrict the carbohydrates with how you replace the other nutrients.If you replace it with fat or what we recommend is plant based alternatives. So that would be very helpful, and very healthy, such as the Mediterranean diet. You know, if the participants want to go, or the individuals want to go to the low carb high fat diet, they can do so but it would be best to have their cholesterol levels monitored with the health care professional. And really just follow closely. Also, it's important to mention that each individual responds differently to each type of diet.
