So, our strategies should respond to that. But to the point, I think it is a great point, this change has happened so quickly and it has been a good response to toxic masculinity. But what does it mean? So, in my \"Seven Black Fathers,\" I talk about the expansion of the definition of fathers, these men who were not all my biological fathers that stepped in and helped keep me on track.

So, as we have been talking about, these traditionally masculine, male-dominated industries like manufacturing, like coal mining, have declined.And meanwhile, the industries that have shown among the biggest growth are sort of traditionally pink color industries, nursing, other kinds of health care jobs, services. And for whatever reason, men have not adapted to that. These are also jobs that often require more post- secondary schooling, by the way. You know, you need a degree to become a nurse, for example. You didn't necessarily need one in decades past to work in an auto plant. So, you know, the challenges, even though there are more men who have entered nursing, it is still a very female-dominated field. These are still very good jobs, they are still very much in demand. How do you encourage a different vision of what it means to have a sufficiently manly job so that there isn't sort of this aversion to positions that are increasing, that pay well, and that men don't seem to want to go into? Or does it require a different kind of socialization of boys, for example, so that they have the greater emotional and social skills that are valuable in many of these jobs, I would say, of the future, but frankly of the president. So, a lot of it has to do with these economic forces that have changed for whatever reason. Men, excuse me, have become more demoralized rather than adapting.

And cash bail, specifically, is a very big problem because it is estimated that up to 70% of people who are currently in county and city jails are just there because they cannot afford bail. They have not yet been convicted of anything. And 43% of those people are Black. So, I think when you drill down and you look at what's actually being proposed and enacted in these cities, they are really things that a lot of people would have problems with. And so, because crime is so multilayered, I think that saying what is progressive policies, of course, it's a very simple cell and it's a very simple thing for voters to buy because it's easy to say that someone is soft on crime that is why you're seeing all of this crime.

It is true, crime has gone up across the country. But if you look at the cities that have the highest murder rates, you know, it is not San Francisco, it is not New York, it's like St. Louis, you know? A number of states in the south have city -- red states have cities, they might have a Democratic mayor, but I wouldn't necessarily call them like bastion of bleeding-heart liberalism, you know, progressive, you know, let's let out the criminals-kind of mindset. But, you know, there are a lot of parts of the country that I think are perceived as being the more dangerous areas but that doesn't actually match what the crime stats show. It's not that we want more crime in any of these places, right? That's not good. But I think a lot of this is really about perception.
