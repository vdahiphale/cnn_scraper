This week, the race for the White House goes directly through the states that couldn't decide at all, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump turn up the heat in their battle for the battleground states. This week, Harris kicks off a bus tour in Georgia while Trump swings through three key blue wall states, both nominees set to make critical new pitches to voters.With the next race defining moment on the 2024 calendar, the presidential debate now just 15 days away in all just 71 days left. until the election. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is leading us off this morning with the latest reporting on Team Harris. And, Priscilla, you're hearing from the campaign this morning about new demand that they have for the next debate. What is that?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Sara. We're learning about some back and forth happening between the two campaigns as they sort out these rules for the ABC presidential debate happening next month. Now, what this includes, I'm told, is the microphones, whether or not they stay on during the debate.Remember that in June the Biden camp, the then Biden campaign had requested that the mics be turned off when each of the candidates was speaking. That is a little different, but from the way that the Harris campaign is approaching this. They actually want the microphones to stay on. This is a statement from Brian Fallon, the Harris campaign's senior adviser for communications. I'll read you part of it. It says, our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. They later go on to say that they don't think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button. Now, the Trump campaign push back on this, is that these rules had already been agreed upon when President Biden was the candidate, though I'm told that the only remaining dispute at this time is microphones despite suggestions from the Trump campaign that she also wanted notes and wanted to be seated. Now, I am also told that the next few days are going to be very focused on debate preparations. We've seen the vice president on the trail a lot over the last month. She's expected to keep up the travel, but maybe at a bit of a different pace as she also puts a big focus on the preparations for this debate, knowing, of course, just how critical they are and how large of an audience tunes in when she goes toe to toe against former President Donald Trump.",

But on the Republican side of things, you're going to try to see how they can combat that, and that brings me to this, because it's now all-hands- on-deck for Republicans and the Trump campaign, sources tell us, as the Trump team shifts strategy to try to cut off Kamala Harris' momentum.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  Obviously, the Democrats are on a sugar high, everybody's acknowledged that, and I think that that gets real after Labor Day. If you look over the history of all presidential election years, I mean, that's when people really begin to pay attention. So, the rhetoric and the little bounce they get out of the convention is always expected. But I think that Kamala Harris is about to be put to the real test. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Okay. Well, look, I mean, I think there's no question, Omar, that the Trump campaign sees what is happening with the Harris campaign. They have been frustrated, we've talked about this for weeks now, with the surge of enthusiasm that Harris has continued to enjoy.We actually saw a memo from Trump's pollsters that they released on Saturday saying that that kind of post Harris becoming the candidate honeymoon that they had anticipated was going to extend beyond the convention, saying that some of the favorable polls that she's enjoying are expected to continue longer than they had initially anticipated. And, really, we are seeing the Trump campaign shift their strategy because they have this new opponent. That includes ramping up aggressively Donald Trump's schedule. Remember, Donald Trump does not really travel as much as a typical candidate. He was really holding about two rallies a week up until recently. I'm told that is changing. For the next few weeks between now and November, the next two months, I should say, they're going to really ramp up that schedule. You're going to see him traveling daily. Many weeks, if not holding two events per day, I'm told. One Trump adviser told me, think Trump on steroids. This is going to be an all hands on deck approach. But they're also really trying to target some of the early voting states. We know early voting kicks off in North Carolina in just 11 days as well as in other states in other states throughout September. They're really going to be targeting their ground game strategy to kind of hit those states with that focus on who are the voters going to the polls first. And then, of course, you're also seeing Donald Trump behind the scenes simultaneously prep for that September 10th debate. So, they have a lot going on. Now, I think to keep in mind here is that this strategy is completely different from the one that they had when President Joe Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. I can tell you, I mean, after the RNC Convention in July, Trump's team was really measuring the drapes. They thought that they were going to have a much easier kind of glide path to November. That has been completely upended by Harris, and, again, the enthusiasm and the surging favorability that she is seeing that they didn't necessarily anticipate. And so a lot of these changes behind the scene directly tied to their new opponent that they're still trying to grapple with.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, it's very clear Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in his speech yesterday, tried to claim a victory, saying that their military targets and their attacks were meticulously completed, having claimed that they were striking 11 different Israeli military sites in the north and targets in the center of Israel.The IDF pushed back. No military targets hit, they said, and no evidence seen that any Hezbollah weapon systems got through to Central Israel, whatsoever. And I think the perception here is certainly that Hezbollah failed to land a punch, and therefore this is something that, you know, reflects badly on Hezbollah. How much that perception is understood in Lebanon is unclear, but there certainly will be people who realize Hezbollah did not actually managed to inflict any damage that Israel will accept. And that means they fell short of their original aim. So, I think that, again, also tells you that they probably won't try to escalate, because to escalate could mean an even bigger escalation from Israel. And also, Israel struck targets in the South of Lebanon preemptively, and didn't go after targets that might have been more sensitive in the north of Lebanon. So, all of that tells you that both sides are sort of stepping back from this at the moment. But it seems very clear from here at least that Hezbollah failed to do what they wanted to do, and that's going to reflect very badly on them at home eventually.",

Despite all of that, Hamas' position remains unchanged. But I think what you have to say here about the talks is they are shrouded in a very high degree of secrecy. We've heard from the Hamas spokesman, but does this really reflect what's happening behind closed doors? It's very hard to tell. However, the talks, as we understand, both in Doha and in Egypt, at a technical level, are continuing.",

The airport actually clocking in about two and a half inches of rain, but there's a lot of factors that have to come together for a landslide or a mudslide to occur.And I want you to take note of this picture of the actual landslide, the debris field at the bottom, the houses that are extremely vulnerable, and the topography, or the mountain ranges in the background. So, this is the area that is most vulnerable to build our homes on, right? And just so you know, mudslides and landslides can occur in all 50 U.S. states, but the steepest slopes are where the most vulnerable and the most likely locations for these to occur. They can travel 20 miles per hour, even faster than that, so faster than the human can run or outrun something like this. And, unfortunately, there are average between 25 to 50 fatalities per year on account of these landslides. So, what happens? Well, basically the mountainous terrain has this heavy rainfall that soaks into the soil. Remember, we talked about eight to nine inches, but eventually it soaks into the ground. Gravity takes over and the slope fails. We cannot hold the slope of the weight when you combine the rocks, the mud and, of course, the water as well. The result was this front that moved through that brought the heavy rainfall to Ketchikan and the peninsula here and there's still an additional tenth to about a quarter of an inch of rain possible through the course of the day today in Ketchikan.
