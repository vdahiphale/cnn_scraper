And their decision means that the drug will stay on the market as is. It can still also be mailed to patients without requiring them to visit a doctor in person.",

Already we're seeing thousands of people in this country forced to travel hundreds of miles for a procedure that oftentimes takes less than 10 minutes or to take two pills to terminate their pregnancy. And so by using telemedicine, which as you know is really common for lots of different medicine that's delivered in this country, by using telemedicine for us to connect with our patients and give them counseling and feedback and allow them to interact with the provider, we're able to get them the safe abortion medication that they need and that they deserve no matter where they live.",

And we feel like medication abortion is still at risk until we can repeal that law.We also know that anti-abortion extremists that brought this case are not going to stop here. Today's win was a big win and it showed that they were far-reaching and extreme in this strategy. But they won't stop here and we expect further challenges to medication abortion and to access to safe abortion in this country. And we need to be vigilant and we also need to listen to the majority of people in this country who support access to safe abortion ir- regardless of political party. We're seeing the majority of people in this country upset that abortion has been restricted and looking to elected officials to bring justice and health care to all people no matter what states they live in.",

They're going for contraception and now they're going for IVF.And I think it really illustrates that this isn't about health and safety. It's not about protecting our ability to build the families that we feel ready and able to build. It's about power, it's control and it's about politics. And when we look at what needs to happen through the lens of reproductive justice we know that people should have access to safe abortion but they should also be able to have access to whatever they need to have children and to build the families that they want. It's all connected and it's all part of the future that we are trying to build together.",

Trump did talk about abortion. He advised Republicans not to be afraid of the issue, to be smart, to not be too extreme. But most of this meeting, according to all the lawmakers that I talked to, was really a gripe session and an airing of grievances. I mean, he talked about the DOJ as no good, dirty bastards, quote, according to some lawmakers that I talked to. He said the charges against him were, quote, bogus.He gloated about how most of the House Republicans who voted to impeach him over January 6th are no longer here. One of those members was in the room, and he called that member out. He also went on a bizarre rant about Nancy Pelosi. At one point, he was even making jokes about Taylor Swift and Hannibal Lecter. So some very freewheeling speeches, classic Trump today in both the House and the Senate. But most members received this very warmly. They even presented him with a birthday cake and sang him happy birthday -- Boris and Brianna.",

FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker says that the agency has ratcheted up its oversight of Boeing, also Boeing suppliers like Spirit AeroSystems. There are more inspectors in place there now.He says before that, the agency was mostly concerned about paperwork and trying to do audits from afar. This happened today during the Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Boeing oversight. That earned some criticism from one of the ranking members of that committee, Senator Ted Cruz. He says that Boeing must certify each airplane to make sure it is truly safe to fly because remember, during that door plug blowout, it ultimately came out that Boeing ultimately did not put those bolts in place to keep that door from blowing out on board that flight back in January.
