Russia underfire a new wave of drone strikes plague at the Russian Capital plus evacuating the share. France begins the evacuation of European citizens following last week's coup. We'll have a live report in just a few moments time. Meanwhile, Beijing soaked a powerful typhoon delivering the heaviest rainfall in a decade, causing floods and landslides. And grayer clouds over the economic outlook there too new home sales in China dropping more than 30 percent from a year ago with July seeing the lowest monthly sales in three years, Allianz Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian will join us to discuss potential stimulus there and the challenges the multitude of challenges still facing global central banks. But some clouds have silver lining. And that's the case on Wall Street where the S&amp;P, now sits at 16 month highs. The majors end during July on a positive note the NASDAQ in fact the tech heavy sector gaining 4 percent last month alone. And here is the pre-market picture as investors digest ever more earnings news. Uber just posting its first ever unadjusted operating profit and raising guidance. Starbucks and Chipmaker AMD sector report after the closing bell today too lots coming up. And we do begin with the latest from Moscow and another wave of drone strikes over the city the Mayor says several of them were shut down. But one crashed into a high rise tower the same building in fact, that was struck in a previous attack on Sunday. And overnight Ukrainian officials reported three Russian drone strikes on the City of Kharkiv in densely populated areas. Fred Pleitgen joins us now. Fred two observations on this Ukraine, despite Russia's air superiority, still managing to get drones over Moscow and of course, the Russians seemingly still prove very adept at intercepting and destroying them?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's what the Russians say that they managed to intercept and as they put it, foilthis attack. But of course, it is quite remarkable that the city of Moscow faced the drone attack on two -- for the second time, in just three days. And you know, certainly one of the interesting things that we've been observing in all of this is while the Russians say that this drone attack was foiled, that these drones apparently hit exactly the same building, or at least one of them hit exactly the same building that was hit just two days ago. So with that building, we know that area, the Moscow City is essentially Moscow's financial district. Anybody who knows the City of Moscow knows there's a bunch of high rise buildings there. I think the place that would be comparable almost to -- in Paris, where you have those high rise buildings in that one area of Paris, very similar situation there in Moscow fairly close to the city center. But that building in itself, despite the fact that there's mostly financial companies in that area, that does how some government offices, one of the being, the economy ministry has an office in there also, the Ministry of Digital Development also has an office apparently in that building as well. So certainly, it seems as though some government places or at least a building with some government entities in it may have been struck here in this attack. The Ukrainians for their part are not saying what the target was? But there was an advisor to the presidential administration of Ukraine who came out that Moscow is getting used to becoming a frontline city in the war with Ukraine. So certainly the Ukrainians are saying this is something that is not going to stop. I thought it was quite interesting, because we did hear some residence on some videos after this drone attack took place, saying that some of them had actually gone to see the aftermath of the last drone attack, which happened on Sunday. And then all of a sudden heard a loud explosion at once again, so certainly quite troubling for the folks there in Moscow and the Kremlin itself Julia, also coming out and saying, yes, this is definitely a threat, and certainly something that the Russians say is being addressed. They said that this last wave of drones that one of them was taken down by air defense system, but one was also taken down as they put it by electronic countermeasures, which seems as if some sort of electronic suppression of the aircraft that caused it to crash. But certainly some damage done to that building and certainly also some damage done to the calm of the folks there in Moscow who once again finds them under fire Julia.",

How do you unwind both of those things or tackle both of those things? EL-ERIAN: So you're absolutely right. And it speaks to the bigger issue, which is that China that no longer has a potent growth model. China is no longer an economy where the government can step in and inject lots of stimulus and hope that kick starts an activity that they can step away. They're worried about pockets of leverage and over indebtedness in housing. And also they no longer having the global economy as it tailwind. The global economy has become a headwind. So what do they need to do, they need to accelerate that domestic structural reforms. And that means letting go politically, so that the bottom up can become the source of growth.

EL-ERIAN: So on the surface, it's not as big of a concern, and you only need to cite two metrics. One is what's been happening to oil and commodity prices. They have gone up strongly in July, despite signs of a weaker China. And two, look at how well as you cited earlier, we've done in U.S. equities. So on the surface it appears that China is less important, having said that, look at what's happening to manufacturing in Asia as a whole. Japan and Taiwan issued their indicators showing contraction. So I think it's much more regional than it is global but China still matters. And China matters because people were hoping that it would be the engine of growth this year, as Europe and the U.S. slowdown to get rid of the inflation problems.",

And I want to sort of shift gears and look at this about perhaps who has the biggest challenge at this present time between Japan, which is having fun and games. The United States, which we've talked about a lot, and also the Bank of England, and what with the weakest growth and the highest inflation rates in the G7. You said actually, the Bank of England has perhaps the most difficult challenge managing the situation today. EL-ERIAN: It certainly does compare to the Federal Reserve and to the European Central Bank. Why? Because it's dealing with structural problems and not getting enough help from the government. So it starts with a much high inflation rate 7.9 percent. It has a lot of real wage resistance wages are growing at 7 percent. And in addition to that, it doesn't have the flexible economy that the U.S. has, or the trade that the euro zone has. So when you look at the task of the Bank of England is much harder. The one that is equally difficult is the Bank of Japan, but the Bank of Japan has more time. Why is the Bank of Japan difficult? Because they have to get out of an increasingly unsustainable policy of reducing artificially interest rates. And that is a very difficult policy to exit from. And it has to be done very carefully. So Central Bank challenges are not over as yet.",

And then of course, as you would expect, investors tested them to see what they really meant. And then they said, OK, fine, we're going to add a supplementary bond buying program to try and manage that and bring those rates back down. The problem is none of these things are mutually exclusive. Bond markets around the world are connected by the investors that invest in these products. How worried are you by a sort of mismanagement of what we see in Japan having an impact on particularly the U.K., but other nations as well. EL-ERIAN: It's something that we should all worry about. Because if it's mishandled, and I say if, because the Japanese could handle it well, but if it's mishandled, we will feel it in two ways. First, an upward pressure on government bond yields across the world, like you say they are all interconnected. So if Japan loses control of its government bond market, this will put upward pressure on interest rates around the world. Second is the concern that the Japanese investors hold a lot of foreign securities. And if they incur losses on the domestic holdings, as interest rates go up, and prices come down, then they'll be forced to sell. So you would get not only the price effect, but you would also get the quantity effect. That's what people are worried about. It is not a done deal by any stretch of the imagination. But what the last few days have told us, as you point out, is be careful of the muddled middle. You cannot get stuck in a situation whereby you signal one thing. And then when the market test you, you go back to doing what you used to be doing before, you've got to have a strategic commitment and move forward. And hopefully, the Japanese authorities understand that because otherwise this muddled middle will end up really hurting them.",

A lot of people think now looking at as the Federal Reserve has now echoed what you've been saying now for many months, and then they're not expecting a recession in the United States. But stocks have had a great year. I think so far. I'm sure investors now wondering what happen for the rest of the year. EL-ERIAN: I mean they've had a wonderful year. If you look at the U.S., the S&amp;P is up almost 20 percent, five straight months of gains, if you were lucky enough to be in the NASDAQ. That's over up over 30 percent. I don't think anybody in the beginning of the year thought we would have these gains. Look, I say it's very simple. There is reason to still be optimistic short term, however, the longer term is really uncertain. So you may want to take some chips off the table here, you've had a wonderful run. There may be some more short term gains, but one has to recognize that the longer term is on still uncertain, economically, financially, socially and institutionally.

And we're putting that money to gooduse to get the first validation vehicles done by the end of this year, and hopefully start delivering vehicles to customers by next summer. But crowd funding has been just amazing for us. It's a tool where you can invest in innovative companies early on, I would have loved to invest in early Tesla, early Google. But you know, a decade ago, it just wasn't available. It's a recent proposition that Congress passed legislation to allow for this type of crowd funding. And we think it's exciting that people can buy into equity, and Aptera and kind of take the journey with us into making transportation solar powered, and making the world a cleaner, greener place for transportation.",

If this goes in valleys, Portugal who advanced and the U.S.A. go out upon fine margins, the U.S.A. eventually advancing, but not really is one huge scale. Let's hear from some very relieved Team U.S.A. perspective now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX MORGAN, 2-TIME WOMEN'S WORLD CUP CHAMPION: It's tough to be second, we want it to go through first. I mean, this team gave everything we just didn't put the ball in the back of the net. And in the last few minutes, we just had to hold it down, we got to get the result and move on. MEGAN RAPINCE, PLAYING IN HER FINAL WOMEN'S WORLD CUP: They got their World Cup on the line. We had our World Cup on the line. So of course those moments are going to be intense. We're thrilled to be going on to the next stage. It's exactly what we wanted out of this match ultimately is to have another one. So on to the round of 16. I'm excited to see who we play.
