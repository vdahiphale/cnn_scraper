Plus, major rift. President Biden privately telling supporters, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to change his strategy and his plans for Gaza, and that Netanyahu, himself, needs to change.

In just a few hours, I'm going to be moderating a town hall with Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, as he fields questions from voters less than five weeks before the all-important Iowa caucuses. The stakes are incredibly high for DeSantis, as he seeks to distance himself from front runner, former President Donald Trump, while picking up his voters. He's also fending off a challenge from close competitor, Nikki Haley, who is about to score a major endorsement in New Hampshire, the first in the nation primary state. Iowans have lots of questions for the governor about domestic and foreign policy, the economy, Social Security, as to bloody and consequential wars rage in the United States finds itself as a critical inflection point. Right now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is at the White House on an 11th hour invite from President Biden, as U.S. support for the embattled nation hangs in the balance. And Republicans tie the destiny of $60 billion of new aid to Ukraine, to U.S. border policy. They insist on more radical border policy change beyond the nearly $14 billion in additional funding in border security, already included in the White House's proposed package. We're going to walk you through just what the Republicans want in a moment, but first, today's visit to Washington, much more sobering than Zelenskyy's first trip there nearly a year ago. a heroes welcome at the U.S. Capitol last December. Today, Zelenskyy was pleading with skeptical lawmakers, as he grapples with the new stage of war, where it's widely accepted that Ukraine's spring counteroffensive has not succeeded, even failed. A top Ukrainian official telling CNN that the world doesn't understand Ukraine is, quote, already losing, without the U.S. aid, unable to launch offensive operations with just enough ammunition to defend its current positions against Russian aggressors. As morale on Ukraine's ranks tumbles, and Russia revels in what it sees as desperation, president of the Zelenskyy will have to answer the hard question, what is Ukraine's plan? Moments from now, Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy will host a joint news conference. We'll bring that to you live as it happens. But first, we are covering all of this from the White House to Ukraine, Russia, and back to Capitol Hill. Let us start right now with CNN's MJ Lee, who's live at the White House for us. MJ, this is Zelenskyy's third visit to Washington since the war in Ukraine broke out. Both Biden and Zelenskyy agree on the need for additional aid. What are they hoping to achieve from this meeting and from this visit?",

That is impacting morale here already, even if funding does magically, somehow, come forwards, there are still feelings amongst Ukrainian troops that that Western unity is beginning to crumble, certainly. And other signs of issues here to, the defense minister today joking that the chief of staff of the military seemed publicly to be at odds with Zelenskyy over the past weeks or so, because that counteroffensive really hasn't gone the way that many had hoped in the West, that, indeed, the chief of the army had, and in fact, been fired yet. That kind of joke gets made publicly, suggests there are palpable tensions because, essentially, of the failure of that counteroffensive. What comes next? Well, Zelenskyy himself in Washington, pointing out the possibility about they have to do more long-range attacks on Russian positions in Crimea, but really, what is the broader plan to strike a victory against Russia that means Ukraine can feel it's happy with the situation? It might resort to diplomacy over. We are seeing near Kherson, the city we were in 48 hours ago, that tense attacks against civilian populations there, but on the other side of the river that its sat on, Ukraine making a bit of a long shot advance towards Russian positions, detach from their own supply lines on the other side of the river. Unclear where that is going to go. Further away to the east, Russia, on its front foot, moving around the city called Avdiivka, another sign of the amount of resources of lives there willing to necessarily waste to take a town of minimal strategic importance.

You're also seeing Netanyahu break with Biden and say, their plans, what they want to happen in Gaza, on day one, after this war ends, it just simply is not going to happen. He is saying that the Palestinian Authority is not going to be in charge of Gaza, which is something that you've heard President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, Vice President Harris, and others float this idea. But so far, you know, President Biden has really left more direct criticism to come from those other top officials of his. Not he, himself, voicing it like he is now.

We have seen that playing out. I don't think anyone in Washington would deny that the southern border is a problem and that it needs to be fixed, but you are seeing them tie it directly to this in a way that we have not seen and they were already fading on their public support for Ukraine. When you see Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene saying that she doesn't even believe Ukraine aid should be tied to the border, that that shouldn't even be brought to the floor for them to vote on. And Senator Lindsey Graham told President Zelenskyy that today that he should thank speaker Johnson for even bring it to the floor, given just how high the opposition is for within the Republican Party.

That was one of the issues that Joe Biden ran on, in fact, in 2020.And yet, at the same time, he has made a case, and for much of the last two years, Americans have believed, pretty emphatically, that it was important to try to stop Vladimir Putin from going across Europe. I think one of the things you should look for is for him to essentially lay out that this was Putin's bet. Putin's bet was that eventually, Americans would be divided and would no longer support this war, and for that reason, it is a false choice to say it is one or the other.

He has U.S. Congress divided about this between the White House and the Congress.So, of course, he's going to be happy and I think that it's really important to realize that the significance, the implications of having Vladimir Putin even be perceived as winning this are really grave. This is -- it's not a border issue in that sense, a domestic issue. This is an international issue in which the United States will be perceived as a country that cannot keep its commitments. Putin will draw conclusions from this about the United States being weak, about NATO being weak, and when Putin thinks that people are weak, he pushes farther forward.

Then suppose their policy worked and the flow of asylum seekers really did taper off dramatically in 2024. Would not the result of that success be only to strengthen Biden's reelection chances and hurt Donald Trump's?

I think when the president talks about something the way he did today, that is with the full knowledge, frankly, that it is not going to stay behind closed doors, quote, unquote. It is a way of sending a message to the Israeli government, to say, we need you to be listening to what we are saying. We are concerned about what happens after this -- after -- not just what is happening in southern Gaza, but then also what happens after that.
