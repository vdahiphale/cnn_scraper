Now, they're concerned about what it means sticking with him, not that they're going to start supporting someone else. But, these are really bad numbers for Biden. And of course, they will say, what the Biden campaign has been saying, they're still number of weeks, months to go until Election Day. But, this is in some ways a lesson too for House Democrats of what they should be talking about. And we did see during the midterm elections, they did stay very focused on the economy, speaking specifically of the legislation they were able to pass under House Democratic majority with Biden's help, how has that specifically affected people in the district.

So, again, this poll is of registered voters because we're way too far out to start to do a likely voter screen on this, but we can still learn something from these numbers. So, 64 percent of registered voters who didn't vote in 2020 say that they pick Trump, and 24 percent say they pick Biden. That's in Michigan. In Georgia, it's a little tighter, 58 percent to 32 percent. Kate Bedingfield, how do you explain what's going on there?

And so, it's sort of a natural -- he is sort of a natural resting place for people who didn't vote in 2020, or who have not historically been dialed in to politics. That makes a lot of sense. So, if you're the Biden campaign, I think you've got to think about driving your folks out to vote. So, you've got to think about how you juice the black vote, in particular, how you juice young voters, and how you speak to suburban independent voters. I actually think that for the Biden campaign to chase a universe of people who have been disaffected or who are inclined to support Trump because they believe that he will upend the system, that's not a voter at the end of the day that I think is going to come home to Joe Biden.",

He instinctively knows how this media landscape works, and that's why you're seeing him double down on it, because otherwise in no other political environment would you ever double down and say, I'm going to be a dictator even for one moment as an American President.

What is like your view of how and whether the legal system would hold if this arc continues, and we see Donald Trump head back towards the Oval Office? ELLIOT WILLIAMS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, &amp; CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think the cynical answer is that it will not. And I think this is not me, quite frankly, talking as a lawyer, but as the child of immigrants, and it happens all over the world. And I think we in the United States have this notion, particularly on the political left in America that our institutions will somehow save us. If someone comes in and says, I'm going to circumvent the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, the Department of Education, and just implement policies that I wish to have implemented, he can just do that. And I think we had -- or at least for most of American history, just this notion that a President could not do that. And so, for instance, if you take the wall and drilling, those are both things that the government is capable of doing. And there is a process for doing it. There is a procurement process for how to construct a wall and so on. But, the President is sort of making clear and is going to install or at least has said that he wants to install people around him who will just do it.

He has to win a sliver of independent, moderate, suburban voters.

And I think the way you've seen many Democrats join the criticism of theseuniversity presidents, the ways, as you mentioned, the White House was swift to condemn what they said, I think there is no question if you cannot answer clearly is it a violation of your code of conduct to call for genocide. If you can't say, yes, it is, that's a problem. Yeah. So, in the immediate case, yes, absolutely. Whether that speaks to a broader cultural rot at these universities, I wouldn't -- I'm not sure I would go that far. And I think there is a lot of discussion to be had about that. But, I do think it shows how fraught it has become to talk about these issues, talk about the war. I sort of think about this as sort of similar in some ways to Congresswoman Jayapal sort of hesitating in clearly denouncing rape as a tool of war. We -- people seem to be so caught up in the emotional moment that they sort of lose the ability to think clearly about condemning something that is universally condemnable. So, it shows how challenging this is. It shows that the politics is complicated because it is so emotional. But, there is no question in this moment. She should have easily been able to say yes.",

Right? This is not some esoteric debate in a lecture hall where we're saying, what's the appropriate response of force and all that? This is calling for genocide on a college campus protected. It is calling for genocide against your own fellow classmates. So, they intimidates, harasses them and tries to force them into dorm rooms where they're afraid to even come out. Is that harassment? The answer is obviously yes. And what we saw was a giant disconnect right now for a bunch of folks who are running these multimillion dollar endowed universities who will look as out of touch as they've ever looked right now from the American people. It's absolutely in the political realm now, because it's beyond that.

And so, I think, in some ways this is, don't want to say an opening or suggest that a comment like this is opportune. But, I do think that this gives an opportunity for Democrats to clearly say, no, that's not a behavior that we tolerate, and draw some of that, try to close some of that gap a little bit, because it is -- actually, it is one of the biggest divisions in our politics predictors, I should say.",
