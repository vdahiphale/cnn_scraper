You know, I heard Sir Boris there saying that more than a dozen people, the authorities are saying, are still trapped or could still be trapped underneath the debris of where those ballistic missiles impacted.And of course, the Ukrainians are saying that because of that, the death toll could still further arise. You guys were mentioning that right now, it stands at 51 with over 200 people having been injured in that. And the Ukrainians are saying that one of the reasons why the toll is as bad as it is, is that when those ballistic missiles struck that military educational facility, there was actually an air raid alert that had gone into effect. However, they are saying that because the time between the first alert going off and the missiles landing was so short, that a lot of the people were actually still heading for the shelters when the missiles impacted. Therefore, of course, had no chance to get to safety. And that is why the toll is as bad as it is. And one of the things that we've been saying is that it could get even worse. This, of course, is one of the worst single mass casualty incidents since the beginning of Russia's full on invasion of Ukraine. That was one about almost a year ago, actually, in a town in the east of Ukraine that killed 59 people. And right now, the death toll that we're seeing here is quickly approaching that number as we go into the evening hours. And of course, those rescue crews are still very much at work. And the President of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he's obviously absolutely angry about the fact that this could happen. And he is calling for further long-range air defense systems, specifically, of course, those patriots, those U.S. supplied Patriot surface to air missile systems. One of the things the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said today on CNN was he said that ballistic missiles are extremely difficult to take down, but the patriots are one of the few systems that can actually do that, guys.",

Sir, thank you so much for being with us.One detail from this story, sir, struck out to me, it was the limited time between the air alarms going off and the Russian strike hitting. I wonder what that tells you about Ukraine's air defense systems. MIKE LYONS, RETIRED U.S. ARMY: Well, Boris, thanks for having me. What it does tell me is that unfortunately, Ukraine has had to have an economy of force with regards to its air defense systems and is likely protecting other areas. And it's not saying this wasn't protected here. Those systems are well far out from where these locations are. However, in this case of having too many false positives, too many times where they have an alarm go off and nothing happens, then the population becomes somewhat immune to them. So in this case, it looks like they're going to have to go back and take a look at what that distance is. Perhaps, these ones were more inside the system and they were not able, you know, to respond with air defense systems back. But again, in some ways, the population has got to recognize there's probably going to be more false positives and next time, to get to those shelters if they can possibly do that.",

And in a way, perhaps it means they'll be willing to give up land in the south, in the Donbas region, an area that Russia has controlled for the past seven or eight years. But if they're going to negotiate, this is kind of the one last chance that the Biden administration can do something in order to try to get something done before the U.S. election. Because I think Zelenskyy knows that Donald Trump is going to come in and likely put a chokehold on some of the supplies he's been getting. He knows that the Republicans themselves are not necessarily for what's going on there. So they're going to do what they can to stop it. And that means cutting down those supplies.

And I think that's what's holding them back here. But in the same token, we've given Ukraine the kind of capability that could force Russia to the negotiation table.So I do think that the Administration should let them hit those military targets. They're doing it with drones that they're creating anyway. We saw them hit infrastructure sites to the north of Russia.

A lot of the sort of -- a lot of people have left already. Then you get left at the end with the younger element. Some of the older folks were leaving. Not everyone. It's a mixed crowd, but some of the younger folks then, they light fires and then the police move in on them. And that's what we're seeing. And I think that's going to be the nature of the protest.But I was speaking to a protest organizer earlier on, and I said, look, the protests aren't shifting the Prime Minister's opinion. He doubled down on his position. He's rejecting you. He's saying if we do what the protesters do, Hamas will take that as a sign of weakness. So I said, what else can you do? And he said, look, there are other things that we could do. And I asked him what? And he said, look, I'm not going to say, but we know, for example, and I pressed him on this, that the unions tried to go on strike. That was overruled by the government in the law courts. But the unions were trying to close down the ports, the airports. It would have an effect on hospitals. It would have an effect on buses around the country. And the unions are considering alternate ways to try to legally call all the big powerful unions here out on strike. And that's really the mechanism to bring about change in this country. It's tried and tested in Israel. It's happened before. So when I think we hear people protest organizers saying they have other tactics, I think it's the running and the governing of the country that they will talk about, finding a way to try to shut down, not just coming out on the streets, confronting the police late in the evenings, but finding a legal way to try to bring the country to a halt, shake the country to its roots is what they say, bringing the country to a halt, stopping it working as a country. I think that's the direction this is all headed in. And they know until they do that, this Prime Minister is not going to listen to them.",

Florida is not where we're seeing that, right? There are seven battleground states where this election is going to be decided. Florida is not one of them.

Essentially, I mean, Donald Trump was a little bit all over the place with that, with his answer on the abortion referendum, which is interesting because I know behind the scenes, I've been talking to Donald Trump's campaign about this. They have been talking behind the scenes about how Donald Trump would address the issue, how he would vote for the Florida abortion referendum. So they knew it was coming. And still, Donald Trump kind of went back and forth on this issue. At first, he did say that he thought the six-week abortion ban was too strict. He later said that he would actually be voting against the referendum, which would remove and change Florida's laws as they currently stand.But look, I think the big picture here to take a step back is that this is an issue that Donald Trump continues to struggle with. And I think the timing of it is really interesting and honestly helpful to the Harris campaign for when they hit the debate stage next week in Pennsylvania, because this is, of course, an issue, as Eva pointed out, that has been really strong for Democrats. They want to make it a priority in this election. Donald Trump, for his part, has really tried to kind of straddle the line on it, to say, you know, take credit for stacking the Supreme Court with three conservative justices that overturned Roe versus Wade while also telling people, you need to think about elections, you need to win elections. And he knows the politics is not necessarily on his side with so much of America very much being in favor of more abortion rights. And so this is an issue we're going to keep seeing. And one other thing to keep in mind, and I know this is a key concern for the Trump campaign as well, is that this plays into the widening gender gap that we're seeing right now, particularly with Harris now at the top of the ticket. We're seeing more female voters say that, you know, they want to go with Harris. And so that's also playing out behind the scenes on all of this.",
