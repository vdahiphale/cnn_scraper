We're only learning about it now. The documents are filled with U.S. intelligence. It could be valuable to Russian commanders, including Ukrainian troop numbers and weaknesses as they gear up for a major counter offensive. This leaked set of documents also give us a glimpse into how the United States spies on its own allies, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

And it's already sparking outrage in places like Israel because of one document that says that the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, was egging on Israeli protesters, something that the Mossad has vigorously denied. So this could cause a lot of friction between the U.S. and its allies. And importantly, it could cause some sources to go dark, because the documents, which are again top-secret, they do describe how the U.S. has been able to eavesdrop and listen in on Russian officials, as well as Wagner officials.

That decision blocked the FDA from rolling back access to the pill in at least 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia. We should note that, for now, access to mifepristone is unchanged, as the DOJ is going to appeal the Texas ruling. Legal experts say that the dueling rulings could quickly land, though, in the issue -- the issue in the hands of the Supreme Court.

This is the first big abortion set of cases that will be heading on a path toward the Supreme Court since Roe v. Wade was reversed last June. That was a stunning decision by a narrow 5 to 4 vote. But there's something that the justices said in that decision that will probably affect how this Texas case is handled when it is appealed to the Supreme Court. The justices said that this should now be a matter for the states, that it's -- that it's the states that should handle it. Any kind of moral policy issue is something for elected officials. And Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately, after he had joined the majority, to say the court was not outlawing abortion nationwide. If this Texas decision is allowed to stand, and medication abortion is not available in the states that now allow it, effectively, the Supreme Court would be outlawing -- significantly -- significantly prohibiting abortion in states that I say do allow it now.",

Now, right now, in this particular case, Poppy, it has to do with just straightforward kind of administrative law authority of the Food and Drug Administration, the processes it was using when it -- when it did decide that this abortion medication was safe and effective.

Now I spoke with the city council member Jeff Syracuse, who tells me that he is confident that there was enough support within the council to appoint him. But there is a tricky part right before that appointment vote. In order to get to the appointment vote, they first have to vote to suspend a council rule that prohibits someone being nominated and appointed within the same meeting. It only takes two council members to object to the suspension of the rule for it to fail, and then we don't get to the appointment vote. And we're told by Syracuse that, if it fails, it could take four weeks until they are able to appoint Jones back to his seat. So that is something we're keeping a close eye on, and that will be a pivotal moment within this metro council meeting. Meanwhile there's a real sense of urgency here from the council members that we've spoken with to reinstate Jones, and that is because there are 70 - nearly 70,000 people under Jones's district currently have no representation within the state House.

(GUNFIRE) LAVANDERA (voice-over): Perry fired his handgun several times at Foster, killing him. Perry's lawyers call it self-defense. But in the trial, prosecutors pointed to texts and social media posts Daniel Perry made that summer that suggested Perry was looking for a fight. In one, Perry wrote he might \"kill a few people on my way to work. They are rioting outside my apartment complex.\" Someone wrote back, \"Can you legally do so?\" Perry responded, \"If they attack me or try to pull me out of my car, then yes.\" The Texas jury didn't buy the self-defense argument and issued a guilty verdict on the murder charge. Perry's lawyer says they're disappointed and will appeal.
