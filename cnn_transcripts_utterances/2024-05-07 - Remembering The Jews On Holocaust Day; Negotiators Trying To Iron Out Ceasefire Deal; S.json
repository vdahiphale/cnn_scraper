We have an obligation to learn the lessons of history so we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past. We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone, anyone. From the very founding, our very founding Jewish Americans, who represent only about 2 percent of the U.S. population, have helped lead the cause of freedom for everyone in our nation. From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy. So, in moments like this, we have to put these principles that we're talking about into action. I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully, and make our voices heard. I understand that's America, but there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for anti-Semitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind. (APPLAUSE)",

This is an address that every president gives annually, but of course this year the rise in anti- Semitism, the protests that we've seen on college campuses, obviously all stemming from the October 7th Hamas attack, and then the subsequent war ensuing in Gaza to this very day has really elevated the level of concern and the significance of these words that we heard from the president in his speech today. He addressed and once again connected the images playing out around the world that we've seen on college campuses, saying there is no place on any campus or place in America for anti-Semitism or hate speech of any kind, while once again supporting the freedom of speech and the right to protest. He also said no one should have to hide or be afraid just to be themselves. Let's bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak, who has been monitoring the speech from the White House. Also notable from what we heard from the president today was his commitment to not only protect Jewish Americans, but also his commitment to the Jewish state, which he once again reiterated was ironclad, even quote, \"when we have our disagreements.\"",

But Israeli tanks are now inside Rafah and in full control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing. The IDF is calling the military incursion a limited operation aimed at destroying Hamas targets. Egypt is calling it a dangerous escalation that threatens the lives of millions of Palestinians. Humanitarian agencies are also sounding the alarm. The Rafah crossing is the main lifeline through which crucial and aid supplies enter Gaza and the only exit point for people who need to be evacuated for medical treatment. The U.N. says Israeli control of the crossing could be -- could bring all humanitarian aid in Gaza to a standstill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, prosecutors have been taking her through a detailed history of her connection to Trump, including descriptions of the night she went to Trump's hotel room. It appears to be an effort to remove any doubt about Daniel's credibility and her claim that she and Trump engaged in a sexual relationship.

So what we've heard so far is basically Stormy Daniels, one, outlining who she is as aperson, how she became part of a community that does adult films, how she became an exotic dancer, what her childhood looked like, and then some details around this interaction that she had with Donald Trump or the sexual encounter that she had with Donald Trump in 2006. Of course, we will note that Donald Trump has said that that never happened. He's denied any allegations around that. But now we're getting into a part about after their relationship sort of fizzled out. You hear her describe what it looked like. They were talking on the phone still, even though she said she was ashamed and embarrassed of that sexual interaction. At times, she said she was trying to get onto The Apprentice. And then at a certain point, she said she stopped picking up his calls when it became clear she wasn't going to get onto The Apprentice. Now we're in a time period after all of this had unfolded. She's talking about 2011. There was an article that she sat down for that she said she was supposed to be paid $15,000 for, but it never aired. And I think we're walking up to when she came out publicly with these remarks. Now, one of the things that you have seen time and time again during this testimony is Donald Trump's team objecting to things that Stormy Daniels is saying. One, before they even started the testimony, Trump's lawyers asked the judge if they could leave out some of the details, not getting into the real salacious matter, salacious details of the sexual encounter. The judge said yes. Any reference that Stormy Daniels has made to potentially feeling safer being in public with him, at one point she said she blacked out, but she had to clarify after multiple objections. She did not mean in any way that she had drugs or alcohol or any indication of that. She was just saying that she kind of forgot what happened, but they're very clearly trying to object to anything that might say that Stormy Daniels was forced into this sexual encounter. But I do want to kind of take a step back as to what we are seeing right now, because really this is a pretty embarrassing time in Donald Trump's life to now have this relitigated. Remember when reports of this first came out while he was in office, Donald Trump was embarrassed. He was humiliated by what was coming out. And it really put a tension on his relationship with then First Lady Melania Trump. This is not something that he wants to be reliving right now. And you can really see that, at least we're hearing it from our reporters in the courtroom, who say that he's very animated when talking to his attorneys during this. He is constantly writing them notes. He seems to be getting agitated at various times. So not all that surprising, given the fact of this really salacious and explosive testimony that we are hearing here, and I will say quite interesting, given the case of most of this being, as you said, business- related, fraud-related-that's what the actual charges are-but now kind of entered into a new realm of testimony here.",

Kristen Holmes, I really appreciate you bringing that to us. I want to go to a former federal and state prosecutor, David Weinstein, who's also been following along with us here. Now, David, look, to this point, again, as I mentioned, things have sort of, so far, been seen to establish the relationship that Stormy Daniels had with Donald Trump over years in various forms, it appears, as we've seen.

That goes to the prosecution's argument that the former president was, in fact, in charge, despite how many layers he had in between him and the checks that were being written. The testimony yesterday showed where the money came from, what accounts it came from. We heard earlier testimony about motivation for all of this. And so the prosecution has, in fact, been attacking and putting evidence on about the elements of the charges that have been lodged against the former president and sort of clicking off boxes as they get through their laundry list in the presentation of the case.",

I want to get you specifically to respond to a point the president made by speaking specifically on October 7th and saying that that is a day and the atrocities committed that day is something that he will not forget and won't forget.

Other people, and I think we heard this more from Speaker Johnson, for example, are suggesting that, you know, if October 7th was akin to the Holocaust, you really can't compare anything to that.

And Jews who are not on college campuses, for example, are more concerned about campus anti-Semitism than the Jews on campuses. I talked to Jewish students who say something will happen on campus, they'll be like, whatever, not that big a deal. And then three days later, when it hits the national news, they'll start fielding calls from their aunts and uncles, maybe from family in Israel. Of course, Israel is where we saw Jews murdered on October 7th, not in the United States. So there's often this funny gap between the Jews who are supposedly experiencing the anti-Semitism and other Jews who are worried about it.

The reason why is because they were two of the co- chairs for the gala this year. Anna Wintour always selects co-chairs, and this year it was Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth. Now you mentioned Zendaya's black gown, but what we're seeing here is her first look. This was a Mason Margiela look, and it was adorned with grapes and feathers. And now what we are seeing is that vintage Givenchy. Now this headpiece, Bianna, is a vintage Alexander McQueen, and she obviously took the garden theme to heart with a floral bouquet headdress. But Zendaya, she always knocks it out of the park, doesn't she? She's the one that you're always looking for on the Met Gala red carpet, so the fact that she was a co-chair really made all the sense in the world. Now another person, Bianna, that people are talking about for some good and some bad reasons is Kim Kardashian. She showed up in a metallic gown with a cardigan. So some people are curious about that cardigan and the choice to wear that, but what's really getting a lot of people talking is this impossibly cinched waist. People are wondering how could Kim Kardashian breathe? Her waist was so tiny corseted up in this dress. So, all the Kardashians were there. No, I shouldn't say all, but many of the Kardashian family were there. We had Kris Jenner as well as Kylie Jenner and also Kendall. And you know they always get people talking, so last night was no exception.",

The witnesses went from someone, somewhat, rather, mundane this morning with an employee at a book publisher to obviously the star of the show today, and we'll see for a few more days I would imagine, and that is adult film star Stormy Daniels. What more did we learn? What stood out to you from her testimony?",
