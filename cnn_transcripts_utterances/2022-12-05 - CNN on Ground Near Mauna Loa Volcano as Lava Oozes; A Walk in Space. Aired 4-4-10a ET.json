Officials turning this stretch intoa one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in. And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned, the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It is within three miles now. The other worry, not here on the ground but up in the air. What looks like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become tax toxic for residents and visitors of the big island. Mauna Loa is the second of the big islands five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea is still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018. But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation, surfacing from this, the world`s largest active volcano. And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

NASA astronauts Josh Casada and Frank Rubio got suited up and floated outsidethe station to install a solar array or panel on the outside of the space lab. Their mission lasted seven hours. There were two solar arrays installed back in June of 2021, but now, the plan is to add a total of six more to hopefully boost the space station`s power generation by more than 30 percent. The original solar arrays were only designed to last 15 years, but they`ve been supplying power for more than 20 years. They still work but they`re definitely showing some signs of wear and tear after that long-term exposure to the environment. When it comes to office views though, this one might be the best one in the world or the best out of this world. (MUSIC)",

Putt in 1971, as commander of the Apollo 14 moon mission, he left viewers and even folks back at mission control stunned when he pulled out a club and ball to take a celestial swing on a fairway 230 miles away. His moon game is now being seen in a whole new light after a NASA specialist dedicated over 10,000 hours to restoring flight film of the Apollo missions. Now here`s teeing up for us right now.

So I think that`s why it really resonates with folks. You can talk seismometers and all of this stuff all day long really of what they`re doing on the moon, but you talk hitting a golf ball in the moon and people like, oh, yeah, right. Shepard obviously was the first American in space and he`d been grounded for a long time. So, you know, he thought he may never get to go back into space. So when he finally gets this, you know, his health works out and he gets this opportunity to go back, you can kind of see him thinking what`s something fun and cool I can do to put my own stamp on this program. And, you know, sneaking things onto the capsule and hitting a golf ball, that seems to be pretty well in line with the Shepard we know.",
