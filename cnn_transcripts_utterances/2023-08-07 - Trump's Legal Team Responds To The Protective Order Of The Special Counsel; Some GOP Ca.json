The deadline is here and the Trump team has just filed its response to a request by the special counsel seeking limits on evidence the former president can share publicly. We're going over the new documents in the January 6th case, stand by for that.Also, this hour, Ukraine says it has a Russian informant in custody in connection with a foiled plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this as Moscow's forces have unleashed a deadly new missile strike in eastern Ukraine. And we're tracking the urgent threat of powerful storms and tornadoes, putting millions of Americans at risk in the eastern United States, including right here in Washington, D.C. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in \"The Situation Room.\" Let's get right to the breaking news on that filing by the Trump legal team in connection with the January 6th prosecution of the former president. CNN's senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz, is joining us right now. Kaitlyn, so what's in this new response just filed by the Trump team?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, there's both some political bluster in here as well as a legal proposal. They actually are not that far away from prosecutors on that the dispute is, at this time. We had the Justice Department saying that they wanted to start turning evidence over to Donald Trump's defense lawyers, but couldn't because Trump's defense team wasn't willing to really make an agreement with them on how they could set some sort of nondisclosure privilege to protect evidence that would be needed for the defense to review as they go to trial.And so that was what this dispute was about in the last couple of days. This judge had set a deadline. We just got the filing deadline. And as you're looking through it, one of the things the Trump team says is they just don't want a what's called a protective order or a nondisclosure order over all of the evidence that they're getting in the case. They just want to only shield genuinely sensitive information that they may be getting. The Justice Department essentially had the same concern in their filings as well previously, saying that they wanted to shield things like grand jury transcripts, things that were genuinely sensitive in this case to make sure it wouldn't hurt a trial as it goes to trial. And so, there are two proposals before the judge right now on how to handle evidence in this case, how much can be shared more widely as they go to trial. But as this is a filing from Donald Trump's defense team, they've been out making political comments as well as legal comments as lawyers over the weekend. And now in this filing, too, they're bringing up some political bluster. One of the things that they mention is a Joe Biden tweet where they say is a thinly veiled reference that capitalizes on the indictment of Joe Biden holding a coffee cup in a tweet that it may not have any direct impact on this case at all, but there is a little bit of this political sniping happening in these filings still at the same time that some of the legal issues are apparently getting worked out. But, of course, as always, Wolf, we need to see what the judge is going to say next to this.",

That's at least one of their primary defenses here. And this filing is full of it. They say, you know, the First Amendment means that Trump should be able to review this discovery and talk about it however he wants. Like, First Amendment doesn't really have a place in a discovery dispute like this, but they're trumpeting it and they're sticking with it.So, you know, I think they -- there will be resolution reached here. The judge will be somewhere in between the protective order that the government wants and some slightly less broad version, probably more broad though than Trump wants, and that's how judges usually decide, somewhere down the middle. It is heartening that they actually provided a red line, so they are working with the protective order that Jack Smith proposed. They're not just saying throw the whole thing out. That's a reasonable approach to work with the judge on, and I hope that they continue in that vein as we move forward with more pretrial litigation.",

And I don't think the judge will agree on every point. But he's offered a proposal to broaden who gets to use these materials, to have slightly more people use them. That's not beyond the pale. How they are handled, he has some proposals to slightly expand that and when they can be used, including introduction at trial, but only after giving the government notice. So, these are not unreasonable counteroffers, and I think when you subtract the politics, they'll land in the middle. The politics are important, though, because John is trying this case in the court of law and in the court of public opinion. BLITZER: Katelyn, I know you've been reading more of this, what, 29- page document that has just been filed by the Trump legal team. What more can you tell us about this filing?",

It just came in right before your show started. But I will tell you, from what I can see, it's not -- there's not a big argument going on at this time about those Trump social media posts. And so, a lot of that and whether that's going to be coming into this case is something we should be watching for as we move forward, not just right now. And there is so much here. I feel like I'm saying it all the time, wait to see what the judge is going to say, wait to see what the judge is going to do. The end of the story is never what the response is from Trump's team or what the prosecutors say. It is how the judge responds ultimately. And whether she, Judge Tanya Chutkan, someone who has increased security around her at this time, someone who is going to be very closely watched. Everything she does here, watching her and how she responds not just to the legal fight that's happening, but also these social media posts from Donald Trump, what prosecutors are flagging in their filings and how Donald Trump responds both with the political arguments as well as legal arguments, that is really the thing to watch moving forward here, Wolf.",

They have reasonable concerns.But we must not, despite the history of Donald Trump's conduct towards witnesses, judges, juries, we must not minimize his First Amendment right. This is a balancing test. And when you take all the politics out of it, there are two reasonable proposals before the court. The judge will probably pick the middle course. This is really the speed and the volume. They decided to come back with an even larger filing than the government, is just a sign of things to come.

We don't have any formal comment or explanation from the U.S. Marshal Service, but this is always been something that would be expected in a case like this.This courthouse ramped up security around jurors in the Roger Stone case, and they have done quite a bit of work over the past couple days, last week in particular, when that indictment was returned, to make sure that courthouse was very secure. But at the same time as they're ramping up security, making sure that the judge is secure, the building is secure, other people involved in the case have security, they also are making sure that things run like normal over there at the federal courthouse, as they always have done in high profile cases.

We even have a poll where 60 percent of Republicans recently described January 6th as legitimate protest. Against all of that, you have to give primary voters a pretty compelling reason to bypass Trump if they are going to do so.

So in that sense, he has a massive target painted on his back. I think it also shows that Russia has not given up hope of delivering a fatal blow and is not softening its stance at all when it comes to the prosecution of its war in Ukraine. And that's been underlined by the fact that today Russia has rejected, for instance, the outcome of a meeting of 40 countries in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia, discussing a possible peace process to bring to an end the war in Ukraine. Russia said that process was doomed before it had even started and has since said that there's been no basis from those talks that would form the basis of a peaceful settlement.

So it is a victory for Ukrainian counterintelligence.So maybe he is safer than he was yesterday, or maybe he is safer than we thought all along. But what's really interesting about this, I think, is we have to remember, when you're looking at a battlefield in the military, you look at the other side and you try to assess what is their center of gravity they call it, their strength. The strength for Ukraine is the will of their people.

But President Zelenskyy is the man who has led this huge effort to make sure that everybody keeps Ukraine in the forefront of their thoughts, keeps Ukraine on CNN screen, right, and keeps as many people on board and tries to expand that, which is what he tried to do this weekend.",

And the strategy that we're seeing in place right now is one where the Ukrainians believe that they have to just keep pushing forward, using the weapons that they've gotten from the West, the ammunition, you know, as much ammunition as they can gather. And they're mend to try to pierce through that line, both on the southern front and the eastern front. And they know that is going to take some time. So they're trying to grind away at the Russians. There's no ace up their sleeve. That is their tactic and they believe that at some point they will be able to pierce through those lines and that their efforts and the counter offensive will accelerate. At the same time, Wolf, we're seeing these extraordinary attacks inside Russia, inside Russian occupied Crimea, both at sea, in the Black Sea against these ships in Russian ports, from the air with these aerial drones and more and more of these drone strikes both in the sea and in the air that Ukraine is claiming responsibility for. So they're trying to put pressure from the rear both in terms of affecting Russian morale, but also affecting those -- that ammunition and other kinds of weapons, logistical lines that will help the Russian effort in the south and the eastern part of the country. So they're trying to squeeze that so that effort in the counteroffensive can really achieve some success soon.",

You know, it was not your normal motor coach, you know, it had -- we've -- there had been reports in 60 Minutes had actually gotten inside it at one point. You know, it had leather seats, kitchen, bathroom, 40 feet long, not your standard RV.But what \"The New York Times\" recently reported is that it cost $267,000, more than a quarter million, and that it was financed in part by Anthony Welters, who is a healthcare executive. He's a longtime friend of Clarence Thomas, dating all the way back to the 1980s when they were both staffers in the Senate. But it's just another instance of wealthy interests helping out Clarence Thomas financially. And no reports on financial disclosure forms because there's questions of whether this loan was a gift, was it income. Now, this is what Mr. Welters told \"The New York Times,\" 25 years ago, I loaned a friend money as I have other friends and family. We've all been one side or another of that equation. He used it to buy a recreational vehicle, which is a passion of his. But the reason this raises the question is again, a private loan, not one through a bank, just what should be told to the public.

That's not happened. And so they have another extraordinary summit Thursday where they will decide if they will militarily intervene in Niger. The U.S. State Department saying it's been in direct contact with these military Junta. They didn't say who they talked to, but they told them to step aside. As this threat of military confrontation looms, the military junta has closed the Nigerien airspace and they are hanging on to power here. And it's important that they are, because in Niger, it's been the only safe part of this neighborhood. It's surrounded by countries that have seen military coups, Burkina Faso and Mali and Chad and Guinea and even as far as Sudan.
