But first, to a sporting scandal in the world of baseball, Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani is speaking out for the first time about those allegations of theft and gambling against his former interpreter and friend. The L.A. Dodgers fired Ippei Mizuhara last week. Ohtani's lawyers have accused him of stealing millions of dollars and using it to gamble and pay down debts. Shohei Ohtani signed a record 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers back in December 2023. Joining us now is World Sports' Don Riddell. Don, and I know we literally just heard from him, an emphatic denial of any involvement in gambling and once again reiterating that he's the victim.",

But they were also friends and there is skepticism that it's strange that someone wouldn't know that this was going on or in some way be at least aware of it on some level.

He seemed very calm. He seems very direct. He seemed very strident in what he's saying. You know, part of the reason why we've had so much confusion over the past week is that nobody has heard from him. And we had these competing narratives about what was going on, and we also had, you know, quite a fair bit of speculation that perhaps Otani himself was the one who was gambling. You know, he put that to bed pretty definitively in that press conference. You know, I was speaking over the weekend to the lawyer for Matthew Boyer who is the bookmaker, the former book maker at the center of all of this. And Boyer's lawyer told me, listen, he never had any direct contact with Ohtani, but what kind of murky clouded the waters was that Boyer, this bookie, was going around telling people that Shohei Ohtani was his client. Now, his lawyer says that that was really just kind bravado. That was like a marketing technique for him to try and get more custom. Listen, if you say that one of your clients is the biggest baseball star in the world, that certainly elevates your position. That's what she says he was doing. And it's clear Shohei Ohtani wants to try with this press conference to just put this all behind him. He says his lawyers, investigators are going to handle from here on in. He will cooperate, but he really wants focus on the start of the season, that they have a game here at Dodger Stadium starting 6:00 p.m. local time against the Angels, his old team They call it the freeway series. And it's a kind of warm-up for the real season that's going to start here on Thursday. Ohtani, $700 million dollar, 19-year contract. Clearly, he doesn't want this betting scandal to be the headline. But clearly, the Dodgers don't walk this betting scandal to be in the head line. So, the message was loud and clear, this was all the interpreter and Shohei Ohtani had absolutely no idea any of this was going on until he had a one-on-one face-to-face meeting with his old friend, the interpreter, Ippei, and that's when he says he found out what was happening. He immediately spoke to his lawyers. He immediately talked to the Dodgers. And here we are today. He's trying to concentrate on baseball, put this behind. To go back to your first question, what will the fans say? We'll see. Julia.",

And when people hear the Homeland Security Department, they typically think ofcounterterrorism agents protecting the homeland here in the United States. But the one agency in particular that is leading this investigation is called Homeland Security Investigations, HSI. And among their remit includes a heavy focus on human trafficking investigations, both here in the U.S. HSI also has federal agents that are stationed in U.S. embassies across the world working with foreign governments, again, in order to try to combat human trafficking. Now, what's worth pointing out right now, we don't know that Sean Combs himself is a subject or target of a specific investigation. But what HSI is confirming for us is that they are on location at homes owned by Combs, both in the Miami area, in the State of Florida, also here where I am, in Los Angeles, California. We don't know why they are there, what specific criminal allegations may be at play here. Typically, this type of posture where you see agents setting up the table there and doing paperwork, that's likely what's called a search warrant, where a federal agent goes to a federal judge and asks for permission to search a particular person. They have -- or a particular location. They have to convince that judge that evidence of a crime could be in these locations. And so, again, this is all very telling. Both the agency that is leading this investigation, as well as what we're seeing on our screens right now. Now, we have reached out to representatives for Combs, both his public relations person, as well as his attorney, we have not yet heard back. Julia, we've also reached out to federal prosecutors.

Stephen, it's a sort of nuclear fusion of personal, legal, and political controversies this week, but it looks like he's going to end the week financially, at least, far better off, one, because that bond amount was chopped so significantly, and two, as I mentioned, because Truth Social, at least, on paper, when it starts trading yesterday, gives him a whopping great lift to his net worth.",

      "sentences": "That's true. That reduction of the bond payment was hugely important for Donald Trump. It wasa famous legal victory, in fact. He was facing a deadline of today to come up with that near half a billion-dollar bond, or it looked like New York authorities were going to start going after his cherished real estate portfolio in order to make them -- make good on the ill-gotten gains that were exposed in his civil fraud trial. You're right, that $3 billion boost, potentially, to Trump's net worth could take place as soon as tomorrow, when the new media company goes public. One caveat here, though, it doesn't look like he'll be able to use that money to pay off this $175 million bond that he now faces, because he can't trade those shares for six months. And even if he did so, he's so endemic to the identity of this new company that the share price might crash if he started to sell off the shares. The problem here, though, is as so often with Donald Trump, triumph was occurring at the same time as disaster. That date for the fraud trial means that Trump will become the first ex-U.S. president to go on trial in the middle of a campaign to win back the White House. And he's going to have to spend most of April, May, and potentially June sitting in a courtroom and not on the campaign trail.",

This endless drama over Trump's finances and his legal issues? We're going into an election that could be, Julia, decided by about 100,000 200,000 votes in four or five states. It's very hard, at this point, to say what exactly will swing that election. But certainly, this unprecedented circumstance of a presumptive presidential nominee who could conceivably be a convicted felon by election day, that could really play into this. There are some polls that really show that while some Republicans are willing to vote for Trump, the idea that he could be convicted of a crime may put them off a little bit.

So, Netanyahu just canceled the trip for the delegation to be made to Washington. He wouldn't allow the government to support the trip by a cabinet member that occurred a couple weeks ago. This speaks, first and foremost, to the profound dysfunction of the top level of the Israeli government and the political disagreements that they're having inside the top levels of that government. It also points to the fact that the Biden administration has very little operational leverage over the Israeli prime minister or the functions of its government right now. And they're angry about that. It's hurting them internationally. It's hurting them at home. And that's why you're seeing this break. Not with Israel, they're not taking money off the table, defense off the table, but they are embarrassing Netanyahu personally.

Eleven people have been arrested so far. The Kremlin has sidestepped questions about whether they were acting on behalf of ISIS, as the terror group claims. Four of the suspects appeared in court on Monday. Matthew Chance has more details. And we'd like to warn you, some of these images are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Blood shed at the concert hall near Moscow. Gunmen running amok before setting the crowded building ablaze, killing more than 130 people inside. Now, the suspected attackers from Tajikistan in Central Asia have appeared in a Moscow court, looking battered amid reports of a brutal interrogation. The Kremlin is refusing to comment on allegations of torture. But disturbing video has emerged of the suspects being run down by Russian security forces and ruthlessly beaten. What appears to have had part of his ear cut off on camera during questioning, electrocution and beatings have also been shown. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses are recounting the terrifying ordeal they endured last week. They didn't scream or tell anyone to take cover, recalls Anastasia. They were just walking around and gunning everyone down, methodically and in silence, she says. It's an outrage that's left many here shocked and questioning just how safe in this country they really are.",

We can think of technology as this tool for access, or we can think of it as a crutch. And I think a lot of people are sick of walking with the crutch because all of a sudden, they notice that they no longer know how to strike up a conversation with someone that isn't in a DM or online. So, there is this shift to try and meet in person. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dating apps are in trouble lately. Millennials, many of whom first adopted apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are getting older. To keep their businesses afloat, matchmaking companies need to attract the next generation of users looking for love, Gen Z. The problem? They might not be so enthused about using dating apps.",
