This is going to mean some major changes in terms of how users interact with Google and what they see on their search results.The biggest change is that Google is going to be rolling out these AI search results summaries, these sort of paragraphs of information that people will see at the top of their search results that's potentially going to remove the need for people to click on a bunch of links. Instead, Google will be doing the reading of those links for people. And its AI will be writing an answer to their question in more natural language. The search engine is also going to be able to handle more complex queries that in the past could have required people to do multiple searches. So, for users, Google is really trying to remove the need to sort of become a search expert, to have the right keywords and do multiple searches. Instead, Google wants to give them those answers in the way that people might be getting information from a smart friends. But to your point, this is potentially going to have really serious consequences for news publishers, for blogs, for other people, other creatives that publish information on the internet. They are worried that if people start to rely on these summaries rather than clicking on links, that they'll no longer need to read that first-party information and that people will lose the traffic from Google that often allows them to sell ads and make money. Now, Google does say that it will be still including links in those AI summaries. And the company actually told us that it believes that those links will now be getting more traffic than they would in a traditional ten blue links search results page. But kind of cold comfort at this point to news publishers who have for a long time had to sort of fight against the rising tide, the changing tides of Google in terms of how it delivers search traffic. They're worried that this could be a really significant change, Sara.",

So, I think we should expect China, Russia, or Iran, potentially other nation states, to try to both either cyberattack our infrastructure or, more likely, spread misinformation and to try to pit Americans against Americans. Secondly, I think we've got to acknowledge, in 2024, Americans, for whatever reason, are a lot more willing to believe crazy conspiracy theories, and a lot less willing to accept as truth things coming from the federal government. And then third is, as you pointed out before the break, John, artificial intelligence brings new tools where we could change with deep fakes your face, my face, our voices, in ways of scale and speed that are unprecedented.
