      "sentences": "Good morning. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.At any moment, President Biden will give what could be one of the most consequential speeches of his presidency when he delivers his final address to the United Nations General Assembly. Right now, Brazil's president is speaking. You can see him right there. President Biden is up next, we are told, as he looks to cement his foreign policy legacy against a backdrop of global crises, including the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East that is widening. This morning, it's threatening to explode into an all-out war in the region. CNN's Alex Marquardt and Kayla Tausche are at the U.N. this morning. Alex, let me start with you first. How will all of this impact what we see there today and how big of a moment is this for the president?",

      "sentences": "Well, no doubt, it is a big moment for him as he looks to this final speech at the U.N. General Assembly, talking about his priorities for from the past four years and those going forward, what has been done, what still needs to be done, and essentially talking about his accomplishments and cementing that foreign policy legacy, as you noted.But, Jim, this was already going to be a U.N. General Assembly where so much of the focus was on the war in Gaza. Now, it is even more focused on the Middle East with fears over this escalating conflict in Lebanon, concerns that the entire region is going to -- the war is going to expand across the region. And that really does highlight the fact that the U.S. has been playing a big role in trying to quiet both those conflicts in Lebanon and in Gaza, and has failed. The talks about the ceasefire are on ice in Gaza. The diplomatic efforts to get Hezbollah to pull back from the border, to get those tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border back into their homes, that has failed. So, no doubt, the president will be speaking about the Middle East, as will countless others. We're going to have a lot of conversations throughout the course of the next few days, and there will also be lots of meetings on the sidelines. This is going to be a major focus on the conversation, but at the same time, at this stage in his presidency, the president is also looking to talk about a number of other issues, the conflicts in Sudan and in Ukraine, climate change, A.I., competition with China. But there is going to be a real emphasis on the Middle East. And following Biden, you'll also hear from Middle Eastern leaders, from Turkey, from Jordan, from Qatar, who will emphasize their concerns, who will probably vent some of their anger towards Israel. So, this is a moment of countries coming together of talking about global cooperation, of highlighting the need to cooperate and talk to each other. But at the same time, there are stark differences between many of these countries here, Jim.",

What are you hearing in terms of his advisers and what they're saying about what we might hear in this speech?",

We can't tell whether or not that is the president who's about to get out of the limousine that you see staged right there. You did see some aides scrambling just a few moments ago.But, Alex Marquardt, as we're waiting for the president to arrive and deliver this speech, and, again, we might see images of the president here at any moment, I did want to ask you, over the summer -- and there is the president right there, that is President Biden entering the General Assembly with his U.N. ambassador by his side. So, he'll be speaking in just a few moments. But, Alex, I mean, set the stage for us over the summer. We heard the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, described these talks to bring some sort of ceasefire and hostage releases at the ten-yard line. That certainly was not the case.",

      "sentences": "We've seen all kinds of optimism, heard all kinds of optimism from various senior administration officials and most recently what we've been told is that the agreement that is on the table is 90 percent there. And so while that sounds like it's quite close, that final 10 percent is really going to be the hardest part.And what it comes down to, sources have told us, is that exchange of hostages for prisoners. You have more than 100 hostages, Israelis who are still being held -- Israelis and other nationals, I should note, being held by Hamas and other groups, around half of whom are still believed to be alive. And so there is still some negotiating about which Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons the Hamas would demand. At the same time, we've also heard Prime Minister Netanyahu talking about how they are refusing to leave. They will never leave that Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphia quarter, that that is critical for Israeli security. So, those do appear to be the two main sticking points. But at this point, Jim, what we're hearing increasingly from the mediators, Egypt, Qatar, and, of course, the United States, is that they just aren't sure whether the parties want a ceasefire. They do not know whether Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, wants a ceasefire in this moment. They don't know, frankly, whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants a ceasefire in this moment because it's clear that he believes that he still has things that he wants to accomplish, that he wants the Israeli military to accomplish when it comes to taking out Hamas inside Gaza. So, those conversations have essentially been stalled for most of the past few weeks, despite the fact that they do believe that they are relatively close. Now, you can imagine that those conversations are even farther back, even further stalled because of this escalation in Lebanon. So, what we're seeing now, Jim, is a very interesting moment where U.S. and Israeli officials are trying to delink, decouple the conflict in Gaza from the conflict in Lebanon so they can just get to a quiet stage on that northern border, that Northern Israeli border, the Southern Lebanese border with Hezbollah, and then turn their focus back to Gaza. We have heard Hezbollah say, no, the two are linked. Until there's quiet in Gaza, we're going to keep fighting. So, that is really one of the priorities right now to try to get quiet on those two fronts, Jim.",

That's going to happen in just a few moments from now.Kayla Tausche, I do want to address Ukraine for just a moment because that has also been a sort of hotly debated issue inside the administration among the U.S. and its allies over or not the Ukrainians will get permission from the United States to use those long range missiles against Russian targets. Perhaps we might hear something about that from the president. What do you think?",

I was just talking with the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, just a few moments ago, and he was being very cagey as to whether or not the U.K. was going to go along with this idea. It sounds as though that all of the U.S. and its allies are sort of waiting to see what the president, what the White House ultimately decides to do. And you're all too correct there, Kayla, may come down to this very critical meeting between the president and Volodymyr Zelenskyy coming up on Thursday.Alex Marquardt, back to you for just a moment. I mean, getting back to the situation in Lebanon we were just talking about the prospects for a ceasefire, a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. What has taken place over the last several days, really over the last week, we saw those exploding pagers last week and so on, has just really complicated things, I have to think, to a degree that is just going to be confounding for U.S. officials here in the coming days. I assume it's made it very complicated for the President in delivering this speech today and the message that he's going to get across to the United Nations.",

Israeli officials will say that, you know, Hezbollah essentially started that conflict on October 8th, started firing rockets into Northern Israel. Some 60,000 Israeli residents have had to leave that area. Same thing has happened on the other side of the border as Israel has responded. Now, of course, this situation has escalated significantly.So, while those Gaza ceasefire negotiations have been going on, there's been a simultaneous separate track led by a senior U.S. official named Amos Hochstein who is the -- essentially the envoy for Lebanon, who's been trying to come up with a deal that many felt was --",
