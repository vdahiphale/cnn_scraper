Hurricane Hilary is now a Category 2 hurricane. Evacuation warnings are already in place for parts of San Bernardino County, that area east of Los Angeles made up of mountain and foothill communities where mudslides and floods could be a huge threat. The storm is already bringing strong winds to Southern California. This video shows lightning from the outer bands early this morning in San Diego. The Navy is moving ships from its three bases in the area out to the sea until the storm passes. Hilary could bring a year's worth of rain in a single day to parts of the Southwestern US. Let's go straight to the CNN Weather Center and Derek Van Dam. They're going to be very busy tracking the storm. When is the storm expected to hit the US? What kind of timeline are we looking at right now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, the storm has sped up considerably.So we're looking more like a Sunday storm even though the outer rain bands, some of the moisture are already impacting Southern California and I'll show you that on the radar, but what do you need to know at home? Maybe you're tuning in from the West Coast, the storm is weakening. That's important. And heavy rains, this flood threat cannot be understated enough. And this slight shift to the East has implications on who will see the strongest winds. So let's get right to the details. Here's a look at the latest information Category 2, as Jim mentioned, 110 kilometers per hour. We are still about 350 miles south of San Diego, and this is the official forecast track from the National Hurricane Center. Notice the weakening storm, perhaps a low end Category 1 or tropical storm by the time it makes landfall likely across the central or Northern Baja Peninsula. This is a significant difference if you were tuning in yesterday at this time, we were thinking, this was a little further west just due to the topography here. This would be more of a Southern California type landfall. Not the case, but this is also going to bring the heaviest rainfall inland as well. Let me explain. Look at the wind gusts associated with this and you can see how they are kind of associated on the eastern flank of this storm. So we will get gusty winds over the western coastal region, so San Diego all the way to Los Angeles, gusting 30 to 40 miles per hour. But certainly the mountain ranges on the interior of Southern California will see wind gusts, tropical storm force as well. And these winds are going to come out of a southeasterly direction and why this is important or rather northeast because this is going to help influence the rain that is going to pick up in intensity here. There are several mountain ranges across this area intermittent between the desert southwest, but these mountains will act as a barrier for this kind of let's say, a sponge in the atmosphere to just wring itself out. So all the available moisture will literally fall in the form of rain. It will fall on the mountain peaks and then start to work its way into the valleys and the communities below. Eastern sections of San Bernardino County under some -- sections of that county currently under evacuation orders and look at the flood watches that extend as far north as Idaho -- Jim.",

The leaders of that community held a press conference, basically calling out Governor Josh Green demanding that they be included in discussions on how much time the community needs to grieve and heal before they reopen, how to rebuild this place that has so much cultural importance to them, and that everything is transparent.

I want to show you a map now to show you the two communities most at risk right now. It is again Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories and then Kelowna. I want to start with the situation in Kelowna, though, because that really took people by surprise. This was a fire that had started on Tuesday and then all of a sudden started to spread in that community. Thankfully, no loss of life, but the firefighters are still battling that blaze, several blazes in fact, and they have had to evacuate thousands of people. I want you to listen now to the fire chief from West Kelowna talking about how they've had a reprieve, but that is still a difficult situation ahead. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON BROLUND, WEST KELOWNA FIRE CHIEF: The winds died down. We didn't see the dramatic, you know, glow in the sky necessarily in as many places as we had the night before. So I guess, if you could call that a reprieve, it was. But don't think for a second that it wasn't totally unprecedented last night after a totally unprecedented day of firefighting yesterday.

They've caught some breaks there, too, Jim, and that is because of the wind and the weather conditions have allowed them to continue to fight that fire so that they can protect the community. But certainly some tense days ahead. And I wanted to say Jim, and speaking about the situation in Hawaii with Bill's great reporting from there. It is the presence of mind that officials have here in Canada that they want to make sure that people are not stranded in these communities, especially in a place like Yellowknife, very difficult to get in and out, which is why they basically created a ghost town there so they continue to battle these blazes. The weather helping out right now, but they are still especially with the wind not being too careful and say that they'll have more to tell residents in the coming days about when they can actually come back.",

JOE WALSH, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, ILLINOIS: Jim, I agree -- what debate? I mean that, what debate? Look, this is Trump's world. I'm a broken record, Jim Acosta. This is Trump's world. This is Trump's party. This nomination was always going to be his, whether he didn't have an indictment or had a hundred indictments. He will dominate this week next week. No Monday press conference, but he'll show up and have an interview with Tucker Carlson the night of the debate. He'll probably turn himself in down in Georgia, the day of the debate.
