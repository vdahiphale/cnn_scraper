We have seen this in other moments. The cameras are allowed in for a moment to kind of scene set each day in the courtroom.This is Donald Trump moments before he is set to take the stand and be under oath to take questioning from the judge in this civil fraud trial in New York. As he was entering court a moment ago, he spoke to the reporters and cameras in the hallway. He attacked the case, he attacked the judge, he attacked attorney general and then made a campaign speech. Now, what happens next could decide his future as a businessman, the future of his empire, business empire, and also impact his presidential aspirations, and the other criminal cases where he is a defendant in.",

And those people you saw on the sides there, those were several of the political aides to the former president who are working on his 2024 campaign, just to give you a sense of who is actually in the room for this testimony before Trump moves from where he is sitting there to actually getting on the witness stand in just a few moments from now.And you are right, Kate, we did just hear from the former president. He came out and spoke, as he typically does, before he goes into the courtroom. It likely won't be the last time that we hear from him in front of the cameras today, though, of course, what he says in front of the camera is a lot different than what he actually says once he's under oath. And that is what we are watching so closely for. And it was noticeable that we also heard from the attorney general here, Letitia James. She has not always been at every single appearance here in every day of this trial, but she did come out, she was on these steps just behind us a few moments ago. And I should note that she was basically predicting exactly what Trump was about to say. Right now, you can see he is -- we are told that he is being sworn in, he is taking that oath before he gets on the stand. And so that's really the big question here, is what he says once he is actually under oath. Because what so much of this is focused on is who directed who to make these statements, these statements that the judge has already ruled that were found to be inflated, that they used to secure those loans. Trump's defense of that has been, well, no one was actually hurt here. These businesses were repaid their loans. There's no victim, he claims, except for himself here. And the question is who he actually pushes the blame on to, because you've seen his adult sons testifying who were put in charge of the Trump Organization when he took office, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. looking to the -- an outside accounting firm that they hired, Eric Trump saying that that also was not his responsibility. That's going to be a question for Trump, the structure of the Trump Organization. And so that is notable here, of course. And I should note that we did hear from Letitia James. I want to play just a few moments of what she said before she went inside this courthouse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, this is the stuff that you'd ask any witness before beginning testimony. And we expect that most of the questions today will focus on the valuation of his properties, properties like 40 Wall Street, his Doral Golf Club, and also Mar-a-Lago. And that's one that's really sensitive for him.We heard him already talk about this as he was entering the courtroom. The judge has found that the value of that property was around $18 million, something that Trump and his lawyers have taken issue with. But the challenge for Trump, while he is under questioning by prosecutors, is to stay composed and stick to the script that his lawyers have guided him through during their preparation. And that is to emphasize that there were disclaimers in all of these valuations and also emphasize the fact that valuing properties is an art, not a science. But this case gets to something very close to his heart, which is his identity as a business tycoon. We know he has pretty thin skin. So, this is a test for him, if he can remain composed. We know he can do this because he has taken the witness stand before, many, many years ago, long before he was a candidate for the White House. But right now, while he's on the witness stand, his legal and political interests diverge and we will all be watching to see if he can keep his answers concise, honest and hopefully along the lines of what his lawyers have prepared him to say.",

And remember, there are seven different claims here -- again, we're in civil court, not criminal court -- seven different claims made by the attorney general's office here. The judge has already ruled for the A.G. against Donald Trump on one of them, something called persistent fraud. For that claim, it doesn't matter whether there are actual victims who are out of pocket or not. And I think that's one of the reasons the judge ruled against Trump on that one claim.But some of these other six claims, it does matter whether there's a victim or not. What you're going to hear, I'm sure, what we'll hear from Trump on the stand, is that these loans, these enormous loans that he took out from Deutsche Bank and other banks, were not only repaid, but repaid with interest. And so the argument -- and this is an atmospheric argument, but for some of the claims, it's also a legal argument, the argument is, how could there be victims of people not only got repaid, but made profits?",

You know, he gets a little bit defensive, I think, over his kids and his monetary worth, his net worth. So, I think they're going to start very quickly going into the actual facts of the case here. And, you know, Michael Cohen, if you credit his testimony, don't forget, he specifically said, we knew what Trump wanted. Trump would say, oh, this came back at $1 billion. No, I'm worth $4 billion.

That is how he has tried to paint himself in this case as a martyr, as a victim, a target of political bias. That is the first time we have seen the sort of campaign rhetoric so far on the witness stand. Now, we'll see if he leaves it there or if he takes it even further attacking anyone else.

It's not doing anything for him. It's not adding to any of the elements of what he's being accused of. It's not going to his liability. It's just sort of taking him off course. And I would just add, too, that we were discussing before, his statement that no one lost money, people made money. One of the themes of all of these offenses that we're looking at, for example, falsifying business records, is the intent to defraud or deceive or injure another person. That doesn't require that that person or that partner, that company lost money at all. And, in fact, one would argue that just because they didn't lose money, they still could have earned or made more money. So, there is that injury, there is that damage.

This is also something that actually came up with both of his sons. Sometimes there were yes or no questions that they got and instead of answering yes or no, they would launch into speeches. So, it is difficult sometimes for former President Trump and certain members of his family to be concise. This is a man who is used to having rallies, people who came to hear him speak at length.

The judge even said, according to these notes, that, look, you can attack me, do whatever you want, but answer the question. And that's similar to what we heard from the judge a short time ago, instructing the former president not to filibuster, not to give speeches, but to answer the question that he is being asked by the attorney general's office. He also noted that the comment Trump made, that he always rules against him, is not true. And, once again, he asked Trump to, quote, please just answer the question.

And it does appear that he is creating somewhat of a sideshow, giving little speeches and even attacking the judge. So, we'll see how this continues.",

I mean, he's got five attorneys in the room, three who are -- two who are seated up there with him. He's speaking directly to Trump when he's saying this.And this is actually a refrain that we've heard from the judge here saying, you know, you can go after me all you want, but don't go after my staff. I mean, we have to remember this is a judge that Trump has already off on bad footing with because he's been fined $15,000 by him for violating the gag order not to attack the law clerk who was actually seated to the right of the judge in there today. And I think that's what's notable here is that the judge is taking that moment to speak directly to him and say, you can attack me all you want, but you do have to actually answer the question that's at play. So, obviously, he's only been under oath for about 22 minutes, Kate and John, and this is already -- we're seeing the sparring happening back and forth between the judge and Trump. Of course, we do expect it to continue as this testimony goes on.",
