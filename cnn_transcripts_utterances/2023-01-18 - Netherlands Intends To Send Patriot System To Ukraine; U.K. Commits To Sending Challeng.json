It has about 90 people in it. What General Zelewski (ph) and the Ukrainians are looking for are multiple tank divisions of 300, 600 vehicles as the General said in December.That takes a long time. And even with 14 challenger tanks, it's going to take a significant requirement to train Ukrainian soldiers on that very modern, technologically advanced weapon system that the U.K. is giving. That's very different from the T-72s that they've been fighting on. And in addition to that, they have to have the repair parts, the capability to conduct the repair and resupply these vehicles with ammunition. So, again, you won't see -- they may be -- the U.K. may be given these 14 tanks to Ukraine, but you will not see them on the battlefield within days. It will probably be within weeks. Just like the 50 Bradley systems that the United States are given the Ukrainians, they are now beginning the training on those vehicles at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels training area in Germany, a place where I know very well. So it will take a long time to get the familiarization and the crew training before those pieces of equipment can be found on the battlefield.",
