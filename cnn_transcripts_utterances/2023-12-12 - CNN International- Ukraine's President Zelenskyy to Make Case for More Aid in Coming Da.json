Then he heads over here to the White House for another meeting with President Biden, and then the two leaders will proceed to have a joint press conference.Of course, Zelenskyy is hoping that his visit here can break the impasse that we have seen on Capitol Hill. Now over the issue of the billions of dollars in additional funding for Ukraine that has been such a priority for the White House but has in recent weeks become completely tangled up in the very fraught and complicated politics of immigration and border policy. What U.S. officials have been trying to warn for weeks is that time is up and that there isn't another pool of money that the U.S. government can tap into. You know, other officials have also told CNN that this is a situation where the world is watching, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. One U.S. official saying that when this supplemental package didn't move forward in the Senate last week that they very much noted that Russian state media celebrated this news. They're also saying that a failure to continue to fund Ukraine would send a bad message to any of the would be aggressors that are paying close attention to all of this. But at this moment in time, the prospects of this additional funding getting approved before the end of the year looking very grim. MJ Lee, CNN, the White House.

They're not saying that they are going to take up these questions immediately, but they have promised a prompt response. And look, timing is really the big issue here. The special counsel knows these questions likely have to be resolved for this case to stay on track and be on time ahead of the election next year. Now Trump is litigating these issues, as is his right, but that litigation can take a really long time to go through all the steps. You start at the District Court where he's lost, goes to the appellate court, maybe even then the full appellate court, and then the Supreme Court. That could take over a year. So the special counsel is insisting to the Supreme Court that look, it is an issue of public importance that voters understand what the resolution of this case is before they vote next year, and that is why they want the Supreme Court to take up these issues, decide them so they can move ahead with their case in March.
