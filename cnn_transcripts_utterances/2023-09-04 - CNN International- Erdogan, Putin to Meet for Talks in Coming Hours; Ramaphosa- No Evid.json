      "sentences": "Africa in particular and Russia is making a great point out of that. When President Putin met in St. Petersburg recently with those African leaders, his point was, it's not my fault that our grain is not getting through. So what TASS, the Russian news agency is saying that Putin and Erdogan will discuss will be the UN Grain Deal -- the original Black Sea Grain Deal. Possibly the use of Turkey as a midpoint for Russian to Europe, gas, natural gas.And the other thing that Putin is going to put forward apparently, according to TASS, according to their sources, is the Russian idea of a new Black Sea Grain Deal for them, whereby their grain goes to, goes to Turkey and then is on shipped from there. This is something that they say is supported by Qatar. Obviously, that's something of a red line for the Ukrainians who are saying you need to thwart -- you need to thwart any efforts by Russia to sort of circumvent the Black Sea Grain Deal, the UN Secretary General wrote to Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, last week and said here we have a concrete plan for you. These are the proposals. These are the steps. The Russian pushback on that is we're given promises, not guarantees. But I think it's worth resetting and remembering here that Russia's war of choice led to its inability to get its grain and fertilizer at a global market. The war it started is the cause of its pain. But it does appear as if Russia wants more out of the deal. They pulled out a month ago. Ukraine wants to keep going with it.",

Now you'll remember this intriguing story and these images of thissanctioned Russian vessel arriving in South Africa in December. And now the very unusual move from the U.S. government through their ambassador criticizing South Africa, saying they had evidence that weapons and ammunitions was loaded back onto that vessel bound for Russia. And for his part, the ambassador saying, we are confident that weapons were loaded onto that vessel and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion.

So this latest wrinkle may ease tensions somewhat.You did go through a period of the most tense, I think diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa for some years. There is a sense that that is easing. You have a major economic summit here in Johannesburg in the coming months that will be attended by senior. U.S. officials, I'm sure. But the question remains is, are the efforts of the U.S. and Europe to isolate Putin working when you have countries like South Africa and all over the African continent and Asia that seem much more willing to do business with Russia.

A rare instance of the Holy Father publicly addressing the issue of religion in China. CNN's Michael Holmes has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A gathering of the faithful, in one of the smallest and most remote communities of Catholics in the world. On Sunday, Pope Francis celebrated mass in Mongolia, a country with a population of around 3 million people, but only about 1,500 are Catholics. And nearly all of them came to see the pontiff. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I'm so happy that Pope Francis visited Mongolia. I got emotional when I attended mass. I think it furthered my spirit. I'm very, very thankful. HOLMES (voice-over): But Vatican watchers say this trip to Mongolia wasn't just about spreading the church's message to a country where no Pope has visited before. It was also strategic and a chance to ease tension with two of Mongolia's neighbors, China and Russia. Relations between the Vatican and Moscow have deteriorated since the invasion of Ukraine. And there have been tensions with Beijing over its treatment of religious minorities and a controversial agreement to jointly appoint bishops in China. But on Saturday, in words thought to be directed at China and Russia, the Pope said the Church is not a threat to governments and secular institutions. And during mass, he made yet another overturned by sending greetings to his Chinese followers. POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): To the people, I wish the best and to go ahead. Always make progress. To Chinese Catholics, I ask you to be good Christians and good citizens. HOLMES (voice-over): Some small groups of worshippers traveled from China for the service, which was more of a low-key affair than other papal trips that can draw over a million people.
