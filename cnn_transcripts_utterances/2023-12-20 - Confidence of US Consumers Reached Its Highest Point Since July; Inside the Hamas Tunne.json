And we are seeing that people in the month of December are feeling much better about the economy, and that's great news.The index at 110.7, rising from the previous month, which was at about 102, the highest since July. And then there is the present situation, how people are feeling right now, that's 148.5, that is up more than 10 index points. And expectations, which is really important is how people feel the economy is going to be doing over the next six months. For the past few months, that number has been below 80, and that usually indicates that people are feeling like a recession is coming. Now that that number is above 80, it's 85.6, it is encouraging. People are feeling like we're going to potentially avoid a recession. And when you look at who is feeling this way, it's across all age groups, but particularly people between 35 and 54 are feeling the most optimistic right now.",

Israeli military officials say that since October 7th, they have discovered some 1,500 tunnel shafts in Gaza, all part of a vast underground world that is complicating Israel's war against Hamas. Many of these shafts are located in civilian areas and inside civilian structures. The largest discovered on Sunday is wide enough for a large vehicle and is equipped with electricity, ventilation, and communication systems inside that tunnel. Joining us with more on this, one of the Western journalists who was allowed inside to get a look, Ronen Bergman. You're a staff writer for \"The New York Times Magazine\" and author of \"Rise and Kill First, The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations.\" It is a dense book and it reads like a novel. It's very well done. Ronen, thank you so much for joining us. [10:35:00] First of all, you went into these tunnels, one of these major, the biggest one so far, and took some stunning photos. I'm curious just what your initial impression was being inside of that massive tunnel. RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE AND AUTHOR OF \"RISE AND KILL FIRST, THE SECRET HISTORY OF ISRAEL'S TARGETED ASSASSINATIONS\":  Thanks. Thanks, Sara. It's not just being inside the tunnel. Being inside the tunnel, it is in a walkable distance from the Israeli border. You see when you -- actually walking from the -- some of us prefer to walk from the Israeli border, you see the ruins of the towers, the communication centers and the automatic machine, that's the Hamas destroyed the first day of the attack. And then you look at the tunnel, this is the biggest tunnel the IDF told us that they have found so far. In fact, off the record with some confidential sources, they say that they were not -- they didn't know that Hamas built such a tunnel that the big car, maybe a small truck can go through. In fact, they found in one of the raids on Hamas headquarters, they found a video of Muhammad Sinwar, the brother of the leader of Hamas, who is the leader of the tunnel project driving his -- in his private car in the passenger seat through this tunnel. And the feeling was, first of all, I don't want to say admiration, but respect towards the -- this kind of unbelievable, digging capabilities while knowing that this was done instead of building Gaza, they built tunnels. Second, the fact that Israeli intelligence missed that, and Israeli leaders did not devote enough tension -- enough attention to destroy those towns. And third, this was just about -- just by the border with Israel. And so, walking there, I think, gave a very clear understanding per the constructing -- construction and military capabilities of Hamas.",

You touched on this, and I want to go back to it. Israel's intelligence agencies have always had this reputation of being almost all-knowing about what is happening in and around Israel, October 7th really tore that reputation apart. And then when it comes to these tunnels, I mean, did their scale and their technological intricacies and the vast network surprise, not only the military but some of your sources at high levels in the intelligence agencies?",

So, Hamas was planning its invasion into Israel with this kind, they called it the orchard because of the shape, the orchard tunnel. They didn't know it's so big, but they know that they exist, they destroyed some of them in 2014.And the Israeli conclusion was to build a massive subterrain fence or barrier that was successful. It stopped the attacking tunnels from crossing into Israel. This was an achievement, a technological achievement, an intelligence achievement, understanding that, but it led to a catastrophe. Because while the Israelis felt that they basically stopped the big plan, we now know that the code name is Jericho, Jericho North (ph).

You mentioned, I was at the event this morning in Urbandale with Governor DeSantis, and he said that he believes what the Colorado Supreme Court ruled was wrong. He believes the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn it. But he also said that whether or not it is fair, that is the kind of thing that follows Former President Trump, and he made that as a case for why Iowa Republican voters should look at him instead of the former president.So, you know, there -- he's careful to criticize the Supreme Court ruling, the Colorado Supreme Court ruling, but also use it as an example of why voters should look away from Former President Trump.",

The folks who are in Former President Trump's camp are pretty staunchly in Former President Trump's camp. There's a very small slice of that pie that remains open to a different candidate. Those supporters are in his camp and they're not budging for anything. And this Colorado Supreme Court ruling, I highly doubt will be anything that changes that either.So, that leaves Governor DeSantis and Nikki Haley, sort of, competing for a smaller piece of the Iowa Republican electorate here as they try to be the candidate that has a late charge here in Iowa. And that has happened in the past, that still could happen, and be someone that gets closer to the former president, at least comes out of the state, if not beating Trump, at least with some momentum.",

About Trump's comments where he said that immigrants are poisoning the blood of America and how it impacts their vote. And here's what it looks like. They're more likely to vote for him, 42 percent. It's a really high number. What does that tell you about voters in Iowa and the rhetoric that he's -- that -- that's been used?

They believe the same thing, and it doesn't bother them what kind of historical context something like that may or may not have. And then there's other people and in that same pool, another 30 percent said it doesn't change their mind one way or the other.So, you have seven out of 10 people that it actually proves their opinion of him or it doesn't matter at all. They hear things like that and say, oh, I wish he wouldn't say things like that, but it doesn't change their mind about supporting him because they have their other reasons for supporting him.
