They have all pardoned people in an icky way. You know, we can even say it's probably the ickiest of the powers the president has. Literally, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, everybody has issued at least one pardon or two that people on both sides of the aisle have disagreed with. And I think this is now becoming that one. It's a perfectly plausible and reasonable exercise of the pardon power, if you regard it as this vast power the presidents have. The problem was that he said he wasn't going to do it, and either wasn't candid with the American people, or changed his mind on something that seemed like a no brainer and could have just stayed silent on it.",

I believe if Kamala Harris had won, Donald Trump -- Joe Biden would never have pardoned his son. I think he would have believed in the faith of the Justice Department, but I do not believe he thinks that it's going to work under the next Trump administration because they are showing us with the people they are putting in charge, that they are not planning to follow the law. It is not planning to be normal. People like Kash Patel in charge, that's going to be the problem.

I report about immigration, so I have been on the ground with working people quite a bit in my career, but it wasn't just the price of groceries. It wasn't just -- it's the whole structure of work. People are doing contract work. They're working night shifts, day shifts. And also, the... The way that people are communicating now, very often the only source of information that people had in Allentown was through their mobile phones.
