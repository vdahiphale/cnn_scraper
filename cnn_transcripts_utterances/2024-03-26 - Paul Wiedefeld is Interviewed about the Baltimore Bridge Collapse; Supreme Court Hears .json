The question here is, how broad will access be?Now, the FDA, back in 2000, first approved Mifepristone. And then in 2016 and 2021 it expanded access, for example, by allowing Mifepristone to be mailed to patients rather than dispensed in person. And so those expansions and access are what's being challenged today. Now, the consequences here are enormous either way because many patients apparently rely on these expanded procedures in order to get Mifepristone, and that's the specific legal issue that's going to be argued in the court today.",

And since that happened, Sara, two years ago, about 20 states have either eliminated or - or scaled back availability to abortion substantially. And so as a result, as you saw in the last hour from Meg Tirrell, our medical expert, the reliance on Mifepristone and use of Mifepristone has gone up because it's become a more important alternative for women seeking abortion.So, it's all interrelated here. That will certainly lurk large in the policy background.",

Governor, thank you so much for being with us. And just to remind people what has happened in your state is the state legislature overrode a veto of yours to enact a ban on abortions before, I believe it's, what, 12 weeks in your state right now? So, this is something you've been dealing with every day. What are you watching for in the Supreme Court today? How important is this decision to the people of your state? GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): It's very important. We need to protect women's reproductive freedom as much as we can. And it's really outrageous that this case has even gotten to the Supreme Court. It's clear that extremists brought this case in order to reduce access to reproductive freedom for women. And what's so ironic is that the Supreme Court, when they took away a woman's constitutional right, at the same time they gave the states the ability to regulate abortion care. With this case they're considering now, they can take part of that regulation authority away from states who have legalized abortion. So, they would be going back on what they said. Mifepristone is a safe and effective drug being used for more than two decades by 5 million people. It's so much safer for women. If they don't have this avenue, in many situations, they have to use surgical procedures. So, we're hoping that the Supreme Court does the right thing today.

      "sentences": "Hi, Sara.This is a busy area, as you can see, any hour of the day, even at 1:30 in the morning, a lot of traffic there. That's why there's been so much concern about trying to find anyone there. The technology they've deployed from the beginning as best they could, even in the darkness, infrared detectors operating from the air and land, above the water, looking for any heat signatures of anybody out there. Surface, searching by boat and aircraft. Divers now in the water, as you note. Very difficult in the dark to do anything. And side scan sonar, which they had down there, which they said did detect some cars under the water. This is, however, very grim work in these temperatures. Remember, most people in 10, 20, 30 minutes lose most of their motor skills to do much of anything, even if they want to rescue themselves. So, as I said, grim work, difficult work right now, even by the daylight. At the same time, a lot of the attention is turning towards the investigation as to what exactly happened with this ship because early information will really matter. This is a massive cargo ship. It's not the biggest, but it's still plenty big. More than three times as long as a football field, about half as wide as a football field is long. One way of looking about it is to say that this would be the equivalent of having a building in a town turned sideways because the ship itself weighs more than 100 - more - close to 100,000 tons, and then it carries much, much more than that. It's like tipping a building sideways and having it go down the river. We've looked more at the tracking of it here as it headed out toward the Chesapeake Bay. Back here, when this ship started out, as it first pulled out it was doing about three miles an hour based on tracking mechanisms that you can look out there. By the time this happened, it was about nine miles an hour. So, that's not fast for most of us in our cars, but with that amount of weight, tremendous power. And one thing I really think we're looking at, and I know investigators are looking at, a short while ago John was talking with one of the officials there and they were talking about how this ship more likely would have been somewhere about here, which would have been where the center of that span when it came through here. Instead, it's over here to the right. And you can just barely see it here. It's not easy to see on this, at this distance. But when you watch the video, all of it, very carefully, of the ship approaching, you can see there really does appear to be a fairly marked swerving to the right as it approaches the bridge here. This would have been under the control of one of the harbor pilots, one of the people who works here, not a ship pilot, as was confirmed a short while ago. These are people who are expert, some of the highest paid government workers in this country, harbor pilots all around the country, because it is such delicate, such difficult work. And yet for some reason there was this slight hook to the right as it approached the bridge there. Maybe already headed that way, but then you see this movement toward the right. All of this being looked at investigators. Maybe some of it doesn't really mean anything. Maybe it means everything. But as daylight comes on and they continue looking for those survivors, we hope - we hope, they also have to look at why did this happen and what happens now. Sara.",

You are looking at the Chesapeake Bay. And, of course, into a more hyperlocal look, this is the Patapsco River. And right now, with these types of water temperatures, the survivability rate of people who have come in contact with that type of water is roughly between one to three hours. We're now entering into the seventh hour of this event. And for search and rescue operations, other things complicating matters, not only on the surface of the water, but out of the water, are the wins and also the tides and the currents. We currently have a coastal flood advisory across the entire Chesapeake Bay, including where the bridge collapse occurred, roughly at 1:30 this morning. And we just passed high tide, which was at 8:20 this morning. So now we're going to experience a reversal of the tides. And remember, tides, at the moment, with a full moon, are exaggerated. So we get higher than high normal tides and lower than low normal tides. And so that is going to create some currents as they try to navigate these very difficult waters.
