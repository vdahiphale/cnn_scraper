A flirtatious smile could be the mistake that trips up the man that police are calling a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the Wednesday killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. This newly released surveillance footage capturing the man smiling after the clerk at the hostel he was staying at asked him to lower his mask. A source tells CNN he used a fake New Jersey driver's license when checking in. That was on Manhattans upper west side, and there is also new video of the suspect suspected gunman on an e-bike escaping from the crime scene and heading towards Central Park. As far as his trip to New York, sources tell CNN he got there by greyhound bus ten days before the shooting. The bus route started in Atlanta, but it's unclear if that's where he first boarded the bus. The words \"delay\" and \"depose\" were found on a live round and a shell casing at the murder scene. Sources tell CNN, UnitedHealthcare's parent company was aware of threats against its executives. We're joined now by Scott Duffey. He is a retired supervisory FBI special agent, director of the Criminal Justice Institute of Wilmington University. Scott, thanks very much for being with us this morning. That hostile image where he was apparently asked to show them his smile. Is that going to be the thing that ultimately undoes this case for him? SCOTT DUFFEY, SUPERVISORY FBI SPECIAL AGENT (RET.):  Yeah. Good morning, Kasie, and thank you for having me on this morning. It's definitely a step closer. So we've seen all these video footages that law enforcement has been getting and then releasing to the public with regards to a white male. A light skinned male, however he's been described with the hoodie some sort of face mask that's covering the lower portion of his face. And then to have this photo that's just -- it's just a better part of evidence to lead to the identity of this individual. And you can see already what they're tracking, the fact of a Greyhound bus where he stayed a few days before. The fact that he may have an electric bike as his escape means of transportation, these are all just fantastic pieces.",

Not only his mode of travel, but where he stayed, and then leading up to the hours of the shooting. So finding that backpack is key to law enforcement, not only the backpack itself, but its contents. And so with -- with every day going by without him captured and additional evidence that he might have left behind, yeah, that's a concern to law enforcement but they still have plenty of ground to cover.",

And they've got the king of England, of all heads of state, you know, he's the head of state there I don't know, there's some complication to go there. I have to have you can imagine a chat with King Charles, can't you, between Donald Trump, you know, when he visits at some point about whether or not he should take over Canada, I don't know. I think people take what he says and what he does is two very different things. But there is genuine concern in Canada certainly about these tariffs because the majority of their trade goes into America. If it happens, it will decimate the economy. But, you know, will he do it?
