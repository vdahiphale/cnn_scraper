But then he turns and I think made a very, very strong plea for, do it now.I mean, he talks about the missile coming from Russia taking three minutes to hit Dnipro where all those people died in the apartment building. And then he says this is a time crisis, and speed is of the essence right now. I think what he's doing, especially to the Europeans and to the Americans is saying, you know, you talk a lot. And he refers to that. Putin invades, and it takes weeks, you know, for the Europeans to get it together to respond. The United States is slow as well. So, he's saying there is no more time, you know. We need -- speed is necessary for both decisions and actions. An action that he's talking about right now is more weapons that he feels are crucial for Ukraine right now, not only to defend itself but to push the Russians back. So, it was a very, very interesting talk. And, Kate, one more thing that I think he was doing, although it came in the question with Fareed was, he was saying Russian society has to open its eyes. You know, there are actually some people in Moscow who went out in the cold in -- right in Moscow to lay flowers at a Ukrainian monument. Actually, not far from the CNN bureau in fact. I've been there many times. And -- in honor and memory of the people who died in that apartment building. And so, what he's saying is, you know, this is -- Russian society has to realize what the government is doing. And that, I think, is a message you know, directed to Russians.

In addition, you showed us right there, several members of the House Freedom Caucus, people who are on the far right added to the House Oversight Committee that includes Congressman Paul Gosar.

Someone who has been -- who has admitted to lying extensively about his resume, did get two committee assignments that are considered lowered-tier committee assignments, the Small Business Committee and the science committee.
