CNN now projecting that Democrats will maintain control of the US Senate following a close, but pivotal victory in Nevada. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto projected to narrowly win reelection, beating her Republican challenger, Adam Laxalt. She spoke about that victory earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-NV): We've known this was going to be a tough campaign, but like all of you, I'm a Nevadan and I know what it takes to deliver for my home state. So, when the national pundits said I couldn't win, I knew Nevada would prove them wrong. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, the vote count statewide is showing that Hobbs is just slightly ahead of Lake, but as you indicated, Fredricka, this is too early to call. So what is taking place right now? Here in Maricopa County, which is the most populous county in the State of Arizona, it is a diligent process. The count is taking place. It is a slower process because of the amount, the volume of mail-in ballots that were dropped off on Election Day. We are anticipating that that will be a large part of what is released this evening. The county expecting about 75,000 to 80,000 votes to be included in tonight's election drop. This is the Lake campaign's path. We are hearing this from sources within the Lake campaign saying they will be looking at this very closely. Now, despite how important this all is, what you're still hearing from Kari Lake as she has made this claim a number of times, that there is something wrong with this process just because of how long it is taking. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We're waiting for the vote to be counted. You know, I consider someone's vote their voice. I think of it as a sacred vote and it is being trampled the way we run our elections in Arizona. I've been sounding the alarm for two years. Nothing got done, very little got done last legislative session and we need to get in there and restore faith in our elections. We can't be the laughingstock of elections anymore here in Arizona and when I'm Governor I will not allow it. I just won't. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He should be coming up on this stage any minute now. That's what we're being told. This arena full of people who may have voted for him, when you look at the demographics. So, let's take a look. Raphael Warnock: This is from an exit poll of the last election, 81 percent of Georgia voters of color voted for Raphael Warnock, 69 percent were between the ages of 18 and 29. So, he just hammered that youth vote; and 68 percent of urban voters. Now, that's when you look at Raphael Warnock. But when you look at Herschel Walker, his number is completely different and it really just shows why this election was so close and why we are on our way to a runoff election in less than four weeks. Take a look at the numbers we have for Walker voters from the exit poll from just a week ago now, 70 percent of White voters voted for Herschel Walker, 58 percent were 65 and older, and he got the majority of rural voters as well. That's why we will see Herschel Walker later today in Peachtree Georgia, just South of Atlanta, where you're going to have a much more rural population and a much wider demographic than you would have in the City of Atlanta. I want you to hear from Raphael Warnock and also from a congressperson who is supporting Herschel Walker. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. AUSTIN SCOTT (R-GA): I absolutely hope that Donald Trump is making robocalls to all of his supporters, asking Herschel Walker -- asking them to go support Herschel Walker. Now, let's be honest about what happened in Georgia. You know, the Democratic Party spent a couple of hundred million dollars talking about Herschel Walker and Herschel's experiences in life. SEN.

Now, having said that, they still need a couple of races where they are behind to break their way to possibly get to 218. But even if they don't, certainly having the Senate is important, because it prevents Republicans from passing through Congress message bills that they believe would be difficult for Biden to veto. The most tangible impact is it allows them to continue confirming Judges, which has been one of their big under the radar successes in his first two years, and it also gives them more leverage in the standoffs that are to come on things like the debt ceiling next fall. So, there are big practical implications, but certainly, by historic standards, if you look at the backdrop of what people said, you know, kind of their views about the state of the country, Democrats just dodged an -- avoided an outcome that could have been vastly worse.",

Even if a majority of the party is now resistant to the idea of nominating him, again, which may be the case after Tuesday's results, the Republican primary rules, Fred, really -- presidential nominating primary rules -- really favor whoever has the largest bloc.The Democratic rules are much more proportional, the Republican rules are much more winner take all. People forget that in 2016, Trump was already the presumptive nominee before he had won 50 percent of the vote in any State, and what that means is if he still has the biggest single piece of the party, he is going to be tough to beat, especially if the side of the party which tends to be the college-educated Republicans splinter among various alternatives, which is what happened in 2016. It could happen again, with candidates like Glenn Youngkin and Ron DeSantis, and some of the others. And the other problem is, does anybody think Trump is just going to go away quietly, if he is defeated for the nomination? I mean, there's a little bit in his language already, like, you know, nice party you have there, it would be a shame if anything happens to it. And so I think, managing a process in which Trump does not win, but does not effectively burn down the Republican Party, if he doesn't, is going to be very difficult and require a lot more dexterity than Republican leaders have shown over the last six years, when essentially, however much they have grumbled in private. They have gone along with Trump, whatever he has done in public for fear of alienating his base.",

What is important, though, is that this election has been a victory for the people, for the candidates who had the courage to run in the face of any predictions, for the grassroots people, VIPs that are volunteers in politics, knocking on millions of doors to get out the vote.Don't ever underestimate -- now see, I'm a former party chair. So, I'm on the ground, you have to own the ground, and owning the ground took us to the place that we are now much closer to victory than anyone would have predicted. And, of course, our President, President Biden and President Obama being out there to make people aware of the importance of this election, and that the prospects were that we could win to offset some of the punditry that were wedded to the past where we know elections are about the future. But I don't-- I don't really get into Republican caucus politics, that's up to them. But nonetheless, we still think we have a chance to win this, but nobody would have ever expected that we would be this -- well, we expected it, but shall we say, conventional wisdom, however, conventional of us, how unwise it was. But let me just salute the Senate. This is so -- such a cause for a celebration. Chuck Schumer was so correct when he said it was a victory for the people and for the country. I personally know that it is a joy to Harry Reid, in heaven as he is that his State came through with the victory that gave us the majority in the Senate.",

They told us, you know, this had happened just four days ago, when the Russians were leaving.There is no internet and phone service in the city here. So, when we were in the Central Square earlier on today, we saw people clustered around some of the army vehicles, because they've got satellite links, and they were trying to get on the Wi-Fi, so they could be in touch with loved ones and the rest of the country to tell them they were okay. By late in the day, the government had set up a mobile cellphone service. It wasn't actually quite broadcasting, but the equipment was there in place, but this whole city is in a desperate situation. The TV tower here was blown up by the Russians just before the left, just because they could. We went to the hospital today, we talked to a doctor there and he told us they don't have electricity. A lot of equipment had been looted by the Russians. When they do surgery, he said, they do surgery by the light of their cell phones. So it is a very, very tough situation. The booby traps and possibility of mines, the government is concerned about that. There are an increasing number of soldiers here. But again, it's a big job. This was a city of a quarter million people until a few months ago. So it is a big city for them to go through and check out all the facilities but electricity will make a huge difference here.

So, that's a worry. The military offensive, it is clear that the Ukrainians are still trying to push and probe the Russian forces on the other side of the river. Quite how that is progressing isn't clear. It's going to be tough, but I don't think that they are not stopping at this city. That's very clear. The war is far, far from over.",
