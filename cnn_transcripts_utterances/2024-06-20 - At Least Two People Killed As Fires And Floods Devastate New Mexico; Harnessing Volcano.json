The warnings were going off nonstop. One of the main arteries that is being used for residents to evacuate the area is -- was -- parts of it were flooding along that -- along that roadway. So just an intense situation. Now, the weather forecast calls for more rain again today, so that could be something we see happen again, although that rain is also the one thing that is going to provide fast and much-needed relief for these firefighters to be able to get these massive wildfires under control that have been burning since Monday. And these are dangerous conditions. We've learned of a second death, as you mentioned -- someone who was found in their car trying to escape from the wildfires presumably earlier this week. That person has not been identified. The first victim that was identified is a gentleman 60 years old by the name of Patrick Pearson. He had a broken leg and wasn't able to drive. And he was at the Swiss chalet in -- along the northern edge of Ruidoso. His son talked about is father's death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZACH PEARSON, WILDFIRE VICTIM'S SON:  He was trying to get away from the fire as fast as he could, you know, but with a -- with a broken leg and a brace, using a walker, trying to carry what you could, it's heartbreaking to know that he didn't make it. To know that he was trying to run for his life -- trying to get away from the fire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I don't know -- with an ax. All right, thank you, John.It is exactly one week now until the first presidential debate here on CNN. This morning, a brand-new Fox News poll of registered voters shows President Biden actually leading Donald Trump by a very narrow two points -- 50 to 48. You see the numbers there. That is, of course, within the margin of error reflecting how high stakes this pivotal debate could be for voters. Keep in mind this is the first time Donald Trump has trailed by him in a Fox News poll since October. Joining me now, Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky, and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. I want to first start with you, Julie. What do you think is behind this new polling, which often has had Donald Trump in the lead by several more points? JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: Well, a couple of things. One is, of course, the conviction of Donald Trump. And Independents, it seems, don't like the fact that their potential next president can be a convicted felon. And so you've seen that shift coming over to the president from them. Also, look, Donald Trump has been raising and spending money on legal fees, and the president has really amped up his advertising in the last month or so and he's continuing to amp it up now. And that message is finally resonating and coming through. And I think that's a mistake that Republicans consistently have made with Donald Trump. They give money to him thinking it's going to get him elected. In fact, he's taken that money and put it on legal fees and put it on other efforts other than convincing voters that he should be the next President of the United States -- and you see that in the polling that's reflected now.",

Maybe questions about some of the legal issues that he currently faces. And I put the emphasis on those things Sara because we know the former president sometimes gets a little agitated when asked about some of those issues.And I think this debate is going to be crucial for both men. But for the former president, I would argue that his tone really matters here. If he can come off as presidential and continue to focus and emphasize the fact that people materially are not better economically, to emphasize the importance of immigration. The fact that most Americans, regardless of their political persuasion, are concerned about immigration. And maybe even throw in some concerns about foreign policy and the United States' standing globally I think is an issue that also registers with a percent of voters. If he can do that while being measured, then I think he could have a successful night.",

If you listen to Donald Trump, you're going to have a crippled old man come out who may be or may not be senile and try to debate.Joe Biden needs to show the United States -- not just Trump's voters but everybody else -- that he's up for the task as the oldest president in history and somebody who is asking to be reelected as the oldest president in history. So he really needs to show up the way he did for the State of the Union. I think that's probably what they're really working very hard on in debate prep. And to Shermichael's point, I think it's an excellent point. Look, I've run debate prep for countless candidates. You need to -- it's really like a murder room almost. We have to go in and ask the toughest questions possible in a debate format. That's something that you can't do at a rally. You have to sit down and really go through the wringer.

Some of the rhetoric that he typically uses on the campaign trail, which is great for the base. Those things don't really sway Independent voters.You -- we mentioned the Fox News poll. If you look at that Fox News poll, President Biden does have a slight advantage with some of those swing voters. Now, granted, we're five months ahead. Those numbers are going to constantly change. But as a strategist, I'm looking at those numbers and I'm wondering what can my candidate do to usurp the lead of this opponent. We also know that the economic issues are still front and center for the vast majority of Americans, which is where I think the former president is strong. Now, on the question of President Biden, he has to not come off as someone who is incapable or unable to lead for another four years. He is going to be the oldest president elected. If he can just showcase stability and an ability to be energetic, to speak to the future, to be forward-looking, then I think that is an advantage for him.",

He is saying that, really, it's Trump who is not as pro-business as Biden because he says that Trump doesn't respect the rule of law and Biden does. And it's an interesting argument especially because, of course, Trump sees himself as the CEO president, right? He wants low taxes, light regulation. He just went to a meeting with CEOs in Washington where he said he doesn't want to just extend the 2017 tax cuts; he wants to make the corporate rate even lower. But Hoffman says it's not just about taxes and regulation because without the rule of law nothing else matters. Take a listen to what else Hoffman said.
