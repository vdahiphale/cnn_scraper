She grew up in a suburb of San Diego. She was raised by parents who are Hindu by faith. She married JD Vance in 2014 in the state of Kentucky. The couple has three young children. Again, she is the daughter of Indian immigrants who are Hindu in their faith. She met JD Vance when they both attended Yale Law School. They graduated from there - he did, at least, in 2013. Now, Usha Vance also has clerked for two Supreme Court justices. She clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts and for Brett Kavanaugh, when he served on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Now, from 2015 until just recently, she was an associate at the law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson, where she handled civil litigation and appeals in sectors that included education, local government, entertainment, and technology. I spoke with a historian named Kate Anderson Brower. She's the author of several books on first ladies, presidents and vice presidents. She said Usha Vance's ability to be comfortable appearing with her husband in public, that contrast with Melania Trump, who rarely appears with the former president in public. Here's what Kate Anderson Brower had to say.

That's really not the role that she's ever played. And so perhaps Usha could be a really big advantage to this campaign, just like her husband is. She's young. She's well-spoken. She's successful.

And here's the key fact, violent crime and murder are both now clearly lower than they were in 2020, President Trump's last year in office.Now, Congresswoman Stefanik's claims of a Biden violent crime crisis, I guess is subjective what constitutes a crisis. But she certainly did not say that there was a violent crime crisis under President Trump, when violent crime numbers were actually higher.",

Non-citizen voting is illegal in this country already. It is punishable by possible prison time, possible deportation. And it - it very rarely happens. We're talking a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of votes.What the House of Representatives actually voted on was whether to add a proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration. And Gallego and other Democrats voted against it because they said, look, this is already illegal. It already basically never happens. So, a proof-of- citizenship requirement would just be adding additional burdens on people trying to register to vote for essentially no clear benefit.",

It's a similar story for women's unemployment. Yes, there was a low since the 1950s under Trump. It fell to 3.4 percent. Very good. Well, it hit 3.3 percent under Biden in 2023. For Hispanics there was a tie, a record low of both 3.9 percent under both administrations. Now, for Asians, President Trump can still claim the record.
