      "sentences": "This whirlwind, bizarre legal battle, this foreclosure auction that was scheduled for tomorrow, but now the company behind this foreclosure attempt on Graceland says that it will not move forward with their claim. That is according to a statement released to CNN by someone who identified themselves as a representative of Naussany Investments and Private Lending LLC.The company saying that this came after consultation with their lawyers. Part of the reason for dropping this claim, the company says that the loan was not correctly recorded with the county, saying that there was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mother's Lisa Marie Presley's mis-habits and mismanagement of the money. The company will be withdrawing all claims with prejudice. That final part right there with prejudice, that typically means that they are not planning to refile. So it sounds like this company is abandoning all efforts to foreclose on Graceland. Now, there is still a lawsuit in play in all of this, a lawsuit by Riley Keough, again, the daughter of Lisa Marie Presley, the heir to Elvis's entire legacy to Graceland. And she claims in her suit that this company, Naussany, presented documents claiming that her mother agreed to a loan, $3.8 million, and then defaulted on that loan, meaning that Graceland would belong to them. Well, she says that's not what happened. These documents are fake. My mother never signed off on this.",

And following this, Gabe, what more are you hearing? GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENTBut the most serious one by far is the second degree assault on an officer charge. That is a felony. And now we're learning that privately, at least some high ranking officials within the Louisville Police Department have been expressing concern that that might be an excessive charge, that that felony charge might be excessive here. As you mentioned, it's really the first indication that we're hearing from anyone that police are concerned about it and feel that the charges should be reduced. We have learned through a source that there was some sort of meeting that included at least some of those top brass officials from the Louisville Police Department, and they were really in consensus that that charge felt excessive. Though, to be clear, they're not the ones prosecuting the case. It has now moved to the county attorney's office. We don't know what's been shared, what of those opinions have been shared with the county prosecutor's office, but it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. We know the police department is holding a press conference tomorrow. They're expected to release additional video of the arrest from a traffic poll in the area. As of now, we don't believe there's any video of the initial incident when the police officer was knocked over, but we're hoping to get more video. And we don't know if police are going to address some of these concerns or anything more about the case. But look, we're also learning that there are some local officials in Louisville who are starting to raise these concerns that perhaps the case is being overcharged. I spoke with a council member, Anthony Piagentini. He represents the district where the arrest unfolded. He told me he definitely feels that this is being overcharged. He has been speaking to a lot of the parties involved here. I want to read you a quote. He said: I think the charges should either be dropped entirely or at least be dropped down to a very, very tiny misdemeanor. I don't know every piece of evidence, but I know enough to say the officer was trying to do his job. Mr. Scheffler was trying to do his job and an unfortunate circumstance happened. So again, now we're starting to get that indication that there may be some agreement within the police department, but we don't know.",

So a series of programs to enhance training for police officers, setting a standard of fitness for duty for officers in the city of Uvalde as well as the school district as well. And it also goes toward the city agreeing to establish May 24th, the anniversary of the shooting, as a day of remembrance there in the city, as well as efforts to maintain and upkeep a memorial for the victims of the shooting and the cemeteries where -- the cemetery where victims are buried. So that is the significant part of that particular settlement with the city. But also significant here is this lawsuit involving 92 state troopers, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers who were at the scene that day. There have been a number of reports and a great deal of criticism, as we've reported over the last few years, about the failure of law enforcement responding to that shooting scene there at Robb Elementary. So a significant part of this is the lawsuit against 92 specific officers who were there at the scene, as well as the school's principal and the former school district police chief Pete Arredondo. One family member who spoke at the press conference today announcing this lawsuit says this is what the family has to do -- these families have to do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
