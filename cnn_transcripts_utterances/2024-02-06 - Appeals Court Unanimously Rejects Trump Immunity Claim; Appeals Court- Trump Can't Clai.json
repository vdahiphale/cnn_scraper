Any moment President Biden will speak from the White House on the bipartisan border bill that's on the brink of collapse. The bill includes a host of tough new border policies that the president says he'd signed but Republicans are ready to torpedo it after Donald Trump came out against it.We're going to bring this to you live. Also, this hour, I'll speak to the Republican who negotiated that deal. But first, a big court defeat for Donald Trump. A D.C. appeals' court has unanimously rejected Trump's claim of presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case. CNN's Paula Reid has been digging through the decision. Paula, what stands out to you about the way that these judges made the decision?",

He had already lost on this issue -- this argument that as president he should do enjoy your absolute immunity for things he did while in office. You're going to be lost on this at the trial court. And a month ago at oral arguments, the three judges appeared quite skeptical of his lawyer's arguments about the breadth and depth of this protection that he was claiming.But what surprised me here is in addition to the constitutional analysis, the judges here eviscerating Trump for his alleged actions after the 2020 election, calling him on presidential and suggesting this is an assault on American institutions saying, quote, it would be a striking paradox if the president who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed where the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity. Now, in addition to these unprecedented constitutional questions, this is also about timing. A large part of the Trump strategy is to just try to delay, delay, delay. Push these federal cases back until after the November election, because if he is reelected, Trump's attorney general could likely make Jack Smith and both of these criminal cases go away. Now it took a month for the court of appeals to get us an answer here, but they appear to be trying to make up for lost time, trying to prevent Trump from dragging his feet too long on any potential appeal. They said that Trump has until next week to signal to the Supreme Court that he intends to appeal. If he doesn't do that, then they'll send this back down to the trial court. But look, once the Supreme Court has this. It's unclear how long it will take though. Many sources in and around the Trump legal team tell me, they would be surprised if the Supreme Court ultimately wanted to take up this issue.",

But when it comes to the actual general election and those independent voters that Trump did not do well with and the question is whether or not he could make up that ground this time around. This is not something that's going to go over well with him, especially when you look at what this -- even these three judges are saying about what's at the heart of this that Trump's view of immunity would collapse the system of separated powers. What's he's alleged to have done that day would hit right at the heart of American democracy.

Also joining me here at the table legal analyst, Elliot Williams and CNN Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic. Let's just pick up on the exact quote that Kaitlan was talking about. And I'll just read some of it from this decision.At bottom, former President Trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that as to the president, the Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute, and the judiciary could not review we cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter. ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN, LEGAL ANALYST: So, let's say a few things in response to that. Number one, and the whole opinion is written sort of as a bit of a love letter to the rule of law. And the idea of what it takes to hold people accountable. There is a few things in that. So, with respect to that specific point, they say that, yes, presidents are entitled to protections the presidency in the United States is unique. However, Article 2, which creates the presidency also has an interest in enforcing the law. We need to be able to enforce criminal laws. And they say that quite explicitly. Another point, and this is in response to the Trump team's quote, this idea of selective or abusive prosecutions. The opinion lays out that no, we actually have several checks in our system, written in the constitution for ensuring that people are not selectively prosecuted. You've got to go by a grand jury, a judge has to hear the case, and then a jury has to hear it. All of these things that in the future -- this idea that now every Democratic or Republican president is going to be impeached or prosecute by the other side just falls apart.",

It's also really biting when it comes to him personally and his actions that precipitated this question.They say former President Trump alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were proven an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government. He allegedly injected himself into a process in which the president has no role, the counting and certifying of the electoral votes, thereby undermining constitutionally established procedures, and the will of the Congress there.

So, to show as a sign of unanimity.So that's a big one, too, to the point about specifics of President Trump's particular case, at least twice in the opinion. They cite to the 30 Republican senators who said that they could not convict the president under impeachment because he was no longer president the United States. So, one of the very core arguments they were making was that well, impeachment was the way to do this. So, you know, let's punt to the criminal courts.

Democrats will again demand much more in return if Republicans pass up this rare chance at border reform, they may not get a better one. Are they right? You've been working at this for four months. Is this the best that you think is possible in the Congress, that might not change that much even if Donald Trump does become president again? LANKFORD: We actually tried to pass changes in law dealing with these issues. When Donald Trump was president, we did a Republican House, Republican Senate and a Republican president. Democrats did block it in the Senate at that point we were not able to be able to move on changes in the law. This bill that we're bringing forward, the three of us had negotiated together was the best that we could possibly get it.
