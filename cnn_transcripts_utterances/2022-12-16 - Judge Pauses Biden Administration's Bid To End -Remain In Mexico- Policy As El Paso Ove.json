      "sentences": "It's interesting. Figuring out exactly what will happen is very difficult to predict.Because, yesterday, we were on the Juarez side of the border here and there were lines hundreds of yards long. Hundreds of people waiting in line to get into the U.S. One of our colleagues is over there today and says that line has essentially disappeared. So that means a lot of people who were in those lines are now being processed by Border Patrol. You'll see scenes like this playing out. These are people who have gone through the Border Patrol processing system. They have been released if they're allowed to stay here while their case goes through the court system. And they are waiting for bus rides or flights out of this area to move on to other locations. But this is where they have stuck. The mayor of El Paso is saying, next week, when Title 42 expires, that the number of migrants coming through the El Paso area alone could be as high as 5,000. That number is slowing down from this recent surge in the days ahead of the expiration of Title 42. It's not clear if all of this was connected. That's very difficult to determine. However, they are bracing here for more migrants coming next week and more scenes like this continuing to play out. In fact, the Biden administration is projecting that all across the U.S. Southern border it could be 9,000 to 14,000 migrants crossing into the U.S. That is what they're preparing for. And the logistics of that is very difficult. El Paso says they are going to work on bringing in more buses that will move migrants from the city here to larger transportation hubs like Phoenix, Dallas and Denver. Where there are more options to move people out to wherever they need to go in a much faster and orderly way, which, in theory, relieves the pressure on some of the border communities.

It's one of several videos of that arrest.It happened on Wednesday morning. It was during a final in that class on Winston-Salem State University campus. You can see in this video that 20-year-old student being arrested. You can hear her in the video speaking directly to the professor, saying, \"I hate you. You are the worst teacher ever.\" Saying that, \"Because I won't apologize, you started yelling at me. You tried to embarrass me about my paper. And you get me taken out in handcuffs because I won't apologize.\" According to the university, and to a student who recorded video, this was about a final assignment and an argument between that teacher and that student. According to a classmate of that student, at no point were there any threats made by either of them. That it was a verbal argument. Both stayed on their respective places in that classroom. But according to court documents, because this student was arrested for disorderly conduct, she was -- they say she was repeatedly asked both by the professor and the police officers to leave and she did not. Now Winston-Salem State issued a statement, a lengthy statement from the chancellor, that said, in part: \"We understand the weaponization of police as a prevalent problem in our community. However, that is not what happened in this incident.\" \"We know the situation has caused a great deal of trauma to those involved and our campus community at-large. Please know that every available resource is being extended to bring a resolution.\" \"We know you want immediate answers. However, the speed of our processes do not match the speed of social media.\" Now I will tell you Winston-Salem State University students, as well as students at other HBCUs, have taken to social media saying they feel traumatized. And this was supposed to be a safe space for them as an HBCU. And they now feel it may no longer be that way. The university has said it is investigating right now. But, again, says that, at this point, it does appear police, they say, followed policies.",

All on track to close at roughly one-month lows. Now this selloff really got started around 2:00 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday. That's when the three of us were on air breaking the Federal Reserve news. Now the Fed statement made clear that there's more rate hikes to come. And that's a concern because, the more the Fed does, the risk they could do too much and they cause a recession. The press conference reenforced those concerns. This isn't just about the Fed. Because yesterday, we had weaker than expected reports on retail sales and manufacturing. That suggested some real cracks are forming in this economy. You put the aggressive Fed together with the weak economic numbers, you get this increase of recession fears. And I would note that Powell and the Fed, they're probably not stressing too much about the selloff because their inflation-fighting campaign requires tighter financial conditions. They don't want the market to boom. And the tougher they sound, the more negative that will be for the market. Some investors I talk to think this could be getting overdone, this selloff. Veteran market strategist, Art Hogan, said, quote, \"It's too soon to be sounding the alarm bells.\"  He thinks this drop is likely overdone. What's clear is the market is pricing the greater risk of a recession. What's less clear is if the market's right.",

That is down 14 cents in the past week, 56 cents in a month.Lower than a year ago, which is pretty amazing. This is actually the lowest price for gasoline since September of last year. Again, it's also amazing because, as you can see on that chart, not that long ago, back in June, the national average was above $5 a gallon. This is happening for a lot of reasons. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. I mean, the same recession fears that are rocking the stock market are also hurting energy prices. U.S. energy demand has been kind of soft. But then, on the positive side, we've seen U.S. supply increase. And we also have those emergency releases of oil by the Biden administration. That has helped. And these concerns about Russia's energy, that their oil experts were going to collapse, that hasn't played out.
