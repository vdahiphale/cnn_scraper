Just moments ago, a neighborhood typical Fourth of July parade just wound up. But just not more than 15 hours ago, this very spot was the scene of a chaotic shooting where 11 people were shot. Three of those victims have died, according to Fort Worth police. And they're still in the process of trying to figure out exactly who was responsible for the shooting if there were multiple shooters involved, and what was the motive behind all of this.But it was around midnight last night when there was a street party here. Essentially, there are people lighting off fireworks and doing donuts and spinning out here in the streets, you know, very chaotic scene. And one witness said at some point they felt like things were starting to take a turn and that's when the gunfire erupted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was wearing a bulletproof vest, according to police, as well as having several rounds -- magazine rounds on him. He was also carrying a police radio.There were five victims and all ranging in age from 15 to 59. There's also a 13-year-old that was wounded in the attack as well.

The officers there in Philadelphia did an outstanding job. They took this guy into custody without firing a single shot. And we spent a lot of time talking about the use of force by police, especially deadly force, it's if it's not justified. This is a situation where they very well could have used deadly force, no question about it, and yet they didn't. And those kinds of cases usually go unnoticed by many people.",

And we could see this truck that you can see in that CCTV video is still up on the pavement when we were there. Its windshield completely smashed. Most of its bumper -- front bumper seemed to be taken off. And the bus station -- the bus stop that it had run into was very severely damaged. And the Israeli officials saying that eight people were injured as a result. One of them was critically injured. And as you noted, they said an armed civilian shot and killed the attacker after he had gone on his stabbing spree.And the Hamas militant group taking credit. Saying that this person is one of he called -- they call them their fighters. An Israeli defense official telling me that this person is a Palestinian man from the West Bank who had crossed into Tel Aviv. They said that he crossed over illegally. Now, the Hamas militant group after that Israeli military operation in Jenin started, they had called -- made a public call for all of their members to go out and they said to strike Israel wherever they could. So, there was sort of an anticipation that something like this could happen and that's what we saw happen today. Now, as for what's going on in Jenin, it's going on as we speak. There are currently, as I'm talking to you right now, heavy clashes. Gunfire is still being reported in Jenin. We are now in hour 44 of what is become Israel's largest military operation in the occupied West Bank since 2002. And the Israeli military saying their goal is to dismantle Jenin as what they call a safe haven for militants. As you noted, the Palestinian health officials are saying that at least 10 people -- I believe the latest count is 11 have been killed. Now, when the death toll was at 10, the IDF told me that they believe that no non- combatants had been killed yet, but they did acknowledge that civilians are among the more than one hundred injured. This is a very extensive operation, utilizing drone airstrikes, utilizing hundreds of Israeli soldiers, utilizing bulldozer to tear up roads, the Israeli officials saying that's because there are IEDs they believe hidden under the roads, and there are still heavy gunfights. And for the ta of people who live in this refugee camp, they have been describing it as almost like a natural disaster when they look outside the windows. Many of them -- thousands of them have fled overnight because they're giving all the indication that this will continue now for at least another day or so. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying that whoever thinks that such an attack in Tel Aviv will deter us from continuing our fight against terrorism is mistaken.
