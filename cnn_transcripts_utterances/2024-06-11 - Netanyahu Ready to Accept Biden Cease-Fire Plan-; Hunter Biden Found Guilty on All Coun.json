I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and we're following breaking news.Israel now appears ready to formally publicly sign up to President Biden's announced cease-fire plan for Gaza. In a statement attributed only to a government official but widely understood to be the prime minister's office, says Israel won't end the war without reaching its objectives, but it now says -- and I'm quoting now -- \"The proposal presented enables Israel to achieve those goals and Israel will indeed do so\" -- end quote. Our White House correspondent, Arlette Saenz, is standing by over at the White House. Our chief national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt, is here with me in the CNN NEWSROOM. Alex, pressure has been growing and growing on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, but this appears to be a major breakthrough.",

We're hearing more and more positive signs from both sides, from both Hamas and Israel.We have this new statement, albeit from an anonymous Israeli government official, as you say, widely believed to be coming from the prime minister's office, that says that Israel will not give up on its objectives, which include destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities. But, very importantly, it says that this proposal that President Biden put forward a week-and-a-half ago, which he called an Israeli proposal, by the way, does achieve these goals, and Israeli will indeed achieve those goals. So this does appear to be a softening of the position by Israel. You're not hearing demands for the elimination, the complete eradication of Hamas, which we have heard from Netanyahu in the past. And we did hear earlier today from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who just left Israel after several meetings, including one with the prime minister, in which he said the Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed his support for the plan that Biden laid out. Let's listen to a little bit more of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu last night, and he reaffirmed his commitment to the proposal. I also had an opportunity to speak to the defense minister, Gallant, and other senior Israelis this morning. And I think there is a strong consensus again behind moving forward with the proposal. But it really is down to one person at this point. We will see what comes from them and from him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's believed to be in tunnels beneath Gaza, perhaps surrounded by hostages. There's a remarkable new report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today which has notes from Yahya Sinwar to the Hamas interlocutors who have been having a role in these negotiations in which he talks about having the Israelis right where we want them and talking about the deaths of these thousands of Palestinian civilians, saying that these are necessary sacrifices, so some really cold-blooded stuff. So the U.S. is saying that the onus is on Hamas and specifically on Sinwar to respond to this deal. We have heard positive noises coming out of Hamas yesterday after a U.N. resolution was voted on. They said that they are ready to engage with the mediators on what that resolution laid out for, a permanent cease-fire. But, Wolf, this really does seem to be headed -- this is on Yahya Sinwar to respond, because now we're hearing these positive responses from the Israelis.",

He was here earlier this morning, left after about 20 minutes and went to a -- we believe, to a hotel nearby, where the family members, he and the family members have been using a base while he waited for the jury to come back. So, as you pointed out, they had about one hour of deliberations yesterday before they broke, and then two hours this morning. And now we know that there is a verdict. We don't know what that verdict is. But, as a reminder, this is a case that is focused on three charges, three federal felonies for lying on a form in order to buy a firearm and possessing that firearm. Again, over 11 days, Hunter Biden owned this gun. He had it. He bought it on October 12 of 2018. And the center of this case has been prosecution -- the prosecution says that he knew he had been struggling with drug addiction, because he's written about it. They showed videos, they showed photos, they showed text messages, everything indicating that he was struggling with drug addiction at this time and that, when he went to the gun store here in Delaware to buy the firearm, that he filled out -- filled out form saying that he was not a drug addict. So that has been the center of this case, that the defense has focused on this idea that his state of mind was not clear, that he may have believed he was not addicted to drugs because there was -- the prosecution did not have any evidence in October of 2018 that he was using. So that's been what this case has centered on over the last few days, an overwhelming amount of evidence from the prosecution, really, not much in dispute, except for his state of mind, really, on those key days, those 11 days in October of 2018. That's what the jury was faced with here, Wolf.",

It was a week of evidence from the prosecution, 13 witnesses in all over a week, over really something that was not very much in dispute. And so the idea that they have a verdict means that this jury believed that the evidence was clear for one side or the other. One of the interesting things, I had a conversation with some of the security officers in the court today, and they said they have seen some interesting things. I mean, obviously, this -- this -- the amount of evidence that we have seen that prosecutors pile on, on Hunter Biden is overwhelming. And so it would be a surprise if he was able to evade on all of this. But I talked to a couple of court security officers who said they have -- recently, they have seen a couple of cases where video evidence, jurors were -- just tossed it out and said not guilty.

It was in July of 2023 when a plea deal, which seemed to have been worked out, which might close the chapter on this very painful, difficult, destructive period in Hunter Biden's life, could actually result in him avoiding trial. That plea deal collapsed in July. And, as a result, you now see him here in court. And, as Evan Perez was saying, this has been weeks of very difficult, overwhelming evidence brought by the prosecution of Hunter Biden's history of addiction. And, in many ways, Wolf, the most surprising thing has been the degree of turmoil that was happening offstage of public life in the Biden family, dividing members of the family from one another. And I think there's just no question this has been a very painful period for the president and for the first lady, who, after all, has been attending every day of this trial.

I'm going to have our reporter just come over and tell us what else they're learning, because, obviously, the most important thing was the verdict.

REID:  Well, as I said earlier, Hunter has enjoyed significant support from his family, family friends, members of the clergy. And the first lady of the United States has been here. His stepmom has been here most days of this trial. But the verdict came very quickly between the time we were alerted that it was ready and the time it was read. And the first lady, actually, she didn't get here in time to hear the verdict read. So that is significant that she was not here during the verdict, but she was here for many other pivotal moments of this trial. And I will note, the president has said that he would not pardon his son, that he will respect the verdict. I will note, look, legal nerd here, right, recovering lawyer, there's also the option to potentially commute any sentence. While he may not pardon his son, he would have the option to commute whatever sentence his son receives here for this trial. So, if, at the end of his term, his son is still serving that sentence, he could potentially commute his sentence, so something important to remember, even though his father said, at this point, he would not offer him a pardon. But he has received unwavering support from his stepmother throughout this trial. Even while she has been traveling abroad to Europe, she has still come back and been here front and center, sitting in the front row, offering support, not only to her stepson, but to other members of the family. For example, their granddaughter had to testify, Naomi Biden. And when she and her husband walked in the courtroom that day for her to testify, the first lady immediately looked at Naomi's husband, motion for him to come sit right next to her. So the first lady has been here throughout this trial, offering support, again, not just to the defendant, her stepson, but also to other members of the family that have been part of this.",

But we're still waiting to hear how exactly President Biden learned the news of this conviction and if or when he will be calling his son. Of course, the Biden family is incredibly close. And for the most part, the statements that we have heard from the Biden family around this trial is simply expressing their love and support for their son as he is facing these criminal charges, but also stressing the fact that they are proud of him in the face of adversity after overcoming some of his struggles with addiction. Now, as Paula noted just last week, President Biden was specifically asked in an interview whether he would accept the results of this verdict or pardon his son. I want to play you a little clip of that moment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so we will see whether we hear anything directly from President Biden himself or this White House. But, certainly, this caps off years of a very tumultuous period for the Biden family. As you heard detailed in this court case, there were very personal testimonials. The president -- Hunter's own words were played back in court recounting some of his struggles with addiction, some of the very tumultuous periods in their family history. You had the Biden granddaughter, Naomi Biden, testifying about her father as well. And, of course, first lady Jill Biden has been on hand for the majority of this trial, taking all of that in. I had been told that there was no question for the first lady that she wanted to be there by Hunter Biden's side as this trial played out. And so we will see a little bit more later today whether President Biden might be weighing in on this conviction of his only living son.",
