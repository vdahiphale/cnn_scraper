I mean, I think it's Hezbollah has been threatening to hit what they described as sort of collections of troops behind the front lines over the last few days and weeks. They've been saying that, but after the strike last night, they said that the reason that their attack got through was because they fired a number of missiles, first on purpose to confuse the air defense systems, and then they said they fired set off a swarm of drones.Now, the IDF only talked about two, not a swarm Hezbollah, when their propaganda was given to exaggeration. But I think you know the way that the IDF is going to look at this is, it is, what has Hezbollah learned about our defense systems over the past couple of weeks? Have they been trying to penetrate them? What have they learned, and how have they used it to advantage? And of course, the other question is, how did they know precisely where to, in effect, hit the most troops at the right time, which appears to have been dinner time, and it appears that they hit them in the canteen. How did Hezbollah get that part of their operation? Where did their information come from? So these are going to be the questions that they need. Pressing answers for the spokesman for the IDF said, we have to improve on this.",

There was a targeted strike last night as well. 14 people died, many of them children a little bit further south in Gaza.But it's that northern area of Gaza where the main operation is going on, where hospitals are being told to evacuate, where civilian citizens are being told that they must evacuate and go to safer areas further in the south, where this may impact, and the U.N. has certainly talked about this already. Today, the U.N. began in Gaza its second round of polio vaccines. It's remarkable. It was just four weeks ago we were talking about them needing to vaccinate 600,000 children, and they pretty much hit their 90 percent target back then. But there had to be a second round, the second round beginning now. And the U.N. is concerned that because of the strikes in the north, because of the ongoing, renewed military operations in the north of Gaza by the IDF, they may not get the target, the required target of children getting their second dose of the polio vaccine. And of course, that has the obvious implication that they won't be able to eradicate it as they hope to.",

So when one is moved, when one is deployed, it is a significant statement about where the U.S. sees the threat and its commitment to stopping that threat.In this case, that threat is very much the possibility of Iran firing more ballistic missiles at Israel. So the U.S. has sent about 100 troops in the THAAD battery. THAAD stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. It's one of the most capable anti-ballistic missile systems within the U.S. inventory, if not the most capable, able to shoot down ballistic missiles in their terminal phase as they dive towards their target up to about 100 miles away. And it can detect those ballistic missiles more than 10 times that distance. So, it's an incredibly capable system. Israel obviously has its own aerial defense systems, the shorter range Iron Dome, medium range David Sling and the longer range Arrow Missiles, which are targeted ballistic missiles. This will add to that, not only in terms of quality, because the THAAD system can communicate with the Navy destroyers that have intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles off the shore there and other Israeli systems. But also in terms of quantity, and that's one of the great risks here. Iran simply has a large number of missiles, and being able to shoot all of them down requires you to have a number of your own systems. So the THAAD system will add to that bars, Alisyn. And again, it's a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies, as well as a commitment to Israel's defense. SANCHEZ: And Oren, the THAAD system has been deployed to the Middle East before, right?",
