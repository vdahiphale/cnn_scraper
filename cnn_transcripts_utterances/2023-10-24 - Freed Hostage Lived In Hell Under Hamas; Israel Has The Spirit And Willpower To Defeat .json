She described walking through a spider web of tunnels underneath Gaza where she was held with dozens of other hostages before being separated and kept with four other people who are also taken from her Kibbutz as well. Lifshitz says she was beaten and she was being taken away on a motorcycle but her said her captors treated her rather to be well once they brought her into Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, HOSTAGE FREED BY HAMAS (through translator): I went through hell that I could have not known. I was kidnapped on a motorbike on my side while they were driving towards Gaza. As we got there, the people told us that they are people who believe in the Quran, and that they will not harm us and that we will get the same conditions they get in the tunnels. We begin walking inside the tunnels with the wet ground. There were guards and a paramedic and a doctor who took care of the fact that we would have the same medicine that we need. There, we laid on mattresses, they took care of the sanitary side so we won't get sick, and we had a doctor who came to see us every two to three days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The question is now, can Emmer get those people that voted to Johnson, almost all of them, to vote for him, so he has some chance of getting to the 217 votes he would need on the House floor, assuming the Democrats still don't vote for a Republican to speaker. So, this is a very split conference. And I think what we need to see now is whether the Republicans decide to do a ballot inside that secret meeting, to try and gauge whether Emmer can get to that 217, so we don't have to keep going through these embarrassing and chaotic rounds of voting on the full House floor in the full view of all the American people that just underlines how chaotic and ungovernable the Republican conference is.

He signed a brief in Texas that tried to overturn the result of the election and a number of battled around states. So, Emmer tried to get Trump's endorsement, but the Trump wing of the party, the far right, which was responsible for failing Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they're against him because of that. Another issue that could be a problem for Emmer is he's a strong advocate of aid to Ukraine. There's a lot of suspicion among the far right that Emmer, if he becomes Speaker, could cut a deal with President Joe Biden to allow $60 billion worth of new aid that the president has requested to go to Ukraine. That's very unpopular with about half at least of the Republican conference. And to do that, he would have to get Democratic votes to get that through the Congress. That is exactly the scenario that cost Kevin McCarthy his job, because he went against the far right and used Democratic votes to pass a stop back stop gap bill to keep the government open a few weeks ago. So, I think there's a great deal of uncertainty whether this will unpick the speaker deadlock. The one thing that Emmer does have in his, sort of advantage, is that people are getting very frustrated, very upset, tired.

Joining me live now is Ory Slonim, former special advisor to Israel's defense minister. Mr. Slonim, thank you so much for being with us. There are so many things I want to get your thoughts on here. I mean, firstly, I'll try to figure out how to order them. But firstly, just the fact that Mrs. Lifshitz, when she addressed reporters, she talked about this idea that yes, initially she was beaten, but the way that she was treated while hostage in Gaza wasn't necessarily as bad as perhaps all of us were anticipating. What do you make of what she said in terms of how she's being treated? How much should we read into those comments? And also, what are your thoughts in terms of what all of this means about whether or not we will see more hostages being released in the coming weeks and days? ORY SLONIM, FORMER ADVISER TO ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER: I think that she spoke with the media a couple of minutes after she was released, and she was kept in captivity in a place that I believe that nobody in the world can imagine, what cruel way of behavior was there. And I won't judge anything regarding her words. I think that she was very frank. If you know that she left her husband of 85 years old there, she knows nothing about him. So, I believe that whatever she said cannot be judged and cannot be even criticized or cannot be even understood in that situation. So, I don't want to -- I don't want to comment on this because I don't know the situation of an old woman of 85, I think, years old coming five minutes after being in captivity with these cool people outside to the media people. I can't comment.",
