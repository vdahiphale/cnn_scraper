Tonight, as Ukraine's President looks torevitalize his war efforts with a new cabinet, we hear from Ukraine's army chief in a new as well as an exclusive interview. Plus, former U.S. President Donald Trump says he has a job for Elon Musk if elected in November. The candidate revealing his economic plans as he faces new legal action. And a Ugandan Olympic athlete killed after a brutal attack by her boyfriend. We'll find out why violence against female athletes is becoming all too common in Africa. But first tonight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's bringing new energy to his cabinet, but the political reshuffle and the timing, of course, of this, has taken many by surprise. Andrii Sybiha was confirmed by parliament and sworn in earlier today, he replaces former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, considered to be of course, a political insider. Sybiha is a career diplomat and was also deputy head of the presidential office. Now, this may be an unexpected move by President Zelenskyy to bolster support when he visits the U.S. this month. He'll be presenting his so-called victory plan. Now, the appointment comes as fighting rages on the eastern front and in Russia's Kursk region, as you can see there, those are key strategic areas for both sides. But Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the eastern offensive his military's first priority goal. Well, our chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour spoke with Ukraine's commander-in-chief, it's his first television interview since becoming military chief in February. Here's a little snippet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, talking about the Kursk operation, we should note this is what has significantly improved the morale of not only the military, but the entire Ukrainian population.

Of course, there is that big offensive going on by the Russians. And he said the same things that we've heard from a lot of commanders in the past. They said, look, we're outgunned by the Russians. They have more ammunition, but he also said that right now, it is imperative for the Ukrainians to get more manpower. The Ukrainians of course, have been recruiting more than they have been in the past. But a lot of those forces have not yet come to the frontlines. And one of the other things that Syrskyi also said is that some of the soldiers that are going to that eastern frontline did not come with as much training as he would have liked to see. So, manpower right now for the Ukrainians is certainly a major issue, one that is a major priority for the military leadership, and of course, for the civilian leadership of this country as well. And that offensive by the Russians is really one that is really dangerous for the Ukrainians also, because the Russians have pushed very far towards that city of Pokrovsk, that city of Pokrovsk is a major logistical hub, but it could also open the door for the Russians to try and invade other places in eastern Ukraine and southeastern Ukraine. So, definitely, a place that the Ukrainians want to hold, and you could feel in that interview with Christiane, that -- Oleksandr Syrskyi; the commanding general was definitely very much aware of what a decisive battle that is down there. And that's why the Ukrainians also are hoping that the Russians, even if they don't move any of the troops that are currently part of the Pokrovsk offensive by the Russians themselves, that at least, the Russians won't be able to reinforce the way they would have, and maybe that will take some of the steam and some of the pressure off the Ukrainians, Isa.",

Fourteen minutes ago. The President's son plans to accept punishment while maintaining his innocence. The prosecution opposes the move.

But it's noteworthy to note that number one, the type of plea that he wants to enter is an Alford plea, where he's going to accept responsibility, but he still maintains his innocence. So, what he's saying by that is that he acknowledges the strength of the case and that the prosecutor is going to be able to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

And to determine whether in fact, Donald Trump is immune from those certain acts and whether it can be used against him in evidence. It ended just how we thought the case is going to get another date. There will be a scheduling order to determine where the one there'll be an evidentiary hearing or whether this case can be resolved by just listening and reading the motions that are filed by both parties.

That's even though a senior U.S.official and others say a deal is 90 percent complete. Prime Minister Netanyahu told Fox News there's not a deal in the making and that it would be inaccurate for others to say so. He also claimed Hamas has not agreed to a hostage exchange either. The Israeli prime minister has come under pressure at home as well as abroad for wanting to maintain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, which separates Gaza and Egypt. And we have been seeing, just in the past few moments, more protests. It's the fifth day of protests. This is just moments ago in Tel Aviv where families of the hostages. One Prime Minister Netanyahu, it's something we've heard on the show in the last few days, and even as we speak to families of those hostages prioritizing their return. Let's get more on all these strands. Our Matthew Chance joins us from Tel Aviv with more. And, Matthew, just help us understand kind of the schism that we are seeing between what we're hearing in the United States that a ceasefire hostage deal is 90 percent complete and then Netanyahu who says there's no deal in the making. In fact, he's been doubling down on the Philadelphi Corridor. How do we make sense of this?",

But essentially, we're talking about, you know, the same things, which is that, you know, there is some infrastructure of a deal that's been put in place, but there are issues that are outstanding. Two main ones. Being the identity of any Palestinian prisoners who were released in a hostage prisoner exchange. You know, whether or not these will be sort of people who are convicted of terrorism, crimes sentenced to life sentences for murder in Israeli jails and things like that, that's still something that's very much got to be negotiated. And understandably, there's a great deal of resistance from the Israeli side on that. The other issue is what happens to Israeli troops, you know, once the ceasefire is implemented, their continued presence in the Gaza Strip? You mentioned the Philadelphi Corridor, which is the strip of land between the Gaza Strip and the border with Egypt. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has personally insisted that Israeli troops stay inside that Philadelphi Corridor. And that's something that's an anathema to mass who want to see Israeli troops out of that area altogether. And so, these are the two outstanding issues for the United States. They say, well, look, 90 percent of the deal is done. It's just that 10 percent, you know, which prisoners and the presence of Israeli troops that still has to be resolved. Benjamin Netanyahu, though going on Fox News within the past few hours making it clear that he did not believe the country was anywhere near brokering a deal. Take a listen to what he had to say.
