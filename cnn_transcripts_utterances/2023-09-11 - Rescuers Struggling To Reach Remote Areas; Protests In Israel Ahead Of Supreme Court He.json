The reality is on the ground in countries like Morocco, they've got pretty efficient government structures, particularly the Armed Forces designed to respond to this. And so, they are saying, no, we can pick and choose exactly what we need. Tell us what you can offer. So, they've got the UAE, you've got very specialist emergency rescue operators, the British and others that you mentioned there in the intro because they are trying to make sure that the aid is appropriately targeted and is put to immediate use. There's not much point in having a massive bottleneck in the Morocco's International Airport with people wandering around, kicking their heels and complaining about not having enough to do. So, that's the first thing. And then in the background there is that this as you rightly point out is a different call complex emergency because the transport communication systems are very poor up in those mountains. The only way to reach people right now, if a large number of people potentially is by helicopter. Mountain passes and narrow roads and tracks have been destroyed by the earthquake. And they were pretty meager to start with, Becky. So, they need to know exactly what is coming so they can deploy it appropriately.",

A new law that strips the court of its power to nullify government actions it deems unreasonable. Netanyahu has refused to say whether his government would even abide by a court ruling striking the law down, which would spark a judicial crisis setting different branches of government against each other. AMIT SEGAL, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CHANNEL 12: The Supreme Court and the government alike possess a credible nuclear threat against the other side. If both sides are rational actors that will put the -- they will disarm those themselves. Problem is we're in a crisis that is not very rational anymore.

But it's prompted a crisis in Israel's defense forces reservist in some soldiers vowing not to serve. The Israeli shekel weakening as well as concern from Israel's greatest allies.

Many of these villages are located in remote areas of the Atlas Mountains, which are typically hard to get to but also the roads have also sustained damage. And that has posed an obstacle to rescue teams. But what we are beginning to see now is international search and rescue teams joining the effort coming to Morocco to support on that front. But there will also be a focus on the humanitarian relief front as well because many of those across the Atlas Mountains, across the area's impacted around the epicenter have lost their homes, have lost absolutely everything. And so, they will be needing that support for some time to. Home here in Marrakesh, what we have seen over the weekend for three nights in a row now actually as families sleeping in the street. Choosing to sleep outside for fear of another aftershock or potentially another earthquake. Many have said that they're too afraid that their homes aren't safe and the structures of their buildings could give way. So that is a real fear for many across the country in those areas impacted by the earthquake. But we have seen an outpouring of community support as well. There has been a real push for people to go out and donate blood. We've seen queues of people lining up to support on that front and we're beginning to see people gathering crucial items for those impacted, loading vans and traveling almost to the areas impacted to support with the humanitarian relief efforts.
