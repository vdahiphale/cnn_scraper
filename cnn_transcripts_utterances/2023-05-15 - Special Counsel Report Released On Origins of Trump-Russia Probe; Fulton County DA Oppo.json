      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, the lack of any new prosecutions, that stands out because we were expecting or certainly we were led to believe by the former president, by the former administration that this investigation was going to find crimes, they were going to find conspiracy by the deep state to go after Donald Trump.What John Durham concludes here is that there was no necessarily political bias. What he says was there was confirmation bias and there were mistakes by the FBI, some of which were already detailed in an inspector general report back in 2019. I'll read you just a part of what Durham says. He says, \"In short, the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia.\" And he also goes on to say, \"An objective and honest assessment of these strands of information should have caused the FBI to question not only the predication of Crossfire Hurricane, (which is the name of this investigation), but also to reflect on whether the FBI was being manipulated for political or other purposes.\" Anderson, the bottom line from John Durham, though is that, you know, he doesn't recommend any major changes for the FBI in the way they handled politically sensitive investigations. A. COOPER: In the report, Durham talks about something called the Clinton plan. What is that?",

There was some information that was declassified by John Ratcliffe, then the director of National Intelligence.It appears that back in 2016, the intelligence community got some intelligence from the Russians that appeared to indicate that there was a plan in the Clinton campaign to tie Trump to Russia and it was never corroborated. But it is something that John Durham spends a lot of time in his investigation going after. He actually interviews Hillary Clinton back in 2022 about this. It appears that that information is still, Anderson, not corroborated, it may have been falsified. And in the end, what John Durham concludes is that there is no prosecutable criminal offense in the way the government handled that information. Again, that dates back to 2016, uncorroborated as it was -- Anderson. A. COOPER: All right, Evan Perez, appreciate it. I want to get some perspective now from CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe who was deputy director -- FBI director during Crossfire Hurricane whose name comes up 58 times in the Durham report. So Andrew in the Durham report, it says the FBI never had evidence of collusion. That's not a legal term we should note, between the Trump campaign in Russia in 2016, it should never have launched a full investigation. What's your response?",

That information does not in my estimation, qualify as unverified intelligence. That is a direct report from a trusted longtime ally of the United States, and it overlays very clearly, with raw information that we knew, not unverified intelligence, things that we knew the Russians had been doing and were continuing to do.A. COOPER: The report is very critical of disparaging comments about Donald Trump made privately by two key members of the investigative team, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who anybody who is following this knows those names.

No, they wouldn't have been involved in the investigation. But nobody knew about that, at the time. And I think it's important to point out that in the IG's investigation, the DOJ inspector general, they looked very deeply at all of those messages and determined that neither Pete Strzok nor Lisa Page was ever in a position to significantly influenced the decisions that were made by people like myself and Director James Comey during the course of this investigation. So yes, those comments were objectionable, and they were unfortunate, and they subjected the organization to immense scrutiny. But ultimately, we're not responsible for the investigative decisions that were made. A. COOPER: The Durham report also says that the FBI handled this investigation differently than to handle allegations of possible attempted foreign election interference plans aimed at the Clinton administration.

And I think to the best of my understanding, he is referring to a piece of intelligence that was received at the highest levels of the FBI in 2016, about some comments or communications allegedly made by people associated with the Clinton campaign that they were going to essentially manufacture some sort of narrative that Trump had ties to the Russians in order to hurt his campaign.Look, the fact is, we knew what the Russians were doing, and had done in an effort to help Donald Trump and if we had had any information, any intelligence or information that indicated that the Clinton campaign was colluding with the Russians, we would have investigated that as well. But that information doesn't exist and to my knowledge was not happening. What you heard in that intelligence that was declassified by John Ratcliffe was a campaign strategy, maybe an underhanded, unethical strategy, I don't know, that's for others to decide. But that is not a violation of federal criminal law or the creation of a threat to national security. A. COOPER: Did it surprise you that there's no new recommendations really, in this report for the Justice Department about changing procedures?

There is nothing new here. And what he does present in the report, though, I will give him credit for this. He is entirely consistent with the pre-judging of this investigation that he communicated, you know, a month or so starting it. We knew from the very beginning exactly what John Durham was going to conclude and that is what we saw today. We knew from the very beginning, this was never a legitimate investigation.

She's told the judge that he should dismiss Donald Trump's motion, that he should not hold a hearing on this matter and he should not allow another judge to hear the Trump team's arguments which is something that Trump team had asked for. You know, she basically said there is no evidence that theinvestigative special grand jury process during this was tainted. She said there was no evidence of misconduct on her behalf because they also wanted her removed as a prosecutor. And she also took issue with the fact that the Trump team is now coming at this at this point so late in the game. She says, \"By his own estimation, Mr. Trump has been at the center of an investigation which has progressed for over two years, but only now is he moving for the prosecutor's disqualification.\" So a very sharp rebuttal from Fani Willis today against the Trump team's arguments there.

She argues first of all that she and her office do not have any political bias, that they've approached this like any other case. She argues that there's no evidence that the grand jury or the judge has been prejudiced or biased against anyone and she makes an important procedural argument.She says, it is not time yet. Nobody has been charged. If and when anybody gets indicted, then you can challenge the evidence in front of the grand jury. But as of this moment, nobody has been charged. And so she argues essentially, Trump does not have standing and this motion is premature. A. COOPER: Are there real issues here relating to District Attorney Willis' conduct? I mean, does the former president have a legitimate point in raising these concerns? Or is this just another attempt to stop this? HONIG: He does make substantial arguments in his motion that kicked this off, Anderson. He points out that the DA has already been thrown off a piece of this case, because she has a political conflict of interest. He notes some of her public commentary, which has been frankly inappropriate. She has talked about her opinion on Donald Trump's criminal state of mind. She has talked about the fact that she does believe there is a crime here, that's not appropriate for a prosecutor to say, and we all remember, the grand jury foreperson. The argument here the Trump team is making is that her public commentary has tainted any potential actual grand jurors or trial jury pool that may come down the line. So there are real questions here about the conduct of the DA and of the grand jury. A. COOPER: What about the allegations relating to this special grand jury and the judge?",
