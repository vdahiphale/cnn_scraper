But behind the scenes, McCarthy has tried to assuage concerns from the right trying to -- putting in a whole slew of provisions in his package, Republican priorities, efforts to go after the Biden agenda, as well as across the board spending cuts like domestic discretionary programs, as well as new work requirements for beneficiaries of the Medicaid entitlement program. All of which had been supported by most members of the Republican conference. But given the narrow majority, McCarthy had very little margin for error, but didn't convince everybody in the conference including Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee who argued that the bill should have went further.

Teixeira is due in court in the coming hours for a hearing on whether he will have to remain behind bars while awaiting trial. He has not yet entered a formal plea. Prosecutors say Teixeira viewed hundreds of documents and conducted keyword searches in what appears to be a deliberate effort to disseminate American secrets. We're also told he has a history of making violent threats and had access to an arsenal of weapons at his Massachusetts home. Well, clashes in and around the Sudanese capital keep undermining the 72-hour ceasefire between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. But the head of the army has signaled his willingness to extend the truce by another three days and is calling for talks in neighboring South Sudan. The rapid support forces have not responded to the proposal yet. The current ceasefire is due to expire late Thursday, local time.

And then, of course, the E.U. juxtapose that China's growing desire to be seen as a global peacemaker after that deal they brokered between the Saudis and Iranians.So, it was in this broader context that we finally saw this highly anticipated call take place. And some observers see this as a reward from Beijing to Europe's willingness to engage with China on this issue. But let's not forget what happened just in the past few days. That is the Chinese ambassador to France caused an uproar across Europe by questioning the legality of the sovereignty of former Soviet State. And that, of course, has caused a lot of damage, even though China has since distanced itself from those remarks, the need for damage control, according to some observers, may finally tip the scales in favor of this rather modest gesture in the form of this call. Now, Xi Jinping, of course, reiterated a lot of China's longstanding talking points. But he did pledge to send a special envoy to Ukraine and other regional countries to discuss, quote unquote, a political settlement. But even the state media here has acknowledged, it's very unlikely anything would change in the short term given the chasm between Ukraine and Russia on their positions. And also, a lot of people have pointed out it's going to take a lot more than a phone call to convince China's critics and skeptics in Europe that it is serious to play an unbiased role.

Large hailstones the size of tennis balls hit the small town of Dublin, Texas, even forcing a bull to head for cover from the storm. Some areas could see continued thunderstorms until morning. On Thursday, the storms will push East putting parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast at risk for more severe weather. And flooding along the Mississippi River is expected to get worse as melting snow causes waters to swell. Upper Midwest states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, we'll see the worst of it. CNN's Emily Schmidt reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EMILY SCHMIDT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): There's a real time math equation playing out along the upper Mississippi River.

Yaya arrived in America with her playmate Lele two decades ago, as an emblem of growing bilateral friendship. But recent videos showing the ones fluffy panda, now looking skinny with scraggly fur has sparked outrage in China. Many Chinese people in some animal advocates accusing the zoo of mistreatment.Videos on Chinese social media claiming the pandas are being abused quickly went viral against the backdrop of growing anti-American sentiment. The rumors, often fanned by state propaganda. And meanwhile, Chinese social media users are praising these viral videos of this panda in Russia, Ruyi claiming videos of the active and playful panda prove Russia is taking excellent care of the Chinese bear. State T.V. saying the pandas are helping the Russia-China relationship. Chinese and American scientists launched a joint investigation concluding that Yaya has a genetic fur and skin condition, that does not impact your quality of life and has received excellent care. But that message is not getting through. Outside the panda exhibit at the Beijing Zoo. I asked people if they've heard of Yaya panda. This man says yes, she's abused in America. An 11-year-old boy tells me, I heard the U.S. is treating the panda poorly. This man says isn't Russia taking good care of pandas. Pandas are happy over there, not like in the U.S. And this man with his granddaughter tells me, pandas in Russia are very happy, why Russians and Chinese are friends. At least Russia is not sanctioning China. (on camera) Yaya will soon settle in Beijing Zoo. Now, China has long used its pandas as a diplomatic tool. Currently, it's pandas on loan to about 20 countries. The United States has not received one since Yaya and Lele 20 years ago. Now, these pandas are normally loaned on these 10-year leases, and they cost a million dollars annually. (voiceover) The Memphis Zoo had already planned to send Yaya and Lele back to Beijing this spring because their lease is expiring, but Lele died of heart disease two months ago, at the age of 24. The average lifespan for pandas is usually under 30 years. Yet, that didn't stop rampant speculation and led to an explosion of accusations about Yaya's treatment to accelerating costs to bring Yaya back to China. The message even featured on billboards from New York City to major cities across China. In 1972, during U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, his wife visited pandas in Beijing. PAT NIXON, RICHARD NIXON'S WIFE: On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift. WANG (voiceover): Months later, China sent a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Now, decades later, these pandas returned from the U.S. to China symbolic, not a growing friendship, but growing animosity between two global superpowers. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
