It took them a minute to get out there onto the floor last night, but when they did, they came out trying to project this message of strength. Is it going to work? ALEX THOMPSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\":  Well, listen, I've covered the Biden White House now for three-and-a-half years. And as someone that's reported on his age quite a few times, I can tell you that the White House is response every single time has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect to gaslight, to not tell the truth, not just to reporters, not just other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president's limitations at his age. There's a reason why he has not done as many interviews or press conferences as any president in decades, there's a reason he does not do events almost ever before 10:00 a.m. and is rarely on camera after 6:00 p.m. And the reason is because he has limitations. He is 81 years old. But the problem was they were not forthright with other Democrats. They weren't at times forthright with themselves. And that is why Democrats are in full freak out mode because what they saw is finally what they have been obscuring. HUNT:  Alex, how much of this is relatively recent?

It would basically take him deciding to drop out for that to happen, and part of why the pressure is so intense is because of the essential way that Democrats view this election, right? He's not running against Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio, or a generic Republican. He is running against Donald Trump, who clearly interfered with a peaceful transfer of power and he did it in no small part because -- President Biden is in this race in no small part because he beat Donald Trump before and seems to think he's the only one that could beat him again. In December, he acknowledged this fact. He said, I'm not sure I would be running if Donald Trump wasn't running. He said this at a fundraiser.
