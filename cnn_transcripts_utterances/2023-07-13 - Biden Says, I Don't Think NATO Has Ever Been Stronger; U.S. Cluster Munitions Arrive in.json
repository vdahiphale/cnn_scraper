The president has spent the morning meeting with the president of Finland, as well as Nordic leaders, including Sweden.Of course, it is important that Finland is the most recent addition to the NATO alliance, joining in April, and it shares an 800-mile land border with Russia, significantly expanding NATO territory. And also at this summit of the Nordic leaders, the president also met with the prime minister of Sweden. Of course, Turkey gave President Biden a big win heading into this summit by dropping its objections to having Sweden join the NATO alliance. They still need to have an official formal parliament vote. That may not happen until the fall, but very soon the NATO alliance will be looking a whole lot bigger. And it all strikes with the message that the President has been trying to drive, not just here in Finland but throughout his trip. As he met with Nordic leaders today, he said that the group has common challenges and also common values. And that is something that he has been trying to stress throughout the course of his trip, especially as he has sought to reinvigorate the NATO alliance. That is something that has been key over the course of the war in Ukraine and also prior in his presidency. And the president also came into that NATO summit over in Vilnius, where you are, trying to strengthen and rally more support around Ukraine. Of course, there were some tensions at the start of that summit with Zelenskyy over what exactly he wanted the NATO alliance to give his country. But by the end of it, the president came out with a G7 declaration to give these long-term security commitments towards Ukraine. So, here in Helsinki, it will give the president a chance for us to ask him some questions about the summit. But he also likely will be reinforcing that he accomplished the goals that he was set to try to meet when he came to the summit. That's what he told reporters yesterday. And the White House has been feeling like they've been riding on a bit of a high after that summit over in NATO, where they not only strengthened the alliance but also showed support for Ukraine through all the allies.",

That's the enforcement arm of the U.S. government in terms of export controls. And it's been pretty tough on some Chinese companies, not to say that this is some sort of retaliation, just more the Chinese hackers would be interested in any communications that senior officials at the department are having, perhaps planning a next level of sanctions against Chinese companies.We don't know that that's actually happening, but that's a very valid reason why they would want to gather information from those officials. And I would also expect that the Department of Commerce and other federal agencies instruct their senior officials, including cabinet secretaries, not to put sensitive communication in emails. That doesn't mean you can't derive useful information from those interactions from meetings or who they're meeting with and when they're meeting. So, that's just kind of the general reason why they might target the Commerce Department. They also went after the State Department. And the State Department first confirmed to CNN that they were sort of patient zero in this hack, in that several weeks ago, around the time when Secretary Blinken was preparing to visit China for a high-stakes visit, the alleged Chinese hackers got into some email accounts at the State Department. We don't know what they accessed. The State Department, you know, touted its defenses and how it reported to Microsoft this incident and not vice versa. So, there's a lot of fast-moving parts of the story and it's just kind of a broader challenge of dealing with a pervasive Chinese cyber espionage threat that the Biden administration is facing.

Not a totally unreasonable point of view from political strategy.
