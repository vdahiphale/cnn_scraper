Any hope of survival was certainly erased after a deep see robot found that large piece of the Titan submersible scattered on the ocean floor. Two debris fields were found 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic. We're learning the U.S. Navy's secret network of underwater sensors picked up the sound of a possible implosion on Sunday around the same time contact was lost with the Titan as went down to the Titanic shipwreck.A senior Navy official telling CNN that it helped narrowed down the area of the five-day multinational search and that, quote, any chance of saving a life was worth continuing the mission. They informed the incident commander that they had heard the sound, but it was not definitive, they determined. We're told they found the Titan submersible's tail cone, as I said, just about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic on board. Titan's creator and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, he was piloting the submersible. Also on the Titan, British billionaire and explorer Hamish Harding, British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman and French oceanographer Paul-Henri Nargeolet who previously completed 35 dives on the Titanic, incredibly experienced he was. Since the time they disappeared, we've learned a lot about warning signs and concerns over the submersible's experimental design and the development process, not going through the protocols, safety protocols and checks that are standard in the maritime industry for submersibles. In the last hour we spoke to OceanGate's co-founder who cautioned people not to rush to judgment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUILLERMO SOHNLEIN, CO-FOUNDER, OCEANGATE:  Safety was always number one priority for us and for Stockton in particular. He was a very strong risk manager, and I believe that he believed that every innovation that he created, whether technologically or within the dive operations, was to both expand the capability of humanity exploring the oceans while also improving the safety of those doing it. I kind of wish we would hold off judgment and just see EXACTLY what the data comes back with. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was almost scheduled to be on this OceanGate submersible trip. He ended up being part of a canceled mission back in May instead. Arnie, appreciate you joining us. I read you say something that Stockton Rush told you and told you, I guess, kind of proudly, that he said he got the carbon hull material from Boeing on deep discount because it was past the shelf life for airplane use? Could you talk about that? ARNIE WEISSMANN, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"TRAVEL WEEKLY\":  Yes. One night we went on the stern of the ship and just sat and talked, and he told me sort of his life story. And part of that was that when he got the carbon fiber from Boeing and he said this was material that had originally been planned for aircraft use, for building airplanes, but that it had passed the date that it could be used for that. And so his implication was they had stuff they wanted to get rid of, but it was past its sell-by date. So that gave me pause, because I was at that point still, I was on the Polar Prince. We were still hoping to dive. This was in May. And so I asked him about it, I said, isn't that a concern? He said, listen, you know, we have partnered with NASA, we've partnered with Boeing on this. We have put it in a pressure tank. We have done deep dives. He said, initially when it was in the pressure tank there were all sorts of noises that were sort of just pinged and made noises, but that those noises stopped after a couple of times in the testing. And it did give me pause. And frankly, if it weren't for the presence of Paul-Henri, I don't know that I would have felt quite so confident. On the other hand, I will say that every day we have meetings, every morning, sometimes multiple times in a day, where he showed himself to be quite what I thought was a very good risk manager, a very good leader with his crew. There were endless checklists in which things were being looked at and repaired. And so he was a complex person. COOPER:  It's interesting, Arnie, that he told you that Boeing was a partner in on this. That's what they also said in a press release in 2021, I believe in some court documents as well. Boeing has denied any involvement in the design or build of the Titan. They have also repeatedly -- this company has also repeatedly cite the University of Washington as being involved in this somehow, though they were sort of vague, but they used those names a lot. The University of Washington has also come forward and said, look, we had nothing to do with the design or the testing of this. I think they rented out a pool from the University of Washington, but the University of Washington said none of their personnel were even involved in that operation. Do you think Rush was overstating the company's ties to his company?",

I was to be on that one, which would have been the first dive of the year. There were no subsequent dives on the subsequent missions. The one that went down and had the implosion was actually the first dive of the year. So it's possible I could have been on the first dive of the year.But the weather conditions changed. It was postponed to the Thursday of that week. Again, the weather wasn't good. But I will say that every day there were a long list of things that still needed to be done. And even on very last day, sort of as a consolation, he said, hey, we will go to this bay on our way back to St. John's and we'll just do a 300-foot dive just so you can have the experience.

And also, I want to bring in retired U.S. Coast Guard captain Peter Boynton. Captain, I'm wondering what your reaction is to the use of Boeing, University of Washington repeatedly by this company. It certainly -- it helps people. It made people feel like these were reputable organizations. But it certainly seems like there is questions about how involved they actually were. CAPT. PETER BOYNTON (RET.), U.S. COAST GUARD:  Yes. I think for most people who are passengers, maybe not everyone, but most people just can't expect them to have the technical know-how to evaluate on their own the safety of a conveyance, whether you are getting on an aircraft, whether you are getting into a vehicle, whether you are going on a vessel or a submersible.

      "sentences": "So it's a great question. And we are on a boundary here, a boundary in many respects. Normally, the Coast Guard is not a salvage or a recovery entity. They are rescue, safety of life at sea. However, there are cases where the Coast Guard does get involved in the investigation, the aftermath if there is an indication of possible wrongdoing or unsafe voyage. And in that case, the Coast Guard can and does get involved.The Coast Guard does not reimburse others for being involved in the search, and the Coast Guard normally does not charge an individual who is rescued unless it is the rare case where there was severe wrongdoing or something of that sort. So if the Coast Guard is remaining there as part of the collection or recovery, that's somewhat unusual and I think is indicative of perhaps investigation underway. And I also agree with the idea that we don't know everything yet. And so there is merit to allowing that investigation to proceed so we can learn more about what actually happened.",

This company was based in Washington State, where the engineering was down, where the -- where the vessel was constructed.So, these are complicated questions, you're going to want to know, look, the company was based in Washington State. The CEO, I believe was a, you know, it depends whether he's a U.S. citizen or not, I believe the vessel was a Canadian vessel. So, all of those are complicating factors. One thing that's really important to know here, about the waiver that these people signed, right? We just saw the excerpt from the waiver. We all sign waivers everywhere we go. Yes, I mean, when Phil takes his many, many children to the trampoline park, you sign a waiver. And they lead the person to believe that well, once I sign this, I can't do anything, I can't sue.
