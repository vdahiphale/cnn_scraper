Kim, I want to start with you on this because in talking to administration officials, they put forward the idea that, look, without the president, without his approach up to this point over the course of the last seven weeks there would be no four to five to six- day pause, there would be no hostages coming home, and yet the political pressure domestically is immense.

Unless they destroy the infrastructure of Hamas and kill the leadership, kill, literally kill the leadership, and prevent the possibility of such a repeat of such an attack, they've done nothing.And Israeli society in every poll that I've looked at, I mean, we're talking about 65, 75, 80 percent are unified on that.

What impact do you think the U.S. can have on those operations and that planning? DOZIERneed to see a different kind of operation in the south than they saw in the north. And according to U.S. officials who briefed reporters last night, they think the message is getting through, that the next stage we'll see is more small operations, more targeted and focused raids through the south, as opposed to these big military sweeps that smash through infrastructure and as many air attacks as we've seen in the past. So, it's because the south is even more densely packed, especially since there are 1.7 million displaced Palestinians packed into the south, Israel had proposed to have them move from one place to a next as it did its operations. And the White House said, no, that's simply not acceptable. You can't keep moving these people around and expect them to get to safety in time.",
