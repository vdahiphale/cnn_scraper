But investigators say that number could get bigger as they get deeper into this investigation.They say that he was covered in blood when he was arrested and actually admitted to some of the crimes that he is accused of committing to investigators, including, as you said, going to the home of two of his friends, Jacob and Ramona Schubach and stabbing them and then going outside and telling investigators that he had taken out the mailman. He said that he went to his friend's house to smoke marijuana, that he started to become paranoid. He thought he was laced with something and then stabbed Ramona and Jay Schubach -- excuse me, Ramona and Jacob Schubach to death. He said that he then went outside and saw the mailman and a witness described Christian Soto beating that mailman and then stabbing him to death and running over him twice with a pickup truck. The horrors do not end there. He is then accused of breaking into the home where three children were home alone, beating them with a baseball bat, including one to death, 15-year-old Jenna Newcomb.

But obviously, it's not going to be much, because everybody from the United States to his employees, to his friends and his family, are absolutely adamant that Evan Gershkovich is a journalist and did absolutely nothing wrong. He just was arrested while he was doing his job. We do know, though, that talks behind the scenes have been ongoing. The Kremlin Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said as much a couple of days ago. They're saying that certain contacts, as he phrased it, were still underway. But just like the U.S., the Russians have categorically refused to publicly discuss exactly what the terms of that negotiation are. So we're pretty much in the dark in terms of that. We do think we know, though, what the Russians want or who the Russians want in return. That's a Russian security services operative who killed a Chechen dissident in a park in Germany.

Sophia, CNN, you, others have all been reporting on this question. The RNC is asking people apparently in job interviews. But you've gone to officials and say, why? Why are you doing this?

And if they're bringing them in for 2024, they want to know what these folks in the states have seen and heard and what they think about what happened in 2020. We know that this is not systematic. The job interviews have been conducted by at least four people. But they've been conducted in pairs. And only one person has been asking this question. And it has not been asked of every job candidate.But it is a very unusual question. And it just shows that the issue of the 2020 election is not over. And it's a central role in Trump's political identity.",

They've been starting from a bare bones standpoint when it comes to staffing in the states. They're behind the DNC. And they've been all doing this within just one week. They've given job candidates less than 24 hours' notice to come show up for an interview. But that also means that they themselves have very little time to kind of get on board on the same page about what it's looking for, for job candidates, how it's going to staff up, how many people they're going to bring back. I mean, they've cut at least 20 staffers in these states. That is the backbone of the RNC's political operation in the states.",
