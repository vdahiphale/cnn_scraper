Meanwhile, some communities on Florida's Gulf Coast are cut off. Thousands are without power. We'll go to the weather center before the brand-new forecast. Plus, there's a health scare. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here to explain what might be going on with Mitch McConnell, who appeared to freeze in the middle of a Q&amp;A with reporters in Kentucky today, just like he did at the Capitol last month.

We could still see power lines coming down here with winds at that speed.I'm also seeing a very big blow up of bright colors here across the Piedmont of South Carolina and also almost upstate there of North Carolina. That is an area I'm concerned about very heavy rainfall still coming down at this hour. One more area here of a blow up over the Gulf Stream, and that's the area that's going to rotate into coastal Carolinas over the next couple of hours, and they -- each one of those storms could actually have a tornado involved with it. But, right now, moving offshore by 8:00 tomorrow morning, finally departing the North Carolina coast and maybe out of our way. Now, we are going to see the chance of some severe weather tonight. Still, the tornado watches are in effect. So, these storms are coming onshore here. And as they spin onshore, they can bring water spouts onshore. I know that. I've seen at least four tornados that actually came through and onshore today and probably go through with the National Weather Service tomorrow taking a look at that damage if there really was any. There's the spin right now. We aren't seeing significant spin at this hour, so nothing like EF-2 or EF-3 damage. So, I think as we zoom in here, the center of circulation is just now moving across Charleston. You can see this light little circle right there of rainfall. It's not an eye, obviously, but it's just kind of the ring around the middle of the forecast at the cone there. So, an awful lot of flooding still coming down tonight and flood warnings are in effect. Please don't go outside and drive through the flooding. It's very, very hard to see.

You know, first of all, Manu, I want to ask you, how is McConnell doing right now? This is very startling, to have seen all of that unfold, and it's difficult to watch. MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it was. And he's trying to carry on like business as usual. In the immediate aftermath of this episode, an aide told me that he was going to see a doctor. This is different than what they said after his July freeze of 30 seconds. Very similar at the time. They said he was lightheaded. They're saying at this time he was also feeling lightheaded. What they're not saying is what is the underlying cause and what led him to that. They're not saying what happened at that doctor's appointment, assuming he did consult with the doctor in the immediate aftermath. He did attend a fundraiser later in the day with Congressman Jim Banks, who's running for the Senate in Indiana. I'm told that the senator was engaging, he was sharp in the words of one person, he took questions, they had a wide-ranging discussion with him and Banks, but Laura, he did not about the episode at all. I'm told that did not come up at all. He has been on the phone with Republican allies, too, through the course of the day, including his number two, John Thune, someone who could potentially succeed him as leader.

So, the same things. And there's a long list of things that could possibly cause this. You know, is it a slight sort of what they call a TIA, a transient ischemic attack, a mini seizure? Could it be a Parkinson's-like thing? And if your medications are starting to wear off, you can have episodes of freezing. But the fact that his aides -- they actually let him continue, answer another question, as you saw there. They didn't seem that surprised by this. We saw this in July, but you get the impression that they're -- they become somewhat accustomed to dealing with this. And my guess is his doctors know as well, which is why there's not this rush.

And you're right, um, the two defendants that we're talking about, Ms. Powell and Mr. Chesebro, they've opted to take advantage of the Speedy Trial Act in Georgia, which is a statute that gives them the specific right to have that case moved very quickly. You have to file a motion very close to the time of indictment.And in this case, it allows and requires actually the trial to be held, at least to begin in October of this year. So, we see that in the way it's set out. What it means basically for the Trump team is that, you know, they're likely to get a preview of the state's case here because the judge is very likely not going to infringe upon his constitutional right to have an effective defense and an effective trial team and prepared attorney to move forward quickly simply because two of these co- defendants have opted to take advantage of a state statute that pushes them, in a sense, on a rocket docket.

This isn't federal court where you're not going to have courtroom. I mean, cameras in the courtroom. This could mean that potentially very damaging evidence will be aired on television.

She was not doing things at his behest. She was not doing things for him. She did not have a signed engagement letter to make her his attorney of record.And in fact, those allegations against her in this indictment are pretty minor compared to some of the other allegations. She didn't basically charge with the Coffee County part of the case, and that is dealing with the voting machine and access to records and those things in Coffee County. A fairly small slice of this case. She's not named in the massive and the sprawling fake elector scheme and the phone call to Raffensperger and those things. Those are other people. And so, her lawyer is saying, look, separate her out, let us try this case. I think in the motion, it actually says, we can try this case in three days, and makes the statement and the assertion that at the end of those three days, the court would have to find her not guilty as a matter of law. So, she's just removing herself, I think, from the bigger, I guess, hornet's nest of the defendants by making those assertions.",

He said he struggled to even maintain his own access to his electronic records. And you have to wonder, given that a couple weeks ago, he conceded in some respect that he'd had and made false statements, why would he go about this default in this way?

So, he's in a very difficult position. And as you mentioned, regarding discovery, I think he really thumbed his nose at this whole process. Judge Howell, I think, made the correct finding that if you're not producing discovery, you're not taking this process seriously, treating these women like any other litigant and taking them seriously, then, obviously, you're going to have to pay the price for that.",

I would only mention, though, that Rudy Giuliani really is in serious financial straits. I mean, he can't practice law in New York nor in D.C. He doesn't have any clients to speak of. He is spending a lot of money to fight against a lot of these different cases. And he's gotten almost no help from Donald Trump. And so, I know for a fact, as a matter of fact, I mean, sources told me that private plane he showed up in Atlanta on was donated by somebody who likes the mayor. It was kind of a gesture on his behalf. And certainly, he's going to try and make money any way he can. But putting up your $6 million apartment is not a sign of wealth.

It protects the system. And so, when you're out attacking them and when you're dragging these otherwise private people into the public domain and slandering them, I'm sure it has a chilling effect on the people who want to participate. I think Giuliani is getting everything he deserves in this. When a powerful person with access to the media and access to communications channels that very few people have access to drags private citizens into that domain and does what he did, they deserve to be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. These people did nothing wrong except show up and try to volunteer for their government to run an election. They should be commended for that, not have their lives turned upside down.
