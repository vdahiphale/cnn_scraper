Trump leads Ron DeSantis, Trump's got 54 percent. DeSantis has got 17 percent. I want to walk up to it just so you can see how big it is. This is a giant gap. \"The New York Times\" notes that no presidential candidate has lost a lead that big this late in a race. You can see no other candidate tops 3 percent in the polls.Now, if it's just two candidates in the race, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, DeSantis still loses by a two to one margin.

And instead of trying to occupy that -- all that space he's leaving on the other side of him, DeSantis is trying to pass him on the right shoulder of the Republican primary electorate. And you can see that he is in a situation that is similar to what any of Trump's rivals faced in 2016.Trump, in this poll, is winning 37 percent of Republicans with a college degree, which is exactly what he won in 2016 according to the summary of all the exit polls that were done, but he's winning - but the remainder, the other 60 percent of college educated Republicans, are splintering. They're not unifying behind any one alternative, including DeSantis. And there you see that unbelievable number in a field with a dozen candidates or so, he is winning 62 percent of Republicans without a degree, which is more even than the roughly half of them that he won in 2016. You know, that makes it tough. The other thing that makes it tough is that Trump has reshaped the Republican electorate, right? He has driven away some of the voters who were least likely to support him in the first place. In this poll, 63 percent of likely Republican primary voters don't have a college degree. So, the party is getting Trumpier, which helps him with the constituents that he's strongest with to begin with.",

And the fact that the Republican Party has not challenged that argument, that voices Republicans trust have not gone out more firmly saying, it's not true, Donald Trump didn't win, that Donald Trump acted inappropriately after the election, now they're kind of reaping, you know, the consequences of that. If you thought that he won in 2020, why wouldn't you think that he could win again in 2024?But having said all of this, the one thing we should note is, Trump's position is not quite as commanding in Iowa. And it is possible that someone could beat him there. The last three front runners were all beaten in Iowa. But it is still a long way from an Iowa win built on mobilizing evangelicals -- evangelical Christians, to building a coalition broad enough to beat him.

And then she seemingly picked up right where she left off on the court. I mean she was leading her team in scoring, rebounding, blocks this season. She made the all-star team.

They're three and a half games behind Chicago for the final playoff spot.

But they have offered their support for Brittany Griner through and through, every step of the way, without any question at all.
