We begin this hour in Washington where right now negotiators are back at the table as they race to end the debt ceiling standoff. Republican leaders and White House officials returning a short time ago, after a marathon session lasted well into the night. The clock is ticking, to get a deal in place before the U.S. defaults on its loans. The national deficit continues to soar where with no rise to the borrowing limit, the U.S. will default on its loans which could be catastrophic to the economy. The Treasury Secretary now saying the deadline for an agreement is just eight days away. But talks are teetering on the brink with at least one top Republican negotiator warning that a deal could come together as soon as today or fall apart entirely. CNN's Alayna Treene and Jasmine Wright are following the latest. Good morning to both of you. Alayna, you first, you're on Capitol Hill and just spoke to the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. What did he say? Is he optimistic?",

He told us that he is more confident now about where things stand in these negotiations than he has ever been before saying because he sees progress.So he entered the Capitol just before 10:30 a.m. And he told reporters that he feels like talks are closing in and they're getting closer to a deal. Now, I am told through my reporting and from sources I've been talking to over the weekend that they want to have a deal in place tonight. McCarthy said that he thinks the earliest they could have a vote is on Tuesday, and he also said that he wanted give members of congress at least 72 hours to go over the bill text and see what is in this bill. So that means that if they want to have a vote as early as Tuesday, that they have to have a deal in place today. Now, he also said that they are working on a few remaining sticking points. He wouldn't say what those were, we know that they are centered on work requirements and spending cuts but they do think that they're closing in here. And we also caught up with some key Republican negotiators this morning like Congressman Patrick McHenry. He said that really it's about getting an agreement on the agreement. Now, they've narrowed the issues that are at stake here, that there are sticking points that they're trying to hash out. But they do feel confident they are closing in on a deal at this point, Fred.",

And that is a huge feat that they still need to overcome.

President Biden expressing optimistic. You just heard from Kevin McCarthy who also admitting it is hard work but he is optimistic. Should everyone else feel the same way? ELEANOR MUELLER, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"POLITICO\": Yes. I mean we're hearing that we could have text as soon as, you know, this afternoon and because McCarthy has said that he wants to give his members 72 hours to look over whatever they put together, that could put this on time for a floor vote, you know, as early as perhaps around Tuesday.

These are all, you know, things that Republicans have basically said that they have to have those work requirements. And things that Democrats have said are a red line. You know, we heard a lot of that, Mica and I were at the same House Democratic caucus meeting on Thursday. Lots and lots of, you know, kind of bemoaning by Democrats that they might have to eventually vote for a deal that could include something like that when they didn't negotiate it. You know, they're saying they didn't manufacture this crisis. So I think that's what's taken so long.

But you know, Republicans also are really adamant on making sure that, you know, those are more stringent. You know, right now, I do think both sides are going to have to compromise a little bit and not everybody is going to be happy, especially with how ideologically diverse this Congress is, and the narrow majority Speaker McCarthy has. I mean I just asked him in this latest gaggle if he thinks that conservatives are going to be even more upset with him, with the extended deadline, as they have more time.

This in the grand scheme of things isn't not so bad.So whether or not there is a clear agreed-upon winner I think remains to be seen. I think we do know that, you know, there are overall, I think overall, we're kind of all losers in this situation. You know, getting this close to defaulting on the national debt is a really, really bad for our economy.

So moderate, still a lot of crowds going to hit the road this summer. But people really want to travel internationally. Everything is open again and everyone is saving up their bucket list trips and they really want to go right now. So that's why you're seeing air fares so high internationally. Air fares have come down slightly in the U.S., so that's good news, too. So pick your poison -- either way, it's going to be crowded.",

Whether that is Southeast Asia, Thailand, Indonesia, or Central or South America, places like Colombia, your dollar is going to go really far, air prices are not too high for those destinations. And hotels are really cheap.So five star hotel in Colombia for $200 a night. I will say if you're going to the capitals of Europe -- Rome, Paris, London, you're going to pay a little more, but the entry of low cost carriers has driven prices down, so we are publishing deal alerts at The Points Guy every single day, sometimes coach fares to Europe as low as $500. The problem is finding a hotel that's cheap enough for your budget. So there are tricks out there. You just got to do your research.

And what the Ukrainians are saying is that the Russians apparently used missiles, S-300 and S-400 missiles for these strikes. Now those are missiles that are normally used to try and take down aircraft, and if you use those missiles in a ground to ground configuration, they become extremely inaccurate. And of course, if you shoot extremely inaccurate very powerful missiles into an urban area, there is the big potential of severe human carnage. And that seems to be exactly what has happened there in Dnipro and some of the video that we got in the early stages after those hits took place, was really horrifying, with people trying to save themselves, from that destroyed building. Much of that building then afterwards burned down, as those rescue crews tried to save as many people as possible. And then, of course, tried to put out that fire as well.

Now, what we do know is that the city currently is not only scouring city and state areas for potential housing options for some of these asylum seekers but also they're taking an unprecedented legal step in terms of petitioning a judge to allow them the ability to suspend its long-standing right to shelter law here in New York City, which essentially requires that the city provide housing to those who need it, be it homeless individuals or in several cases recently, asylum seekers. The city in response to criticism is saying that they are not looking to shut the door on anybody that may turn to the city for housing, but they simply want to plan a step ahead in case things continue to get worse.
