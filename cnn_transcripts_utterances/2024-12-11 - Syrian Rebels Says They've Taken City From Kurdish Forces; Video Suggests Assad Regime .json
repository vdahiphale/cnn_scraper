I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.Coming up, Israel says it's carried out almost 500 strikes across Syria over the past two days after Bashar al-Assad's regime fell. This, as the international community including Iran, condemns Israel and accuses it of exploiting the instability. As Syrians sift through the remains of the Assad regime, they've found a warehouse stacked with captagon, an illicit drug that apparently transformed Syria into a narco-state, reportedly on state property. And we are hearing from the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, who was defiant. Entering court, he was denied bail and is now fighting extradition to New York. As Syria's top rebel leader tries to reassure the world his country has no desire for any more war, the rebel coalition says it has taken control of another city. Video here showing men in camouflage around the administrative building in Deir Ezzor. The city is controlled by a U.S.-backed Kurdish group. And yesterday the Kurds agreed to leave Manbij near the Turkish border after it was attacked by a group backed by Turkey. Mohamed al-Julani, who is in charge of the group that ousted Bashar al-Assad, says Syria only wants stability. Video has now surfaced showing a warehouse on military property in Syria stacked with the illicit drug captagon. The U.S. has said Assad and his allies made billions trafficking that drug and it may have helped finance the ousted president's luxurious lifestyle. And we're getting a look at just how luxurious it was. Here's CNN's Clarissa Ward.

And now the big question is whether Israel would remain there or would withdraw back to the '74 lines once there is a stable government in Syria. And Prime Minister Netanyahu was actually hinting. Maybe he was taken by his euphoric mood, said that the old arrangement and Middle East agreements are no longer in place, and he referred the buffer to Syria.
