That's no surprise to anybody either. But that doesn't mean that he's involved in the intricacies of how that business record was recorded, and that's something they're going to have to establish. On the other side of it, she did take off after Michael Cohen, and say Michael Cohen was always trying to force himself into the campaign, always trying to be part of it.

And that overall number is more than a million kids who've lost a parent to either drug overdose or gun violence.The larger number there is lost to drug overdose, 759,000 kids are estimated to have lost a parent in the last 20 years to drug overdose, 434,000 from firearms. From drug overdose, the numbers increased 345% over the last few decades, of course, as fentanyl has taken over in the United States, leading to many more deaths from drug overdose 39% increase seen in drug -- sorry, gun related deaths. And these numbers are not felt equally across races. Black children are much more likely to have lost a parent particularly to gun violence. And fathers are much more likely to have been lost than mothers, about three times higher that they see these data. And so, they say that children are not only at increased risk of gun violence themselves and drug overdose deaths themselves, but also to potentially losing a parent.
