Russia is now accusing the United States of being behind that drone attack we told you about yesterday on the Kremlin.Vladimir Putin's spokesman just made that accusation without any evidence, by the way, to back it up. This was during a phone call that he had with journalists. He claims the U.S., quote, \"dictates such decisions to Kyiv.\" The Ukrainians have flat-out denied any involvement in that drone attack. But overnight, we saw Russia unleash a wave of its own droves on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. They had handwritten messages on them that read \"for the Kremlin\" and \"for Moscow.\" So let's go to our senior international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh. He's on the ground, live in Dnipro, Ukraine. Nick, the concern yesterday right after this news from Russia blaming Ukraine for these drones -- now they're blaming America -- was is this a pretext for Russia to take further action?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And so far overnight, we have not seen marked escalation.It's been bad, night by night, for the past four to five days across Ukraine from missile and drone attacks. And they seem to be the same level. We saw a lot of drones taken out of the sky by air defense systems. But let's just go back to these extraordinary comments from the Kremlin. No end, it seems, the kind of escalation we're seeing from Moscow. Yesterday, saying Ukraine tried to assassinate their president in the seat of government. Now today, again without evidence, saying Washington essentially told them to do it. Let me give you the quote from Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, on a call with reporters: \"Such attempts to disown this in Kyiv and Washington are, of course, absolutely ridiculous. We are well aware that decisions on such actions and such terrorist attacks are not made in Kyiv but in Washington. And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do.\" Part, I think, generally speaking, of a narrative from Russia, as the war for them here in Ukraine gets worse and worse, of trying to persuade to the Russian population that, essentially, they're fighting the rest of the world. They're fighting NATO. They're fighting all of the NATO alliance, backed by the enormity of the U.S. military. This, perhaps, plays into this, too. But my gosh, how we enter very high escalatory stakes here. Not only have they said that the country they're at war with has tried to kill their president. At the same time they're saying Washington told them to do it. I should point out, again, we are very thin on evidence about this. We're told that Vladimir Putin is in the Kremlin working today, that he has remained calm since what Moscow called an attempt on his life. And that the minimal damage that some suggested may have been done to the Kremlin by the explosion that was seen on a video, well, that's actually being fixed. It's two copper plates that are being redone. So frankly, even if this was an assassination attempt, it didn't seem to bring an awful lot of explosives to even damage the roof that it landed on, one of the drones there. The real emphasis on the Kremlin to come up with the evidence here to provide some kind of proof of what they're talking about.",

That, in fact, was part of his reaction to being accused of having tried to kill Putin or being part of -- the head of the government that tried to do that. He just said he wanted to see Putin in the Hague. And the symbolism of the tour that we've seen Zelenskyy do, yesterday going to Finland, the newest member of NATO, right along Russia's border. And then today in the Hague, the place where so much of the Western alliance that's trying to assist Ukraine here wants to see Vladimir Putin face trial for the mass deportation of children. Startling symbolism there, particularly as we're expecting Ukraine's counteroffensive to more publicly, perhaps, is the best way to say it, get under way. Back to you.",

That's up a little bit from recently. So there isn't anything materially new about this bank. But it is the nervousness on Wall Street means investors are selling it. So the stock is down 38 percent, 50 percent at one point this morning. You can see that big dive there. That is right before SVB collapsed. So you can see regional banks and this bank has had a really hard time kind of finding its footing since that happened. The bank has not experienced out of the ordinary deposits since the sale of first republic bank and other news. That's what the bank said the other night. But in the eyes of Wall Street traders, I guess it doesn't matter. They've been selling this stock here. We know the FDIC has stepped in before. They're looking for a buyer here. The company says that it is looking at strategic options. So we'll see if pieces of this bank could be sold. One thing that's interesting to me is this is the interest rate story, right? As interest rates have risen, the value of its investments has gone down. And if you mark those to market, you know, it shows some weakness on the books.",

And at some point during this appointment, he became agitated and opened fire, according to police, killing a 38-year-old woman and injuring four others. All of the victims are women. Three of them are in critical condition, one of them in stable condition. And according to police, Patterson then took off running and stole an unattended vehicle at a nearby gas station just a couple blocks away from here. Technology played a huge role in his capture. According to police, they say within 20 minutes of him stealing that car, the vehicle tag was spotted and they'd alerted authorities that he was in the suburbs just ten miles Northwest of where the shooting all took place. Ultimately, an undercover police officer found Patterson hiding in a pool area inside an apartment complex in the suburbs there, ending what was a very terrifying and emotional day for the city of Atlanta and beyond. And just very quickly here, Kaitlan, we know that he is expected to make his first court appearance at 11 a.m. He has been charged with four counts of aggravated assault, as well as one count of murder. And his mother, we heard that audio played -- his mother is cooperating with police, as is the Coast Guard. Patterson is a former Coast Guardsman who served from 2018 to 2023, when he was discharged from active duty. They are also closely cooperating with police -- Kaitlan. COLLINS: Yes.

And including one that just relates to brinksmanship, saying that if the Congress just waited until the final minutes to raise the debt ceiling, that would even have serious consequences for the American economy, with 200,000 jobs potentially on the chopping block. That larger warning is related to kind of a three-month protracted default, if they were not able to come to an agreement. That's where that 8 million jobs lost figure comes into play. Now this all follows Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier in the week, warning that Congress needs to raise the debt limit, potentially as soon as before June 1. She said that waiting until the last minute to reach any type off agreement could have serious consequences for the American economy. But really, what the White House is trying to do here, they hope these kinds of warnings will help move the needle in the discussions over the debt limit.

Last flu season, about 150 children died of the flu, many of them as young as this child. So, yes, children can die that young from flu or from flu-like symptoms.Two big questions I think is the child who died, did they have any underlying -- what exactly did they die of, to your point, and did they have any underlying illnesses? And the other children, how sick did they get -- Kaitlan.",

So headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. So if children at that school should be looking out for those symptoms, then really, children everywhere should.
