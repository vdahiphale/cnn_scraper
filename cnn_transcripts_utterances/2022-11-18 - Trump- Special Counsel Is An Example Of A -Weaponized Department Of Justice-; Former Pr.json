Again, we did just hear from the former President, a short time ago.Attorney General Merrick Garland said the decision was prompted by quote, \"Extraordinary circumstances,\" primarily the former President's announcement, to run for president, again, but also, President Biden's stated intention to do so as well. Biden continues to say that it is his intention, to run for president. Do we have the sound of Trump, guys? All right, we do not have the sound of Donald Trump. Let's go to Evan - oh, wait.

It went on and on and on and on.And much of what he was saying was misleading. Some of it was flat out untrue. The fact of the matter is the President was being investigated, yesterday, by the Department of Justice, for what happened in January 6, and also for the possible mishandling of these documents. He is still being investigated, today, and will be investigated, tomorrow, for January 6, and also the potential mishandling of documents. That investigation has just moved to a different super advisor - supervisor, I should say. So, let's begin our coverage now, with CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez. Evan, let's get the facts, here. What did Attorney General, Merrick Garland, say about these two separate investigations?",

I mean, there is no - nothing to say that this was a dead investigation, or that it was being abandoned, and far from it. I mean, the people around him, have been getting subpoenas in recent days. So, there was nothing to indicate that this was about to go away. And certainly not anymore, right? Because of the former President's decision to announce that he's running for office for a third time. The Justice Department says that they needed to appoint a prosecutor, a special prosecutor, to oversee them. Now, as you pointed out, both things are ongoing. One of them is looking at the former President, and his allies' efforts, to impede the transfer of power, after his loss, on January - in the 2020 election. And then, the second one is the mishandling - the alleged mishandling of these classified documents that the FBI retrieved, in that extraordinary search, at Mar-a-Lago, in August. And so, those now are going to be going on. The Attorney General said that they're going to have all of the resources, they need, and that this special prosecutor is going to make those decisions, as to whether there should be charges.",

He could come in, though, with this fresh focus, maybe more scrutiny than we've already seen, of the former President, his associates, even his lawyers. Because, as Carrie mentioned, the Attorney General talked at least twice about obstruction. It's those people, in Trump's orbit, as well as maybe Trump himself, who really could be implicated, in any obstruction charge, stemming from these classified documents, at Mar- a-Lago.

You don't have a victory party, when you indict somebody. And, as a prosecutor, part of the beauty of being a prosecutor is, you get to decide, when you indict, but you do not get to decide when a trial happens. The average trial, in the federal system, give or take, is about a year after an indictment. In this case, you're going to have all sorts of motions, appeals, a year would be lucky. So, let's do the math here. When's an indictment going to happen? We're already basically into 2023. Trial is going to be in 2024.

And they're going to need to decide whether or not they're going to cooperate, in any way, or whether he's just going to batten down, and wait to see what the Justice Department does. But also, John, just to follow up, from something Elie said, Attorney General Garland's mention of the urgency of the case, I thought was interesting, and a little bit unusual. Because usually, Justice Department officials will say, \"We'll investigate as long as it takes. We'll take the facts, wherever they go, as long as it takes, for justice to be served.\" And he used the word, \"Urgent,\" today. And I think that does play into the timing that Elie is describing.",

The investigation is not of one event, the January 6 events, and the other one being Mar-a-Lago, and the documents, separately, they intersect, including a possible conspiracy, to obstruct justice. It's important that the Attorney General twice in that statement used the term, \"Obstruct,\" and also \"Destruct,\" in terms of the records. I think what is apparent, also, he wants to expedite this case, not slow it down. And often it's been Donald Trump, who has slowed down the investigations, around him, because he'd like to delay them, rather than have the possibility, of an indictment, coming down. So, I think we don't know where it's going to go. But, I think - and also, this special prosecutor has a record of not indicting, in a number of cases that he's handled. So, I think, the fairness question, that we can be pretty assured, unless we are the most partisan, and really believe that this is some kind of witch-hunt, which certainly I have no evidence of, and I think the contrary, I think we can believe we're going to have a real investigation, here. And it's very possible that the same Republicans, who in the past, have defended, to go to your point, Donald Trump, this time, might - may see this as too much baggage, given the evidence that they know of, already, from the January 6 committee, especially. But look what we know, about Trump destroying, and his people, destroying documents. Look what we know about the possible obstruction, of turning those documents over.
