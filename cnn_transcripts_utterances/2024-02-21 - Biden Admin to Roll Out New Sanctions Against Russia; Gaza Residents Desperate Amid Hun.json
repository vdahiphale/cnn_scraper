Washington will roll out more sanctions on Russia, following the death of Alexei Navalny, an ex FBI informant openly admits to peddling Russian misinformation against Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Currently, the futures sit indicating a lower start to Wednesday's session. Well times are very tough for Ukraine. We are just shy of two years since Vladimir Putin illegally invaded the east of the country, or Russia now pushing ahead after the fall of the frontline city Avdiivka. And unlike Ukraine, the Kremlin says it's got the hardware to do it, with the Defense Minister pointing to what he describes as thousands of drones being produced each day. And it's not just hardware. Russia has a manpower advantage too. You're looking at Kremlin video of Russia's army chief awarding honors to soldiers who took part in that Avdiivka assault. CNN's, Fred Pleitgen, standing by for you in Berlin. Alex Marquardt is live in Washington. Let's start there, Alex, the U.S. rolling out new sanctions ahead of what is this two year anniversary of the war in Ukraine that as the country struggles to pass the much needed aid package in Congress, what can we expect at this point?",

Now the Biden administration announcing that there will be a new round of sanctions that are going to be implemented against Russia. This was a package that was already being planned. We're told by sources to be timed with this second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine this week. Now, in the wake of Navalny's death, that package is being supplemented. We don't have specifics just yet. This package is going to be rolled out on Friday, when we hope to learn more, but we are getting a few more details. According to Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, these sanctions are going to target Russia's defense industrial complex, to try to cut off revenue for what Sullivan is calling Russia's war machine. Here's a little bit more of what Sullivan had said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Becky, the administration also making clear here domestically in Washington, that one of the best ways they believe, would be to confront Russia would be to send more aid to Ukraine, of course, that $60 billion being held up by Republicans in the House of Representatives with no sign that, that bill is going to be passed anytime soon, Becky.",

And I think you're absolutely right to say that the fact that the in Avdiivka they've pushed the Ukrainians out of that area. That certainly is something that the Russians appear to be building on or trying to build on at the very least, they've said today that they managed to get least infiltrate some villages around that area and south of Avdiivka moving towards another frontline town, which is called Marinka, which has been on the front lines, and have been under heavy pressure for an extremely long time by the Russians. So that's certainly something that they are trying to build on. It was quite interesting to see the Defense Minister make those comments also, to have Vladimir Putin's top general near the front lines, they say they're handing out awards to the soldiers who were part of that Avdiivka operation. The Ukrainians, for their part are saying that they have several major issues. But probably the two biggest ones among them are manpower issues where they said they simply don't have enough troops on the front lines to fill up the ranks and confront the Russians the way that they could. They do say that they could stop a lot of these assaults from the Russians if they had more manpower. But the other big thing and it's something that Alex was alluding to, as well, is of course, firepower. And that's where that military aid from the U.S. being caught up in U.S. Congress by the Republicans in the House of Representatives really is painful for the Ukrainians. In fact, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, he spoke about that with our own Christiane Amanpour, I wanted to listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
