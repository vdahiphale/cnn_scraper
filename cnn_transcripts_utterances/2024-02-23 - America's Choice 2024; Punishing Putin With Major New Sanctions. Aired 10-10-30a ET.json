Today, both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump are delivering closing messages to voters. Several stops planned in the Palmetto State. Though, Haley has done much more campaigning if you want to call it traditional campaigning in her home state and Donald Trump -- yet, Donald Trump remains far ahead in the polls among voters there, like 30 plus points ahead.If you're keeping track at home, friends, here's the delegate count which is how you secure the nomination in the end in that primary. Donald Trump has 63 delegates, Haley has 17. But 1,215, that's the magic number needed in the end. Fifty delegates at stake in South Carolina. Enough with the math, let's get to the trail. CNN's Kristen Holmes and Kylie Atwood are in South Carolina. Kristen, you're in Rock Hill. That is where Donald Trump is going to be stopping. What are you hearing from him and his team headed tomorrow?",

If this looks more like a general election, Kylie, the general election matchup that Nikki Haley wants to focus on, is the fact that polls show that she would be Joe Biden by more than Donald Trump would be Joe Biden. She's got a long way to go before she'd ever see that though. What are you hearing from her team?",

What we've heard from Nikki Haley over the course of the last few weeks here in South Carolina are a number of things. First of all, that she believes that the American people can do better than an eight-year-old president going after President Biden and former President Trump in the same message, as we've heard her do over the course of her entire campaign. And also going after Trump on a number of fronts, saying that he is complaining about those legal woes about him, he's making it personal. He's not caring about the American people. That he is using campaign donations to actually pay his legal bills, which she said is not normal.And she's reminding South Carolinian voters of what she did here in the state when she was governor to try and bring people together when there were challenges at the state facing the tone at the top matters. And here's what she said yesterday on the trail about why her campaign is still alive, saying it's about something greater than herself and reminding voters to get out tomorrow with their friends. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tell your friends, tell your family, email everybody, text them, all of that. This is the time South Carolina can really step up and show the direction that we want our country to go in. I believe in you. I've always trusted you. Then they are talking about my political future. I don't care about a political future. If I did, I would have been out by now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That certainly seems like a lofty goal now that we have seen polls over the last few weeks that show her 30 to 35 points behind former President Trump.

As the chairman of the Republican Party in a state that does allow for mail-in voting, although it is pretty specific, I think 65 and older can do mail-in voting, along with some other exceptions.

But it's also about the energy that people are, you know, experiencing here in South Carolina.They want to be a part of this process. They want to make their voices heard.

Because when you talk about 65 or older, I mean, you know, that is the population that does tend to vote more than any other. BOUCHERYou know, with early voting, at least you're going into a site and you're voting on a regular voting machine. But when you've got to trust the US Mail, you've got to trust the signature verification process. Short early voting by mail adds a layer of potential problems to the mix. So we don't discourage voting by mail. We'd like to focus on early voting in-person and voting on Election Day.",

And it came in direct response to the death of Putin critic Alexei Navalny, and on the eve of the two year mark of Russia's brutal invasion to Ukraine.The Kremlin this morning so far has yet to respond. And Biden is calling them responsible for Navalny's death facing a sweeping new blow to the money fueling his war machine. That's how Biden puts it.

I'm sure that as we pick it apart, it's -- I'll look at these things and say, these are some very strong sanctions. I'm sure that people who are on the other side of these sanctions are going to have their lives ruined. But there's one huge problem in this whole story, which is that, and we're not addressing it, which is that Russia earns somewhere around $500 million a day from the sale of oil outside of the country. And they're spending that money on weapons. And they're killing Ukrainians. And we have not done anything to cut off that supply of oil. And as long as they continue to sell oil, they'll continue to make money, they'll continue to buy weapons, and they'll continue to kill Ukrainians. And so, it's great to do sanctions. And, you know, I'm probably, you know, most -- one of the biggest enthusiast of sanctions packages, but we've left this one thing out, and that's the elephant in the room.",

They sent him to a Siberian prison like Navalny, they put him in solitary confinement like Navalny, and he's speaking out from prison like Navalny. And I fear for his life. And I'm hoping that now that Navalny is no longer with us, the West will wake up and take seriously that this terrible stuff happens to these political prisoners. And we'll do something to try to get him out and get some of the other important ones out, because we're going to need these people to be leading a free Russia at that moment when the Putin regime finally fractures.
