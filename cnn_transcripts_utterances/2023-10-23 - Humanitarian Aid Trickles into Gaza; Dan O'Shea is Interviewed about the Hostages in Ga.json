      "sentences": "Overnight, the Israeli military launching raids on the ground, ramping up airstrikes on Gaza. The IDF, just about a half an hour ago, said there have been more than 300 strikes on targets in Gaza and they say they are preparing their troops for the next phase of the war against Hamas, which is now on day 17.Sources telling CNN, the U.S. is urging Israel to delay a ground assault into Gaza in the hopes of getting more hostages out and humanitarian aid in for the more than 2 million Palestinians who, of course, are short of every necessity, including water. A senior Israeli official tells CNN that there will be, though, no ceasefire. The IDF has now updated their number of hostages. That number has gone up yet again. They say that 222 people were kidnapped during the Hamas invasion and massacre two weeks ago. To think about that, when they add just a few - a few numbers to that, it goes up by three. That's three families who thought that maybe their child or loved one is dead, who now have hope that that they may be returned alive. Each number an individual human being. And this morning, President Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and several European leaders said that they had a chance to speak yesterday, issued a joint statement on Israeli's war with Hamas. The White House saying, quote, \"the leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\" Also this morning we are getting a better picture of how desperate the need for aid in Gaza is. So, a new CNN analysis shows that Gaza is more than 7,200 truckloads of aid short of what would normally have been delivered since the October 7th attack. Keep in mind, Gaza is completely reliant on aid for its existence. The Hamas government failed to do that. So, it's reliant on aid. Seventy-two hundred trucks short. They've gotten in 14 trucks yesterday. That's the context. The U.N. says that Gaza normally receives 455 aid trucks per day. So, compare that per day to the 14 that came in, in just one 24 hour period over this weekend. So, this is a crucial analysis of how dire the situation actually is. Well, the people from Gaza, the catastrophic humanitarian situation therefore is deepening. Near constant bombing has left one hospital overwhelmed they say with bodies. They don't have any morphine left. And, of course, fuel supplies are running out. Because of the aid coming in, Israel has said categorically the one thing that is not included in that is fuel because they say Hamas will take it and siphon it off. Israel's calls for Gaza citizens to evacuate from the north to the south are sparking fears of the displacement of millions of Palestinians. Jordan's King Abdullah calls it a red line that can't be crossed. Our Nada Bashir joining me now from Amman, Jordan, of course. So, Neda, why is this such a red line for Jordan where, of course, refugee camp isn't even an accurate word to use for some of the refugee camps that have been established with Syrian refugees. These are now permanent, permanent homes for millions of refugees.",

This is a huge issue here.But what we've been hearing when we speak to people, many of them Palestinian refugees who still have loved ones, family members stuck in Gaza, and they are watching the news, desperate to see whether their loved ones have survived, whether their homes have been impacted in this latest round of airstrikes. But the message that we've been hearing from them is, they do not want their loved ones to be forced into becoming refugees. They do not want to be exiled because they fear this means they will never be able to return. Take a look.

There were two Americans freed on Friday, of course, as you know, a mother and daughter from Chicago. Judith and Natalie Raanan are said to be safe. They're in good health in Israel, expected to return to the United States very soon. Perhaps as soon as tomorrow. Natalie's father telling \"The Washington Post\" that his daughter's 18th birthday is tomorrow and that she could be flying back home very soon. Former Navy SEAL commander and the coordinator of the hostage working group at the U.S. embassy in Iraq, Dan O'Shea, joins us now. Dan, here, over the weekend, there was a lot of speculation and - and, you know, a lot of reporting out there that maybe there were going to be more hostages, right, that those first two were sort of breaking the seal and at least when it came to some foreign nationals that we would have seen a few more over the weekend. We didn't see that. Does that signify anything to you? DAN O'SHEA, HOSTAGE WORKING GROUP COORDINATOR, U.S. EMBASSY IRAQ: Well, listen, right now these hostages, now over 200, 222 as your report stated, those are the bargaining chips. That's the -- this is the only card that Hamas can play. And obvious (INAUDIBLE) note, the U.S. and other - other countries are putting pressure on Netanyahu and the IDF to slow down this -- the incursion into Gaza and, obviously, limit the scale and scope of what the IDF wants to do, which is to root out Hamas and wipe them out. And that's why I don't think we'll see - I -- we may see more exchanges, but I don't think they're going to come in a flood. I think they'll be dragged out as long as Hamas is trying to - to survive.",

But, obviously, a very small part overall of the 222, the vast (ph) -- while there are plenty of foreign nationals, the vast majority, of course, are Israeli.But we did see, Dan, overnight, yesterday, there was actually the first - the first clashes between Hamas and Israeli special forces in Gaza. So, when Netanyahu said soon you're going to see the inside of Gaza, special forces have been in there. We know they were in there at least once and then a second time yesterday that resulted in a strike - a clash, I'm sorry, and one IDF being killed. What do you think -- do you think it's possible that they - I mean I would imagine they're trying, but what do you think the possibility is of some sort of special forces rescue being successful given that we do know that they're probably being held underground and in various locations? O'SHEA: Well, in my 20 odd years of tracking this, and I spent two years in Iraq dealing with over 400 international kidnapping cases, and 40 plus American hostages taken, Gaza presents challenges that we haven't seen anywhere except for maybe Mosul when we had to recapture Mosul after ISIS had taken over the city and had almost a year to put in their defenses. And Hamas has had over 15 years to prepare for an IDF incursion. So, this will be challenging on every level because even in Iraq and Afghanistan, we own the air, we own the nights. We had forward operating bases all over the place. And the fact that this intelligence failure on October 7th shows a glaring weakness in Mossad and the intelligence organizations within Israel, so we don't necessarily know how much intelligence they have on these tunnel systems or where these hostages are located.",

We accessed the information of voting machines. And also these statements I made about election fraud, they were lies. We knew they were lies. It was part of the big plan to steal the election.
