Cheney, of course, is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and she says she is committed to doing what it takes to prevent former President Trump from returning to the White House.Today's stop is part of a broader push by the Harris campaign to move undecided voters and on the fence Republicans away from Trump. And the timing here is critical. There's just a little over a month ago until Election Day. CNN's Eva McKend is live on the trail in Wisconsin.

There is no Democrat for Trump equivalent here, and it just speaks to how the Harris campaign is prioritizing this and believes this is a winning strategy. But not every Democrat is on board. I've spoken to Democratic lawmakers who think the campaign instead should be investing in core coalitions, black voters, Latino voters, Asian voters instead, and shouldn't be so aggressively trying to go after Republicans and independents. But the Wisconsin Democratic Party, I spoke to them as well, they think it is the right strategy, especially in a state like this one that is so evenly divided. Brianna.",

Two, he was a fake Republican, lots of proof around that. And three, Kamala Harris, in this period of time for our country, is going to be a steadier hand and a better president. And I think that resonates. I look at this as like a corporate restructuring project. And the first thing you do when you restructure a company is you fire the CEO. If we're going to get this Republican Party back to where it's operating with policy, empathy and tone, it's going to have to be without Donald Trump.

Your house is worth more than it's ever been, but your groceries are also more than they've ever been.And so it's a mixed bag of stories in the suburbs. But look both parties are guilty of inflationary pressure. I mean, Donald Trump spent $8 trillion we didn't have that. He promised he wouldn't do. Joe Biden is going to, at the end of his term, spend a little more than $8 trillion and so we've got to go to work. That's one of these issues with the Republican Party looking forward with a GOP 2.0. We've got to be better at actually delivering on the promises we make. I mean, Donald Trump, when I said a moment ago, he's a fake Republican. He's a bonafide fake Republican. He lied about protecting the border. He had lots of strong rhetoric. He scared South America away from coming across the border, but he built 20 miles or 2 percent of the border with a wall that was about a photo-shoot, that was about a political opportunity, that wasn't about actual border security.",

So that adds context to it.But you know, let me just put this in a larger context myself. People talk about October surprises. They look for the October surprise. Now, almost every October before a Presidential Election, you have multiple October surprises, some of them help candidate X, some of them help candidate Y. The special counsel's report that was submitted yesterday is full of October surprises that aren't helpful to Donald Trump.

So a reminder at this point in the campaign, while millions of people are actually voting, is quite useful.And again, it's an opening for Democrats to point out that to some degree, the republic is at stake. That is not an exaggeration. And people need to focus on that. They need to focus on what Benjamin Franklin said at the constitutional convention to a citizen asking him what had been done.
