We have heard optimistic comments over the course of the last week from U.S., Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials, and now Hamas is joining the fray. But as with the others who are expressing optimism, Hamas is also adding a note of caution to their comments.In their statement, they are making clear that, quote, \"Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions.\" And that if is indeed that note of caution that they are raising, suggesting that Israeli negotiators are making additional demands as this negotiating process moves forward. A second Hamas source said that they view the current state of negotiations as quote, \"positive and optimistic.\" And it is important to note that amid this optimism, we are also seeing a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region. The U.S. National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just last week traveled to Israel, Egypt and Qatar to try and advance a deal. He said he hopes that he can put the conditions in place to reach a deal within the next month. And that is indeed the target here, appears to be, to try and reach a deal before President Biden leaves office on January 20th, and President-elect Trump will then be inaugurated. And we know, of course, that the Biden administration has also been closely coordinating with the Trump administration over this deal as incoming Trump advisers have also been traveling to the region and coordinating closely with the officials who they will soon be replacing. It is important to caution, though, that as we are seeing this momentum, as we are seeing this optimistic language, the reason why we are also hearing notes of caution from all of the parties involved is because we have been this close in the past. We have been very close to a deal and ultimately talks have collapsed, and that possibility still very much looms. But Israeli and American officials who I've spoken to have pointed to a new set of conditions in the region in terms of Hamas being increasingly isolated, Israel having accomplished a slew of military achievements in Gaza, including the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, that might make them more willing to reach a deal now. All of this pointing us in the direction of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal. But again, the deal isn't reached until it's done. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The commentary that you just heard about the largest earthquake and the most shocking results of an earthquake in the Pacific is very true. The population is very shocked and saddened by what has happened.The main focus of efforts at the moment is on that search and rescue in the downtown area of the capital of Vanuatu, Port Vila, a number of buildings collapsed and people have been trapped in those buildings with the search and rescue efforts being absolutely phenomenal and a lot of effort is going into that. But there's also been major infrastructure damage to the wharf from a landslide to the main hospital that has no active operating theater at the moment. So there's an outdoor triage area that has been set up to assist people.
