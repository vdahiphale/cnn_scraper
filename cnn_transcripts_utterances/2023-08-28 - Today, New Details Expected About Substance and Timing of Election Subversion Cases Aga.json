Essentially, what this says is if a person is a federal official or former federal official and they get charged with state-level crimes, they can move the case over into federal court if, and this is the big if, if they can show they were acting under color of such federal office.Now, Mark Meadows has already made this argument and he'll have his hearing today. He was saying, I was acting as White House chief of staff. Jeffrey Clark has made this argument. He was a DOJ official. Donald Trump has not yet made this argument, but I think it's very likely that he will. So, Fani Willis, of course, is going to respond, no, you were not acting as a federal official. You were committing crimes and, therefore, you were outside of your federal scope. And we'll get our first sense of how the judge comes out on that.",

Not great, but better than 26. Cherokee County went 68 percent for Trump. So, you're going to have a more pro-Trump jury in the federal court. Also, in the federal courts, no matter where this case is tried, it's going to go up to the mid-level court of appeals, whether in state court or federal court. But if you get into the federal court, you have the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, famously conservative, really seen as the second most conservative of the 13 appellate courts in the United States. They've ruled against Trump. But if you're Trump, you want that 11th Circuit. And, finally, most importantly, if you get into federal court, your next move, if Mark Meadows gets there or Donald Trump, you ask for dismissal on the basis of immunity. If you can show that you were within the scope of your job and that you were not doing anything more than was necessary or proper, then you can get the case dismissed and that's the whole ball of wax.",

And then most importantly, you have the D.A. kind of making the initial salvo in those cases and you have the Trump defendants kind of giving a preview of what could end up being the president's defense.From the political perspective, which is where I spend most of my time, this continues the kind of saga that has really crescendoed to this point. For a lot of these indictments, it has felt like kind of one after another, a kind of waterfall of information that was kind of washing over voters. I think that that mug shot and this kind of latest round of Georgia indictments kind of broke through in a different way. And so I think you're going to see more attention on this case. You're going to see the kind of Trump never surrender argument being kind of tested on a national front and we don't necessarily know how that's going to land. We know among the Republican base itself it's caused people to really rally around him in a kind of short-term way, but we don't know how that hits with the public at large and we don't know if the other candidates are going to actually use this as an opportunity to try to attack him. And so I think that the continuing kind of development of facts in Georgia might have some new political consequences for us because of the pure reason that for this case specifically, whether it's because it has a RICO charge, whether it's because it has other defendants involved, Atlanta, Georgia, some of maybe familiar facts after January 6th. It does feel like this indictment is cutting through the noise in a way that maybe the last couple of ones from the special prosecutor didn't really hit for voters.",

It's ultimately you nominate someone to win a general election.So, let's talk about independent voters. First of all, there are plurality of American voters, more self-identified Independents than Democrats or Republicans. And two-thirds of Independent voters have said they don't want to see Donald Trump back in the White House. That's a problem, not just for Donald Trump, but for the Republican Party if they continue to nominate him. And Astead makes the point, look, we're an unprecedented territory. I think we can say with a degree of certainty that multiple indictments on 91 counts does not help Donald Trump with the American people at large or Independent voters. It may have a short-term bump in a primary, but the idea that this helps in a general election is not just it's unprecedented. That's just, I think, not reality-based.",

I think when you're the president giving the instructions, it's a little harder to hide from the instructions you've given.Jeffrey Clark was over at DOJ. I don't -- I mean, he has not a great argument, but he has a colorable argument. But I do wonder to what extent -- we don't know this right now -- to what extent are they coordinating? To what extent are these defendants getting together saying, you go first, then we'll go? I mean, it's interesting to me that Trump has not yet filed his motion.

She, at first, had a Trump appointed attorney who was funding her legal fees and they wanted her to not recall events that she very much did recall.

We have a violent gun problem in our country. We know that. We also have a problem with racism.And I think that every step on the path that we take either is a step toward more unity, which is something that I desperately want from my community, or it is a step in the other direction. And I think that we all want unity. I was grateful that the governor came to our vigil last night in Jacksonville, because I think it's important for him to see up close and personal the pain this community is in. He offered some help with security at Edward Waters College. But I think that any sort of step toward unity starts with more communication. But it also starts with facing the facts of -- that we don't always say the things that we should be saying in order to step toward seeing our own and each other's humanity. And I think that's really what we have to deal with here in a very honest way.",

And I personally think that that's a step in the right direction.But I think he does need to hear those folks. I mean, it is a community that has been injured over and over and over again. And either we are walking in the direction of truth when it comes to our systemic racism in our city, in our state, and in our country, or we are in denial about that and creating policies that don't really help in that regard. And so I think, as I said, any steps in the right direction start with better communication. So, I think he heard from a community that is hurting and absolutely devastatingly tired.",

But he further said that there really wasn't anything that could have been done legally in this situation, and therein lies the problem.These guns are far too accessible to folks, these AR-15-type of guns. And, frankly, if we want to go deeper than that, if you want to go further than the guns, you've got to address the hate, and you've got to address the fact that we don't seem to want to acknowledge the truth of our history and the way that we should be dealing with it. So, I don't know legally, given the way the laws are written right now in the state of Florida, that there was anything that could have been done. And therein lies the frustration for me.",

Your last full day to prepare is today because we do expect that first arrival of tropical storm force winds for early morning hours along the southern peninsula of Florida.By the way, this is not just a Florida storm. It could impact the Carolinas into Southern Georgia as well. This is crucial we are starting to see that northerly turn and the storm is becoming more and more organized near the Yucatan Channel. Here is the forecast track. You can see how it runs parallel with the Gulf Coast of Florida, so the West Coast. This is where we're concerned about Wednesday into Thursday. And, yes that's a Category 3, a major hurricane. We've seen this unfold before with, of course, is being a game of miles. Any track or deviation to the west or to the east has major implications for so many population centers. But, Sara, we've got tropical storm and hurricane watches as well as storm surge watches posted, as you said. Back to you.",
