At the same time, there's the political argument as well because president, former President Trump has, of course, accused NATO allies of not pulling their weight, threatening to pull the us out of NATO, even threatening to not come to NATO's allies' aid if they were to be attacked by Russia, if they didn't reach that 2 percent threshold.Now, Jens Stoltenberg is someone who often does not make news, Omar. But here he is making quite a bit of news, pointing out there that just five years ago, less than a third of the NATO alliance was reaching that 2 percent threshold. Now, he's saying that the majority of them will. So that is really quite significant. On the political side of things, we should did note that there is, that first debate between President Biden and former President Trump next week, right here on CNN. And that is certainly something that is going to be coming up. I should also note that in three weeks time here in Washington, D.C. is the NATO summit. It's the 75th anniversary. It is -- they're going to be celebrating the admission of Sweden and Finland to the alliance. But there have been a number of moves Omar lately to try to Trump proof both NATO and the West approach towards Ukraine. We just saw last week at the G7, the U.S. sign this ten, sorry, this ten year security pact with Ukraine. We're also hearing that NATO is trying to set up a coordination mechanism to basically take over more of the control of the flow of weapons to Ukraine. And make no mistake, Omar, that's because there is the potential for President Trump to be back in office next year looming over quite a bit of this.",

And now there are only three NATO members, France, Britain, and the U.S., which are a nuclear powers. But there are American nuclear missiles all across Europe in a variety of countries.

This is appointed message to Joe Biden that you got to stop telling Ukraine that it can't use the weapons systems you're giving it a less it avoids striking Russia. Now, of course, Biden has slightly loosened the reins such thatUkraine can hit Russian troops around the border city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian city that Russia is trying to take again. But Stoltenberg has said publicly and I've spoken to a number of European officials in the past several weeks who privately said that they think the Biden White House is still too afraid of Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons, and that's why they're tying Ukraine's hands on long- range missile systems, which could be a deciding factor in this fight.",

And then, of course, the very real possibility that former President Trump could be elected again, where he has not been shy about wanting to do things differently in regards to the relationship there.So, is that move on the part of NATO, is that really just anticipating an uncertain election outcome in November here in the United States?

If you've got NATO coordinating all those deliveries with the big spreadsheet saying, hey, you guys haven't sent your promised artillery yet, that's helpful.But the U.S. is the main contributor to financially and leader of NATO. So if Donald Trump decides to change aid to Ukraine, withdrawal aid for Ukraine and tried to force Kyiv to the negotiating table with Moscow as many inside Ukraine fear he might do, there is little that the Biden administration can put in place to stop that, even the tenure security agreement that Biden signed with President Zelenskyy last week, it's helpful. It looks great on paper, but it's not a treaty ratified by Congress. Therefore, the next president roll it back.",

That's a threat that Trump has made before, is repeated on the campaign trail.But the fact of the matter is a lot of these countries are investing so much in their defense, not because of Trump's threats, but because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And it's made them realize that they might not have Washing -- that they might actually need to face off with Moscow and then Trump's agitation has made them realize they might not have the U.S. to depend on in future.",

      "sentences": "All right. To Israel now where there are new questions about the country's war operations in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the war cabinet that was established in the days following October 7. This was an anticipated move following the resignation of opposition leader Benny Gantz and a renewed request from far-right leaders to be included in the cabinet.Now on Sunday, Israel's military announced a tactical pause to allow aid to enter southern Gaza, amplifying the political risks, because according to an Israel the official Netanyahu did not know about the decision and called the military's announcement unacceptable. Now an IDF spokesperson clarified to CNN, the pause does not mean a stop in fighting. Israel to this point, though, has controlled all checkpoints into Gaza since launching its Rafah military duration six weeks ago. Since then, 1.3 million people have been displaced from Rafah. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Israel. Oren, now -- now that -- now that the war cabinet has been dissolved, decision-making is really going to move back to the government's main security council, which does include far-right leaders like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, so how is this announcement being received in Israel and does this significantly change the war in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's already a tremendous amount of frustration with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has let this war run, and especially frustration that there hasn't been a ceasefire deal yet. We have seen that and repeated protests over not only this past weekend, but previous weekends, there were more protests today calling for a ceasefire deal.Ultimately, the question is, does the dissolution of the war cabinet make it more or less likely? And for that answer, we'll just have to wait and see. Now, the war cabinet had three members, essentially with a vote able to influence how the war is managed. One of those, Benny Gantz, a former war cabinet member, left and that meant the only other two members of the war cabinet were Netanyahu himself itself and his defense minister who are from the same party. So from that perspective, it doesn't make much of a difference whether they make decisions as part of a war cabinet or as part of a security cabinet or if they simply make decisions on their own and don't even rely on the security cabinet, or if Netanyahu, as we've seen him do in the past on different issues, simply makes those decisions without consulting with anybody. It does, as you point out, allow him to head off far-right ministers who had demanded to become a part of the war cabinet and influence how the war is run. They have repeatedly criticized Israel's operations in Gaza, saying it should be resettled pushed for going harder and deeper into Gaza to essentially building out more permanent Israeli infrastructure there. So Netanyahu has been able to avoid that part of it. It doesn't seem like this will affect the stability of the government. So dissolving the war cabinet doesn't mean elections are any closer, or that the government will collapse still, it is something to watch because now the eyes of the country on how this war plays out, are firmly focused on Netanyahu.",

But the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable battle hardened foe Israel has faced on its borders since the 1973 October war.

We saw a statement from his spokesperson, Karoline LEAVITT, as well as comments from Jason Miller, a senior advisor. I'm going to read for you some of what Karoline said. She in thistweet, she responded on X and she wrote: The contrast between President Trump strength and success versus crooked Joe Biden's weakness failures and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week. And so that's kind of giving a little preview of how they expect. No, this could potentially come up next week. I know from my conversations with Trump campaign that they have been preparing for all different types of controversial scenarios and issue -- and topics that will likely play out on that stage -- his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records being one of them. But we also saw in some of their responses to this is they are arguing that this shows that President Joe Biden and his campaign as well as Democrats at large are really weaponizing the government to target him as Biden's political opponent. And they're trying to use this ad and Biden increasingly talking about his legal battles as further proof of that. Now, I also just find it interesting. I want when to point out from an add to what Kevin said, which was really great insight, is that both Joe Biden and Donald Trump's teams see some sort of benefit from talking about his convictions, whereas Joe Biden's campaign, as Kevin laid out, sees that they can try to show this contrast between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Trump's campaign really believes that the rhetoric around I am a victim, I'm trying to run for office so that this no longer can happen to you to the voters is their big message and they've continued to fundraise off of it to spend on it, to talk about it. Now, that also comes as I know, when I do also talk to Trump's campaign, they argue that luck this is a really good message to raise money off on. They also want to talk about the issues and they also want to try to move away from the trial. And so it'll be interesting to see how they continue to try to play off how Joe Biden's and his campaign is increasingly talking about this.",

You're seeing the crews here on the ground. This is an area where the fire already came through so they're putting out some of the hotspots. There were also doing some back burns in this area yesterday and you're seeing the crews here on the ground. We're also seeing some of the crews in the sky with the helicopters and the water drops. You know, they're further away. We tried to get closer to the front line today and what you're seeing is just an area that's inaccessible. And so, what you have to do lot is essentially hike. That's what these firefighters are doing, hiking to the flames, doing everything they can to put them out. And an important thing to point out there, is that in this area, in California in general, we had so much rain that you have a lot of grass, you have a lot of brush, the trees grew and so that creates the fuel. So when the summer comes in, the heat comes, you have so much of that fuel that the flames are able to spread quickly. And so, of course, that becomes a problem for fire season and for really everyone in California and the Western region the U.S. Again, in this area, in particular, 1,200 people are under evacuation orders and many others are being told just to be on alert. There's evacuation warnings, authorities telling people to have everything packed and ready to go in case you do have to go at a moments notice because the wind is so strong, it can again change the direction of the fire quickly or move that fire line very quickly.

I spoke with the surgeon general earlier today. He said he thinks that the risk here is as profound as for cigarettes and for alcohol because were dealing with kid's mental health. He cited a couple of stats and his op-ed calling for this warning this morning. One is that a Gallup survey found that kids on average are spending about five hours per day on social media. Another study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that kids who spent at least three hours a day on social media have double the risk of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and almost half of kids say that looking at social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. And so, the surgeon general is calling for this warning, but it would take an act of Congress actually to put that into place. This and as I spoke with them today, he said he was optimistic something would happen, but it was really unclear which legislators would potentially take this forward and how quickly, Omar.",

And so, he wants to see legislators actually regulate these companies to a greater degree, including trying to due to harassment and exposure to extreme content on these platforms.I stopped the platforms from collecting sensitive data on children, also prohibit use of things like auto play, an infinite scroll, things that keep kids really coming back. He also wants to make sure that these companies are required to share data that they have on the health impacts of social media use on children with the public and with independent scientists so that there can be independent audits performed of their safety.",
