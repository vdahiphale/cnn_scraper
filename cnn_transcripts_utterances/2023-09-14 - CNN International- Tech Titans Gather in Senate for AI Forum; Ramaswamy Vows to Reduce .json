If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is defending his decision to order an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. That's despite not having the full backing of all House Republicans. The inquiry will look into whether the President financially benefited from his son Hunter's business dealings. The United Auto Workers Union is preparing to strike at targeted individual U.S. auto plants if contract agreements are not reached by late Thursday night. This would be the union's first ever simultaneous strike against each of Detroit's big three automakers. Many of the top Titans of tech gathered at a Senate hearing -- in a Senate hearing room on Wednesday to talk with Senators about how to regulate artificial intelligence. But there was little consensus on exactly how to do it. And as Brian Fung explains, some Senators questioned why Congress is even taking regulatory advice from the very companies they need to regulate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "There's broad agreement that government should have some role in regulating AI, but there is still no consensus on how. That's the big take away from a day long summit on Capitol Hill involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world.In the meeting, Bill Gates spoke of how AI could help end world hunger. Others talked about its potential to cure cancer. Elon Musk said the meeting, quote, may go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization. But questions are still swirling about how the U.S. might approach AI regulation. Does the U.S. need a new federal agency to regulate AI? What about bans on AI and political advertising? How soon could Congress come up with a comprehensive bill? Many of these questions are still unresolved after Gates, Musk and others like Mark Zuckerberg, descended on Washington to offer their views. Meanwhile, officials in the meeting from the entertainment industry and labor and civil rights groups, called for protecting workers, writers and minorities from some of the harms that AI could cause. Senators coming out of the meeting said most everyone agreed the United States should remain a leader in AI development while also trying to protect people. But outside of the meeting room, some lawmakers took issue with how the sessions were closed to the public. Senator Josh Hawley called the event a, quote, cocktail party for the tech industry, and he sharply criticized what he said was an opportunity for big tech monopolists to lobby for the regulations they might prefer. That critique was bipartisan, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, expressing a similar view. Still, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who hosted the event, defended the closed-door approach by saying, it allowed lawmakers to hear from key stakeholders in a, quote, unvarnished way. How that gets reflected in U.S. policy, though, is still very much unclear. Brian Fung, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
