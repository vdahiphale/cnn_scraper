And what we're hearing from authorities is that five people have been killed, there are several more injured, some of them in serious condition. This was a shooting attack, and police are saying that they have, what they call neutralized, which means that they likely killed at least one assailant. And there's a very heavy police presence right now in north Jerusalem where just this just happened in the last 20, 30 minutes or so. We're seeing images from Israeli news channels of just an absolute massive amount of police and emergency services. We are getting reports from Israeli media that this happened actually right outside or at a synagogue in Neve Yaakov. It is the Sabbath here, the Shabbat, so many people would be at the synagogue, praying for the Sabbath services. This is one of the worst attacks, targeting Israelis in several months, especially when we're looking at the numbers of the victims. But as you mentioned earlier, this is coming at a time of incredibly heightened tensions and violence, while we did think that today was a little bit calmer than yesterday, this attack is proving to us that this situation is quickly spiraling out of control right now between Israelis and Palestinians.

Last night, rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel as well, and responded with airstrikes in Gaza.

Hadas Gold joining us from Jerusalem, where of course, it's now well into Friday evening or well just about. In a few hours, we will get to see the video of the arrest of Tyre Nichols. Now, it has shattered the U.S. city of Memphis. The 29-year-old man died days after police pulled him over, after the car he was driving, claiming he's been driving recklessly, that was earlier this month. They then allegedly beat him so severely, that a few days later, he succumbed to his injuries. The police chief who has already viewed the video has told us, it shows, in their words, acts that defy humanity. Five police officers have been fired, and they now face varying degrees of murder, assault and very serious charges in connection with the death. They have all been released on bail and bond. Nichols' parents and their attorney spoke a short while ago, and they're calling for police reforms including obligating officers to intervene if other officers are committing crimes. They also want the special Scorpion Unit as it's known, that the office belonged to, permanently disbanded. All across the city in Memphis, people are in mourning and shocked, now, there were plenty who gathered last night for a prayer and remembrance visual at the Skate Park where friends and family members say Nichols found some of his greatest moments of joy. And that is part of the tragedy. Nichols was a lover of sports and the outdoors, an amateur photographer and a father. Sara Sidner now takes us through who he was through the words and images of his parents and friends.

They are super fast, they are also maneuverable, and there doesn't seem -- there's certainly nothing in the Ukrainian air defense armory that can stop them.

So in terms of the confusion over the numbers, that may be because the assailant has also been shot dead. And so from what we understand, seven victims in this attack, the assailant was shot dead. We are getting information from police that this happened in two different locations. The first one was at the synagogue, right? As services were ending Friday evening, Shabbat services were ending. That's where the first location took place. There was several dead there. The assailant then, according to police, got into his car, started driving, at one point got out of -- at a junction of some kind, not clear why, that's when he was engaged by police and police say that a police officer did shoot him there and that he has been killed. But they do say that they are currently scanning the area and trying to find out whether there were more assailants, suspects that they need to be aware of. As you know, quickly developing situation. Seven so far killed. There have been several injured including some in serious condition. This all just happened within the last hour, fifteen minutes. It's 9:30 right now, local time. This happened right around 8:15. So, not even an hour and fifteen minutes ago, like I said, happening during, as you noted a very tense and violent 36 hours or so here. So, while this is a shocking event, shocking attack for people in Jerusalem, for Israelis, it's coming at a time when the tensions have been sky-high.

The -- Paul Pelosi was then in hospital for many days. He suffered numerous head injuries, made thankfully a full recovery. The assailant told police he was looking for Pelosi's wife, Nancy Pelosi, who was, of course, the speaker of the house at the time. Veronica Miracle is in San Francisco. Gosh, I mean, the suddenness of that attack, when the police told him to drop the hammer, it's quite -- it quite takes a bit of watching. VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's very difficult to watch, Richard. And in the aftermath of that, after the attack, after the arrest of David DePape, he had an interview with investigators. It's about a 15-minute-long interview and that has also been released today, which I just listened to. And when asked why did you hit him with the hammer after the length of your encounter, because it was quite a long time before David DePape eventually hit him and then he did it right in front of police, he said that he was not going to surrender, that he didn't go to this house to surrender. He wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage. He admits to all of this. He said that he told David DePape -- or he told rather Paul Pelosi that he would go through him if he had to. And so in that moment, he felt that he needed to do that. He also admitted to using full force to hitting Paul Pelosi, Richard.",

But he goes on to talk about every single thing that he did, and even talks about his intent. But at the very beginning of the conversation, they asked him, what is your phone number, and he couldn't remember his own phone number. So there's some moments where it's a little bit confusing, is this man in his right mind? But then the rest of the 15-minute plus long interview, he lays through every single step of what he wanted to do, and all of the reasons why he felt that he wanted to go after the Pelosis and other targets, which he admits to go -- wanting to go after. So, that's a very good question, Richard, and we'll see how that plays out.",

There have been, over the years, Haitian presidents and prime ministers that had to leave in the dead of the night because they've been forced out by violence, by gangs, by the political turmoil of this country.

The anti-government protesters are calling for President Dina Boluarte to resign. And they want early elections and a new constitution. Of course, we've covered this greatly on this program.

Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of men and women were deported to concentration camps because of their sexuality, usually under another pretext. Germany's Lesbian and Gay Association welcomed Friday's ceremony, calling it an important symbol of recognition for the victims. Now I've made no secret of it, of course, I'm gay myself. And so talking about this and moments of recognition in the LGBT community is important, which is worth remembering. Sixty-seven countries still criminalize same sex activity. You can see them on the map there, mainly in Africa and over towards the Eastern down into some parts of Southeast Asia. The death penalty is still on the books in some and is even being invoked in certain countries, Iran for instance. It's also worth reminding ourselves, there has been much change in recent years, countries such as Barbados and Angola have decriminalized same sex relations. Others like Cuba, Slovenia, and Slovakia -- Slovenia and Switzerland, I beg your pardon, have expanded laws now legalize same sex marriage, either by government or the courts have done it for them. The Vice President of the GLAAD Media Institute is Ross Murray. He is with me now. And Ross, progress has been made. And I guess the core of this is the decriminalization action that is, in a way, the first step that many countries take.",

But you're absolutely right, the decriminalization piece is one of the most basic fundamental human rights to not put people in jail, or in some cases execute them for their lives, for their relationships. And I think it's been really helpful to see if there's been a week of momentum in that. This action from the German parliament, Pope Francis's statements condemning laws that criminalize LGBTQ people, and even several conversations and actions happening at the World Economic Forum in Davos, including lighting up the promenade in rainbow colors between Accenture and GLAAD and a lot of partners in the partnership for global LGBTI equality.",

It's places that governments and leaders in other countries can look at and examine, and to see that if such diverse countries, as Singapore and Barbados and Angola, can take steps to secure the freedom for LGBTQ people, that it can be done anywhere.
