Its key evidence for prosecutors, as they tried to put together were exactly classified materials were moved on the Mar-a-Lago property after the Former President left office. But we also know that witnesses have been asked if anyone tried to prevent them from getting all of that surveillance footage or if anyone tried to tamper with it, or destroy it. Now according to the superseding indictment to Trump employees wanted to destroy this surveillance footage because, \"the boss wanted it gone\". Now the new charges were filed not only against Former President Trump and his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, but they also added a new co-defendant Carlos De Oliveira. He is a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago and he has been seen on surveillance footage with Walt Nauta, moving boxes that contain classified information, including one incident where they moved boxes out of a storage closet, all right before one of Trump's lawyers went to search that closet for classified documents. Now Carlos is represented by a lawyer who is paid for by Trump linked political action committee. His lawyer tonight had no comments but they're both expected to appear in court next week.

He simply gave these examples of how it would be unheard of if the Israeli Supreme Court were to do that.Now he does have a point in that respect, because the Israeli Supreme Court has never before struck down one of Israel's so called basic laws, that these kind of quasi constitutional laws. It's never done that. In the past, however, it has accepted seven petitions to hear, to look properly at this law to decide whether it can stay or whether it should indeed be struck down. And I suppose one, interesting aspects of that, I mean, it could take weeks, it could take months. By that time, of course, the government could have presented other elements of its judicial overhaul which could, again, be scrutinized by the Supreme Court as to the reasonableness or as to the legality as well. And what we've also heard from is Benny Gantz now he's the Leader of the Opposition National Unity Party. And he has said that if Netanyahu were to not abide if his government failed to abide by a Supreme Court decision, striking out or striking down this new reasonableness bill than that, in his words, would amount to a coup, say some very strong words coming from the opposition. Of course, it's all hypothetical at this stage we don't know which way the Supreme Court will go. And we don't know which way the government would go, if the Supreme Court were to rule against it. Of course, it could say this law is perfectly fine, in which case that could take some of the wind out of the sails of Netanyahu's opponents. But for now, this law, this reasonableness law, is no longer allowed. The Supreme Court can at this moment in time no longer strike down decisions or appointments on the grounds of reasonableness, whether it will stand in the long term or depend on those Supreme Court justices decision, which they will begin deliberating on in September, Max.",
