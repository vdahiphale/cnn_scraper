Israel estimates half a million people have fled northern Gaza for the south. Israeli officials say that's where they're working with the United Nations to establish a humanitarian zone to provide those vitally- needed supplies. With Israel clearly preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza, President Biden said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview aired Sunday, it would be a big mistake for Israel to re-occupy Gaza as part of its effort to eliminate Hamas.

There are tens of thousands on the border with Gaza right now. If you look at the fact that if they go in, which they are, sort ofheavily hinting that they will, calling this a new phase in the operation that's coming, saying it will involve significant ground operations, then they will be engaging likely not only with Hamas who has proven itself to be very well prepared for this, but also likely other militant groups in Gaza as well. And that will worsen the humanitarian situation. We know that although Israel says more than half a million people have evacuated to the south as they were told to do a few days ago, many are left, including according to the World Health Organization in hospitals, the more vulnerable patients, doctors making the very difficult decision to stay behind to care for them. In addition, it would be increasingly dangerous if this becomes a ground operation to bring aid in which we know has not yet happened. A lot of focus this morning on the Rafah Crossing down in the southern border of Gaza with Egypt. Both sides, Hamas and Israel denying that a ceasefire or humanitarian corridor has been arranged as of yet. But there are truck-loads, plane-loads of aid waiting on the Egyptian side, and on the flip side, civilians trying to get out. We've seen live images of civilians waiting at that border this morning. This is why you see the diplomacy intensifying, Secretary Blinken has now arrived back in Israel, will be pushing for more humanitarian assistance, and of course, stepping up efforts as the U.S. has been doing since the start of this, to try to prevent the conflict from spreading.

Now, when you look at the relationship between Israel and the United States, it really may be rare for U.S. troops to even come close to going into Israel. Now, there's been training between the Israeli forces and American forces in the recent past.In fact, just in the run-up to this particular event, you know, over the last about eight-nine days ago now. And that, you know, shows that there's some maybe ventral probability between U.S. and Israeli forces. One possibility is that U.S. forces would be used not in a hostage rescue role, but in a humanitarian role. That's one possibility. The other possibility, of course, is hostage rescue force, normally, the Israelis would want to take that responsibility themselves, and make sure that they were in control of any hostage rescue operation.",

They have not worked in any of those other areas that are under Palestinian control like in the West Bank, for example.And that is usually been the province of the Israelis. Now, could they do something? Yes, they could train-up very quickly and try to do a rescue operation or something like that. But it would be very difficult to do that because you're talking a very tough target, you know, especially if the hostages are in the tunnels.

So, depending on the severity of the storm, I don't think it was that severe.But depending on that, that could impact operations. You know, one of the most famous ones was D-day, which was delayed for 24 hours before Eisenhower launched that operation. So, weather plays a huge factor in military operations.

I mean, it's a Herculean task, and the sort of balance around the sentiment towards what's going on is really on a knife's edge.MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I mean, the first part of it asking them to condemn Hamas isn't as hard as it sounds, because many of these countries aren't fans of Hamas. They obviously are very concerned about Palestinians more generally and the casualties coming from that and also their -- you know, the effort to get aid in there. It's just not getting in there and it's a grim situation that you've been reporting on that, of course. We did have this very stark language from the Egyptians talking about this collective punishment. This idea that Israel has a right to defend itself, but it's tipped into collective punishment. That was very stark. And actually, over the course of the morning, we've seen that being echoed around the world really. We had similar language from the Chinese, and even the Irish prime minister, would you believe. So, this is a real challenge for Israel. So, I think he's going to be going back to Israel and saying, you know, you've got to protect civilians. You can't target civilians. You've got to get aid in there. And that's going to be his big challenge right now. I spoke to the IDF earlier today, they made it very clear that civilians aren't their enemy here, and they're doing all they can to protect them, it's Hamas that made them vulnerable.",
