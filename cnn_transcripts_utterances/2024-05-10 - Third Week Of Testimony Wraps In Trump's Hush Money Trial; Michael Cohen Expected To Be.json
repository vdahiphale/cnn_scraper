Prosecutors do plan to call their star witness to the stand. That is Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. I'm here again with CNN chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid. Also with us, CNN's chief domestic correspondent, Phil Mattingly. Paula, there's a lot for Michael Cohen to button up for the prosecution. They also have indicated today, next week might be the end of their case. So they -- they actually are laying this all at Michael Cohen's feet?",

Because, as of now, they have not established a direct link between the defendant and this alleged falsifying of business records.They certainly have testimony from Jeff McConney. They have notes from Allen Weisselberg who won't be called. But this is the prosecution's only direct link. And unfortunately, for the prosecution, not only is he -- he has multiple convictions, including lying to Congress and pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. But he also -- his entire identity, his career, the way he makes a living is attacking the defendants. So the prosecution is really going to have to do a lot of work to convince the jury that they should trust whatever it is he says.",

But he has a personal reason to want Donald Trump to feel the kinds of consequences that he believes that he's felt.And the prosecution is going to have to address that preemptively. But then the defense will have their turn at cross, in which Michael Cohen's going to get grilled. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Oh, I don't think there's any question. I think if you thought Susan Necheles' cross-examination of Stormy Daniels was sharp or aggressive or perhaps kind of condescending in some ways, get ready. That was the preview. If you want to know how they're going to go after another person, who has kind of the last couple of years off of their role against Donald Trump or being attacked by Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels was that, except multiplied by about three thousand, and that's where they're going to be with Michael Cohen. I think what's been fascinating to watch over the course of the last four weeks has been how prosecutors have kind of subtly or not so subtly laid the groundwork for making clear Michael Cohen is not a wonderful individual. Michael Cohen is not liked by many people. Michael Cohen is -- what was it Hope Hicks said? He's - he's a fix-it guy, and assistant -- (CROSSTALK)",

Because Trump is very adept at not leaving a paper trail, which is why it's so remarkable in that he's -- he's really charged with not a paperwork crime -- I don't want to diminish the charges -- but really, it's falsifying business records. And this is going to be, in terms of the cross, I mean, this is the defense. The cross-examination of Michael Cohen is the defense case. It's everything Todd Blanche has been focused on.

Let's go straight to CNN's Kara Scannell, who was in the courtroom this morning. So, Kara, the gist of the testimony today really got back to the nuts and bolts of this case, which is the documents. What did they say? The communications. What stood out to you in all?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, we saw four witnesses today, all involved in putting into evidence from phone calls, a lot of these calls related to Michael Cohen.You know, we expect him to be testifying as soon as Monday. So in a little bit today was setting up what will come on Monday, Michael Cohen and the -- the phone calls, the text messages, the conversations that he's had. Several of these records related to calls that he had between Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, David Pecker, at AMI, who was involved in two of the catch-and-kill deals, and Dylan Howard, who was also involved in the Stormy Daniels deal, to some extent. So all laying the groundwork for Cohen and what he will be talking about when he comes onto the witness stand. Now interestingly, Trump's attorneys asked the judge to ask Cohen to stop making public statements about this trial and about Donald Trump. The judge said that he would direct the prosecution to tell Michael Cohen not to say anything else about Trump or the trial. And to tell Cohen that this was coming from the bench. So a warning to Cohen to stop talking ahead of his testimony, which is expected to go next week. Now, prosecutors also said that they may rest their case by the end of next week after calling two witnesses. They did not identify Cohen. But it's the elephant in the room because everyone's talking about how he has not yet testified in the case. And he's obviously a person at the center of the payment and also in the reimbursement, which led to the charges of falsified documents that Donald Trump is facing. We also saw today what is often called a summary chart that pulls together what the alleged crimes were. One of the paralegals for the D.A.'s office brought that in. And it lays out the 34 counts in this case. And that's the paperwork. Those are the checks, the invoices, and the vouchers that tied to the general ledger that prosecutors say were falsified. So a little bit on the dryer side of testimony when you're coming off the day with Stormy Daniels. But certainly testimony that is very important to this case, and that is important to setting up Michael Cohen, whose testimony could begin on Monday -- Abby?",

No, absolutely not. Now, to be clear, there's still at least a week or several more days of testimony. And who knows what comes from Michael Cohen? But certainly -- here's where we see the difference between common sense and reasonable doubt. Where, as matter of common sense, this just didn't look right. And clearly, the former president and the folks around him did find that some of the conduct with respect to the sexual behavior with Stormy Daniels was embarrassing in some way. Now, does that rise to having been so problematic that they wanted to hide it from campaign and voters That's just not there yet.",

He's not. He's able to go. He complains about not being able to campaign and then fundraises off of that and also scheduled a rally. He actually -- Phil Barb (ph) had this great piece on \"The Washington Post\" either today or yesterday, really breaking down how much Trump had -- would've been able to campaign. Out of less than 25 days or so, he said 12 free days. And he hasn't really spent all of that campaigning. There's been a couple of rallies here and there. There's one Saturday. There's one in Ohio after that. But really, he could have been campaigning a lot more than he said. I think he's been fundraising a lot more off of the accusation that he's not allowed to campaign than actually campaigning.",

So just all of these basic facts that help people who don't know very much about this case understand what the prosecutor was saying when he announced that this would be an election interference case. And this week, it was interesting because there were so many people who were in Trump's inner circle, or at least in that contacts list of, whatever, 31,000, 39,000 people. And getting to have those people on the stand, people who felt affection for Trump, right? People who weren't necessarily there to tear him down. They're also supposed to be there to build a case. What Cohen -- why Cohen is interesting is because we heard a week of people saying he's terrible. And all those people had one reason or another to say why they didn't think he was a good guy. So once he gets up there, they are going to finally have to make this case with him, that he did something at the behest of Trump, and that that is part of this process about the election.",
