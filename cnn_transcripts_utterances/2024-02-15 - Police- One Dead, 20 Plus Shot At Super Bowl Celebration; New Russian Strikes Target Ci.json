The uproar started when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner announced what he called a serious national security threat.Turner also urged the president to declassify the intelligence, with several senior members of Congress briefed on the matter, say the intelligence about Russia's threatened space is concerning but it doesn't pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests. Another official tells CNN the threat doesn't involve a weapon that will be used against humans. Now, Russia has used an advanced hypersonic missile for the first time in combat. That's according to a scientific group in Ukraine, which analyzed missile fragments from a Russian strike on Kyiv last week. It hit a residential building in the city killing four people and leaving 38 others injured. Ukrainian group says Moscow used the so- called Zircon missile, which is believed to fly eight times faster than the speed of sound. Experts say the weapon can evade even the best of Western anti-missile defenses. All right. I want to bring in Malcolm Davis, who's a senior analyst for defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and he's with us from Canberra.

DR. H.A. HELLYER, SENIOR ASSOCIATE FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES, ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE: I don't think about Netanyahu trying to put pressure on Hamas about a deal. I think, unfortunately, this is the logical consequence of Netanyahu strategy or lack thereof over the past four months. I think that all of the signals are that indeed the Israelis intend to go into Rafah. And if they do, I think there will be massive consequences, not least of which will be applied to the Palestinians. Gaza, on its own is usually under the best conditions, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Rafah, it's far more than that. And I don't think that there is any possibility of the IDF or even the most incredibly strategic and moral army in the world going into Rafah and not having a mass casualty event. And unfortunately, what we've seen over the past four months is that the IDF has acted with, you know, incredible disproportion of means. I think that the inevitability of a huge massacre is really staring at us in the face, and it's incredibly important that the Israelis do not go into Rafah.",

If there is an incursion of the Israelis into Rafah, more deeply, and there is a massacre, there is a mass casualty events, I think those nations that have diplomatic ties with the Israelis are going to be placed under tremendous pressure from their own populations to downgrade or suspend those ties. And, of course, this completely changes the security architecture of the region. I think it also has an impact and repercussions on those nations' relationships with the United States and Israel's backers, at this particular moment in time. Even if the leaderships of those countries, are uninterested in reconsidering the regional arrangements or security architecture of the region. In that regard, that the relations are going to be changed irrevocably.Already what we've seen across the world in the Global South, but really just across the world, is a recognition that when the West and particularly, United States talks about the rule of law, a rules-based order internationally, human rights, invasion, occupation, people laugh. I'll be very frank with you. I've done a lot of meetings over the past four months in different parts of Europe, in different parts of Africa and Asia, and the credibility of particularly the United States, but also other European countries that are backing the Israelis at present, it's extraordinary. I've never seen it like this. When the Israelis are currently in the dock at the International Court of Justice being accused of genocide. And you have states like the U.S. and Germany and elsewhere, saying, no, we don't see that there's any basis to this case, when literally the highest court in the world considers the case to be plausible enough to be heard, then, we have a big problem in terms of how the rules-based order goes forward. The credibility of those in the West that are constantly trying to say that Israel is legitimate in pursuing and prosecuting this war, despite the fact that around 30,000 people, the vast majority of whom are civilians have been killed over the past four months. I think we have to stop and really think what this means not only for today, not only for the region, but really for international order, for Ukraine, for the future of any rules-based international order.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kim, of course. So, one of the reasons why we are seeing that the Japanese economy, the Japanese GDP is going down, is because Japan is facing a demographic crisis. We know that over 10 percent of the Japanese population is over the age of 80 and nearly a third of the country is 65 and above, which is retirement age. Now, what this means for the Japanese economy is that its less productive. You have less people working for the economy, less people contributing to it, and that means that the GDP continues to shrink and shrink.Now, the latest government data released earlier this morning show that the 2023 nominal GDP for Japan was $4.2 trillion. Germany on the other hand was $4.4 trillion in 2023, which of course means that Germany has now the third largest economy in the world. Now, I've been living in Japan for over three years now, and it's very obvious that it is a super-aged society. You don't have to go very far, just going to the doctor's office or the beauty salon, for instance, and most of the other people there are elderly people. So, again, these demographic changes that we've been seeing in Japan for the past 10, 15 years have greatly affected the country's GDP. Now, another factor here are currency developments. So last year, the Japanese yen on average was about 141 yen to the dollar. Ten years ago, it was 80 yen to the dollar. We calculate GDP, of course, in dollar terms. So on the whole, it looks like Japan's GDP has gone down. Now, the last factor here contributing to Japan's now position as fourth in the world in terms of how big the economy is, is private consumption. In Japan, private consumption makes up about half of the economy. But in the last quarter, private consumption went down 0.2 percent. Why? Because prices in Japan have been increasing, people are spending less and less. They're holding onto their wallets and they're not spending as much in the country. So again, these are all factors that contribute to Japan's position now as fourth in the world in terms of its economy, Kim.",
