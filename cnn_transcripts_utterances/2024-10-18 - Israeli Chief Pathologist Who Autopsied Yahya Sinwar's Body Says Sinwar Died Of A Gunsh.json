Tonight, the chief pathologist who autopsied thebody of Yahya Sinwar, tells CNN what he believes killed the Hamas leader. We are live for you in Israel in just a moment. Also ahead, President Biden says Sinwar's killing could be quote, \"a path to peace\". Well, Israel and Hamas shared that  optimism in this moment. I'll chat with a former Irish President Mary Robinson on the diplomatic path ahead. And Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both campaigning for pivotal votes in the swing state of Michigan today. We'll have a closer look at the blue wall, and why it matters so much. But first, tonight, the Middle East remains on edge after Israel eliminated its number one enemy, that's Yahya Sinwar. Hamas confirming that its leader was killed by Israeli forces. Palestinians who are mourning Sinwar's death gathered on Friday in Mosques to pray for their slain leader who they perceive as a martyr. Thousands of protesters rallied in Yemen's capital to honor Sinwar as you can see there. Many there were chanting slogans and carrying posters of the dead Hamas leader. Top U.S. officials were hoping Sinwar's death sparks an opportunity for progress in the war in Gaza. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And certainly, there are some pictures and videos that appear to have emerged that seem to show North Koreans possibly getting a Russian military gear, Russian military uniforms, that is certainly something that the Ukrainians are saying is happening. So far here, what you're hearing from the leaders of those allies of the United States, and of course, the European countries as well is that they want to continue to aid Ukraine. There really wasn't anything specific about this possible new aid from North Korea, but at the same time, the European allies and the United States are saying that they are going to full-on continue to support Ukraine. You mentioned that he said there was near unanimity, one of the things obviously that the Ukrainians have been asking for again and again, Isa, is to -- for the U.S. and other countries to allow them to use some of those longer distance weapons that they have already gotten from the United States and other countries to be able to strike deep into Russia. And so far, that hasn't been forthcoming. The Ukrainians say that, that is something that's very detrimental to their defense. They believe that they can hold up some of the Russian advances that have been going on in the east of the country, and of course, that are made more powerful the Ukrainians say by North Korean ammunition that they're getting, and then possibly North Korean fighters as well if they're allowed to strike deep into Russian territory. And I think it's something that the Ukrainians are going to keep pushing for, and I also think that there's actually quite an interesting dynamic that's going on there as well, and that we've seen time and again, that the way that the United States goes is the way that the main allies of the United States go as far as supporting Ukraine is concerned. And so, therefore, countries like the United Kingdom, for instance, could give Ukraine the possibility to use those Storm Shadows missiles deep into Russia -- into Russian territory if for instance, the U.S. allows Ukraine to use its weapons to do the same thing. So, all of that is very important, but it doesn't seem as though there's been much headway made on that, despite all these leaders saying that they are going to continue Ukraine -- Olaf Scholz said, once again, for as long as it takes, Isa.",

And that's exactly what this campaign has to clinch, or either campaign has to clinch to get that victory in November. So, it is why this state in particular is so crucial. Now, it is one that President Biden only won narrowly in 2020. Some of the counties that the Vice President is going to, today, are trying to keep those gains. For example, there's Kent County, that is a county that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, but then voted for Biden in 2020. The other two counties are counties that Biden won by wider margins in 2020 versus 2016. So, certainly, this is the campaign trying to make sure that they can lock in their coalition in these different parts of the state. Now, in Lansing, the Vice President in particular is going to be focused on union workers. Of course, that is a crucial part of the voter bloc that she needs to keep to try to win this state. And as she's going to draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump, especially on manufacturing. Now, the other sort of new element here is that, this is going to be the first presidential election where Michigan can early vote in person. And that is something that campaign officials tell me they were trying to capitalize on because this seat is very complicated. There are a lot of different parts of the coalition here, the Arab-American community, for example is one where the campaign knows are going to have some losses given the Israel-Hamas war. But they're trying to make up ground, say, with a suburban areas in the state in those white college-educated voters, and they want to try to do that early on and try to get them to early vote. They're going to use the star power to do that. I'm told that tomorrow in Detroit, the Vice President will be joined by Lizzo, and then later she'll be in Georgia where she's going to be joined by Usher.

Yes, we have generators, but you can't get more fuel unless you haven't stored up.

The Hamas leader's death is raising renewed optimism as you've been here for the past 24 hours for a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal, but all of that is far from certain.
