Since last Thursday, the company has canceled more than 15,000 flights including 2300 set for tomorrow. FlightAware finds 89 percent of the nation's cancellations just today belong to Southwest Airlines. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg promises to hold the nation's largest domestic carrier accountable, but for some passengers, Southwest may never be able to make up for days of delay, misplaced luggage, and ruined holidays.

They are so over having to deal with the delays, with the cancellations, with the re-bookings, but it seems at least one more day, they're going to have to deal with just that. The slew of cancellations continues already since this saga started last week, more than 15,000 Southwest flights have been canceled today, another 2500 or about 62 percent of the planes that they expected to put up in the air. Looking at the line behind me though here at the Southwest ticket counter, you would think that there would not be a problem at all. But this really doesn't translate to the mass of the passenger experiencing.The reason that really no one is in line or that is considerably thinner than what we've seen in past days, people don't have planes to get on. So, even those that are coming here with a flight scheduled to take off on time, they're encountering a different set of problems. Earlier, I spoke to an 11-year-old girl who told me through tears that she had planned to travel as an unaccompanied minor but because of staffing shortages, she wasn't able to get on the plane that she had anticipated getting onto Florida later today. And the loyalty of some of the Southwest fliers who have flown with this company for in some cases, decades, it's really being tested here. Earlier, I spoke to Michelle Smith. She said she's flown with Southwest for more than 20 years. But after going what they -- what she went through this week, she's really drawing all that into question.

Now, the policy put in place by the Trump administration during the early days of the pandemic, allows federal officials to deport migrants before they have received an asylum hearing. But the court's ruling has some interesting allies. Conservative justice Neil Gorsuch siding with the court's liberals about eliminating Title 42 and writing \"the current border crisis is not a COVID crisis. And courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency. We are a court of law, not policymakers of last resort.\"Joining me now, CNN's Leyla Santiago, she has been in El Paso now for days, and CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez. Leyla, I'm going to begin with you. You're in El Paso. You are seeing the results of some policies. And they're still preparing, as I understand it, for another surge of migrants to come through.

Now, I just want to remind viewers why we're still seeing migrants in Texas and why there are still concerns of a surge.Title 42 does not apply to all nationalities. It really depends on who Mexico was willing to take back and who they can expel to their native countries. And that doesn't always apply to all the nationalities that we're seeing arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border, which is why migrants are being released after being processed by border authorities. Of course, there are also migrants who are evading border authority. So, that is why the administration is still focused on their preparations be setting up temporary facilities, scaling up air and ground transportation, and working with NGOs along the U.S. southern border. The administration though is also taking the opportunity to tell Democrats and Republicans to find comprehensive immigration reform and to work towards that.

This is something CNN had reported on as it was happening at the time. McEntee also said that he heard at one point Trump mentioned a potential blanket pardon for those involved in January 6. You know, in a transcript, he says Trump raises this possibility the White House Counsel pushes back and says, you know, this isn't a good idea.
