Also happening this hour, the shake up in Ukraine's Cabinet Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hands in his resignation after the country suffers a deadly wave of attacks, we'll be live for you in Kyiv. The U.S. Department of Justice charges six Hamas leaders over the October 7th attack on Israel, the first attempt by the U.S. to hold the terror group accountable. And as the race for the White House kicks into full gear, fresh CNN polls show a dead heat race in critical battleground states. Now, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, at 09:30 local time, and it does look like a quite open for the main indices. That's at least what is being indicated by the futures markets after steep losses yesterday. Of course, technology stocks have been a real drag in recent weeks. Back to those markets, bottom of the hour as they open for you. In Ukraine, rare deadly strikes in the west and big changes on the way for the government in Kyiv. Well, sirens sounded as Russian missiles pounded the City of Lviv. Officials say seven people were killed, including three children, and this comes a day after one of Russia's deadliest attacks of the war. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Foreign Minister was amongst those to hand in their resignations ahead of an expected cabinet reshuffle. That is, according to the Parliament Speaker.

New information into CNNconfirms that this strip of land between Egypt and Gaza, the Philadelphi Corridor, as it is known, is the main sticking point preventing a deal between Israel and Hamas. A diplomatic source familiar with the matter told me, quote, as long as the Philadelphi Corridor issue is not resolved, there is no deal. Things are very tense, very much up in the air they said. Well, Nic Robinson connecting us from Tel Aviv and Kylie Atwood is in Washington. And Nic, you know, others I've spoken to today familiar with what is going on in these negotiations were very frank today. They said they're going nowhere at the present, what are you hearing?",

Kylie, Yair Lapid the opposition leader also quoted in an extensive report in \"The Times ofIsrael\" today telling members of his party during a faction meeting in the Knesset that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government prefers the war, and as long as it exists, the war will continue. He says, the forever war will go on as long as this government is in power. And his words, echoed by many inside Israel, not everybody, by any stretch of the imagination, not everybody is calling for Netanyahu's ouster, but there is a -- there is a groundswell of those who are inside Israel. And real concern, and as I understand it, shared by those in the Biden Administration in Washington about Netanyahu getting in the way now, of any deal. As I said to Nic, I've had the talks at present described to me today as going nowhere. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right. I mean, you heard President Biden earlier this week pretty bluntly say that Netanyahu isn't doing enough. He was asked by a reporter if he's doing enough to get a deal into place here, and he simply said, no. He wouldn't expand on that, but the fact that the president felt the need to make that public statement, not just -- you know have these discussions privately, as we have reported on extensively, U.S. officials growing concerned with Netanyahu in recent months, and of course, growing particularly frustrated with Netanyahu after he gave that press conference earlier this week, doubling down on Israel, not pulling out of the Philadelphi Corridor. There is a sentiment here in Washington that those frustrations with Netanyahu continue to grow. At the same time Becky, the Biden Administration is determined to put something back on the table to work with Israel, excuse me, to work with Egypt and to work with Qatar to get something back on the table to Israel at Hamas. When I speak with U.S. officials, they are privately not overly optimistic that what they're going to put on the table right now is going to be a breakthrough by any stretch of the imagination. But they do feel that there is an urgency here, particularly after those six hostages were murdered over the weekend, they think that things need to get back on track. Whether or not Netanyahu actually comes back to the table and is willing to work on it. It doesn't seem like he's in that space right now, but U.S. officials say that they're going to continue pushing.",

I really never expected that you and I will be having this conversation about a blue dot, but it is anincredibly important one, as you have eruditely laid out mate, I thank you for that on behalf of our viewers, keep up the good work, mate. Thank you. Well, Donald Trump returns the campaign trail today. He is also headed to Pennsylvania, where he will answer questions at a town hall hosted by Fox News in Harrisburg. Meanwhile, while his running mate, J.D. Vance is set to speak at a chase the vote rally in another battleground state, Arizona. CNN's Alayna Treene with more from Washington. So, this is Trump's sort of return to the campaign trail, as it were. I wonder what we can expect to see and hear from him.

      "sentences": "Right. Well, it is a Fox News town hall. I'll tell you, what I find always interesting about these types of events isthat Donald Trump tends to be a little bit more comfortable, a little more candid when he's sitting down and being interviewed by someone he knows, someone he likes, and Sean Hannity definitely falls in that bucket. You can remember a little over a year ago, he did a Fox News Town Hall with Hannity, and he had made that now infamous comment about him being a dictator on day one. It was a joke, but of course, that has stayed with his campaign throughout the rest of the election cycle. So, stay tuned for that, but look, this will be a pre-taped interview airing in the U.S. at 09:00 p.m. Eastern. But what I'm told when I talk to Donald Trump's campaign is that this is really their version of debate prep. We know that Donald Trump doesn't like formal debate prep. He doesn't like to do the mock sessions where he has someone standing in for his would-be opponent, in this case Kamala Harris, and said he likes to do more informal sessions and use these types of events, particularly town hall style events, to answer questions and really use this as a way to get out his talking points and see how it fits and how it lands with his audience. So, I'd expect that from him tonight as well. Now all of this also comes as Jeff just laid out that great polling that CNN had released today about how close this race really is. What we're going to see Donald Trump do tonight and again next week on that debate stage in Pennsylvania is try in any way that he can to tie Kamala Harris to Joe Biden's policies. Particularly the ones where they know that Biden had been weaker on and see how they can get any sort of edge over her that she can, because any win on the margins could really alter this very close race, Becky.",

Time here is half past 5 in the evening. It's 09:30 on Wall Street. You're watching \"Connect the World\". And right now, traders beginning their day after what was quite the tumult yesterday. This is how the market is doing at the open. The DOW, of course, fell more than 600 points on Tuesday after concerns about manufacturing data and the impact of past Fed rate hikes on the economy. That was the macro picture that spooked the markets, but shares were also dragged down by chipmaker Nvidia, after it suffered the biggest one day drop in market value in U.S. history. Let me just give you the number. It is extraordinary, $279 billion. You heard me correctly. $279 billion were wiped off on Tuesday, amid fears of an AI slowdown and an investigation into whether the company broke competition laws. Now this is a company that sits at the very heart of the AI era. It makes those chips that powers the technology. The plunge in its share price so dramatic. It also wiped off a whopping 10 billion from the personal net worth of Nvidia's CEO and co-Founder Jensen Huang. Well, Tuesday's drop comes after what has been, I have to say, a meteoric rise for the tech giant. That graph really shows us where we are at. Just take a look at that since the start of the year. Other AI related stocks have also suffered from volatility, with concerns it might take longer than expected to see the practical impact of the AI revolution. It's now down 24 percent from its high still worth trillions of dollars, of course. Well, in Europe, thousands of Volkswagen workers gathered at the company's main factory for the start of what are crucial meetings over the brand's future. VW is warning it could close plants in Germany for the first time in its history, as part of a drive to cut costs. One huge issue has been a steep decline in deliveries to China, its single largest market, Volkswagen or the people's wagon. That's where the name comes from. It was taken over by one of China's biggest selling car brands, as the country sees a huge boom in homegrown electric vehicles. Well, Hanna Ziady following this story for us from London. And this Volkswagen story, I mean, this is historic, as I say. This is a, you know, an organization that, back in the day, the very term Volkswagen, is all about the people's wagon.

It would be the first time, if it happens that happened in 87 years, that's how old Volkswagen will be this year. Chief Financial Officer, Arno Antlitz telling employees that Europe's car market is now permanently smaller. Since the pandemic, about 2 million fewer units a year being sold, or about 14 million in total. He does not expect that to recover, and Volkswagen is selling around half a million fewer cars a year in Europe, equivalent to about two car plants. So, certainly a very serious situation. And let's saying that the company has a year, maybe two, to turn things around. Major upheaval Becky, for the world's second largest car maker.",

They say that she used her position in state government in order to give special access to Chinese government officials and also to block Taiwanese officials here in New York City from having access to that office. One of the things that Sun is accused of doing, Becky, is of writing letters of invitation in behalf -- on behalf of the governor, and inviting Chinese officials into the United States. The officials used these letters in order to travel into the country. She also issued proclamations to them with the governor's signature and the seal of the state. And while these things may not hold much significance. They certainly were important to the Chinese government officials that were receiving them. Becky, in exchange for all of these actions, federal prosecutors say that Linda Sun received millions of dollars in kickbacks. She laundered that money by purchasing several properties here in the United States. She received tickets to special events. Her husband was able to kick back business to his personal businesses. And their family members were able to benefit and take jobs in the Communist Party. Now, all of this appears to be part of a trend that we have been seeing here in the United States. Certainly, in the last year, we've seen several cases of people being accused and convicted of working on behalf of the Chinese government. Now we did hear from China just a few hours ago, they, of course, denied having knowledge of any of this. In the meantime, both Governor Hochul and Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who she also worked for, have both tried to distance themselves from this aid, saying that as soon as they learned that there was any inappropriate behavior, they flagged it to the correct people, and that eventually she was let go from her post. But one thing that we are learning from this indictment, Becky, she held numerous positions, not just in the executive chamber, but also across several state agencies, for more than a decade. So, there are some real questions about just how much access she had, how she was able to get it, and why she went undetected for as long as she did, Becky?",

No U.S. man has won it since 2003 that was Andy Roddick. It was heralded as the start of a new era, but it really didn't then pick up any momentum. And as a guest on our last show said, well, of course, Roger Federer is to blame for that. But we are now in this new era, and there is such excitement with the likes of Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe. Tiafoe, this is his second semifinal here in New York. But both of these players hoping that they will be in the final for the first time. And if the atmosphere has been good up to this point, it is certainly cranking up a new couple of notches.
