The US and allies scrambling to protect ships from attacks in a key shipping lane. Tonight, the Hapag-Lloyd chief executive joins me. The volcano erupts, now the gas pollution threatens to reach Iceland's capital, Reykjavik. And look at them, I have them here for you, the humble berry. What's your favorite? Berries may be a small, but they're holding big lessons as we navigate the global economy. We have the new CEO of Driscoll on this program. Live from New York on Tuesday, it's December the 19th. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. All of that is to come after I have updated you. The Israeli president says his country is ready for another truce with Hamas that would ensure the release of more hostages. President Isaac Herzog made the comments as the UN Security Council debated a new ceasefire resolution. A vote on that resolution could come within the next two hours. At the same time, new surveys show that over two-thirds of Israelis want elections to be held immediately after the war concludes. Most of the respondents said they will likely vote for either the same party or same political block. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. I think, in some sense, we can't really know about the truce yet. But this political business is interesting because if the results were the same, we'd be in the same political mess as they were after the last election.",

And so, Israel is certainly no stranger to those kinds of chaotic politics. But I think there are a lot of warning signs that are flashing for the Israeli prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu. We have watched, since October 7th, his approval ratings have been below water significantly so, and his chief political rival, Benny Gantz, his approval rating has been rising. And so, there has been a significant sense in that latest polling that the Israeli public would like to see Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu out of power following the conclusion of this war. There is also a school of thinking here that the Israeli prime minister, you know, is trying to stay in power for as long as possible. He has already begun effectively campaigning, in a way, trying to secure his right flank, talking about the fact that he will not allow a Palestinian state to exist, taking credit for the lack of a Palestinian state so far in his recent news conferences. At the same time though, of course, he's coming under enormous pressure from these families of the hostages who want him to do everything that he can to secure their release, and a lot of frustration among those families, and also the broader Israeli public, that perhaps this current government is not doing enough and is more focused than anything else on the war against Hamas rather than securing those hostages released.",

So they do have countries that are willing to put resources into this. Many of which will include ships, will include destroyers, some of which are already there, as well as perhaps aircraft and other resources. But ultimately, it's unclear how this is going to differ from a task force that has already existed in the Red Sea over the last year or so.

Others are diverting shipping away from the Red Sea entirely. Hapag-Lloyd is one of the world's largest shipping firms and is now rerouting vessels around the Cape of Good Hope. But if you look at the map of where that goes, instead of going up through the Red Sea, you are now going a much, much, much longer way around. The CEO is Rolf Habben Jansen, who joins me now. Sir, thank you. First of all, I mean, I'm just looking at where your ships are and how you're negotiating that. To go via the Cape of Good Hope is a considerably longer, more costly way. ROLF HABBEN JANSEN, CEO, HAPAG-LLOYD: Yes, that is correct. It depends, of course, a little bit where they have to go because if they come directly from Asia and have to go to the US on the East Coast, for example, it's about a week to 10 days extra. The same goes for north continent Europe, but, of course, especially if ships have to go to the Met or to Turkey, for example, we talk about a huge detour.",

Itwas 200 or 300 cubic meters per minute of lava, which apparently was flowing laterally from that giant fissure in the ground which has been forming after it burst open in the late hours of last night. We have been here in Iceland before, watching all of this unfold. Of course, the authorities here believe that this volcano could have erupted about a month ago. There's already massive cracks in the town that you mentioned, the town of Grindavik, which luckily so far has not been affected by the eruption yet. Nevertheless, this is a huge event. As you can see, we have the volcanic eruption. We're still quite far away from it. The authorities are keeping people pretty far away. However, a massive eruption can be seen in wide parts of Iceland. Here is what we are seeing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): The arctic night illuminated, as the Earth breaks apart from the fissure bursts its molten core. Weeks of earthquakes led to this display of our planet's fire and force.",

Officials took no chances, though, evacuating the population after weeks of tremors. Thousands of shakes were felt in November and all knew what they could bring. Thankfully, none were in Grindavik town when the volcano, around two miles away, finally did erupt.
