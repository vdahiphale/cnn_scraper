      "sentences": "In a Florida federal court today, Donald Trump's lawyers picked apart the warrant used to search his Mar-a-Lago estate back in 2022 for hundreds of classified documents that prosecutors say were illegal for him to have there. Defense lawyers said the warrant was not specific enough and may have violated the former president's rights. They also said that some of the information in the warrant application misled the judge who approved it.Now, this attack on the paperwork is just one of the myriad ways the Trump team is trying to get the case tossed. Let's discuss with national security attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, great to be with you. We just got some new reporting from our team on the ground, and it sounds like Federal Judge Aileen Cannon said Tuesday that she had a hard time seeing any problems with the warrant the FBI obtained to search Mar-a-Lago back in the summer of 2022. In your eyes, does the Trump team have a strong argument to stand on against the original search warrant?",

      "sentences": "No, not really. The warrant, as even according to the reporting even Judge Cannon noted, was largely particularized. It did what it was required to do for that stage of an investigation.This is before there was even an indictment, obviously. All they had to do was outline for the magistrate probable cause to believe that evidence, documentation, information relevant to the crime was going to be at those locations, outline where the agents could search, what they were to be collecting. It's pretty clear this motion will go nowhere. I don't think Donald Trump's team really expected it to. They got more than they ever bargained for. They got weeks, if not months, of delay and a full hearing on it. That's all they could really hope for. They got the delay they wanted. But on substance, no, I don't think anybody expects this motion to be granted. What we all do want to know about is the morning's hearing that was done sealed behind closed doors, dealing with the attorney client privileged information that was disclosed to the grand jury.",

At one point, Trump's attorneys claimed that the prosecutors should have to provide information about any divisions or disagreements in the FBI about the case and whether any agents involved in the case disliked Donald Trump.The prosecution immediately jumped up and called it an attempt to hijack the hearing. A dramatic moment, no question. But why would that information be relevant in this case? Is there grounds for the defense to seek that kind of detail?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so that is relevant to a separate motion and that's kind of what the prosecution was noting when they objected. There's a separate set of motions dealing with selective prosecution and a motion to compel additional discovery. It's this fishing expedition the Trump team is doing, trying to gather details on whether or not there was some political motive behind the decision to go forward with a search warrant and the raid on Mar-a-Lago, whether or not there was dissent within the FBI ranks.I mean, look, the FBI is a bureaucracy. There's going to be different agents and different lawyers within the FBI and the DOJ who are going to be considering this momentous decision to conduct a search of a former president's residence. Of course, I'm sure there were heated discussions, but ultimately it's going to be irrelevant to the issue of whether or not the warrant was proper, whether or not the investigation was proper. It's just a fishing expedition to throw political smear onto the whole thing.",

Judge Merchan in that case has lifted parts of the gag order, but he's keeping restrictions on comments related to prosecutors, court staff, and their families so Trump can basically talk about witnesses in the case, people like Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels. Trump's team has described it as a, quote, another unlawful decision.At this point, after the conviction and before sentencing, do you think parts of the gag order still need to be in place?",

Look, there's still very much the ability of Donald Trump to try to interfere with the ongoing integrity of the proceeding, especially because he still has to actually be sentenced. Prosecutors and their families still are at risk, as well as the court staff and their families.That's why this -- that part of the gag order remains in place, at least until July 11th, but when it came to the witnesses, they've already testified. There's no more threat that his comments could jeopardize the ability of them to -- jeopardize their safety, put them at risk of not testifying. Their testimony is on the record, so he's going to be free, say whatever he wants about Michael Cohen at Thursday's debate. It's not going to change anything.",
