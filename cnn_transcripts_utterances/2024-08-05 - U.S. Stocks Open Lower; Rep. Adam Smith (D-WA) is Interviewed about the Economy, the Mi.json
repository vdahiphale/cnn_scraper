I imagine probably not good.But this is a continuation from Friday, right? It's the new week. Same old concerns that plagued the session on Friday. So, on the one hand, you have that jobs report that came out obviously weaker than expected. And you have some who say, it's one jobs report. It's one data point. That does not necessarily make a trend. On the other, and this is where the market appears to be, there is a growing feeling that the weakening that we have already seen in the labor market is intensifying, but also maybe the Fed dropped the ball. Maybe they waited too long. We can actually pull up for you where the Fed Funds Rate has been. And you can see it's been in that 5 percent range for quite some time. Sort of - sort of adding to these concerns that maybe the Fed did too much. This is the unemployment rate, which we saw, obviously, jump in last Friday's report as well. But it's sort of adding to these concerns that perhaps the Fed has done too much. Perhaps the interest rates are too restrictive and you're seeing that sort of in consumer spending, that being the concern. So, the question now is, what does the Fed do? What do we do with this? I talked to Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's, a short time ago, I asked him the same question. And this is what he told me. He said, \"the fed needs to start moving. If they don't, we are going to have a problem. The economy is sputtering and it's going to stall out. Recession feels much more likely.\" So, the clear message is, the Fed's got to move.",

Iran doesn't want a war. Hezbollah doesn't want a war. We have to make -- take advantage of that. But make sure we have a deterrent capability in the region and then keep pushing for a peace deal. I mean the pathway out of this is fairly clear for Israel, get to a ceasefire in Gaza with the return of the hostages, get to a future for the Palestinian people so you can build the security agreement between the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan that has been in - was envisioned, frankly, before October 7th.

Well, that's an extraordinarily risky thing to do with groups like this that are so fanatical in many instances.And secondarily, I'm nervous about the fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to begin to outline a future for the Palestinian people and stop undermining that future, particularly in the West Bank, as we go forward so that we can get to that peaceful outcome.

You know, he and his wife Gabby have been working on gun safety for a while. By the way, Gabby is an incredibly compelling figure as well who would be part of this. And I think Mark brings the right sensibility to the ticket in terms of, you know, we tend not - we tend to like reluctant politicians in America. And Mark has been a reluctant politician. He got into politics for the same reason millions of other people did, because of Donald Trump in 2016.

It's probably about right when I started active duty, I wanted to start to go to different schools and see - see how far a nurse can make it in each school. So, I went to, you know, airborne school, aerosol jungle school, and I was like, maybe jungle school will be where I - where I end in my - my trail. And then after jungle school I had some people tell me I should go to Ranger school. And my best friend Page (ph), her dad was like, don't worry about your hair, you're fine, it will grow back. And I was like, I don't - I don't know. I don't know if I want to lose my - you know, I had long, blonde hair. And I finally decided, you know, hair grows back.
