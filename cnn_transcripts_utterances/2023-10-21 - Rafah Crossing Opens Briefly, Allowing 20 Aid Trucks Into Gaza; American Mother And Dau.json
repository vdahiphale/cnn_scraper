I'll talk with you in moment.We begin with our special coverage of the rapidly changing events in Israel and Gaza. After days of waiting, the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt was opened briefly this morning allowing 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza. The United Nations says it in included drinking water for more than 22,000 people. But that's just for a single day. International groups are warning 20 trucks isn't nearly enough aid. Water, fuel, and food are all running desperately low in Gaza and the United Nations is warning that Gaza's hospitals are on the brink of collapse. One American trapped in Gaza described his situation to CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABOOD OKAL, U.S. CITIZEN; HE AND FAMILY STUCK IN GAZA: We thought that strategic (ph) that we could stay close to the border because we have faith that the State Department would work on extracting us or getting us out of Gaza do some (INAUDIBLE). We have been here for a week. We're staying in a normal single-family home, two floors with about 40 people. Sharing everything we can share from food to drinking water, supplies. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Protesters chanting their solidarity with the Palestinian people, with the people of Gaza. But also calling for an end to the airstrikes on the Gaza Strip and calling for an end to the siege on Gaza. Now tonight we aren't expecting any huge demonstrations outside the Israeli embassy, but what we saw yesterday is not only the usual demonstration, but thousands of people taking to the streets of downtown Amman, marching through the streets in a show of opposition following Friday prayers. This is really a cause which has united people across the country. And we have seen that reflected across the region Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt where, you know, protests typically aren't sanctioned by the state. We have some people being allowed to protest in Tahrir Square. So this is a significant cause for many here. And I have to say there is outrage, there's anger being directed towards the Israeli government as well as the Israeli government's allies including the United States. People here are seeing the mounting death toll in Gaza, they are seeing the destruction of civilian areas in Gaza. They are hearing from rights groups that Gaza is now on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. This catastrophe is unfolding according to some. We are seeing food, electricity, fuel, water, not being able to get in. And of course, this has been a moment of hope today where we have seen some aid trucks getting in but this is going to be a long and difficult road.

And you know, of course, that King Abdullah is today in attendance of the Cairo peace summit taking place, hosted by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.And he had some pretty strong words today. Let me just read you a bit of what he had to say. He said \"I'm outraged and grieved by those acts of violence waged against innocent civilians in Gaza, in the West Bank, and in Israel. The relentless bombing campaign underway in Gaza as we speak is cruel and (INAUDIBLE) on every level. It is collective punishment of the besieged, helpless people. It's a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime.\" And this is the message we've been hearing from the outset of this war from the Jordanian leadership, from the Egyptian leadership, from many leaders across the Arab World.

It is felt in Amman, it is felt across the Middle East. It's felt in the protests in London, in New York. That is certainly a key element here. And of course, as you said, Jordan has full diplomatic relations with Israel. It is a key ally also of the United States.

And it was under the (INAUDIBLE) Offender Act which means there's no conviction.But even more importantly, Mr. Chesebro has been called the architect of the fake elector scheme. I would like your viewers to please ask themselves this question. If Mr. Chesebro was the architect of the fake elector scheme, some sort of scheme to bring down democracy, which is what I heard over and over for the last few months, would the district attorney of Fulton County offered him first-offender probation? I really don't think so, Fredricka. So I think this plea deal was offered because the evidence was not there that he was the architect of some sort of fake elector scheme. Mr. Chesebro is willing to live with it and now he will fulfill the obligations that he committed to when he signed his plea deal.

I think the U.S. side recognizes this. I think there's probably some more pressure privately behind the scenes on the Netanyahu government by Biden, but almost no pressure publicly.But if that were to happen, and the Iranians and Hezbollah would get involved, we have to recognize that the likelihood of it dragging the United States into it is significant. And it would lead to a situation in which it would not only have a conflict in Ukraine, a potential conflict in Taiwan with China, but then also yet another war in the Middle East.
