Many turned themselves into border authorities.El Paso, Texas is boosting its law enforcement presence. It's just one of several cities and counties preparing for even more strain on the immigration system. Now, on the past few days, authorities have detained a record number of migrants at the southern border while things appear quiet at crossings right now. One official tells CNN it will get worse.

It's also known as the train of death and often controlled by cartels. Roberto wears the face mask to not infect the others. Tells me he got sick early on in his travels. It's because lot of them have been sick and over the journey, he had to leave his two kids, young ones. He tells me his two toddlers nearly died so we sent them back to family in Honduras as he continues on. They stand, sit and sleep on metal construction beams covered in plastic. Dirty clothes and cardboard used to make it as comfortable as possible. The heat and sun, brutal. [02:05:00] At night, it's the cold and wind. The smells, a range. Sewage at times and burning trash as we drove past what appears to be an incinerator. Their souls worn down. He says it's very dangerous for women, too. And they said food is just really scarce right now. Omar spent four days on board already. Food? He's run out. He showed us the little water he has left and the documents he clings to, keeping secured in plastic. He's reading through all the different situations that would allow you to enter the U.S. He's got it printed out in Spanish. And he's got the address of his friend in Baltimore that he hopes to get to. Four days on the train for him, he said. The first day he was really sick because the sun was just so strong and now he's making sure to keep covered as much as possible. He wants to go to New York. For Omar, it's a familiar journey. He left Venezuela six months ago, already expelled once from the U.S. for trying to cross. He'll try again. Legally or illegally, he will cross, he tells me. I ask him if he's hopeful. I've got a lot of faith, he tells me. Ultimately, he hopes to get money to send back to his two kids in Venezuela. As we pull into Ciudad Juarez, about 25 miles still from the border wall with El Paso, we and the others climb out. And that's it, you can see almost everyone now getting off. It's basically the last stop. Omar, among the last off, carrying his only belongings and, somehow, a smile, planning to cross immediately. And most of those migrants we met had the same destination, this place right behind me, the border wall. That's technically U. S territory from Mexico looking on towards Texas and you can see it's been barricaded off by Texas National Guard and Texas State Troopers.

USAID reports 59 percent of the country's population lives below the poverty line. Seventy-seven percent who intend to migrate do so in search of economic opportunities. Seventy-five percent of Guatemalans cite insecurity as the most serious problem in the country. And many are victims of extortion and corruption. Guatemala also has the youngest population in Latin America and they mostly have insufficient training and job opportunities.Now, I want to bring in Quique Godoy, who's an economist and Radio Host, joining me now from Guatemala City. Thanks so much for being here with us. So, for Guatemalans who wanted to come to the U.S., were they anticipating this end of Title 42 as a great opportunity to get through? QUIQUE GODOY, HOST, GUATEMALA'S RADIO INFINITA: Yes, Kim. I think right before the pandemic, we had about 250,000 people trying to get to the U.S. every year. During the pandemic, that number went up to 500,000 people. And it's been getting even worse because of the corruption, some of the things you mentioned before, because of no job opportunities in some of the communities. And especially because there's a big, tight labor market in the U.S. which is pulling people into the U.S. Like you said before in the introductory note, we have a very young population, which is exactly the opposite of what is happening in the U.S. You're getting an aging population. You got 1.4 million people that retired last year from the workforce. So, that's pulling people into the U.S. And because we're not creating opportunities here, it's pushing people from here into the U.S.",

But if you get caught twice, you might go to jail or you have some other penalties. So, that message is getting across, but at the same time, the needs are so big and they're rarely surviving in certain parts of the country that they take the risk. And even if they can't get through, they'll still remain in Mexico probably with better conditions than they have here.",

One is -- from one side, we have to fight corruption all the way through because corruption creates the conditions for these communities -- complete communities, to try to migrate because corruption makes it very hard to get education, makes it very hard to get health, makes it very hard to get water and electricity in those communities. So, they're barely surviving while they're there. So, if we don't fix the corruption side of the problem, so we can get -- the U.S. says, well, we can send more money, we can make some investments for job creation.But the problem is not only job creation, it's getting them basic conditions for people to be able to survive with those services that we were talking about before. So, the double problem we have there is that we have to fight corruption, but at the same time, we're in the middle of an election right now. And within that middle of the election, we're getting a lot of corruption through the election. We're getting people that are getting thrown out of the election process all through this year. So, it's not getting better, it's getting worse. And at the same time, you have the conditions in the border, in the U.S. Mexican border is one thing, but the Guatemalan Mexican border is wide open so people are coming in from Venezuela, from Cuba, from Haiti, from Central America, and we're starting to accumulate people in our borders that are trying to get into Mexico.

There haven't been any rockets fired from militants in the Gaza Strip towards Israel for some 11 hours, and there haven't been any airstrikes from Israel against militants in the Gaza Strip since 2 o'clock local time, so for about seven hours now.And this is, I suppose, fueling more speculation that we could be inching towards some kind of ceasefire brokered by Egypt. In terms of the actual fighting so far, you mentioned, as you say, more than 800 rockets, almost 900 rockets fired by Islamic Jihad militants towards Israel since this latest round of hostilities began. Israel saying that almost a quarter of those misfired or fell short, and saying that it hit 170 targets, including overnight military posts and concealed rocket launchers. In terms of the death toll so far in Gaza, as you mentioned, 30 deaths, according to the Palestinian health authorities in the Gaza Strip. Israel is saying that at least half of those were militants, which means that about half of those were uninvolved civilians, as well. In terms of that death in the Israeli city of Rehovot, when a rocket fired by militants from the Gaza Strip scored a direct hit against an apartment block in that city of Rehovot, Israel saying that that was down to a malfunction by the Iron Dome rocket defense system. Israel saying that, so far, in this round of fighting, it's had a success rate of 91 percent. In other words, taking out 91 percent of the rockets that it wanted to take out. But I suppose, while the militants of Islamic Jihad will see this death of the first Israeli so far in this round of fighting as a victory, it also goes to show that Iron Dome, for all its successes, is not infallible. Now, one other development that's not related to this specific fighting going on in Gaza right now, but to fighting that was taking place in the West Bank a year ago, in an interview with CNN yesterday, the Israeli Defense Forces Chief Spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari apologized for the killing of the Al Jazeera Correspondent Shireen Abu Aqla, which had taken place a year ago to the day.

River flooding happens when the river slowly rises. Flash flooding happens when you get such very, very quick rainfall and high rainfall amounts at one time, one, two, three, four hours and you get 200 millimeters of rain. The water just doesn't soak in, it runs off. And that's what we're seeing here. In this red zone, that's all 200 millimeters of rainfall just over the next 48 hours. So, there's a high risk really.

The two sides held high-level talks this week in Vienna for the first time since the diplomatic crisis erupted in February. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is live in Hong Kong. So, Kristie, both sides say the talks were \"candid and constructive.\" But did anything actually come out of it?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And you know, this was a surprise. You know these were talks that were previously undisclosed as a meeting that one U.S. official told CNN came together fairly quickly. And it showcases how China and the U.S. are trying to just move beyond the balloon incident and trying to stabilize this pivotal relationship.You have China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, meeting with the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. They met for two days of talks in Vienna. Talks that spend some eight hours. And again, this surprise meeting is the highest level of engagement between both sides since the balloon incident back in February, which of course, led to America's top diplomat Antony Blinken to delay a planned visit to Beijing. Now, we have a statement from China's embassy in Washington. They said that the two sides \"had candid in-depth, substantive, and constructive discussions on removing obstacles in China-U.S. relations and stabilizing the relationship from deterioration.\" And the White House readout used similar language, and we had this for you as well, saying this. \"The two sides, they had candid, substantive, and constructive discussions on key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, global and regional security issues, Russia's war against Ukraine, and cross-strait issues among other topics.\" Now, Sullivan also raised concerns about U.S. citizens detained in China and he added that this was a personal priority for the U.S. President, Joe Biden. And he also raised concerns about the potential for Chinese military aid to Russia. This comes as this ongoing diplomatic rift has been deepening between both of these nations over a slew of issues including Taiwan, Ukraine, access to technology, the balloon incident, the list goes on. And although these talks that just took place in Vienna were deemed candid and constructive by both sides, still, we don't know when Blinken will visit China. In fact, the spokesperson at the State Department reiterated that that trip would be rescheduled \"when conditions allow,\" Kim.",
