And let's talk about these victims for a moment. We now have a photo of 9-year-old Evelyn Dieckhaus, who died in this mass shooting at her school. Reportedly, she has an older sister, and she was quoted in \"The Tennessean\" at a prayer vigil last night saying that: \"I don't want to be an only child.\" Again, this is a sister of this young girl who was killed yesterday, Evelyn Dieckhaus, in this school shooting. Nine-year-old Hallie Scruggs also killed. She was the daughter of the lead pastor here at Covenant Presbyterian School. There she is. It's more of an updated photo than we have been seeing for much of the day. Also killed, 9-year-old William Kinney, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce. She was the head of school. We spoke with a friend of hers who said they were friends for 15 years. And she texted her yesterday morning as soon as she heard that there was a shooting here, and she never heard back. And when she went to the reunification center, and didn't see her friend, the head of the school at that location, which she should have been there, she realized that something was terribly wrong; 61-year- old Cynthia Peak, she was a substitute teacher, and 61-year-old Mike Hill, who was the custodian of the school. Alex, you talk about the grief in this community. And I tell you, we can feel it. When you look behind me here, there's a makeshift memorial that has been growing throughout the day. And all morning and day long, we have seen people, strangers, people from the community coming with teddy bears and flowers. There was also a small group of elderly people who walked over from a senior center just right next door to the school, the Brookdale assisted living center. They came with their walkers. They walked slowly, many of them crying. And they said that they fell in love with these children because they were coming as elementary school students every year during the holidays to sing to them. I want you to listen to what one woman, a 101-year-old elderly woman, said about what she was feeling when she arrived here. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And they had Easter egg hunts. And now they will not hear them. And like some of those at the senior facility that you interviewed earlier, these are their neighbors, those that they love and who love them. The heart of the matter is that we have got to have better gun laws. I heard from some of my sorority sisters who are in these -- where I just left on yesterday right before coming to reunification center. And they said they met with Congressman Ogles, and he's saying that it's mental health issues that created this. No. The gun did not have any idea that someone with a mental health issue was behind the trigger. I think the combination is a disastrous, tragic outcome, as we witnessed on yesterday.

Remember, he has been thinking that he might have to do this quite some time. Let's delineate two things here, Alex. On the one hand, it's his role as the president of the Senate and the vice president. So what he's talking about on the floor as a member of the Senate, so to speak, in that capacity is not part of this inquiry. What is relevant here is what Trump may have said to him prior to January 6. Did he acknowledge that he'd lost the election? Did he seek to try to block certification? What specifically did he say? Was there anything threatening? What were the terms that he wanted him, Pence, to abide by? What steps were actually taken to try to disrupt the peaceful transit -- transfer of power in our American democracy? All of this extremely relevant, and yet another defeat. Remember, you got former attorneys and current attorneys of Trump who have been asked to testify in the grand jury, a federal grand jury. Now you have got somebody who was the second in command who, of course, was threatened on January 6, who was a bit of a hero for so many on that day for standing true now having to testify about things that the president said to him.

And then you got this idea of a probably more clear-cut case about declassified documents. It's a finite universe. You know when they were supposed to be handed over. You know that they were not handed over. He has admitted to not wanting to do so and has provided some justification in his mind that is not really viable as to why he can retain them. That's a little bit more open-and-shut. Either you handed them over or you did not. Either you had your attorney do something nefarious or you did not. The January 6 one, as we all know, is a much more comprehensive and complex case to look at. It involves whether or not he gave a virtual code red. Was there a conspiracy? Was there a seditious action by a former president of the United States at the time he was the president?

They were under the impression that, when she sold the one weapon, that she did not own anymore. As it turned out, she had been hiding several weapons within the house.
