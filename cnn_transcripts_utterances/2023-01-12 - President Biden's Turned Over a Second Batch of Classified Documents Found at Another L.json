President Biden's legal team has turned over a second batch of classified documents found at another location. Republicans are calling for a special counsel investigation, just like the one President Trump is under.Ukraine says it's killed 100 Russian soldiers near the hard-hit town of Soledar in the Donetsk region. CNN can't independently verify the claim, and Kyiv didn't provide any evidence as such of an attack. This as Ukraine's Military pushes back on claims from Russian-backed mercenaries that the town has fallen. California officials are preparing for more extreme weather, saying this moment right now is the calm between the storms. Conditions are relatively quiet at the moment. But, the state is recovering from weeks of back-to-back deadly storms. A number of places recorded 50 percent to 70 percent of the rainfall they would usually get in an entire year. The past 16 days have been seeing widespread flooding. Roads have been damaged, and thousands of people have been forced from their homes, and more rain is expected in the coming hours, first impacting the Pacific Northwest before shifting East in the days ahead. This five-year-old boy is missing in the wake of the week's storms. Kyle Doan was with his mother on Monday when floodwaters overtook their car. She describes what happened next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDSY DOAN, MOTHER OF 5-YEAR-OLD MISSING AFTER FLOODS: My car shifted and started to float to the left side and then hit two trees. I was - I don't normally curse, but I actually said a bad road. And, my - and Kyle said, Mommy, it'll be OK. Just keep calm. He unbuckled his seat belt and took his backpack and climbed into the front. And, I told him, when I saw him taking the backpack, I said, no, leave the backpack in the car. I don't care about the backpack. I just want you. And so, he did. He followed my instructions. He let go the backpack. But, the current was so strong that he wrapped me and I was holding his hand and then the current pushed him away from me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They were all sold out because of the huge demand. Drug companies like this major pharmaceutical manufacturer in Beijing, they're going into overdrive to increase supply after there was a shortage of medicine to treat COVID-19 symptoms. I asked the Vice President if they had received any advance warning from the government that they were going to abandon zero-COVID so they could prepare to ramp up production. Well, he didn't directly answer my question. But, it's clear that now they are doubling down. The company told us they simply follow government policy, the drug shortage, overflowing hospitals and crematorium, their images of a country unprepared for the sudden end of zero-COVID.
