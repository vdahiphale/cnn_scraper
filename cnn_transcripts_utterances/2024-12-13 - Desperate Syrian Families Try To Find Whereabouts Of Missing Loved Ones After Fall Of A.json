Even in death, they are still only identified by numbers. Everyone here heard about the horrors that took place in Assad's notorious prisons, but to see it up close is something entirely different. (on camera): A lot of them have bruises, have horrible wounds that seem to be consistent with torture. I just saw one woman retching as she came out of the other room. Families are now going through trying to see if their loved ones are here. (voice-over): There's not enough room for all of them in the morgue, so a makeshift area has been set up outside. (CRYING)",

      "sentences": "For the first time, the public is hearing from the top executive of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, after it's CEO, Brian Thompson, was assassinated on a Manhattan street.In a \"New York Times\" guest essay, Andrew Witty said, \"Thompson, whose murder has been celebrated by many, was,\" quote, \"a brilliant, kind man who was working to make health care better for everyone.\" Witty also addressed the widespread outrage that has been expressed against health insurers, writing that, \"Claim denials are not well understood,\" and, quote, \"We need to improve how we explain how decisions are made.\" The suspect accused of gunning down Thompson, Luigi Mangione, will be back in court in 10 days. CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller, is here now. John, give us the latest on the investigation. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, we're learning some new things today. It starts with the finding by the New York City Police Department in consultation with UnitedHealthcare that the suspect was never a client of theirs, not a customer. Part of that goes to what was behind his particular animus to this organization and its leader. And apparently, based on that, it wasn't anything that happened between him and the company. Rather, it may just be that UnitedHealthcare, for a guy who was very vociferous online about his feelings about the health care industry, was simply the biggest. In the note that was allegedly found on his person by police in Pennsylvania, it says, quote, \"United is the fifth-largest company in the United States by market cap, behind only Apple, Google and Walmart. It has grown and grown.\" That may have more to do with it with his targeting than anything between him and the company. The other thing that emerged last night was reporting by CNN about three search warrants that had been obtained. It looks like those search warrants are most likely for the laptop he was actually working on while he was arrested at that table at the back of a McDonalds in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Investigators want to get into that. Now, in the note, he says that he is -- \"My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering, so probably not much in there.\" That may be true, but they still want to get into that computer and find out, was he talking with anyone else? Was he working with anybody else? He also says in the note that he wants to avoid a lengthy investigation, and he wants to state plainly, \"I wasn't working with anyone.\" That may be true, but they want to get into those devices and determine what was in them. The burner phone that he was walking with on the street, on the video, you can see him actually talking with someone on the phone right before the murder. They want to get into that phone and find out, who was that person? So a lot of loose ends to tie up while they wait for the extradition proceedings to go on between New York and Pennsylvania.",
