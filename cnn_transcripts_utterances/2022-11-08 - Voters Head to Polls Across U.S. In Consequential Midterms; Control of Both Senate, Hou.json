And, Democrats, if they were able to flip this, this would be a massive upset for them.I talk to Tim Ryan, a little bit, yesterday. He thinks he's going to, quote, shocked the world. Very optimistic outlook there. But, look, this has been a closer than expected race, especially considering it is a red state that Trump won in 2022. Republicans have had to spend money, and resources here. And, Tim Ryan has been able to raise a ton of money, even without the help of the national Democratic Party. And a big part of that reason is that he has done a really good messenger on the economy for Democrats. He's really leaned into the economic -- now voters are feeling. He's talking about bringing manufacturing jobs back. And he's also been a fighter. He has gone up against JD Vance. He's tried to tie to Donald Trump, paint him as a sycophant of Donald Trump. Meanwhile, J.D. Vance, he is someone that has tried to make Tim Ryan into the want to be Republican and said he's not actually a moderate. He's trying to run as a Republican, even though he is a Democrat. But, for J.D. Vance, that strategy here has been talking about inflation, the border, and of course making Donald Trump a key part of his strategy as well.
