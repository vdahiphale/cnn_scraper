Israel believes Sinwar was the mastermind of the October 7th attacks.Joining me now is CNN's Nic Robertson and CNN's Oren Liebermann, as well as Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling who is back with us. Nic, as we are waiting and hoping that we get more information, can you just explain the significance of what this would mean to Israelis, what this would mean in the broader region, particularly as this region is in so much tumult right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think what it means for Israelis and what it means for the region, it depends in part when the dust settles and we can see what comes next. And I think that's an important point to make. I mean, it is important because Sinwar is and has been the face for Israelis to think about when they think about who organized the October 7th attacks.Obviously, there have been a lot of other Hamas commanders and leaders taken out, specifically Mohammed Deif, who was the military commander of Hamas and plotted and planned as well along with Sinwar. And he was taken out in an Israeli airstrike on the 13th of July this year. He was replaced by Mohammad Sinwar, the brother of Yahya Sinwar. So I have to ask myself at the moment, is -- has his brother survived? These two have been joined at the hip. They went through -- up through the ranks of Hamas together. His brother Mohammad was a hugely important figure in Yahya Sinwar's life. He was the one that helped get him negotiated and freed from Israeli captivity for the release of Gilad Shalit. It was his brother Mohammad Sinwar who had hold of Gilad Shalit. They're incredibly close. And speaking to very senior Israeli officials about a month ago, they told me that they believed that Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammad were still traveling around together. In fact, they had evidence that they might have been in Tel al-Sultan around the end of August, just outside of Rafah, on the edges of Rafah, barely a month ago. If his brother was killed along with him, then I think the picture becomes perhaps a bit different. There's a prospect perhaps of that injection of diplomacy that can be a break point, that can be a point for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare this as something of a victory and Hamas defeated. But I don't think we're there yet. And Hamas has shown in the past that it will just replace up with somebody else. Sinwar, hugely important for October 7th, but him gone doesn't mean the death of Hamas.",

But, again, our reporting, according to a person familiar is that Israeli officials have now informed American officials that there has been an initial DNA match showing that this person is, in fact, Yahya Sinwar. I know you have been talking about this a ton throughout the course of your show, but this initial confirmation is going to be momentous for everything in the region, including, of course, the ongoing Israel- Hamas war. The continuation of this war has been a source of such frustration for U.S. officials, something that President Biden and now, of course, Vice President Kamala Harris has spent so much energy, so much political capital working on. This is the person that in all of our reporting over the course of months, the U.S. officials have most often pointed to as perhaps the man if he were to be killed in Gaza could potentially shepherd in a new era in this conflict. And, you know, we'll see how the next coming hours and days unfold and all of the ramifications that could come, including, of course, the big question of who might potentially succeed him. But again, our reporting right now is that, according to a person familiar, Israeli officials have told the Americans that initial DNA match has confirmed that the man killed is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

We are crushing Hezbollah in a way that perhaps exceeds what we'd hoped.We are showing -- continuing to show success against Hamas, they don't have a credible military operation. We've taken out one commander, you know, in the case of Sinwar here. It presents -- it does absolutely present an opportunity for diplomacy to come in here and the -- for Prime Minister Netanyahu to sort of take the high road, if you will, to say we've got our victories. We've done well. Let's just lock this in with some arrangements, with some -- with a ceasefire and a release of the hostages and something else credible with Hezbollah where they don't come back to the border and continue shooting and firing rockets into Israel. I think there are a lot in his cabinet who might still be uncomfortable about trying to bring all of these things together and saying that this is the moment to pause. Let's not forget, Israel is in the moment of waiting to decide when they will strike back at Iran for Iran strike two and a half weeks ago. There's a real hope that they won't escalate, that it'll be proportional, that they'll stick to military and intelligence targets and not go after nuclear sites and oil refineries. But all of this is in the balance because what's in the balance for Israel is, is this the moment to absolutely continue, if you think you're crushing your enemies, to crush them further so that they don't come back? In the past, people have talked about mowing the lawn, going into Gaza, taking out a number of Hamas operatives there, doing the same in rounds of conflict with Hezbollah. I think the perception in the cabinet is this is a different moment with a different set of opportunities and there might be a lot of pressure on the prime minister to set those pressures aside and take a different path --",

      "sentences": "So, from the perspective of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who built himself a tremendous amount of political capital with the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah just a few weeks ago, that was a major move for him. You have seen it reflected in some of the latest polls in Israel.There's no election coming up, but in Israel effectively there is always an election coming up. So the polls are constant and his numbers have improved there. This is absolutely certain to help. [12:45:08] As I said a few minutes ago, it's really the first thing in a year of war in Gaza for Israel that Netanyahu can claim as a true victory. Israel's forces have killed many of Yahya Sinwar's deputies, have dismantled Hamas' ability to wage war. They have frankly leveled large parts of Gaza and we have seen the death toll there amongst the Palestinian population. And yet from a purely political Netanyahu perspective, none of that was something he could claim as victory. This absolutely is, so we'll certainly wait to see first when Israel officially confirms it, second what he says and then how he plays this amongst his own coalition, because previously his far-right ministers had threatened to take down the government if there was a ceasefire. Now, certainly the U.S. and others will try to push on that diplomatic window, negotiations that were dead just days ago, they see a window of opportunity here and they'll try to take advantage of that window. That's on the diplomatic side. The military side is a very different story. Israel has promised to retaliate for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on October 1st. The U.S. is sending and has just sent an anti-ballistic missile defense system to Israel that's very much there, so the U.S. is very much engaged on the military side of this, ready for first Israel's expected attack and then Iran has vowed to retaliate for that. At the same time, for example, just last night the U.S. struck the Houthis in Yemen, another Iran-backed rebel group. So this at least gives the possibility of trying to bring all of the fighting to an end. But as you point out, there is politics at stake here for Netanyahu, for others, and everyone's trying to figure out first what Sinwar's death would mean and second, how to move forward from this point.",

Oren, thank you so much for that.Joining me now is Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee and co-chair of the Harris-Walz campaign. Senator, first, the reporting that you just heard from MJ Lee that the U.S. government has been told by their Israeli counterparts that it is, in fact, Sinwar. What is the impact of this from your perspective? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D), FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: This is a momentous day. If the leader of the brutal, murderous attack on October 7th by Hamas has, in fact, been killed, justice has been done. Yahya Sinwar is a bloodthirsty terrorist who has blood on his hands from Americans, from Israelis, from people from dozens of countries who were massacred on October 7th. And it's important for us to take a moment and think about what Sinwar's goal was on October 7th. Why so much blood? Why so many innocent civilians killed? Well, first, because Hamas is an organization committed to the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel. And it's important to keep that in mind, that their tactics and their approach puts the lives of innocent Palestinians at risk and took the lives of innocent Israelis and people from dozens of other countries on October 7th. But his core goal was to interrupt the path towards reconciliation, the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Real progress was being made on Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel and Israel agreeing to a path forward that could achieve regional peace. So as your reporter was just commenting, having him gone, having Sinwar dead, on top of recent military accomplishments by Israel, striking Hezbollah, taking out one of its main leaders, pushing back on Iran's other proxies in the region, may create a moment, first, for the ceasefire and hostage deal that's been elusive for months. John Kirby recently said that Sinwar was the major impediment. And second, might open an opportunity for getting back to that negotiated regional peace that will ensure Israel's security.",

He lost his arm in the Hamas attack on a bunker where he and a group of his friends were sheltering, and it was a near miracle that he survived for months and months and months, only to be killed by Hamas terrorists moments away from his rescue by IDF soldiers.The heartbreak of his parents and the heartbreak of so many other hostage families from around the world has weighed on me and has weighed on many in Israel as there have been protest after protest. Let's take a moment, though, and reflect on what this means for the nation of Israel. In May of 2011, I'll never forget the night that I got the news that Osama bin Laden had at long last been killed by American Special Forces. Yahya Sinwar is the equivalent of Osama bin Laden, a terrorist who killed thousands of people, innocents in a long planned plot that struck a deep blow and for which justice had to be done.
