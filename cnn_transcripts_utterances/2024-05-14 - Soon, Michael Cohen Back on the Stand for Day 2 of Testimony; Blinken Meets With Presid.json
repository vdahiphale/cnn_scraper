For the very first time, someone has testified in this case that they witnessed Donald Trump committing the acts he is facing 34 charges for. That person is Michael Cohen, who testified for the first time that Donald Trump knew of the hush money payment scheme to cover up Stormy Daniels' story about a sexual tryst some 15, 20 years ago.Remember, Donald Trump is charged with falsifying documents to cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, all to influence the 2016 election. And yesterday, at the very end of the day, we got testimony about those documents. Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former fixer, testified he was at a meeting with Trump and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, and he testified to this. The question, did Mr. Weisselberg state in front of Mr. Trump that you were going to receive $420,000 over the course of 12 months? Michael Cohen said yes. Question, what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at the time? Answer, he approved it. And he also said this is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C. One more question, did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of you, Mr. Trump, that those monthly payments would be a retainer for legal services? Michael Cohen says yes. He testified that Donald Trump approved of the scheme. That testimony ended yesterday. Today, though, perhaps even more importantly, we are set for the cross-examination. That could begin in the next couple of hours. With me, CNN's Brynn Gingras, who has been in and out of this court for the last four weeks, this is such an important moment.",

S. economy.CNN's Matt Egan has been talking to experts for us this morning. What is the potential impact of Donald Trump's mass deportation that he's promised if he gets into office? MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Sara, it's easy to see how Trump's immigration plan could backfire on the U.S. economy. Now, let's set aside for the moment the real moral and legal issues here. Here's the economic problem. Businesses, they need more workers. They've got unfilled jobs, and there aren't enough workers here in America to fill those jobs. Now, here's why economists are warning that Trump's immigration plan could worsen the worker shortage, right? I mean, businesses would lose some of the workers they have, and they have trouble getting new ones, that could boost wages and inflation and force the Fed to keep interest rates high for even longer. And that's something, of course, that would impact everyone. Listen to Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi explain this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S:  My sense is, you know, President Trump's policies are inflationary, right? It's higher tariffs. It's deportation for immigration. You know, I think these things are going to lead to higher prices for American consumers. If he follows through and starts deporting a significant amount of immigrants, that's going to be very difficult on businesses and it's going to cause them to raise wages and prices for the goods and services that they're producing.

      "sentences": "Now, Sara, there are, of course, some caveats here. First, we obviously don't know if Trump is going to win. If he wins, we don't know if he's actually going to pursue these immigration plans. Plus, these immigration proposals, they would surely face legal challenges.But we do know there has been a spike of immigration in recent years. The CBO estimates that last year alone, there were the U.S. experience net immigration 3.3 million people, that is more than triple the annual average before COVID. And this spike, this has created a real strain for some cities and states have been scrambling to feed, house, educate asylum seekers. But as you alluded to, there actually has been an economic positive, right? Economists say that this spike in immigrants has actually helped to fill open jobs, keeping a lid on wages and inflation. And it's actually boosted the U.S. economy. And so economists say that those have actually been positives. Now, we've reached out to the Trump campaign, and they've essentially doubled down when asked about this criticism. A Trump campaign spokesperson claims without evidence that President Biden, quote, let in millions of undocumented immigrants and vowed that Trump will deport them and, quote, re-implement his America First pro-growth, pro-job agenda to uplift all Americans. Sara, here's the ironic part. Frustration over high inflation, that could very well return Trump to the White House. And yet economists say that Trump's economic proposals, they wouldn't fix inflation. They could actually make inflation worse.",
