      "sentences": "Well, yes. And I would also say, Jim, I mean, look at already we see AI being deployed throughout the industry. The opening credits for Disney Plus's Marvel Series \"Secret Invasion\" -- AI. We've heard the great Stephen Fry talk about how his voice was lifted off audio books he did of Harry Potter and found in other places.We've already seen things like body scanning happening here in Hollywood to some degree. So these are real issues that are a part of this. I think most importantly though is let's always remember, every technology ultimately does find a use that nobody thought it was going to have. I'll just use one example. As a child, we're going to be drug dealers, best friends. When we thought they were for doctors. AI just in the five months that this strike has been going on, just in those five months, the evolution of AI, the people at the heads of the tech companies coming before the Senate with Chuck Schumer and what have you, the President talking about this. The evolution of this technology, I don't think, it can be contained within one contract, even if it's a three-year long one. So I think what they're looking at here is how to put guardrails in place. So yes, there will be inevitably some use of AI. Copyright issues as your entertainment lawyer friend, I'm sure told you also come into this. But it's finding a way to make this work within the pathways of keeping people employed and not having them replaced by computers.",

Its mayor said that in the last two days at least 5,000 asylum seekers has come to his community of about 30,000 people. Video shows folks this morning forming a human chain to wade across the Rio Grande from Mexico into the United States. And today, law enforcement agents were seen giving some of these migrants life jackets. That's because Texas officials say a three-year old boy and a man drowned this week in the river. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Eagle Pass for us. So, Ed, what are you seeing now?",

And eventually many people figuring out a way to lift up that wire and crawl through. That's what we witnessed yesterday. Today completely different. However, Eagle Pass, Mayor Rolando Salinas tells us that coming, we've spoken with many migrants, the few that have come through today, say complicated on the southern side, because the trail, the rail lines and the trains that have been running north and so many people have been getting on top of and riding quickly up into northern Mexico, those have stopped. And the mayor says he believes and has been told by federal authorities that 50 to 60,000 migrants are in southern Mexico. And the question now is, where are all those people going to end up even if they make it this far? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAYOR ROLANDO SALINAS (D) EAGLE PASS, TEXAS: The reports that I'm getting from intel from the federal government and state officials is that there's other groups coming in the next couple of days and that tells us that we have to keep our guard up, that it's a situation that's serious and we have. To be ready for anything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

How many of them are able to make it? We spoke with one family, a man and his three children and more than three months walking through Mexico to get to -- that requires an immense amount of fortitude to be able to do that. So exactly what's going to happen to these large groups as they make their way through Mexico is -- are probably echoing the sentiment of many local officials along the U.S. southern border. They're bracing for what might be in store for them in the days and weeks ahead -- Boris.",

You know, things like watchful waiting are options where you're actually not treating, but that can be problematic or difficult on its own. They also say you could crush up the amoxicillin tablets for little kids who can't swallow them and put them in liquid or Apple sauce. And of course, there are other antibiotics, but doctors typically try not to have to use those because they don't want to promote antibiotic resistance.

Police say she wandered away from home in the rural Upper Peninsula. They say she walked upward of three miles barefoot. Her family called police around 8:00 p.m. Wednesday night, she was found a few hours later after an extensive search. A family friend on a TV interview said the family's Rottweiler, Buddy, started barking at him as he approached. He then found the girl sleeping with her head on the family's English Springer, Heartly, who growled him when he tried to wake her up. He then drove them all back home, with the girl giggling, hi, mommy, when she got home. Medics say thankfully, she will be fine. Also, COVID-19 is landing more children in the hospital. According to federal numbers analyzed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Weekly admissions among children in the latest week are five times more than over the last three months. Pediatricians say they are especially worried about children under five years old because they have the lowest vaccination rates. And something new is coming to Amazon Prime -- Video ads. And if you don't want to watch them, you'll have to pay an extra $3 a month. Amazon says the move will help pay for quality programming and that the ads will start showing during shows and movies next year.
