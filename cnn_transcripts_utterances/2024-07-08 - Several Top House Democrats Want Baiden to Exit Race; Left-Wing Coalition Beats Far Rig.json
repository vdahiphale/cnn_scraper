      "sentences": "-- more permanent end to the war continue while the first phase of this deal is carried out.So step back, bigger picture. Remember, we have a three-part deal that is on the table that was proposed by President Biden. The first part of that deal, the first part, the first phase rather, is what we're discussing here. And that first phase is a six-week ceasefire that would see Israeli hostages, the most vulnerable among them, so the elderly, the sick, females, exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. And that's exactly what will be discussed in Doha this week with the CIA director in attendance alongside, of course, the key mediators and the warring parties. But this is going to be a huge challenge, Rosemary. In the past, negotiations around the release of Palestinian prisoners have taken many years. This time, these negotiators are hoping to have a breakthrough in just a matter of weeks. But there's a lot of pressure that might propel them forward. Inside Gaza, the humanitarian situation is dire. Nearly every single Gazan has been displaced by this conflict. You mentioned those additional evacuation orders that were issued just recently. And then, of course, inside Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu is facing huge pressure from those who want to see those hostages come home. So we may very well see some progress in the coming weeks. But again, this is going to be a huge challenge, very difficult talks in Doha this week.",

Amid growing concerns, President Biden could hurt the Democrats' chances of retaking the House and holding the Senate this November.While recent polls suggest Mr. Biden's support is slipping, he's refusing to step aside.

And that drip, drip, drip is going to weaken him, whether he stays in the race or not.I do think that for those who believe that Biden is now in a position where he can't win, the phrase I heard a lot Thursday and Friday was grace. We need to give him grace to reach this decision on his own. The fact that instead he's kind of dug in very publicly since, I think is going to change that equation, and it's highly likely you're going to see more public pressure on him this week.

Most people seem to be united in the idea that a snap election has actually made him weaker, and the parliamentary system weaker too.A leader in France's left-wing alliance says voters, quote, rejected the worst case scenario in Sunday's elections after the far-right failed to reach that majority. There were celebrations, though, in the street when the results were announced. The outcome was a reversal of the first-round elections a week earlier, when the National Rally topped its rivals, of course. But after the second and final round on Sunday, the far-right came in third. The New Popular Front coalition came in first with 182 seats, making it the largest bloc, but without a majority. French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance came in second. Let's see what the international reaction to this is. Nic Robertson joins me now, our international diplomatic editor, and I'm just imagining, Nic, what it'll be like for President Macron to go into the NATO summit, which I think is tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, it is significant because Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin haven't met face-to-face in nearly two years. That was last on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in September of 2022, and that's when Modi implicitly criticized Russia and Putin's invasion of Ukraine when he said, quote, today's era is not of war.Now, last week was the most recent round of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and Modi did not attend that gathering, and that was largely seen to be a sign of India's displeasure with China, with the lingering tensions on the border between the two countries, which have erupted into violent and sometimes deadly skirmishes in the last several years. Some analysts think that Modi is trying to go to Moscow to continue to use Russia as a kind of counterbalance for the tensions that it has with China, and especially watching how close Putin and Xi Jinping have gotten in the last couple of years. I mean, they're meeting together almost, it feels like, every month, whereas Modi and Putin meet far less frequently, even though India and Russia enjoy a, quote, special and privileged partnership. There are -- there is a longstanding defense relationship between Russia and India. India relies on Russian weapons, and India's imports of Russian energy have surged since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, India buying discounted Russian crude oil, to the concern of Western countries that have been trying to isolate Russia. There are areas, other areas of friction, and they include the fact that some Indian citizens have been popping up in the ranks of the Russian armed forces fighting in Ukraine, and that was mentioned by a senior Russian diplomat. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VINAY KWATRA, INDIAN FOREIGN SECRETARY (through translator): At every level of Russian leadership, both official and political, we have expressed strong concern that Indian citizens who are being taken to the Russian army through improper procedures must be returned promptly.

He also needs Russia with China. And he has tensions with China. And he's trying to carve a kind of a neutral road between some of these big geopolitical tensions.For Vladimir Putin, Rosemary, this is an opportunity to show that he's not as isolated as Western governments would like him to be, particularly during a week when President Biden will be hosting a NATO summit in Washington -- Rosemary.",

More than 84,000 customers are already without power, and that number will likely rise as the storm moves inland.Well, Sicily is running out of water.

And we've talked to farmers who've had to make the difficult decision between whether or not to cull their herds or let them starve to death because there just isn't any food for them. They're trying to get the government to help to try to give them, you know, subsidies to be able to buy hay and other fodder for their livestock.But we've seen places where these animals graze completely dry, the watering holes where they would get their water completely dried up. And so the residents there that deal with agriculture that are in the agricultural industry are really suffering as well. You know, you can hope for rain, but that's not in the forecast. It's going be another hot summer. It's only early July, and they're expecting this to be another hot summer followed by a very dry winter. And that is the problem -- Rosemary.",
