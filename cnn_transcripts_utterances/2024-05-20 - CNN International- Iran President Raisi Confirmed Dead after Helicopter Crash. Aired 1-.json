      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton and we are following breaking news out of Iran or state media has now confirmed the death of President Ibrahim Raisi and the country's foreign minister after a deadly helicopter crash.Now rescue crews are now at a staging area. Those are live pictures where they are trying to assess where exactly the wreckage is and to begin their recovery efforts. Iranian officials say the helicopter ran into trouble amid heavy fog on Sunday afternoon. Images of the crash site in Iran east Azerbaijan province showed the remote mountainous area where the aircraft went down. And you were looking at a photo of it right there. The President and other officials had been attending a ceremony for the opening of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Rescuers face difficult weather conditions overnight, including cold and heavy fog as they scrambled to locate the crash site. Iranians were urged to pray for the president amid news of the crash with the country's Supreme Leader vowing that there will be no disruption in Iran's work. CNN's Paula Hancocks' following all these developments, and joins us now live from Abu Dhabi. We should say, state media has officially declared that their president has died and we have not heard again from the Supreme Leader. But just if you can bring us right up to date on what happened in any reaction that you have coming in.",

      "sentences": "Well, Paula we do know that nine people on board that helicopter lost their lives in the eastern Azerbaijan province. We know that the President was on board the foreign minister, we understand the governor of that province, also an imam of Friday prayers of that province, along with security, the pilots the crew, so nine people in all went down with that helicopter.Now you have mentioned the dire weather conditions, it took rescue teams around 16 hours to be able to locate and get to that area itself. The rescue teams were unable to put a helicopter into the air. They said because of the weather conditions. The fact that the fog was so thick visibility was very limited. We also heard from the rescue teams that there were subzero temperatures that it was extremely cold in these areas. You can see from the images of the very mountainous area near inhospitable terrain, and sparsely populated. So that's the latest information we have. We do know also from state media that the government has convened an urgent meeting they say that according to a photo that was provided by state media, that the chair that set President Raisi would usually sit in had a black sash across it for morning. We understand from state media as well that there will be details in in the hours to come about the morning precession, the process, the timing, the details, all those will come to us shortly through state media. But people in Iran will be waking up this Monday morning to this this shocking news that said both the President and also the top diplomat have lost their lives in this helicopter crash. Of course questions will be asked internally now about what happened about weather why this this helicopter was in the air with such dire weather conditions. We know it was in a convoy there were three helicopters in all carrying the delegation of President racy from this inauguration of the dam project. Just on the border with Azerbaijan. There were three helicopters. Two of them landed safely, but the one carrying the President's and the foreign minister we know now did not pull up. Paula.",

Those are the people who run the country. The rest are acting at their service and their behest, they're not independent.You can have nuance, you can have styles, differences that can either be more abrasive or less, but the actual running of the country is from a much higher level.

Well, since the uprisings and the protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, and the desperate desire for democracy and freedom, and an economic future. I think that it was very significant.And the Iranian structure, the regime was shocked at the very low turnout in those recent midterm parliamentary elections, regional elections. I think the turnout was 41 percent, which was a historic low, and for them, no matter how manage these, so called elections are, and in this in the last several years, certainly under Raisi and before, there was almost no choice. I mean, before they would play it having some kind of choice, there would be potentially somebody from the reform crowd being allowed to run. This time, not at all during the last presidential election, and it's highly manage. And so when they came to these reasons elections, they use that they hoped the regime as a barometer of faith in the system, where they were told that the faith in the system is crumbling, because the turnout was extremely low. So I think that is something to watch very, very carefully for in any future election. And I do also think it's important to watch to see whether people decide to use this moment to again vent their anger and frustration at what they believe is incredibly bad governance, failure to deliver on their basic human needs, not to mention their human rights. So I think that it is an important moment to take stock, certainly the international community has to be, you know, fairly careful how they react. And we'll see how they react inside Iran.",

But the reality is that the Iranian presidents have very little say on foreign policy, even foreign minister is not more than a spokesperson for the foreign ministry.And in that sense, it is really the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions and even in the region mostly implement Iran's regional policy.

But the reality is that in the next 50 days, I think the Iranians will be more internally focused, because they would have to organize a high stakes election in a very short period of time. Usually the vetting process in Iran is quite complicated. Although conservatives are in control of all levers of power, but they are engaged in very serious infighting. And the rupture between the states and the society is quite serious.So the system would be most likely concerned about internal unrest during the next few weeks. And in that sense, I think it's not going to focus on region, as was the case in the past. But let's remember that just two weeks ago, Iran had a one off parliamentary election, in which only 8 percent of the capital residents actually participated at the polls. And that just shows how unpopular the regime is at this moment in time.",

And they were grooming President Raisi to be a potential successor to the Supreme Leader, not necessarily because he was the most competent, but because he was one of the most loyal to the deep state in Iran represented by the Office of the Supreme Leader, and the Revolutionary Guards.And so now this creates a vacuum that I'm sure rivals in Iran would try to fill. And it definitely throws all the plans that the Office of the Supreme Leader probably had out of the window. But having said this, there is no shortage of people who are subservient, and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic, who could potentially step in. And so they have to go back to the drawing board. But I don't expect this to be, again, the fundamental game changer.",

It makes sure it doesn't, again, create space for miscalculation, or further escalation, especially because Iran sees itself now in a positive position of vulnerability, and often acts more aggressively when it's in in such circumstances. But also because it up actually provides an opportunity. There is a rupture with the pattern that we have seen in the past three years, and Iran could potentially be nudged with a more open election towards a government that will be more representative and therefore will be able to reduce tensions in the region and between Iran and the West. I'm not holding my breath that would happen. But I'm saying that the West should not miss this opportunity to encourage Iran to move in that direction.",

Earlier former .U.S Defense Secretary Leon Panetta explained to CNN why he was surprised that there were so many high ranking officials on board flying in dangerous condition. Listen. (BEGIN IVDEO CLIP) LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Usually don't want to put your top officials in one helicopter, that's not a good policy to follow. And when I was chief of staff, we never did that with the President or the Vice President and others. We will you -- you normally would want to have them go in separate helicopters. This was a big event, evidently, in Azerbaijan. They were dedicating a dam. And so the President and the foreign minister went up there together. They probably decided to ride together in the helicopter, which was a mistake. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So even countries with complicated relations with Tehran, and there are many that have that, in the aftermath of the crash are coming out with messages of solidarity.I'll point out Pakistan for example where Iran bombed a border region of Pakistan in January and triggered widespread anger within the political elite and military elite in Pakistan, sending messages of condolence and support in the wake of the news coming out of this now deadly helicopter crash. The president of Azerbaijan is the last head of state to have seen Raisi face-to-face. This was Sunday when the two leaders met at the border to inaugurate the new dam project. And it is from that location that Raisi was flying in a helicopter when the aircraft went down. So Ilham Aliyev put out a statement saying that he was troubled by news of the helicopter crash, and he said, our prayers to Allah Almighty for President Raisi and for the delegation offering any help possible. Turkey, a neighbor of Iran, sent a drone that helped with the search for the crash and Russia also sent aircraft and dozens of rescuers to come to the scene to try to help with that. We know that Vladimir Putin, according to Iran's ambassador to Moscow, had effectively an emergency meeting with the Iranian diplomat, which I think underscores the close ties between Moscow and Tehran. And we'll likely see more of these kinds of outpourings of support in the days and weeks ahead.",

Iranian news agencies say the government there has convened an urgent meeting following the announcement that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has died in a helicopter crash.His chair at that meeting was left vacant and a black sash was placed in his memory. Eight other people were onboard, that includes Iran's foreign minister. Iranian officials say the helicopter ran into trouble and heavy fog on Sunday. It was returning from a trip to the Iranian- Azerbaijan border where the president had attended a ceremony for the opening of a new dam. Now this video shows President Raisi during that trip on board a helicopter over the weekend. He was elected in 2021 and Iran's government is expected to move quickly to elect his replacement. CNN's Paula Hancocks has been following all of this for us from Abu Dhabi. I'm grateful to have you as we continue to parse exactly what's going on and the stunning news that Iranians are just waking up to really.

And that has been backed up by what we heard as well from the Iranian Red Crescent, from rescue teams saying how bitterly cold the situation was. And the fact that they were having to try and track this location on foot.We know that it took about 16 hours from the time that the helicopter was reported to have lost the -- lost any contact with anybody and to the time when it was actually fine. So that's a substantial amount of time that passed before it was able to be located. So these are all the considerations that will be taken when investigators are trying to find out exactly what happened. Also, I think the question will be asked as to why the president and the foreign minister, were on the same helicopter. Now certainly in many countries, the protocol would be that the two such VIPs would not be on the same helicopter. We know that there was a convoy of three helicopters that were traveling from eastern Azerbaijan province where the president and his delegation had been attending an inauguration of a dam. And we know that two of those helicopters landed safely. One however, did not. So what the investigators will be looking at is the weather conditions, whether this helicopter should have been in the air. Obviously, looking at all those on board, we know nine people were on board -- the president, the foreign minister, a governor, also an imam. There was security personnel, the pilot, copilot, and crew. So these are the sorts of things that will be looked at at this point as they are trying to be -- trying to be investigated, Paula.",
