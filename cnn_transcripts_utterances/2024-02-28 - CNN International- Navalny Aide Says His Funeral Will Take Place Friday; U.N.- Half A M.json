This is CNN Newsroom.Just ahead, Alexei Navalny's widow gives a passionate speech and calls on Europe to unite against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Plus, U.S. President Joe Biden's son Hunter is set to answer questions on Capitol Hill. We are live in Washington for the very latest. And Prince Harry loses a legal battle in a U.K. court. I'll ask CNN's Royal Correspondent what the ruling means for Harry's security. We are learning the funeral for the late Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, will take place in Moscow Friday, exactly two weeks after his mysterious death at an Arctic penal colony. His spokesperson made the announcement on social media. Meanwhile, Navalny's widow delivered a very powerful address to the European Parliament earlier today. Yulia Navalnaya unleashed a scathing critique of Vladimir Putin, blaming him directly for her husband's death, and said the Russian president is not someone who can be negotiated with.

And with all that emotion in her voice, it has been 12 days, something she insisted upon during the speech since the assassination of her husband.And this was really something of a call to arms, Amara, not just urging European lawmakers to, in her words, do more like her husband and prove innovative in their attempts to take on Vladimir Putin. What she explained was that the same old sanctions, the same old attempts to shift the lines simply won't work. And it's time for European leaders and others and all those who want to help Russians from outside to get far more creative as they consider how to help take on Vladimir Putin. It was also, Amara, a call to arms to all the many millions of Russians who are outside the country now, explaining that it is with those Russians that Western leaders need to be working in order to try and make a difference. And I think there was also this important sense that now was the time to act because of all this huge outrage and anger that there is, that she'd urged the world and Russians specifically inside the country, to share with her when she made that address. You'll remember about 10 days ago now, looking for the first time, like the opposition leader we imagined she will more officially become with time. Amara?",

Ismail Haniyeh says the group has displayed flexibility in the talks, but remains ready to fight on. He also called on Palestinians, and Jerusalem, and the West Bank to march to Al Aqsa Mosque on the first day of Ramadan. Now, Qatar, which is mediating these negotiations, is hopeful that a final agreement can be in place before the start of the holy month, which begins March 10th or 11th. A deal couldn't come soon enough for the people of Gaza, who are just desperate for humanitarian aid. The U.N. says over half a million people there are one step away from famine.

Of course, we heard from the U.S. President Joe Biden saying that it could be as early as the end of the weekend.But we've seen Israel, Hamas, also Qatar distancing themselves from that particular sentiment suggesting that it may not be that fast. Now, we've heard from John Kirby as well, the national security spokesperson in the U.S. saying that he believes they're getting closer in a negotiation. It could happen in coming days. And what we're gathering from from different reports, from different officials around the region, it is that it will be a phased approach. So when they're talking about a potential truce, a temporary ceasefire fire, that would just be the first phase. And what we understand the negotiations to be in broad outlines, it would be a six-week ceasefire. There would be some 40 Israeli hostages released for about 400 Palestinian prisoners. And we're hearing from the Israeli side that they are insisting that female Israeli military soldiers would be part of that. And then once they're in that temporary ceasefire, we're hearing from officials there is a hope that the next phases could be negotiated, that it would create some kind of more peaceful space to be able to negotiate further hostage releases. But, of course, the crucial part as well is to make sure that within that time, as much humanitarian aid as is possible can get into those in Gaza who so desperately need it. Amara? WALKER: Yes, let's talk more about that aid, Paula, because obviously concerns are growing around the world as we are awaiting Israel's promised invasion, ground invasion of Rafah, which is really one of the last places of refuge for the more than 1 million civilians there. We heard the U.N. say that over half a million people in Gaza are just one step away from famine. I guess, what is the situation there in terms of humanitarian aid and if it's getting in?",

Live for us there in Abu Dhabi.Well, Joe Biden and Donald Trump easily cruise to victory in the Michigan primary Tuesday, but neither of them could be entirely happy with the results. Around 13 percent of Democratic voters cast a protest vote of uncommitted. That's 100,000 voters. They were telling the president that they oppose his policy in the Israel-Hamas war. In a swing state like Michigan, Mr. Biden will need to get many of those voters back to win this state in November. And Nikki Haley continues to be a thorn in Trump's side, with almost 300,000 Michigan Republicans, choosing her over the presumptive nominee. And she says, she thinks voters deserve better than a rematch of 2020.

      "sentences": "Yes, so these were wins, but with some general election warning signs. I mean, look, there weren't expectations that Biden was going to lose this primary. There weren't expectations that Trump was going to lose this primary here in Michigan, but we got a good level set for where their support actually lies in this critical battleground state of Michigan.Let's start with President Biden. There was a large movement led by Arab American activists to vote uncommitted instead of vote for Biden over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Now, in statewide, they got over 100,000 votes, which is obviously a very significant number, but here in Dearborn, which has one of the largest American communities in the country, Uncommitted actually beat Joe Biden, 56 percent to 40 percent. Now we're talking about a total of 11,000 votes in that contest, but still shows that this movement and this message pushing the Biden administration to get toward a permanent ceasefire is a serious one. And one they believe should be respected come November. I mentioned over 100,000 uncommitted. I want you to keep in mind that Biden actually won this state by around 150,000 people in 2020. So you can get an idea for the margins that are really in play here. On the Republican side of things, yes, no expectations that Donald Trump was going to lose this state, but Nikki Haley getting around 26 percent of the vote, just under 300,000 votes, is no small block to laugh at. And for someone like Donald Trump, who is clearly trying to move toward a general election mindset, this has remained a thorn in his side. The Nikki Haley has still generated some significant support, not just here, but in the previous primary in South Carolina, where she got around 40 percent of the vote, approaching 40 percent there. The question, though, moving forward is you need delegates to get to the nomination, and she has not won any of these contests. And Super Tuesday, which is coming in less than a week here, we're going to see more than 15 states with voting contests and more than a third of the delegates at stake here. And if she can't be successful in that Super Tuesday effort, it's hard to see what her path moving forward is, but it is there is no doubt that there's a significant amount of Republicans who are looking to put their support behind her rather than the former president.",

This is really a make or break moment for GOP lawmakers, who so far have provided no clear evidence to support their allegation that President Biden benefited from his son's foreign business dealings.And you referenced in the intro, Alexander Smirnov. Just two weeks ago, the Justice Department charged him with lying when Bidens received millions of dollars in foreign bribes. That was a claim. That was a piece of evidence that was at the heart of this impeachment inquiry. Now, Republicans are brushing off that setback as they head into today's deposition. And this deposition is only happening because lawmakers were willing to make two significant concessions to allay Biden and his attorney's concerns about selective leaks. Initially, they said, he would only answer questions publicly. He did not trust, he said, Republican lawmakers not to selectively leak things that he said. So today's deposition will not be filmed, unlike other witnesses in the impeachment probe, and the transcript will be released to the public. We expect it will be released pretty quickly. So these are at least two concessions that were made to get him to sit down behind closed doors. At this point it's unclear if there'll ever be a public hearing. At this point, we're told, there's no plans or discussions about that. But we'll be watching to see how he handles this today, Amara, because what we've seen over the past year, it's Hunter Biden, he got a new lawyer over a year ago. Abbe Lowell has his colleague and friend and attorney Kevin Morris. They have taken a very aggressive approach at times, much to the chagrin of the White House towards his attractors, towards Republicans. We've seen in the past two months, they made two unannounced, arguably stunt appearances up here as they were negotiating this to get their point across to lawmakers. So it's going to be really interesting, especially in the wake of the Smirnov revelation, to see how Hunter handles his appearance today.",

So, publicly funded services that come from being in a publicly funded role, one of which was security from the Metropolitan Police.He moved to Canada, he kept it for a while there, but then it was taken away from him. And this is a debate about whether or not that was right. He's not looking for full time, you know, all year security from the British police, but he is expecting it, when he comes back to the United Kingdom, armed police to protect him because he says there are threats, general threats against him. One of the reasons he hasn't come over with his kids is because he doesn't feel they'll be protected. So a debate about that. On the other side, the Home Office speaking on behalf of the government is arguing there is protection in place. It is bespoke. So if there is a credible threat against him, they will give him that support, but they won't -- he won't get it automatically. And that's a system that's in place for other VIPs around the world. You know, a big Hollywood A-lister coming to London, says there's a credible threat, they would get police support, but they wouldn't get it every time they came over.

Just to give your viewers some context, the city of London and the greater area is some 390,000 acres. So the largest of these blazes, as you pointed out, is the Smokehouse Creek fire. That is now the 2nd largest in the state history. Fire crews have been struggling to contain this blaze. They're battling very difficult conditions. They don't have a lot of access to water. This is an area that's been impacted by drought. A lot of these counties are rural areas, and that means not only humans are affected, but livestock. Almost impossible to evacuate large numbers of livestock. Now, you mentioned the nuclear facility. This is the main facility in the United States that disassembles America's nuclear arsenal that had to shut down yesterday. It is we are hearing back online this morning. Another nearby town, the city of Fritch had asked all of its residents to evacuate on Tuesday night. The natural gas was turned off there to limit the fire danger. But now we're learning that the city of Fritch is asking for outside help to bring their water system back online because of a power outage. Another area, Canadian, Texas. One motel owner there spoke to CNN and she described a scene that looked like Armageddon. There was white dust in the trees, smoke everywhere. She had to shut down in her motel and evacuate. The local hospital there also had to evacuate all of their patients on Tuesday. And that is just one of many areas affected. And because of these high speed winds, you know, the heat, the fire, we're also seeing those blazes spread into neighboring Oklahoma. So it is not just the Texas panhandle that is affected.

They can decide not to pursue. They can pursue some or all of it. So that's one aspect. The worst case scenario would be that the entire indictment gets thrown out, that there's a determination that not only is there a disqualification, but the indictment was also at issue, and the indictment is no longer in place. So the whole process would've to start over. I think that's very, very unlikely that the indictment would be impacted.

As you see behind me, all of these mountains that are brown are supposed to be covered with snow.This year instead there just hasn't been the snow. The only snow you see here was made with artificial snow machines. NADEAU (voice-over): The human caused climate crisis has resulted in snow loss across the Northern Hemisphere. Here, more than 4,400 feet above sea level, where snow is disappearing fast, people are questioning how much longer skiing can go on. This year, the influence of El Nino means temperatures have been even higher than usual. Normally, on a Sunday in February, you'd have 6,000 people skiing on these slopes. This year, only 4 of the 14 slopes were open. Of the 250 people who work here normally, only 50 have been able to keep their jobs because the season has been so mild and short. This ski resort has been in Andrea Lallini's family for 23 years. First his father, and now he and his brother Luca run it. He says the seasons have been getting shorter over the years. He tells us the problem is lack of precipitation. Plus, it has never gotten cold. This year winter barely even arrived, he says. They tell us that in the 1980s and 90s, artificial snow wasn't necessary. There was plenty of the natural stuff to go around. This year, snow machines were the resort's only option. But even that is problematic, because last summer there was very little rain, and lakes like this one ran dry. There was no water to make snow, and even fake snow melts if it's too warm. It's a vicious cycle, he says. And non-skiers feel the impact too. [08:55:04] Gennarino Di Stefano is the mayor of Rocca di Cambio. He says the town's livelihood revolves around this ski resort and those nearby. The changing climate is having a ripple effect on the economy. GENNARINO DI STEFANO, ROCCA DI CAMBIO MAYOR (through translator): Every town has a good number of people who come here to work. From the ski instructors, the managers, the bars, the restaurants, the people who run the ski lifts. Many people are not working. NADEAU (voice-over): And for ski instructors like Isidoro Franceschi, the lack of snow in shorter season means these young competitive skiers have to go elsewhere to train. ISIDORO FRANCESCHI, HEAD SKI INSTRUCTOR AT CAMPO FELICE (through translator): For those of us who have always worked in this area, it is heartbreaking to see nature spoiled like this. It isn't good. NADEAU (voice-over): As skiers turn to resorts at higher elevations where there's more snow, skiing in places like this will soon be wiped out for good. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Campo Felice, Italy.
