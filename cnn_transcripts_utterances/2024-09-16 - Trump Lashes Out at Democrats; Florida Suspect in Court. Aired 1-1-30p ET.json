Trump is set to meet with the acting Secret Service director, Ronald Rowe, today. Rowe plans to stay in Florida as this investigation plays out. Meantime, the former president is placing blame on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' rhetoric for causing him to be shot at. CNN's Paula Reid is live outside the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach, Florida. Paula, what else happened during this hearing today?",

He was shackled, both his hands and his feet, for this initialappearance before a magistrate judge. Now he was asked a series of questions. Our colleagues say that he nodded and just said \"Yes, Judge,\" a few times. But this hearing was also, Boris, the first time that he learned the charges that he is facing, including these two counts, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. And, of course, this investigation is barely 24 hours old. So it is highly possible that additional charges will be filed against him, though it's unclear exactly what those charges will be. Now, as of now, the government is arguing that they want him to continue to be detained ahead of a possible trial. They argue that not only does he present a threat to the community, but that he is also a flight risk. Now, Boris, based on what we learned at this hearing, it also appears he's unlikely to be someone who can post bond or bail. It appears that he only has an income of about $3,000 a month. And, in terms of assets, he had two trucks. They are in Hawaii. Now, the next time he will be in federal court will be next Monday. That will be for a detention hearing where prosecutors will lay out their case for why they want him to remain detained. And then he will be formally arraigned on September 30.",

Again, you don't stumble upon that. That takes a little bit of thought and it shows a level of sophistication in his attack planning. But, Brianna, I think it's really important to understand, like, if this person was here that long showing and exhibiting this level of sophistication, this didn't all just materialize today. He's been thinking about this for a while. I think, from a behavioral threat standpoint, this individual is really concerning, because he's showing things in his past, past behavior, his past interactions with law enforcement that are really pointing to a lot of red flags around this individual that makes him a real concern for the Secret Service. And these are the types of individuals that the Secret Service has to get on top of working with local law enforcement to identify before they're able to even take these actions.",

But, uniquely, you have agents that are pushing to the left and to the right of him in advance and that are flanking all around him, again, another layer out. And their role is specifically to identify this exact type of threat. It's that longer-range threat that is lying in wait for -- to launch their attack. The agent that actually identified this threat and then engaged to try to neutralize it did a remarkable job. And it actually proved that the training tactics and experience of the agents that were on site yesterday proved successful. This is the exact type of response that we want to have.

One of the things to note is that golf game was a last-minute addition to his calendar, so some of his own closest advisers didn't know it was on the schedule. Some of his own allies didn't know he was in West Palm Beach because he has been traveling. So, obviously, questions as to how exactly this person was -- got the knowledge to understand where Donald Trump was going to be and at what time, and if there are going to be any changes in security protocol. Now, as of now, we are told that there aren't going to be very many changes at all, at least to his schedule. Donald Trump had several campaign events on the agenda this week. We are told none of that is going to change. That includes trips to Washington, D.C., as well as Michigan, as well as Uniondale, New York. But, as you mentioned, Donald Trump reacting to this shooting very differently than what we saw after that first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, when he called for unity. This time, he is going straight to blaming Democrats and the Biden administration. I want to reach you part of the quote from this interview he did with FOX News Digital. He says: \"He,\" being the gunman, \"believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it. Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country, both from inside and out.\" Again, very different from what we heard from Donald Trump after that first assassination attempt when he was calling for unity. Clearly, in this case, he has moved on to a different type of rhetoric on top of the very divisive rhetoric we have heard across the spectrum this election cycle. Now, again, we are waiting to hear a readout of that meeting between Donald Trump and the acting secretary. We, of course, will give you any details we learn from that.",

That's not to say that other societies aren't, but we are particularly violent for a combination of reasons. And, naturally, wrongly, we focus on presidents and people who are, let's say, disturbed in various ways, believe either that the president or presidential candidate or other important person is responsible for their troubles, when there really is no connection at all. Or -- and this is the worst -- they just want to become famous. We have had a number of those, which, by the way, is one reason why I try not to use the names of assassins unless it's absolutely necessary, because that's what they want.

As one of the members of the Secret Service once said to me, \"If wehad our way, we would wrap all protectees in bulletproof glass and never let them out of it,\" because then they wouldn't have to worry so much about what may happen. But, of course, the protectees are human beings. They have to have a life. They like to go golfing or whatever the case may be. So adjustments are made. Also, you have to remember that politicians believe that they are, if not -- that they are, if not invulnerable, then at least protected from lots of the normal plagues of mankind. That isn't true. It just isn't true. President Kennedy -- and this is by no means an attempt to blame the victim. What happened was absolutely unjustifiable. But President Kennedy believed that it was important to look voters in the eye. He didn't want anybody, anything obstructing the people's view of him and his view of the people. And he sometimes pushed the Secret Service agents to a backup car, instead of on the runners of the presidential limousine. Well, we saw what happened in Dallas. Now, could the Secret Service have done a better job? Sure. They did not even investigate many of the tall buildings with many open windows in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Why? Because it wasn't done back then. Because we had fooled ourselves into believing that somehow we were beyond the history of presidential assassinations. And that's just one example. There are so many others. And we never seemed to learn for very long. We learned for brief periods, but not for very long.",
