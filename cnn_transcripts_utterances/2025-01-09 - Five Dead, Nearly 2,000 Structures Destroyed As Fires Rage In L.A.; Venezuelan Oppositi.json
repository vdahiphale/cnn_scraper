      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. You have been watching CNN's special coverage of thefuneral of the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. Friends, family, and all the living presidents gathered to say goodbye to President Carter, a man who embodied the term public service. Mr. Carter's casket is now on the way to Joint Base Andrews, about to head to his final resting place, Plains, Georgia. That's where 100 years ago, Jimmy Carter began his extraordinary life. We'll have more on the rest of the president's funeral throughout the afternoon for you. But first, we are, of course, continuing to monitor the ongoing wildfires that are raging across Southern California. At this hour, Los Angeles County is facing a fire emergency unlike any it has ever experienced before. There are now five major fires raging. Not a single one of them is fully contained. In all, nearly 30,000 acres or 12,000 hectares have already been burned. And at least five people have been killed as a result of the fires. Overnight, another major fire exploded in the iconic Hollywood Hills, but the winds have died down somewhat since then, allowing the Hollywood evacuation order to be lifted. In the last hour, the mayor of Los Angeles updated the public on the efforts to contain the fires and urged residents to help each other. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Julia, it's been 24 hours since we last spoke, and the fires have only grown since then. There were four yesterday, five today. Talk to us about the unprecedented scenes, the real hellscape that we are seeing in all of the images as we've been covering these devastating fires.",

      "sentences": "It is a hellscape. It is apocalyptic, Bianna.I'll tell you, the one piece of good news that we heard and what we've had in the past 24 hours since we last spoke is that there's been a lull in the wind that is expected to end in the coming hours. And the wind is expected to pick back up this afternoon and evening. But the fire, Eaton Fire, that's the one that's affected this area on the east side of Los Angeles, of Altadena and Pasadena where I am, it has stopped growing. But over 1,000 structures have been damaged, so we know that five people have died, but we're still hearing, waiting to hear for more updates on this. That number is expected to go up at some point. The scale of the destruction, I mean, we are on -- we're in a city here, Bianna. This is -- it is not the woods. It's not really a wildfire. I mean, it started as a wildfire, but this has now really, as the fire subsides, we can see the scale of this destruction and start to understand what is it that has been done to these towns. Almost 180,000 people have been affected by these evacuation orders, 215,000 people are without power. Some of that, almost half, is actually intentional because authorities are so scared that if there is power going through these wires, that we see so many downed poles that could spark even more fires. And I'll go back to the winds issue, Bianna, because that is so, so important. With the slow in the wind, there have been able to be helicopters up in the air helping fight the spread of these fires. We're still at zero percent containment, by the way. That hasn't changed. But having the help coming from the air has been vital for firefighters. There are about 750 firefighters that are here in Altadena trying to fight these fires and making some really difficult choices of going from spot to spot, figuring out what is it that they can save and what is it that's just too late to try and save. I'll leave you with this. There's been some issues with water as well. We've heard from residents that some of the fire hydrants are just not working. This is partially is anecdotal. There aren't widespread issues with water, but there's been a lot of debate. And we're hearing from people that -- and authorities, just earlier today, that it's just not built, the structure here is just not built to withstand this kind of damage. And there's just so much water that's needed to fight these fires that they're just hitting a wall here, but they're still working tirelessly. And the good news is that the fire here, Eaton Fire, has stopped growing for now. Now we have to see if that will hold, Bianna, overnight.",

As many wildfires as we've been covering and have beenexperienced in that part of the country, they've never seen something to this scale and magnitude. The equivalent, it's unbelievable, of 20,000 football fields have thus far been burned. And as you said, none of them really fully contained at this point. Julia Vargas Jones, thank you so much. With the very latest on the firefighting efforts, I'm joined by L.A. County Fire Department Section Chief, Kenichi Haskett. Chief Haskett, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. Talk to us right now about the resources needed most for the fire departments as they are continuing to battle. Yesterday, it was four. Now, there are five fires. Thankfully, the winds have died down, but the battle to put these fires out is still ongoing. KENICHI HASKETT, L.A. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT SECTION CHIEF: The weather -- can you guys hear me OK?",
