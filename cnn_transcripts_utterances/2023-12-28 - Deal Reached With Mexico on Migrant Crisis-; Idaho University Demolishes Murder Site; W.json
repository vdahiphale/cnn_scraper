This morning, she has tried to clean up those comments already on a radio show. She said, of course, she knows the Civil War was about slavery. What you're looking at right now is her first public event in North Conway, north country there in New Hampshire, back on the trail. We will see. We're watching this very carefully to see if she mentions it at the event. I want to remind you what she said last night. Listen.

But Democrats argue that was after the pressure, after the terrible slaughter at the Mother Emanuel Church, that she was pushed into that position. So this is an ongoing conversation now on the campaign trail. We will see if she addresses it further. She typically does not take reporter questions at campaign stops, but she does take questions from voters. And perhaps they will ask her about this as she makes multiple stops today on the campaign trail. She's going to be joined by Governor Sununu on some of those stops -- John.",

We know that. That's unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing and whether government, economically, culturally, any other reasons had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what that bigger issue with the Civil War is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way. That should be the goal of what we always try and take away from that, right, because we never want to return back to that place. But we always want to remember the lesson of what it means to be a free individual and that everyone deserves to be a free individual. So we stand by that. I say that as a Southerner. I say that as a southern governor who removed the Confederate Flag off the Statehouse grounds. (APPLAUSE)",

This morning at this event, she proactively went out and among the very first thing she told this audience in North Conway, New Hampshire, a long, long way, by the way, from the South, the very first thing she told that audience practically was, of course, the Civil War was about slavery and also the role of government there.

This ambiguity, this kind of cloudiness, people don't respond to that. Voters want you to stand for what you stand for. Even if they land in a different place, they always reward authenticity. If Nikki Haley sounds inauthentic or she sounds calculating, I think it's just going to backfire on her, really.

Here's why.Overnight, Colorado's Republican Party asked the Supreme Court in an appeal to overturn a state-level Supreme Court ruling that says Trump is ineligible to run because the 14th Amendment bans insurrectionists. They argue: \"By excluding President Trump from, the ballot Colorado Supreme Court engaged in,\" as they put it, \"an unprecedented disregard for the First Amendment. There is a real risk the Colorado Supreme Court majority's flawed and unprecedented analysis will be borrowed,' they argue, \"and the resulting grave legal error repeated.\" That is what they're asking the court to look into. Colorado, though, is an outlier, actually. Other state supreme courts have so far rejected similar efforts to keep Donald Trump off the ballot. Decisions in Maine and Oregon could come at any time. With me now is Caroline Polisi, federal and white-colored criminal defense attorney. Thank you so much for being here. We're looking at this situation where the Colorado Republican Party has said, all right, we are appealing this. We're going to the Supreme Court. How do you see the Supreme Court reacting? It's surely because so many states are looking at the same issue and they're ruling differently. Do you see this -- them picking up the case?",

This is exactly the type of case that the Supreme Court should take, in that they can't let sort of chaos reign during this election cycle, wherein different states have different candidates on the ballot. So that's why I do think they will take up the issue. Unfortunately, I don't think we are going to get a satisfactory answer to this big issue, which is whether or not President -- then-President Trump engaged in insurrection. That would be covered by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. We saw the lower Colorado court really engage in that issue and decide that, yes, he had. However, I think that the Supreme Court will not get to that question. They will likely rule under the sort of idea of whether or not this is a political question, whether or not the courts are the ones that are supposed to be stepping in and deciding this, rather than, say, Congress or the electorate.
