I'm Laila Harrak.Already in Berlin, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Germany as that nation prepares to supply billions in aid to help Ukraine fight Russia. Bracing for disaster, millions of people in Bangladesh and Myanmar in the path of powerful Cyclone Mocha. And Eurovision has a winner. Sweden takes home the top honor in this year's song contest. Good to be with you. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Berlin right now meeting with top German leaders who are providing some much needed military support. He landed there hours after Germany announced its biggest batch of military aid, which includes 30 Leopard tanks. The $3 billion package also includes armored vehicles and reconnaissance drones. Germany was reluctant to deliver weapons to Kyiv in the early stages of the war, but it later made a policy U-turn, becoming a major arms supplier to Ukraine. For more now, Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London. Salma, President Zelenskyy now on his first visit to Germany since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What kind of reception is he getting?",

      "sentences": "Look, you're going to receive the reception of an ally, of a friend, of a close partner in this war. Germany has been critical, has been pivotal to Ukraine's fight against Russia. And it is Germany, really, that became, if you will, the center of this debate around tanks just a few months ago. Germany initially seemed reluctant to provide those tanks.I know you describe it as a U-turn, but, really, at the beginning of this conflict, most western allies were highly concerned about providing any weapons that might seem to be offensive, that might escalate that conflict with Russia, that might show some sort of direct involvement that would further instigate the war with the Kremlin. Of course, that calculation has now changed more than a year into the conflict. And, again, it was a few months ago that once that deal was reached for the United States provided Abrams tanks that Germany, in turn, also provided those very critical Leopard tanks that are already on those frontlines. Of course, before President Zelenskyy arrived in Berlin, Germany, Germany's defense ministry announcing this $3 billion aid package that will include more of those tanks, more help ahead of this expected core offensive. And if you're asking what to expect to happen during this visit in Germany, I think what took place in Rome is a good indicator, is a good prelude. There, of course, yesterday, President Zelenskyy met with his counterpart, met with Pope Francis as well, Italy's prime minister pledged unwavering support, pledged to push and help Ukraine in its bid to join NATO. Pope Francis emphasized the humanitarian aspect. Of course, you can see or expect, rather, very similar lines coming from Germany, and all of this, again, ahead of this push on the ground, this expected counteroffensive. President Zelenskyy yesterday signaling that the first steps of that could come soon. Laila?",

But they want to make sure that they demonstrate that they will continue to help Ukraine even if there's a change in U.S. policy.So, this package was negotiated already weeks and months before, but it is now a very good timing to announce the package, also with Zelenskyy having just arrived in Berlin to demonstrate, well, whatever happens in the United States, this is a war which is existential for Europeans.",

It's not a beauty contest, but it's still surprising that this visit is coming relatively late.And so the sign that is sent with this visit by the German chancellor and by the government is perhaps relations between Ukraine and Germany are not as warm, are not as strong in rhetoric (ph) as other countries' relations are, but they are substantial.

And Germany's hesitancy in supplying Ukraine, for instance, with tanks at the beginning of this year, has led many observers to question this historic shift that the German chancellor has announced.But what we see now is that actually the implementation of this shift is making real progress, especially the new German defense minister, Boris Pistorius, is really putting a lot of effort into making the nitty-gritty of such a shift work in terms of giving Ukraine the weapons that they need quickly, approving to export weapons quickly, getting, for the German army, the weapons that they need.

We've already seen trucks carrying fuel going into the Gaza Strip as well. So, things returning to the way things were before this latest round of hostilities. And, overall, as you say, we've seen, according to the Israeli Defense Forces, more than 1,200 rockets fired by Islamic jihad militants towards Israel these past five days. Israel saying that it struck more than 370 targets, 33 Palestinians killed inside Gaza, including militants and also women and children. And there were two people killed inside Israel as well. Israel, while thanking Egypt for its mediation efforts, reiterating after the ceasefire came into effect that quiet, in its words, will be met with quiet. Adding that if Israel is attacked or threatened, it will continue to do everything it needs to do to defend itself. And the militant factions in the Gaza Strip also saying that this round of fighting may be over, but the will to fight has not receded. And there are a couple of other interesting takeaways here, which is, first of all, Hamas, the bigger and more powerful militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, was not targeted by Israel. Although it was saying that it was involved, Israel says that it was differentiating between what Hamas was saying and what they could see that it was doing. It said that Hamas was not involved. And so Israel was not targeting Hamas, even though in previous outbreaks of hostilities, Israel has targeted Hamas, blaming it, saying it is responsible for any rocket fire emanating from the Gaza Strip. And I suppose the other thing is that this coming Thursday is the flag march where usually religious nationalist Jews march through parts of Jerusalem, including in Eastern Jerusalem, to celebrate what they see as the reunification of that city. Well, because we've just had this outbreak of conflict and a ceasefire, the fear of hostilities breaking out again have receded somewhat. Laila.

That number still stands at about 23,000. So, this what you can perhaps call a temporary respite is allowing them opportunities to process those individuals to make room for others who may possibly choose to enter the country illegally. Now, there is speculation there on the ground when you speak to some of those who are running the shelters that receive some of these migrants after they're processed. They seem to believe that perhaps some of the news coming from the Biden administration of stricter policies could be making it south of the border. So, you have many potential asylum seekers just south of the border that are still weighing their options. There are, of course, those numbers that are likely to grow, that is the number of asylum seekers ending up in some of America's largest cities.
