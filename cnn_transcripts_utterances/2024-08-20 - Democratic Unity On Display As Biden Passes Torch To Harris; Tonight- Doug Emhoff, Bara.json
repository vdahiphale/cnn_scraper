I'm Dana Bash, live from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where tonight, two of the party's biggest stars and the man who hopes to be the country's first first gentleman will take that stage right behind me.We are told that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will underscore just how high the stakes are heading into November, while Doug Emhoff focuses on the personal side of his wife, Kamala Harris. We'll also hear from Senator Bernie Sanders, and this might be a first Donald Trump's former Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, will speak in support of the woman trying to defeat the man she wants to work for. As for the candidate herself, she will be nearly 100 miles north, holding her own rally in Milwaukee, which we are told will be coordinated with the programming in this hall. It comes on the heels of an emotional night with Joe Biden fighting back tears after a heartfelt introduction from his daughter Ashley, and thousands chanting their thanks over and over again. This entire arena, you can see it there on their feet after almost every speaker expressed gratitude for his leadership, and though no one said it outright for dropping out and endorsing Kamala Harris.

And I think, more represent the future versus past, kind of dichotomy that Harris wants to present. Because, you know, for all of yesterday's kind of legacy building of Joe Biden, it was -- it was a reminder, frankly, of the where the party was just a month ago.You have people like Hillary Clinton saying that there was such energy in the country. But it was also a reminder that some of the very people on the stage were actually advocating against kind of unleashing that energy, when they were supporting Joe Biden staying in the race. Now that he has had his legacy moment in terms of Monday night, I think you're going to see Tuesday through Thursday. Really point towards the future, really point towards Harris's bio, and I think prior to -- so I think, try to reintroduce her to the country in a way that goes beyond the kind of good vibes that we had yesterday. I think it has to happen on the policy front, but it also has to happen, I think, on just the presidential readiness front, to say that this is not someone who's kind of just stashed in the administration for four years, but this is someone who is better than the presidential candidate you remember three four years ago. Barack Obama will make that case. Michelle Obama make that case. I think Bernie Sanders will be an interesting person, too. I interviewed him a week ago, and he was talking about how this administration's populist economic messaging, the things that she rolled out yesterday, has won people like him over.

You wrote about this, Peter, about rose-colored glasses.[12:05:00] Michael Kapp, a DNC member from California, said, while Democrats here are giddy, they're also more focused and ready to work than they were in 2016. It's the same level of excitement and momentum that I've seen in smaller groups and over the phone and online, just with much bigger crowds, Kapp said. There is a willingness to take the fight to the Republicans, but no rose-colored glasses that -- that I and many others have had in Philadelphia in 2016. That is really interesting. Meaning, in 2016 everybody was excited, but there was a complacency because everybody thought, wait, there's no way Donald Trump will be president. They don't think that anymore. PETER HAMBY. PARTNER, PUCK NEWS: I mean, all of us who covered 2008 too we hear this from people. This feels like 2008 with Democrats are excited. There is memes, there's grassroots energy. People are really excited. But Michael Kapp, that DNC member, I'm sure all of you guys have talked to members this week. I talked to Levar Stoney from my hometown of Richmond, the mayor, who said the same thing, that the cloud of Trump winning again does hang over this as excited as they are for this new burst of energy and momentum, they feel like they have to keep working. I mean, Kamala Harris has increased her lead over Joe Biden. She is beating Donald Trump in key states, but it's still a jump ball. She's not at Biden's 2020 levels, with certain subgroups, with black and Hispanic voters. In particular, she still has to keep working. And to what you -- what Astead was just saying, like she also introduced herself and her validators here have to as well. I mean, one thing I want to talk about Biden speech going late, and people on the East Coast didn't see it because it was after midnight. I haven't talked a lot of Democrats were like, he didn't talk about Kamala enough. He was just a valedictory speech for him. I talked to one person who, you know, from the Obama University said, you can expect Obama tonight to give a much more formal -- sorry, much more forceful outline for what Kamala Harris will do compared to Joe Biden.",

Harris' rise to presidential nominee amounts to a continuation of the arc that began with Obama on that summer evening in Boston two decades ago. The energy fueling her candidacy and thunderous crowds chanting her name have drawn comparisons to Obama's history making 2008 run. That's your story with Kevin Liptak, of course, two decades ago in Boston. We were just talking about this before coming on the air.

And she was a very young district attorney from California, 35 or so. But Obama does not have a recollection of meeting her until later that fall, when he was out in California for a fundraiser.There are paths across. They weren't that close necessarily. They have become close. He has become a trusted adviser to her. He was speaking to her throughout the vice-presidential selection process. And he cut ads for her when she was running for attorney general, when she was running for the Senate in California. But look, the bottom line is this moment tonight, he's only four years older than her. This is a passing of the torch in a different way. There's been an interlude with Donald Trump, with Joe Biden, but this is a moment where -- to Peter's point, he is going to make the case for her. A senior adviser says that this speech is going to be sort of a roadmap for Democrats what they need to do. And watching Hillary Clinton last night, the 2016 campaign hangs over this in so many ways. A, the division among Democrats at that convention, there was still a deep divide among Bernie Sanders and that include Democrats, that does not exist. Bernie Sanders exhibit a being on this podium tonight, and also the need to campaign, whereas Vice President Harris tonight in Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton did not go to Wisconsin the entire general election campaign. So, I think all those lessons of that loss still hang over this party in ways that nothing else does. It guides all the strategy. It guides every decision making in terms of ads and message. So, that's what is different from eight years ago.",

And you know, Clinton would always wear, as she did last night, suffragette white, tying her candidacy all the way back to the effort to get women the right to vote 100 years ago.And she is putting Harris in that line of history and saying, this is the step forward. This is the future. Let's do this. It was extremely well received in the room. All the way through, people were standing, and in some ways, I think there was an effort to exercise the ghosts of 2016. The other thing is, we were talking about Vice President Harris. Every speech says, I'm the underdog. We are the underdogs. We have to work for this. I was talking to Robby Mook, who was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. And he said one of the big mistakes they made was not letting on how worried they were about losing.
