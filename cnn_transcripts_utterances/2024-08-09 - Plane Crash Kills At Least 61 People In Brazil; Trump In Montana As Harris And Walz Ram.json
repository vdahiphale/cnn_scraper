Donald Trump about to hold a rally in solid red Montana as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make a play for battleground Arizona.

But those were the voters who are moving away from Biden in the biggest numbers from 2020 to 2024. So, you had this surprising situation where Biden was at a stronger hand in the older, whiter Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, then again in the southwest.For Harris, the equation is pretty much to go back to the drawing board of 2020, try to maintain the level of support that Democrats had among Latino voters then, which was down from 2016, but still enough to win and continue Biden's inroads into the white collar suburbs. He was the first Democratic candidate to win Maricopa County, which is centered on Phoenix, since Harry Truman in 1948. And doing that while avoiding further erosion from them, what Democrats saw in 2020 among Latino voters, is what would allow her to get over the top.",

First of all is because the Harris-Walz campaign is coming out strong on the offense, on border security and immigration. They already have a couple of ads out that underscore what Kamala Harris has done throughout her career as a prosecutor, as attorney general in California, and as senator, and as vice president, to push budgets that actually focus on strong and smart border security.They're also pointing to the complete hypocrisy of Republicans who are supposedly so worried about border security, but that falls flat because Donald Trump himself told his most conservative Republicans who had negotiated a very strong border security bill with Democrats to say no to it because he needed to weaponize the issue during the election. So, they have nowhere to go on this. Meanwhile, Democrats have been the ones who always have known what the solution is. The solution is strong, smart border security along with a common sense, balanced approach that opens up legal pathways, especially for the long settled immigrants that have been here for years, like DREAMERs who have contributed trillions of dollars to our economy. So, that reality, I think, is what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are going to focus on. They're going to go on offense on this, and I don't think the Republicans are going to be able to fight against that, especially with the lies that they're going to tell about her.",

The idea that we would have sanctuary cities all across the country, I can tell you many Americans living in suburban cities, living in urban cities do not want that.I think my Democratic friends oftentimes forget that immigration is not a right guaranteed by the United States Constitution. It's a privilege that we grant when it's in our interest. You know who stated that? Barbara Jordan, a Democrat back in the early 90s when she chaired the Immigration Committee for former President Bill Clinton. That's when Democrats once upon a time believed in having tough immigration reform. So, I don't think Republicans' message on this particular issue will fall flat at all.",

Because here's the thing, Latino voters, even since 2020, they have grown by more than 5 million voters. Latino voters are overall younger than the mainstream population. They have been so excited and energized and mobilized and inspired by the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket that I think that Kamala Harris has a tremendous potential to not just get what Joe Biden had in 2020, but to increase that support among Latino voters, especially among Latina voters, who, to the point that we were making earlier that Ron Brownstein just made about the choice issue, is huge among Latino voters.And when you have a contrast with the Trump-Vance campaign, who the only thing that they talk about when they're in front of Latinos are that they are rapists, that they're coming here to commit crimes, that they are coming here because countries in Latin America let out their mental institutions. Let's remember what he said at the very beginning of his first campaign, that they were rapists and criminals. And so you have a campaign that understands what immigration has meant to this country, the trillions of dollars it has brought to this country, the hard work that immigrants bring to this country. And you have a campaign that has promised through Project 2025 to instill mass deportation camps around the country. And that is a contrast that wins, not just with Latino voters but with those moderate suburban voters who were so disgusted when they saw babies ripped from the arms of their mother during Donald Trump's deportation issues during his first four years, and he's just going to do it again.",

Now, Wolf, I will tell you, there's a lot of bad blood between these two teams, so it's not surprising that they really weren't able to find any areas of commonality, but what was really surprising, the prosecutors said they weren't sure how to proceed and they were going to ask for more time. And the reason that's so surprising is because prosecutors are the ones who have been pushing to bring this case to trial before the November election. So, the fact that they've now asked and been given several more weeks, that is really surprising here because they have said that they're going to go and consult with other experts inside the Justice Department about exactly how the Supreme Court case is going to change the criminal case they brought against former President Trump, because, as you may remember, the justices said, you can't charge a former president with anything related to official acts, but they also said you can't charge him for unofficial activity and use official acts as evidence.

We want to warn you. You may find it disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is a rare look inside Israel's notorious Sde Teiman detention facility. In CCTV footage obtained by Israel's Channel 12 News, masked Israeli soldiers select one of more than two dozen Palestinian detainees lying on the ground and take him away. Behind a wall of shields obstructing the view of security cameras, the soldiers allegedly sodomized the detainee. Their victim was taken to a hospital in life-threatening condition with injuries to his rectum and upper body, according to Physicians for Human Rights Israel. Weeks after the early July incident, military police detains nine soldiers on suspicion of aggravated sodomy, abuse and other misconduct, four have been released. But a military court extended the detention of five others, saying and there is reasonable suspicion they abuse the detainee. It marks an extraordinarily rare pursuit of accountability at the Sde Teiman facility. For months now, there have been allegations of torture, of abuse of these Palestinian detainees, but this is the first its time that Israeli soldiers have actually been detained and are now set to be tried for these allegations.",
