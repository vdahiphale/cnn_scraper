If we can leverage it to defeat Hamas, and the prime minister has already said that anyone who notifies and brings in a hostage will have immunity, if that is able to be moved forward, then that last remaining group can raise their hands, raise the white flag, and carry out three things, stop shelling Israel, returning our hostages and disbanding.

He's erratic. He's not up to the task. The messaging is almost just a, you know, a mirror image of what Republicans were saying. The challenge for the Harris campaign is, voters have, by and large, over - almost overwhelmingly made up their minds on Donald Trump. And so if he makes a crude joke at a Catholic dinner - I'm Catholic by the way - they factored that in. They know that's Donald Trump, who he is. They know that's what he's going to do. They still want to hear from Kamala Harris, what are you going to do as president?
