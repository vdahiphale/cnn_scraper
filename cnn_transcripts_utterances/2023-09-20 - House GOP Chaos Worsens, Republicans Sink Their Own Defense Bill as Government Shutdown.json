In fact, there were really two issues with procedures yesterday, that defense bill that went down on the floor of the House of Representatives, exceedingly rare, but they also had to make a decision from leadership yesterday to pull a vote on a procedural measure on the floor to advance the short-term spending bill. And that is where we stand today.That is where Republicans are still engaged in around-the-clock conversations trying to find a way forward, and there was a marathon meeting all day yesterday in the office of Republican whip, Tom Emmer, one of the Republicans who was in that meeting, Kelly Armstrong told our colleague, that it was really more of a therapy session, as members were able to sort of get a lot off their chest, have a conversation about what they might need to do to move forward as one united Republican front. But it's not clear they're ever going to get there, and, in part, it's because you have a number of hard liners, who are not only opposed to moving forward with this negotiated one-month Republican stop-gap spending measure, you also have a number of conservatives who are starting to make clear they may never get to yes on any short-term spending bill. And that is a problem for Kevin McCarthy because he has such a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. And if you zoom out a little bit and think about the bigger picture, we are still focusing on if Republicans can come together in one side of the Capitol. There is still no negotiation that is happening to avoid a government shutdown, even for a month, between Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and Democratic leaders in the Senate. And that is the negotiation that will ultimately matter if we are going to be avoiding a shutdown. So, a lot of unanswered questions right now as Republicans are hoping to find a way forward.

And I, again, state that there is a fabrication of the truth.And it is unfortunately that in this day and time that the police officers of this country, many of them, the first thing they say is that someone attacked them or they thrust at them or they made some type of inappropriate gesture. I met with the city attorney yesterday. I started going through all of the video footage. My client, not at one time, attempted to assault in any fashion the Birmingham Police Department and it's an ultimate fabrication. And also there's footage, and I think that has now been sent to you all that some of the officers that are Birmingham Police officers that were there were amazed at the fact that my client was even tased. They were totally stunned and they thought that it was totally inappropriate, the actions of the Birmingham Police Department. And regardless of how this may have started, there is nothing that happened that would have warranted my client being tased multiple times even while on the ground like some total criminal at that point in front of 145 students at Minor High School. Those kids were traumatized. They have been, I think, distraught over this situation. This is an embarrassment to law enforcement. We have never witnessed this that I can ever recall in this country that an educator would be tased in front of students by law enforcement is unacceptable. It is excessive. And not only that, we are going to be seeking also the information as to who cut the lights off at the school, as well as who the other security was in attendance.

They believe this was a drug trafficking ring that was being run out of this daycare, perhaps this daycare used as some kind of front to hide what was going on there. And pretty significant in the sense that what they found there after this one-year-old who died, they believe, because of an opiate overdose, fentanyl that was in this daycare center, somehow came into contact with the one-year-old and three other kids.And if it wasn't for the quick actions by emergency responders, using Narcan to save the lives of these other three kids, we could perhaps be talking about a worst-case scenario. So, now, the feds are involved. They have charged the two individuals, the day care owner, Grei Mendez, who's 41, and another individual, Carlisto Brito, who was living inside this location, with conspiracy to deliver narcotics and possession with intent to distribute narcotics. But the investigation is not over. In fact, the NYPD said they're going even further to see if this was some kind of global drug trafficking network out of the Dominican Republic. They're looking for the daycare center's, the owner, her husband, who fled the scene. She called him, text messaged him in the moments after all of this happened. Even before she called 911, she's texting and calling her husband. He comes to the location, as police are arriving, and removes items filled inside a bag. They don't know what exactly it is, but, obviously, investigators believe it has to do with drug paraphernalia, other items that they found at the home. So, now, they need to figure out exactly was this part of some kind of bigger network, the three other children who were injured are doing okay. But if it wasn't for, really, the quick action of those emergency responders who had to use this nasal spray, right, this Narcan, who would think that kids would need to be treated in such a way? And just to follow-up, I mean, we're talking about a kilo of fentanyl, which the DEA and others say, can kill up to 500,000 people. I mean, this is enough drugs that you can sell to 500,000 people.
