The Kansas City Star is now reporting that Ralph Yarl is out of the hospital and recovering at home. The teen was shot on Thursday after police say he went to the wrong house to pick up his younger brothers. A witness said that Yarl was \"very alert,\" but was bleeding from the left side of his head and his right arm while waiting for the ambulance.Authorities say the homeowner who CNN has just learned is a white man in his '80s actually shot the team twice. Police released the shooter after only two hours in custody without charging him. That move sparking outrage across the city with protesters marching over the weekend, demanding justice. CNN's Camila Bernal has been tracking all of these developments. Camila, bring us up to speed. What's the latest?",

But you have to keep in mind here, there is a long road ahead, especially when you consider the mental and the emotional toll and recovery and how long that's all going to take. This all happened on April 13th and Ralph was supposed to be picking up his two brothers and he was given an address. He was told to go to 115 Terrace and he actually showed up to 115 Street. It is a simple mistake, but once he went to the wrong house, he was shot as you mentioned twice. He was just a block away from where his brothers were and it was a neighbor who called authorities.   That neighbor - one of those neighbors, at least, that we talked to, that CNN talked to was told to stay inside the house. Eventually she came out and tried to help him. She described him as a very strong teenager and the family now very focused on his health, but also asking a lot of questions. A lot of people are raising the question here as to race and what factor did it play in all of this. There are very different views here and I want you to listen to the Kansas City Chief of Police in what she says about race, but also what Benjamin Crump, one of the family's attorneys is saying about race and the role that race played in this incident, here they are.

Here's what we know that it was 10:34 on Saturday night at this Sweet 16 birthday party here, near the main drag here in Dadeville.

That's why Dominion thinks it has a good shot to win this case to prove actual malice. But, of course, we'll see if this trial actually happens. We'll have to come back tomorrow.
