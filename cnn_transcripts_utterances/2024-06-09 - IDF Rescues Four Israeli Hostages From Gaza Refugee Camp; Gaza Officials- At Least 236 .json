And so, many of the people who were killed yesterday in Nuseirat were, in fact, coming from that area.Now, we've just received the latest numbers from the Gaza ministry of health who say that yesterday's death toll from that Israeli operation was 274 with 698 wounded. That brings the death toll since the 7th of October -- in October -- in Gaza, according to the ministry of health there, to 37,084. Now, yesterday, the scenes in the hospital, were absolute pandemonium. Lots of wounded women and children. The morgues were full. They ended up having to put the dead simply on the pavement outside. We did speak to one doctor at one of those hospitals in central Gaza who told us that yesterday was the worst day of his entire professional career, which is something given what people in Gaza have seen over the last eight months. So, there is anger in Gaza and there is a feeling that certainly, once again, this shows just the completely different worlds Israelis and Gazans live in.

Welcome to you both, gentlemen.Colonel, let's start with you, and I'm struck by a couple of things. The first thing that Hamas was holding these hostages inside of a refugee camp. The second, the high number of civilian casualties, though those numbers we cannot verify here at CNN, but over 200 is the word from Gaza officials. Israeli officials have the number at about half. Could this operation have been successful without this number, this high number of civilian casualties? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Amara, good morning. It depends on a variety of different factors. But generally speaking, by initial impression is that yes, it could have been successful with far fewer civilian casualties. I think one of the problems that the Israelis had was that it appears that the hostages were actually held in private homes, at least for part of the time during which they were being held captive, and that presents some other difficult problems when you're going into -- conduct a hostage rescue operation. So, that might have exacerbated this civilian count. Plus, of course, there was a lot of firepower the Israelis were using, and that should have probably been a lot -- a lot less to achieve the same end.",

And, you know, Benny Gantz is also -- you know, basically, I think, quite rightly said Netanyahu needs to have a plan for the day after in Gaza that goes beyond just saying we don't really have a plan. I also want to return to what kind of Leighton was saying. Look, if this -- if this was a U.S. special operations raid there's -- you know, think about the Osama bin Laden raid. The Obama administration debated at what to do for literally months. And one of their big considerations was dropping -- a bomb on the compound would kill a lot of people in the city, in Abbottabad. Think about -- also the Trump administration also debated for many, many weeks about killing the leader of ISIS in 2019 in Syria. Also, with the issue of civilian casualties. And I don't -- Colonel Leighton can correct me. I don't think there's a universe where the U.S. special operations would have approved this raid with this level of casualties, whether it's 100, as the Israeli say, or 270 as we've just learned from Ben Wedeman. Clearly, it's an unacceptably large number of casualties. You know, it's great that the hostages were returned but I don't see a world in which this -- which the U.S. special operations community would have gone forward with its raid, knowing having this level of potential number of casualties.",

What changes on the ground include -- especially the dynamics when Blinken lands? BERGENThere's no other deal that is on the table. That is the Israeli deal, by the way, Biden announced it, that it's the Israeli deal. And it's pretty close to the deal that Hamas was looking for just a few weeks ago. So, that is the deal.

Let's talk about this testimony because it was very emotional and could be critical here. How effective do you think Naomi Biden's testimony was? She is Hunter Biden's eldest daughter and she testified that her father seemed good around the time in 2018 when this is all happening, probably the best you'd seen him since her Uncle Beau died in 2015.

And they said they never would have filed a case like this when you didn't have, as you just said, someone who was a felon at the time that the gun was purchased or someone, you know, who did not commit a felony or even use the gun as in the case of Hunter Biden.So, this is very unusual. Prosecution cases like this aren't typically filed and particularly in this jurisdiction. And you know, there is something called jury nullification, Victor, where jury decides that this law is unjust or this prosecution is unjust. So, we may see that happen in this case.

      "sentences": "Well, she has played on international teams as a younger play player so she certainly has international experience, not Olympics of course. But Caitlin Clark has taken the nation by storm. This isn't just a story of a basketball player obviously. Everyone who's watching us knows her name, arguably the most popular athlete in the country male or female right now. Obviously, people can argue about that as they can argue about anything with Caitlin Clark. But she has just been a terrific role model and a huge name in the sport, and as you mentioned, the attendance, the TV ratings, records in the NCAA, records in the WNBA.And my point that I make in that column in USA Today is simply this. Whatever you think about her, guaranteed if she's on the Olympic Team, she will bring eyeballs. And I've covered -- I started in kindergarten, but I started -- covered the Olympics for 40 years and -- since '84 in L.A. I've covered, reported on the Women's Basketball Team every Olympics in some way or other. And I've covered at least five of gold medal matches of the women's team, Amara. And the Press Tribune is basically tumbleweeds. I'll be there, a couple of other reporters, and what the problem is, is this team is too good for their own good according to many of my male sports writer colleagues who don't want to cover them. And this has been happening throughout the decades. They just do not get the attention they deserve. They are great players but they win all the time. They last lost in 1992. The most dominant team in the world is the women's basketball team from the U.S.",

And she -- I was at the game the other day in Washington, that one that you mentioned that first time in seven -- the biggest crowd in 17 years in the WNBA. She had seven three-pointers electrifying the crowd. It's extraordinary. It's magic. It's like the highwire act at the circus. I'm not saying other players aren't great, but what she brings to the table is grandma, you know, and grandpa in the produce section, you know, who don't watch sports, they'll tune in for her. But you asked about merit, and I went through the statistics, they're in that column. And in several categories, Caitlin Clark is ahead of Diana Taurasi.We can go apples and oranges, we can go category by category, but it is not -- the notion that it would be some kind of gift or P.R. play, that is a huge piece of the conversation. Caitlin Clark is good. And I think over the last couple weeks in the WNBA there's been this this idea that she's not playing well. She's playing really well. She is getting statistically the toughest defense of any player in the WNBA, any player. So, I would make the case she's the most important and focused on player in the WNBA at 22 in her first month. She was the Rookie of the Month. She is leading or close to the lead in several statistical categories, fourth in assists, second and three-pointers made. Again, better than Taurasi, better than a couple of other women who are going to be on the team. So, that argument about merit, you have to really push that aside because on merit, you can make the case she deserves to be on the team.",
