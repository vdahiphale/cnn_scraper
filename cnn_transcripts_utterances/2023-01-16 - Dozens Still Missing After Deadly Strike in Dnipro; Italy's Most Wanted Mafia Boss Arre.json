      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I am Christina Macfarlane in for Isa Soares. Tonight, dozensare still missing after Russia strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, we are live with the latest on what is now one of the single deadliest attacks of the war. Then Italy's most wanted mafia boss is arrested in Sicily after 30 years on the run. We'll have the reaction to his arrest. Plus, three people are still missing after Sunday's deadly plane crash in Nepal. Why hope for their survival is fading fast. We begin with the grueling search operation in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro where a Russian missile plowed into an apartment building on Saturday. At least, 40 people died, dozens are still missing, as rescue missions continue, hope of finding survivors is fading. It's one of the single deadliest Russian assault on civilians in its war on Ukraine and the deadliest in months. The Kremlin claims the missile was fired by Ukrainian air defense forces, but offered no evidence to back that up. Ukraine security service says they will identify -- they identified the wreckage of ammunition as a Russian cruise missile. Fred Pleitgen shows the devastation it left behind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The morning brings to light the full extent of the destruction. The residential building home to dozens of families annihilated down to the foundation. Even though rescue crews still work, the chances of finding survivors now virtually zero. All night, residents watched in fear, anger and grief. Olha Nivinchanaya(ph) says she passed by the building only about half an hour before it was hit. \"There are many friends and people close to me here. Many\", she says. Elena Loyan(ph) stunned by the scale of the destruction, curses the Russians. \"I simply hate them. Children, people die here\", and then she can't speak anymore. Throughout the night, the death toll continued to jump. On top of the many killed, Ukrainian authorities say dozens were injured, many of them children. In just this location in Dnipro, one of many sites in Ukraine Russia targeted with barrages of missiles this weekend. (on camera):  The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage here is so extensive is that, this building was hit with a cruise missile called the KH22, that's designed to destroy aircraft carrier strike groups, and obviously, when it hit the building, it completely annihilated it, burying dozens of people underneath. (voice-over):  The Ukrainians called the attack state terrorism, and the president says rescuers will continue to try and save anyone trapped here. \"Let's fight for every person\", President Zelenskyy says. \"The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save a life.\" But even the slightest hope has now all, but died, and this is essentially a recovery operation. The crews searching for bodies where so many lives were violently ended in an instant. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And of course, that's something the Russians have been doing, that is -- since the beginning of this war. They've been -- even though Belarus is not actually a combatant and official, combatant in the war, the Russians have used their territory to launch ground attacks and air attacks, as well. So, the concern is that, with a concentration of Russian air power and missile power, there, that there could be additional strikes.

But certainly, the legal, the political morass for President Biden is growing. And what's interesting, when you talked to White House officials on Friday, they did express, you know, some muted relief that at least, the drip of these additional documents had stopped for the moment. But then on Saturday, of course, it kept dripping when the White House said that they did find those additional five documents at the president's home in Wilmington, Delaware. We did get that lengthy statement from the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer sort of laying out the timeline of when he and his associates found these documents at those three separate locations. And sort of laying out his rationale for why he hasn't   been as transparent as some people have urged the White House to be, saying that everything that they said could potentially jeopardize the investigation that's ongoing at the special counsel's office. Any sort of disclosure of witnesses and events could hamper that work that's ongoing there. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from coming out, criticizing this White House very harshly and demanding more information. We heard the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee James Comer, he did ask for those logs of the president's home in Wilmington, Delaware. Just to give you a sense. The White House does maintain visitor-logs for the White House itself, for people who are coming and going to the executive mansion. But President Biden goes home to Wilmington almost every weekend, so it is very much, as much a workplace as the White House. But what we heard from the Secret Service is that they don't maintain these independent visitor logs. The White House counsel office says that they don't maintain them either because that is considered his personal residence. So this is all growing into a very significant legal and political problem for the president. But the strategy right now is business as usual, we did see the president earlier today speaking at that Martin Luther King Day event. He does also have events throughout this week. What he has said over the past week or so is that he does wish he was able to say more. For now, that doesn't seem to be in the offing, as the White House puts the tamp down on any kind of information about this as this special counsel continues his work.",

Well, let's get to CNN's Richard Quest who is live for us in Davos this hour. Richard, nice to see a bit of snow dusting behind you this year. No doubt climate change is going to be on the agenda this year. But how much is, you know, the focus really going to be on a global recession, you know, as the world seems to be teetering on the edge of one here? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: CORRESPONDENT: I think that the focus will not be on whether there will be or won't be a global recession. That's the sort of thing that just, you know, we'll only know about afterwards. And anyway, even if it's not a formal recession, most of the countries will grow very slowly, and it will feel like a recession. I think the issue here is how to handle it, how to deal with the consequences. And by that, we're talking of poverty, food hunger, starvation in some parts of the world. We're talking about access to medical care, education. And the one thing that Davos has grown on, if you will, is dealing with all these other issues. There are many, many, many more people from civil society, NGOs, charities, you name it, who are all concerned with the effects of it, rather than the recession itself. This year, I do not see economics as being the big talking point at Davos.",

There's no reason to come here. The fact is, back in May, when they had the spring, Davos, there was a real reason. And they came because Ukraine, the war was relatively new, and the recession was likely in the future and interest rates were just starting to go up. Now we've got the war, God forbid it's a year's length, we've got interest rates probably peeking out. And now the medicine just has to work. We have a load of issues with China reopening, but -- the COVID situation, but there's no imperative for all these leaders to come together, especially when you've probably got a G7 around the corner.",
