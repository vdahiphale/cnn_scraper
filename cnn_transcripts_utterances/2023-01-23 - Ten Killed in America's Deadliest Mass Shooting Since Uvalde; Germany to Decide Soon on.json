Was it purchased? Was it legally purchased and then altered? So, there are a lot of questions about the weapon itself. And then this narrative, Don. We've been talking about The New York Times interviewed a man named Brandon Tsay.

It was quite interesting because yesterday, the German foreign minister came out and said, look, if, for instance, Poland, which has been pushing Germany very hard, wants to send these German-made battle tanks, which Poland also owns, to Ukraine, the Germans wouldn't stand in the way.Now, it's not clear whether or not the German foreign minister got ahead of herself a little bit, because today, the Germans came out and said they haven't even received an official request from the Poles yet to send those main battle tanks. Meanwhile, Poland has been ripping into the Germans, saying that they want to create their own coalition of European countries to send those tanks and then wouldn't even ask the Germans for permission if they were to send those main battle tanks, which is usually not in line with the way these things are done. One of the things we do have to mentioned is that the Poles so far have sent a lot less modern material to Ukraine than the Germans have. The Germans have sent multiple rocket-launching systems, very capable air defense systems and are now going to send infantry fighting vehicles as well. But the main battle tanks are literally the main issue at this point in time. The Germans say they want the U.S. to also send Abrams tanks if the Germans are going to send the tanks that they make. Of course, we know that the U.S. is not there yet or says it won't send Abrams. I spoke to a Ukrainian official. And he said the Ukrainians need about 300 to 400 modern western tanks to really turn the tide here on the battlefield, Kaitlan.",

That's something that's general practice. For instance, if a company buys Abrams tanks to the U.S., they couldn't just export them to Ukraine either.The Germans have various problems with that. First of all, they fear that it could escalate the situation in Ukraine, that the Russians could retaliate against Germany as well, even though we heard from the Kremlin, as you correctly pointed out earlier, that they said it would be the Ukrainians that who would bear the brunt of their retaliation. But that's something that the Russians have said with pretty much every new weapon systems that was delivered to Ukraine. They have always said there would be a massive response and a few times has there actually been a massive response from Germans. Of course, the Germans also have a big legacy in this part of the world as well, of course. They invaded this place, Nazi Germany did, in the 1940s. And that certainly is something that still weighs very heavily with them. One of the things that the Germans really don't want is the optics of a German tank rolling over a Russian position in Eastern Europe, Kaitlan.",

But throughout the Santos campaign, Stefanik was a significant reporter. And we talked to several people who donated to Santos' campaign, including one man who gave tens of thousands of dollars who paid Stefanik -- said Stefanik's support influenced them to donate. And Stefanik endorsed Santos early on his campaign, we should note, more than a year before the election. Her tweet included a link to a fundraising page that would benefit both her and Santos. And then she later tweeted that a lunch event raised over $100,000 to help George flip New York District 3. One donor who was at that lunch told CNN the only reason they donated was because of Stefanik. And Santos understood the power of Stefanik's endorsement as well. He used a photo of the two of them, as you see right here, as the banner image for his Twitter page up until last week. Republican consultants said they first heard of Santos' issues the summer of 2022, but it's unclear how so many pros in the political arena let Santos slip through the cracks. Of course, we also know Republicans really needed that district. Kevin McCarthy did for one to get the vote to be speaker.

The justices have also started new security protocols for how they handle drafts and deliberations as they try to come up with a ruling that has at least five votes on it.
