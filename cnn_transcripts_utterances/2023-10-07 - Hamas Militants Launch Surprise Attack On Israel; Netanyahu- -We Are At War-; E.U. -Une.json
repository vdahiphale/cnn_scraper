The militant group launched an unprecedented early morning attack on Israel, firing at least 5,000 rockets. Israel says at least 300 Israelis are dead, more than 1,500 wounded. But this was not just a series of rocket attacks. The terror group overran border crossings, invaded by sea, taking over Israeli communities in the south; they came in by air as well. We do have to warn you, many of these scenes are truly graphic, unlike anything I have seen. And I have covered so many wars in this region and elsewhere. Video obtained by CNN shows what appear to be dead civilians, gunned down in their cars, on the road, near the border with Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCIUTTO (voice-over): Hamas also claims it has taken Israeli soldiers and civilians hostage. Many of them -- and you see the video there of a young woman, forced into a truck at gunpoint. This video was posted online; it was geolocated by CNN. It shows that Israeli woman captured, taken into Gaza. As he mentioned, Israel is now retaliated with strikes -- look at that, taking down what I believe is the second tallest building in Gaza earlier today via airstrike. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 232 people have been killed in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And their correspondent was just standing on a street in Beeri in southern Israel, while you could hear active gunshots and explosions going on behind him. And he was saying that these were near the police headquarters of the town, where there had been gunfights going on for hours. In fact, the diplomatic correspondent for Ha'aretz, he is a journalist, a well-known journalist, he reported that he had spent 10 hours trapped, essentially, in his home, in his bomb shelter, with his children, while militants continued to be active in his town. In terms of also though, the Israeli military response, it is not just focused on those towns but they are responding now to Gaza. Now they have a very, very complicated situation because they want to have an aggressive response in Gaza. They have already actually sent out a message to civilians in Gaza, warning them to evacuate certain areas, saying, if you are a civilian in Gaza, get out of these areas, go to these safer areas, because we are going to be targeting this soon. But now, I'm told a number of Israeli civilians and soldiers taken prisoner of war within Gaza. And so Israel will have a very complicated task there, to have a very strong response, targeting these militants. Right now, as far as we can tell, it is just from the air and from the sides. There is no ground invasion yet. But a question of, how do you handle going after these militants, going after Hamas, without also somehow the collateral damage of your own citizens?",

Can you just place into context, for folks watching right now, how the scale of this, the brutality is truly unprecedented? AVI MAYER, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"JERUSALEM POST\": Absolutely, Jim. You know, when you look at what is happening in Israel today, you have to understand that Israel is a country of under 10 million people; 100 potential abductees or 300 Israelis killed are the equivalent of 9,000 Americans. That's three 9/11s. That's what we're talking about here in terms of scale. This country has been devastated and it is in a state of shock. You have Israelis who don't know whether their loved ones are dead or missing, who haven't heard from them since this morning. There is total confusion in southern Israel.

This is a terrifying scenario for so many Israeli families. You have to remember that, back in the early 2000s, there was a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was taken captive by Hamas.

But I ask that we all be resolute in pushing for peace; by the way, also for Palestinians. I'm horrified by what is almost certain to ensue; women, children; the innocents will be collateral damage in something that, of course, Israel -- Israel has to protect its citizens. Just as the United States of America would have to if missiles were raining on us from Canada or from Mexico. That is the sad truth. But we have got to end this as quickly as we can and pursue peace.

So right, now the House literally cannot do anything. I want to point out to everybody, though, there is an analogy here. The dysfunction in the United States Congress is going to be consequential. The world is paying attention. Some of the challenges in Israel, in recent months, I think, perhaps opened a door to what occurred in the last 24 hours. I think there are some that are taking advantage of what they consider to be perhaps some temporary weakens. We are exhibiting the same thing. And I would then ask and encourage and invite all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to ensure that we put the country first and end this nonsense of shutdowns, of vacations of speakers. And I hope my GOP colleagues and friends, on Tuesday, when we reconvene in the United States Congress, will choose a speaker expeditiously and, most importantly, ensure somebody of principle and character, that keeps our national interests in mind first and then takes care of our friends and allies, to whom we owe a great deal around the world.

Oftentimes, we will hear it fire a heavy machine (INAUDIBLE) -- machine supported (INAUDIBLE) on the ground here. There are heavy explosions coming from the direct (INAUDIBLE) Gaza fighter jets as well in the air. Israeli Defense Forces say they have been targeting Gaza. But over the past perhaps half an hour, 45 minutes, we've witnessed right here, above our heads, the Iron Dome defense system, taking down missiles being fired out of Gaza. Literally the explosions have been taking place right above our heads here.

That helicopter I was telling you I could hear, I heard it firing its heavy machine gunfire, heavy machine gun. It seems to be happening in the area of Sderot.

One of those that we were reporting earlier this evening, one kibbutz that has now been fully taken control of by Israeli Defense Forces, the Hamas militants neutralized, according to Israeli Defense Forces.

That is something that makes it really difficult, from an urban combat perspective, to actually precisely target these kinds of areas, especially if they are going into an area with the idea of figuratively decapitating the Hamas leadership. That is going to be a problem, because the Hamas leadership is very much a leadership that parks itself in the middle of a civilian population. That, I think, is what we are going to be dealing with here. This could be a very, very difficult thing here. There are certainly possibilities that this could be defused.
