It made landfall early Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of over 200 kilometers per hour.A high end category three hurricane, the most powerful storm to batter the region in at least 125 years. Idalia is now heading northeast along the Carolina coast, bringing heavy rain, floods, and a new threat of tornadoes. The national weather services reported a weak tornado touched down in Goose Creek, South Carolina, tossing this car into the air and causing minor injuries but no other damage. But in the neighboring state of Georgia, police report a falling tree instantly killed one man. At least one person died in weather related car accidents in Florida, and insured property losses in the state estimated at more than $9 million. Emergency crews have already searched about 75 percent of the storm zone. Residents are asked to remain indoors and avoid downed power lines. Hundreds of thousands of people across the Southeastern U.S. are without electricity, right now. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis says most schools and hospitals shuttered by the storm will reopen in the coming hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just 24 hours ago this was looming right around the Big Bend area, Florida.And the path of destruction that Idalia has taken has been broad and wide and very intense, with numerous people reportedly without power all the way from Florida into South Carolina. South Carolina and North Carolina right now are bearing the brunt of Idalia. 60 mile per hour winds are about 100 kilometers per hour and racing off towards the northeast but, as you can see, there is a lot of deep convection associated with what is left of our tropical storm now. What we anticipate is that it will begin to exit that central coast of South Carolina, but that convection is so broad that it impacts this broad area from the Piedmont to the Low Country region. For the Low Country, because it is so low, we are seeing significant flooding because it is just ringing itself out along these coastal areas. Well, there are tornado watches out for some of these coastal regions. It looks like South Carolina now is excluded from that, but into North Carolina the probability of some of those outer bands moving on shore and firing up a tornado certainly exists. Now, most of these tornadoes would be on the weak side, but that does not mean they are not capable of producing some damage. Alright, so here is the wet weather right now. With a couple of these thunderstorms producing quite a bit of lightning. If you live in that Wilmington area or the outer banks, it is going to be a pretty rough couple hours with very heavy downpours and an additional four to six inches of rainfall likely, really filling up those rivers and streams. Right now around Etta Stone, Savannah, and Charleston, the rain is not quite over yet, but Charleston recorded its fifth highest tide there. The highest being during hurricane Hugo during 1989, terrible. But there you can see a closer look, right around Kingstree into Myrtle Beach, Conway, Florence and Wilmington, that is where we are seeing the heaviest precipitation now. [00:05:05:] So, prepare for the potential for more continued flooding as well as additional power outages and the possibility of an isolated tornado. John, back to you.",

How crucial could this moment be for the Ukrainians? Is this the moment when maybe that counter offensive, in the south at least, starts gaining momentum? And how dependent upon is that on the Ukrainians being able to hold off the Russians in the east? Are they stretched too thin at the moment? COLLINS: I mean, first of all, attacking a prepared defense, and as prepared as that defense is in the south and the east, right, that is an extremely challenging operation. Probably the only two things harder is riding an amphibious assault or a river crossing against contested territory. These are very complex operations that involve synchronizing all of the assets, right? Armor, engineers, artillery. And so it is a very challenging operation. I think there were unrealistic expectations based off of what Ukraine was able to do last fall, and some people expected Ukraine to repeat that with this counteroffensive, which was just not realistic. And so, that is where they are at right now. Ukraine did lose a lot of good fighters over the last year, and so did Russia. But it makes it that much harder to conduct this really hard, breaching all of these obstacles. And so, they are related, they have to have some success in the east to really hold down Russian forces and Russian assets there so that they can then get a penetration in the south. That is really what we are seeing play out now, and the question is, will they be able to achieve that penetration where they can really make some kind of success, or is it going to stall out and they are going to have to wait and try again next year?",

Most of them, former French colonies, but each of them a different cocktail of power plays and discontent. In Gabon, the citizens have lived under a dynastic regime for more than 50 years. Omar Bongo ruled for more than four decades. Much of that time spent in France, a critical ally. The elder Bongo members of his family and confidants were accused of eye watering corruption. Often linked to OPEC Member, Gabon's significant oil wealth. Ali Bongo took over from his father in 2009. He has been praised for conserving Gabon's vast forests and taking innovative steps to develop carbon credits to combat climate change. [00:30:09] But he's faced growing discontent from many, with violence breaking out after disputed polls in 2016 and an attempted coup three years later. But these scenes have wider consequences. Many fear that Gabon is not the last domino to fall. African Union and international actors have failed to effectively counter recent military takeovers. And Bongo's faith and house arrest remains tenuous.",

And the reaction from the militant groups has also been harsh. It highlights the widening gap between the official Palestinian institutions and the militant groups which hold increasing sway and power, especially in the Northern part of the West Bank where this happened. Now, violence has been surging across the occupied West Bank over the past year and a half, with the Israeli government saying that the Palestinian authorities' lack of action compels the Israeli military, they say, to conduct regular raids across the West Bank to tamp down on militant activity. So what happened was that a gun battle erupted in the town of Tulkarem after Palestinian Authority security forces say that their forces entered the refugee camp there to remove what they called hazardous materials and barriers, including some that were near a school. And that they then came under fire from armed youths in the area. A local journalist told CNN that the forces entered the camp to remove unarmed IEDs that were put in place to target Israeli forces if and when they were to enter the refugee camp. Now, security forces say that they took, quote, \"necessary measures\" to control the situation. GOLD (voice-over): Now, the man killed was identified as a 22-year- old, Abdel Qader Zaqdah. His brother told CNN that he was an electrician and claimed that he was not associated with any militant groups.",
