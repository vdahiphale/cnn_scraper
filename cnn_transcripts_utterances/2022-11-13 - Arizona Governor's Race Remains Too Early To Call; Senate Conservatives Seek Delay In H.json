In Oregon's 5th Congressional District, CNN can project that Republican Lori Chavez-Deremer will beat Democrat Jamie McCloud-Skinner. Now Chavez-Deremer has 51 percent of the vote to almost 49 percent of McCloud-Skinner. McCloud-Skinner has just conceded. Now this is a pickup for Republicans. The balance of power in the House is 212 for Republicans to Democrats' 204. Now Republicans need to win six of the remaining seats to take control of the House. It's still early to call who will control the House of Representatives. And in Arizona, new vote totals were just released a short time ago. They show a tightening in one of the most watched governors' races in the country. Trump fire brand Kari Lake has cut into the lead held by Democrat Katie Hobbs. Now let's begin this hour in Arizona. CNN's Kyung Lah is at the Maricopa County election center in Phoenix, where those voting numbers were just released. All right, Kyung, what's the latest there?",

I want to start by saying the Kari Lake campaign has not really said anything to reporters. And that's an unusual pattern. Most nights, there has been confidence. They have given us an indication that they still think they're going to win. The latest that we're hearing is that they're going to wait. They're going to wait and see.We are seeing a statement that Katie Hobbs just -- she is the Democrat -- that she has just posted on Twitter, saying that they believe with this latest tabulation result, that Katie Hobbs is the unequivocal favorite to become the next governor of Arizona. That's a bit of confidence, given that these numbers are still really out there. What we saw tonight are 98,000 votes that were released by Maricopa County. This is the most populous county in the state of Arizona. The county says that they have about 85,000 to 95,000 votes left. That is -- those are votes that the Lake campaign sees as their remaining path. Those votes, they anticipate, will be in their favor. But that has not been as overwhelming in their favor as they had planned. She did manage to narrow the gap with tonight's release. It did -- it definitely favored her versus other nights. But Katie Hobbs remains in the lead. She is remaining the leader in the state by 26,000 votes. And it is so narrow, that margin, Paula, that it is going to be very difficult to see what happens tomorrow. It is still very, very early to call, too early to call, as these ballots continue to be counted here in Maricopa County -- Paula.",

The issues that mattered most to the people of the 4th Congressional District which time and time again, whether it was through polls, whether it was through talking to them, whether it was meeting neighbors, it was about things that affect their pocket, cost of living, inflation, and of course crime.

But I know that my district was a seat that Biden won by 15 points. When I first got into the race, people said I was crazy. I was coming from the town of Hempstead where I had a comfortable seat, one that I won with re-election in 2021 with 70 percent of the vote. And people were upset.

I sat in a car with people from different economic backgrounds, different religions, different color skin, certainly different political ideologies. And my life depended on them, their life depended on me. And we worked together each and every day to make a difference to protect and serve the communities that we swore to. And I'm going to bring that same mentality that I did in the police department and the same one that I had on the Hempstead town board where I worked with Democrats to put forth tax cut budgets and deliver for the nearly 800,000 residents in the town that I represent. And so, listen, Nassau County is a community and a county that Democrats outnumber Republicans by a significant margin. And there is no way that you can govern either far to the right or far to the left, and think that you're going to be reelected. I've heard from people that are Democrats, lifelong Democrats, that they feel that they've lost their party. These are the moderates. And I think we need to govern as such.

You know who wasn't able to do that was Barack Obama because Barack Obama never had those relationships in the U.S. Senate. Kind of started as a stopping off point to become president, and by the way he did a very successful job of that. But very much Joe Biden, you know, is an institutionalist. But when welook at Congress as a whole right now, and this is a very dangerous thing that's happening, is that Congress is a separate branch of government, OK? It's a separate branch of government when it comes to politics as well. And when you have a sitting president or a former president who is trying to dictate who is going to be the leader of the house Republicans or the Senate Republicans, it really starts to get really sticky there and really takes away a lot of the autonomy that these 100 senators have and the 435 members of Congress have over in the House.

And I think he's trying to get these things done and over with so that -- I hope -- so that they can start strategy and the plan for the American people because that is what was missing. I just want to make one really quick point. The election, I believe, was reflective of the 50-50 split in America. The question is, was this a 50-50 split on policy or was it party loyalty? And I believe because no one really -- not one side or the other -- I'm being fair here -- really articulated a plan for the American people. And so I think it's really -- Democrats have to be really careful that they don't take this as a mandate to do whatever they want to do. Yes, the American people have told us to do whatever they want.

Now, as a Democrat, my party ought to take only humility out of that.They're not marrying the Democrats. They're just dumping the Republicans. OK. But they're dumping them so hard they're getting a restraining order. The problem that the Republicans have is as their election liars have lost statewide, they've won in Republican primaries for the House. So \"Washington Post\" estimates that two- thirds of the entire Republican conference in the House in January, in the new House, two-thirds, will be election liars, election deniers. That's a crisis. When it's an unsaleable position with independents but it seems to be a mandatory position with your most committed base voters, it's a really tough thing for the Republicans. The Republicans have to break the fever. But believe me, the independents right now, they're done with the Republicans and the election lies.",

The balance of power in the House still hinges on a few key races, and we're staying on top of all the results and we will update you just as soon as we get them.Now joining us now is Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who just won reelection. Congressman, first of all, congratulations on your victory. As you know, the Democrats held on to the Senate and still have a chance to keep the House. Now I'm sure you'll say that you expect that they will keep the House. But if they don't, what does that mean for the party? REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Well, first of all, you know, if you look at the history the last 40 years, there's been I think three times that the president party has done well in the midterms. And it looks like this might be the fourth time we are keeping the Senate. The House, you know, this red tide or red tsunami that they've talked about didn't happen. Just a little puddle. Maybe a little ripple that we saw. So what this means is that we still have a pathway to win the House. But even if we don't win it, it's going to be a slim majority, single digits. And I can tell you, whoever the Republican is, they're no Nancy Pelosi. Nancy knows how to work the different caucus, work with the progressives, the moderates like myself, and she's able to get the job done, even though it's a slim margin. I have to say I remind people what happened with the Tea Party with John Boehner and Paul Ryan. And they just couldn't get the job done unless the Democrats came over and helped them.",
