And polls show voter interest at record highs, along with alarming levels of division and anger, as well. A new NBC News poll shows that more than 80 percent of both Republicans and Democrats believe that the other party is a threat to destroy America. High inflation and economic fears are mobilizing voters, and that's hurting Democrats, the party in power. And in recent days, Republicans have wrestled back momentum and one senator says, time is running out for Democrats to sell their economic plan to inflation-weary Americans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in Mesa, Arizona, armed men are wearing masks and tactical gear as they keep a watchful eye over a ballot drop box. Maricopa County officials are calling the men, quote, uninformed vigilantes. Those officials accuse them of disrupting the voting process, and there are also groups of so-called ballot watchers. They're recording people as they cast their votes in the drop boxes. In Georgia, which tipped the Senate to Democrats two years ago, nearly 741,000 Georgians had cast early votes in person as of yesterday morning. So, let's bring in CNN's Nadia Romero.

You can still cast your ballot. Now, the workers here told me in the first two hours of the day, they saw more than 200 people cast their ballots at this location alone. But we are talking about record voter turnout. Let's look at the statewide numbers here. So far, more than 740,000 Georgians have voted so far in this early voting process. The numbers dipped down to about 80,000 on Saturday, from 141,000, who we saw on Friday. But those are still a record-breaking number. Seeing so many people who are definitely voting and participating in the process. And we know that there are people who are concerned about election integrity, about voter fraud, especially if they believe the big lie from 2020, so we spoke with an election official about how they're working to ensure voter security.

We're going to hear what those voters had to tell me later on in the show.Well, earlier this month, a CNN KFF poll found that 90 percent of U.S. adults say the United States is experiencing a mental health crisis. Well, now there's a new way for states to get help, providing mental health and addiction services to those who need it most. Joining us now is Missouri Senator Roy Blunt, who has helped spearhead this bipartisan legislation. Senator, thanks for coming on. We're going to talk about your new mental health program in just a moment. But first, we want to talk about the midterms. So, I want to know, what we said at the beginning of the show, Republicans were trailing for a time, but they had staged a bit of a comeback here. And CNN's poll of polls, the two parties are tied. Analysts say the economy and inflation, they are driving the Republican resurgence, but Democrats argue your party has no real plan to deal with the economy. Let's listen to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  The fight is not about inflation, it's about the cost of living. And if you look at what we have done to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, to bring down the costs of energy and the rest in our legislation, you will see that it has been opposed every step of the way by the Republicans and they have no plan for lowering the cost of living or helping with inflation.

ROY BLUNT (R-MO):  Well, I think it's pretty easy to see why we have the inflation numbers we have. There's some of this worldwide, but the bad energy policies, the desire to drive energy costs up so people would use less energy, which is exactly the stated policy of our friends on the other side. And then the really bad judgment in early in the administration, on a partisan basis, to dump another $1.9 trillion on top of an economy that was clearly recovering. Now, you can go back and say, if you're them, well, the economy wasn't recovering. There's no indication that the economy wasn't well on its way to recovery. There's every indication, by Democrat and Republican economists that what they did would produce the results that were produced. And you could have all of this macroeconomic, worldwide discussion you want to have. When people go to the grocery store, they go to the gasoline pump, they know that their cost of living has gone up and they know when it happened. And I think they're going to blame Democrats for it, because Democrats are, in fact, responsible for the two biggest contributing factors to this incredible cost of living for Americans.",

Just one or two seats need to change, and suddenly your side is in charge. But the American people have reason to be concerned about the course of events. The Biden presidency is now halfway over.

You know, we did this package on the Public Safety Bill, but tried very hard to make the point that if you have a behavioral health problem, you're much more likely to be the victim of a crime then you are to be the perpetrator of a crime. But occasionally, when you don't have a mental health system that works, all of the times when you would have been able to see something step in, do what you needed to do to help, that you failed to do that.

And for many women, that decision is, you know, very sadly, on their end, but it is a decision to end the pregnancy so they can receive the optimal care.

And more than that, if you look at three of those four states, you see movement of three to four points from where we were on September 1 to where we are today. So that movement we've seen nationally does seem to be translating down to the Senate level. And if Democrats were favored in the Senate, say, at the beginning of last month, right now, at best, it's probably a toss-up. And I honestly don't know what exactly would happen as all these races are well within the margin of error.",

And you know, what we saw early on in the beginning of the summer, right as Roe v. Wade was getting overturned, Republicans had a three-point advantage. Then by July 23rd, it was a one point. Then on August 23rd, it was tied. Then Democrats actually took a one-point advantage.But the further and further we get away from Roe v. Wade getting overturned as that sort of goes in the rearview mirror, Republicans seem to be gaining back that advantage that they had early on in the summer. You can see right now the estimate is that Republicans are ahead by two points on the generic congressional ballot. And that would be more than enough in my mind based upon history for them to retake control of the House. And I think it's also the reason why as we saw in that former slide, that Republicans have been gaining in those Senate races because the national wins in all honesty, Pam, are moving in their direction. So, there are also 36 gubernatorial races and there seem to be some surprises, Harry. Let's start in some states Joe Biden easily won in 2020.",

So, you know, look at these races in these states that Joe Biden won by over 15 points or 15-plus points in 2020. Look at New York. Lee Zeldin has been polling within 10 points, some polls have him within five points of the incumbent governor, Kathy Hochul. That's a real shocker.There hasn't been a New York Republican governor since George Pataki in the early 2000s. How about in Oregon, there hasn't been a Republican-elected governor there since 1982. Yet Christine Drazan is within a dead heat of Tina Kotek, the Democratic candidate, in part because there's a former Democrat, Betsy Johnson running as an independent. I don't know what's going to happen in that race. So, New York, I think, Hochul will hold on, but the fact that it's competitive, my goodness gracious!",

His attacker is charged with attempted murder.The people who live in New York City have had it with the sharp spike in crime especially on the city subways. New York Mayor Eric Adams announced some new crime fighting initiatives this weekend. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is with us now. So, Gloria, you spoke with the mayor today and he had some tough statistics to deal with. Crime in the subway is up more than 40 percent than this time last year.

The mayor and his top administration officials holding a summit over at Gracie Mansion over the weekend to try and come together, come up with ideas, and really take on what is beginning to be on many New Yorkers' top of mind, concern that the subways are not safe.We're seeing more and more of incidents like here in this video which I want to show you where you see a straphanger that is walking along the platform then somebody comes out of seemingly nowhere and pushes that person on to the tracks. Thankfully that person was not struck by the train but they were severely injured. The police asking for help to identify the person who pushed that man on to the tracks. So, we wanted to sit down with the mayor today and really ask him about this idea he has been talking about, the reality and the perception of whether a crime here in the city has increased. Some crimes have gone down but crimes in the city's transit system continued to be of top concern. Here is what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I am one of the 3.5 million riders on the subway system and I've never been attacked. I feel unsafe because of what I see, what I read, what I hear. So now I have to address that fear.So, what are we doing? We have this large amount of omni presence of police officers, nothing dissipates violence feeling more than having a police officer, that blue uniform, they're doing actual patrol. We're going to have them on the train. And then we're going to not be passive in dealing with those who have real mental health issues on our subway system. As soon as we came in from January 6th on, we got rid of the encampments. We've got over 2,000 off our system that were living on our system that couldn't take care of themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is very complicated to get people who need help, mental health treatment, to be able to go into treatment.
