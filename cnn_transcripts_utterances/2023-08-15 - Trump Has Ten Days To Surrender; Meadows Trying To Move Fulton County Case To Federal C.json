      "sentences": "Hey, Kaitlan, thank you so much. And good evening, everyone, I'm Abby Phillip. Welcome to CNN Primetime.The clock is now ticking. Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants have just ten days now to turn themselves in after being indicted in Georgia on serious criminal charges. The former president is accused now of being the head of a criminal enterprise to overturn Joe Biden's victory in that state. And tonight, a local sheriff says that he's expected to be booked at a Fulton County jail. So, what is going on right now in Trump's world with just ten days to go until surrender? We also have news on Mark Meadows making a last ditch attempt to get the case against him in Georgia dismissed. We'll dig into all of that tonight. Plus, the 45th president of the United States now faces a stunning 91 criminal charges across four separate cases and it will be tied up in multiple courtrooms throughout this presidential cycle, all while he's running for this second term. So, what should the GOP do if their frontrunner has been now indicted four times over? We will talk to New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, one of the former president's most vocal critics in the Republican Party. And it was one of the most defining images of the civil rights movement, a 15-year-old Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, making her way through an angry mob as they integrated with that whites only high school. And now, 66 years later, there is a new battle over black history in the state of Arkansas. We'll talk to a Little Rock school board member tonight about all of that. But let's begin now with Trump and the world scrambling with just ten days to surrender to the Georgia authorities. Here with me now is CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former Federal Prosecutor Elliot Williams and former Trump Attorney Tim Parlatore. Tim, I want to start with you. You have a special insight into this, of course. We're learning tonight about what could happen in the next ten days or so, a surrender to Fulton County officials. The sheriff says he's going to have to go to a county jail, basically. What do you expect to happen if you're his attorneys? Is it something you get over with or you wait until the last second here?",

And so if they have ten days and you surrender on the first day, if you're trying to drag the case out past the election, why not take the extra ten days? If it wasn't a case where you had an election, I would take my client in today, but that's a different calculus.",

And when you read it, you realize Alvin Bragg's case needs to stay in the state court.But Fani Willis' case actually does belong in federal court because it really does deal with these two federal officials related to things that they were doing while in office. I mean, he's physically in the Oval Office as he's doing this stuff. So, I expect that that will be successful. Now, that doesn't remove Fani Willis from the case.

And I think know they're going to have some problems, especially if they get it over to federal court because RICO has an element of continuity to it, where you have an organization, an enterprise that is engaging in a series of racketeering acts as part of a continuing course of know, like a mafia family or organized crime, gangs, things like that. But here, it's all focused on a singular event, which is the election. And so I think that when you do bring it over to federal court and they start to apply some of the federal RICO standards to it, that's going to become problematic. Also, reading through the pattern of racketeering activity, I think there are ways that you can attack that really on a motion to dismiss on the structural side before you even get to the merits. And so I would want to see how much you can cut away there. You also have the issue of Fani Willis. She's a county district attorney. A lot of this stuff didn't happen in her know.

So, there's at least an argument that there was a continuing course of conduct.Look, I'm with you that it is an aggressive way to charge an individual, but I think we have in our heads that RICO, Racketeering Influence, Corrupt Organizations prosecutions are for mafia families and so on. And the way the Georgia statute is written, it's broader than the federal statute, as we've sort of talked about here. And perhaps all these things can be brought in. But all of these questions, including that removal of the federal court one, which I'm not totally in agreement with either of you on either, it may actually end up staying in Georgia state court.

That's a much bigger swath of individuals and something that I think Republicans need to take note of.This is a grand jury in a very conservative state that said this guy needs to be indicted, right? This isn't just the Department of Justice and the idea that it's all politicized. This is a grand jury in Georgia, of all states, which, again, kind of doubles down on the idea that this guy can't win in November. We might give him the nomination. I hope we don't. But this guy cannot win a state like Georgia. He cannot win a state like Arizona or New Hampshire or these swing states that you absolutely have to have. And last time I checked, you can't govern if you don't win, right? It's just going to be another sob story for Donald Trump, and he's going to crush the Republican ticket going down.

PHILLIP: One of the candidates in the race, Ron DeSantis, is saying that this indictment is helping Trump, and he may be right. If you look at some of the polling, a poll in March found that Trump and DeSantis were just about four points away, and then more recently, a New York Times/Siena poll found that Trump had a massive lead over DeSantis. It's only grown. But I wonder, do you think that that's true, that the indictments are the reason that he's winning, or is it the failure of candidates like DeSantis and others to -- but is -- or is it the failure of other candidates to launch a strong campaign against him?",

They need to show leadership, inspiration, something people can galvanize and get excited about, right? They have our interest now. They got to get us excited as the Republicans in the party.But there is no doubt that these four indictments have definitely built a lot of sympathy for the former president. He knows how to use the media to his advantage incredibly, incredibly well. I'll give him all the credit in the world on that. He knows how to take something bad, make it good, build sympathy and empathy onto himself. He plays this victim role. I mean, the guy is literally a victim, right, at this point, which is just crazy if you know his background and understand who he really is. But he's been able to play that very well. And the national -- I mean, it's not so much in New Hampshire and Iowa, because the polls locally here are very different than what you see nationally. But, nationally, the average Republican is just seeing what they see on the news, and they're not seeing any of the other candidates. No one is giving the other candidates airtime.

In other words, he was not acting as a campaign volunteer after hours and on weekends, but rather was executing the orders of Donald Trump. So, we'll see what happens with that. He may have a plausible case for getting it removed. It's interesting that he wants to get out of state court and you know, fly back to the safety of the Federalist Society-Packed Federal Courts. In any event, I believe it's in the 11th Circuit where the court is considering another RICO action, which was Donald Trump's RICO lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, which was thrown out at the district court level, which is now being considered by the 11th court. But we're getting so much Donald Trump litigation and prosecution, where he's either the defendant or the plaintiff, that he might end up having to argue different sides on the same legal issue in different cases that are appearing in various circuits.

Of course, under the Brandenburg decision, incitement to imminent lawless action is not protected under the First Amendment. But in any case, that's not the only action by a long shot. I mean, they've got, I think, 161 different specific actions that are alleged, and of course, speech makes up the course of conduct constituting a lot of crimes.For example, if you think about an antitrust collusion conspiracy where businesses get together to set prices, that can't take place without speech. When you think about insider trading and people conspiring to give secrets about, you know, what's taking place inside a company, that can't take place without speech. So, you don't zero in microscopically and just look at the speech. You see if that's part of a pattern of conduct that adds up to violation of the law. And he's alleging a lot of different criminal actions way beyond his speech at the ellipse, which, as I said before, is not necessarily itself protected under the First Amendment, because to my mind, it did incite imminent lawless action.

I mean, I think this is really -- it underscores how much this is Donald Trump's party.I mean, we have evidence, you know, over the course of the last, you know, couple of years that show just appalling behavior by a former president. And you have a handful of elected officials who say they want to be the standard bearer for their party in 2024 who are unwilling to take that on. I think -- I mean, there's certainly a moral component to that, but also from a political standpoint, from a strategic standpoint. The dynamic of the race is not going to change unless somebody takes it to Donald Trump in a really meaningful way. And this was an opportunity to do that and to see Governor Christie sort of back off from some of the tougher things that he said about Donald Trump over the last few weeks, few months, I think shows you where the Republican Party, where these candidates believe the race is going.",

If everybody would kind of jump off the cliff and tell the voters the truth, yeah, there would be a path because people would listen to them.But instead, I mean, it's amazing to me when people are sitting around reading this stuff about Donald Trump and they're probably open to maybe this was wrong, maybe this was corrupt. And then they see Ron DeSantis stand up and say, this is a weaponization of the DOJ. Of course, they're going to believe it's a weaponization of the DOJ because they trust Ron DeSantis, they trust Tim Scott, they trust these people. These people that are running for president are failing their voters. They are not leading their voters. I am -- every day that goes by, when I watch people like DeSantis and Tim and everything say, oh, this is just weaponization. I just -- it blows my mind. I'm like, why are you even running? Just endorse Donald Trump, work for him, and try to get in the cabinet because you know this is corrupt. The people that vote Republican, I think in their hearts, obviously very good people, but they have been so misled that, you know, I guess, like, yes, everybody's responsible for what they believe, but to an extent, I'm like, well, if all your leaders are telling you what the DOJ has been weaponized, I guess it's fair to believe it.",

Now, the state's governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has been a vocal critic of what she calls indoctrination in schools.SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R), ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: We have to make sure that we are not indoctrinating our kids and that these policies and these ideas never see the light of day.
