Buckingham Palace announcing Kate Middleton had very serious abdominal surgery, in the hospital for two weeks away from royal duties for more than two months. What's wrong? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: The Trump charade. Former President Trump is about to speak in New Hampshire after spending much of the day in a New York courtroom where he dared the judge in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case to toss him out of the room. All day, Trump did not control these outbursts, and the reality of it is, is this is exactly what he wanted -- the theater, the coverage, all of it. He wants this case to look like a charade, like a joke by throwing his hands in the air, shaking his head, slamming the table, monitoring the words \"witch hunt\" and \"con jobs\" so loudly that the jury could hear it. He did that while E. Jean Carroll was testifying that Trump's attacks had shattered her reputation. And then after court ended in, Trump goes out, he continued in this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is important to remember, jury already decided this. So, what's at stake now? Just how much money he may have to pay and defamation against her, not the abuse part.

And now she's trying to walk back comments about race, comments about what South Carolina and the country's history work when she said on Fox News that this country has never been racist. We know that there was a three-fifths compromise back in 1787 when all the way to 1866, we know this country for hundred years of slavery, which she couldn't seem to mention when she was talked -- when she was posed that question before. So, I'm not sure exactly what she's trying to do, except that it seems a lot of bird whistle -- dog whistling to try and get Republicans focused on anything else other than the facts and the issues. At the end of the day, I'm clear on the fact that Joe Biden is going to be there. Anybody that comes out of the Republican primary, whether it's her or Donald Trump.

This is the fourth time as you point out within the course of the last seven days that we have seen the U.S. target the Iran-backed rebel group. On Thursday, we saw the U.S. and U.K. or carry out a wide array of strikes against command and control nodes, radar sites, as well as the missiles and drones they've used to attack international shipping. There was a follow-on strike on Friday against the radar site. Then, just yesterday, we saw them target anti-ship ballistic missiles.And here once again, it's unclear at this point what was targeted. We expect to find that out soon, but the U.S. clearly showing a willingness to go after the Houthis in Yemen again, an Iran-backed rebel group after the Biden administration for weeks tried to avoid directly targeting the Houthis for fear of a potential escalation in the region. But the context here is important. Erin, twice this week already the Houthis have targeted and hit us, owned and operated vessels, minor damage ships continued on their way, but that is a critical context for what were seeing unfold here.",

In just the past year, more than 31,000 Chinese migrants have you illegally entered the United States, which is double the prior ten years combined, as our David Culver has reported here OUTFRONT.
