Because right now, as was just noted in that report, everything in the United States has been highly politicized.Obviously, we have an election coming up. And so any issue, and especially Ukraine, where you're talking about, you know, big amounts of money, you've got this package -- overall package of $106 billion, 60 billion of which would go to Ukraine. The rest would go to Israel, to the border, and some other -- Taiwan, in fact. But 60 billion is a lot of money. And as American lawmakers look at it, they don't believe that there is much progress that the Ukrainians are making. And also, they know, at least the Republicans know, that Joe Biden is really kind of over the barrel on this. He needs to continue that funding. That is a major purpose that he set out to do. And so, they can hold him and they can pressure him on this issue of the border. Now, the Russians are saying security -- the border is security, but there's, I think you'd have to say a difference between armed invasion of another country, albeit another country and people coming into a country. They're -- they're quite different issues, but in the United States right now, they are intricately connected. And so, it's very difficult. And I think Zelenskyy is going to have to rely on the power that he has emotionally to connect to people, but also to make that issue that I get across that idea, which he's made before, that if Ukraine loses -- whatever lose means at this point, and Russia is perceived as winning, that it can be a danger to Europe and to the United States.

DeSantis is running to Trump's right, trying to peel away some of his core supporters on the theory that if he gets it down to a one-on-one race, that the voters in the middle will have no choice but to rally around him as the last chance to stop Trump. But that strategy, Rosemary, really hasn't paid a lot of dividends. He hasn't paved the way -- a lot of Trump supporters, and he's alienated a lot of the more centrist voters in the Republican Party who are the most resistant to Trump. That's left the vacuum for Haley, which he has failed to probably pass him as the most viable alternative to Trump, consolidating those more centrist voters, college-educated voters, suburban voters. But that last debate showed the limits of her approach. When DeSantis and Ramaswamy really tag-team, went at her from the right and she didn't have, I think, as effective a response as she did in some of the earlier debates. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
