Seven people were injured. Their conditions range from critical to stable. The attacks included a home invasion and multiple crime scenes. No motive currently now.The war of words between Disney and Ron DeSantis has ended with a settlement. It all started after Disney spoke out against Florida's so-called controversial Don't Say Gay law. DeSantis then asked Florida's legislature to terminate special privileges granted to Disney in Central Florida. Both have agreed to drop the various lawsuits they filed against one another and resolve their differences outside court. Beyonce teased her upcoming country album on Instagram set to release in less than 24 hours. The track list includes the Dolly Parton hit \"Jolene\" and the Linda Martell show referring to the singer who became the first Black woman to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. There are also hints of collaborations with Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Today, Donald Trump is expected to attend the wake of a NYPD officer Jonathan Diller, who was killed during a traffic stop. A spokesperson for Trump says the officer's family invited him to attend the wake. So, brand new this morning, the Biden campaign just announced that its blinged-out fundraiser in New York tonight has already raised $25 million. The event will feature former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and a huge list of others. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. And the Biden campaign as -- is billing this as the most successful political fundraiser in U.S. history.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, John, and it really marks a unique moment in presidential politics as you have three Democratic presidents teaming up with one goal in mind, and that is defeating former President Donald Trump.Tonight, they will be assembling more than 5,000 supporters at Radio City Music Hall for this first-of-its-kind fundraiser featuring Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. Stephen Colbert will be moderating a discussion there. There's also a separate event that will be taking place online for those small-dollar donors. Tickets for this event started at $225 and went all the way up to $500,000 -- with the more you pay, the more access you're getting, including one batch of supporters who will have a photo taken by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz of themselves and the three presidents. Now, it come as the Biden campaign is touting this whopping $25 million figure that they're raising from this one-night event. If you just take a look at how that compares to some of the fundraising of the president in the past, back in February he raised $53 million total and that has given him about $71 million cash on hand. Now, if you add in Democratic accounts, that number is nearly double. Compare that to former President Donald Trump who currently has $33.5 million cash on hand. So this fundraiser will help add to that cash advantage Biden has as he ramps up his operations to take on Trump in November. But this really marks quite a moment when it comes to having former presidents involved in the president -- in President Biden's campaign. We have seen former President Barack Obama really pick up his involvement in the campaign. He's taped these fundraisers and taped videos relating to health care. But in speaking with Biden's advisers and Obama's advisers in recent months, they've really made clear that they want to use the former president at moments that would be of maximum impact. Fundraising is one area where they have seen that Obama has helped the operations. It's likely he won't be hitting the campaign trail until much later in the fall as this election nears. But it does comes as Obama has said to allies that he does believe this will be an incredibly close election and believes it will be an all-hands-on-deck moment. Of course, they're also deploying former President Bill Clinton -- a rarity out on the campaign trail. And it's really speaking to the fact that the Biden campaign is trying to tap into this Democratic star power using Obama and using Clinton to help boost Biden's campaign heading into November.",

And so, what are some of the things that it does? Well, it requiresfederal agencies, by December 1, to implement things like steps to verify that they -- these AI tools don't endanger Americans' rights. They'll also have to publish a complete list of the tools that they use that are powered by AI, as well as why they're using these tools. They'll also have to complete risk assessments to ensure that the public is aware of the potential risks that these AI tools could pose. And then, finally, these AI -- these agencies will have to appoint a chief AI officer to oversee the use of some of these tools. Now, this is kind of been years in the making. We've already seen hundreds of AI use cases in the federal government. We've seen agencies like NASA using artificial intelligence to track volcano activity all around the world. Agencies like NOAA use AI to track wildfires and to count seals and whales. And this is really all just the beginning of what's going to be a much larger engagement with AI, Fredricka, because agencies like the Department of Homeland Security just recently announced last week it's going to be using artificial intelligence to train immigration officers. It's going to use it to enhance law enforcement investigations. So this is really the tip of the iceberg. And the federal government is trying to get out ahead of it before anything goes awry because until now, we've not had a single policy and agencies have been basically doing -- going -- doing basically their own thing.

Now, prosecutors are saying that in their filing to the judge, \"...his life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people's money.\" They've also said that his lack of contrition has been galling. Now, his team is pleading with the judge, saying that he should get no more than 6 1/2 years in prison, saying that he is not like other fraudsters, like Bernie Madoff who stole money from pensions. That he was not intending to enrich himself by this, pointing to his look of often wearing t-shirts and shorts. They have said to the judge that a sentence that either the prosecutors want or the probation department, which has asked for a 100-year sentence -- they called that, \"A medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation. Crushing Sam in this way is unnecessary.\" They've also sent to the court dozens of letters from friends and supporters of Bankman-Fried.

That's why we are so honored and pleased that the President of the United States followed through on his promises. The Army Corps of Engineers will be -- is on its way right now to clear that channel. And we've got to make sure that we do that so that ships can once again start coming in and out of the port that where, as I understand, four ships in the port that were stocked. There were 20 waiting to get in. So the reality is that for all those docked and for all the commerce that goes through the Port of Baltimore opening that channel is the priority.",

And it has to happen just as soon as possible. It may be, John, that we open up one of the passageways. That area is designed so you can have two-way ship traffic but obviously, if we can open one of the lanes sooner, then that obviously would allow ships to come in and out of the port.",

So we are going to await their findings.Their findings will hopefully, I think help with two things. Number one, find out exactly what caused this. And I should say that if there is liability on behalf of the ship owners, they are going to certainly have to contribute to the cost of rebuilding this bridge. But the other purpose is to make sure that we learn lessons to try to avoid this going forward. I can't comment at all, John, on the structure of the bridge. I mean, this was a ship that is three football fields long. Even going 10 knots, that's a lot of momentum. So, you know, I don't know if I want to guess it anyway about structural issues. The bridge itself was to all accounts -- by all accounts very structurally sound.",
