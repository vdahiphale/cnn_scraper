Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield and we begin this hour with breaking news. Israeli war cabinet member and former deputy prime minister Benny Gantz delivering an ultimatum to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he must choose between victory and disaster, and telling him the war cabinet must agree on a plan for the Gaza conflict by June 8th. Gantz is threatening to leave the coalition government if Netanyahu does not meet his expectations. CNN's Elliott Gotkine is in Tel Aviv for us and we're hearing now that there's a response from Netanyahu?",

      "sentences": "There is a response from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office deriving, dismissing Benny Gantz's words as washed up words, and saying the Gantz's plan would result in a defeat for Israel against Hamas and also the abandonment of the hostages who were abducted by Hamas on October 7th. Of course specifically what Gantz's plan is calling for is all efforts to be made to rescue the hostages, to bring them back to Israel, and also, of course, to defeat Hamas at the same time.So what I think we're seeing beyond the specifics of these words is that the divisions that were underground, if you like, that managed to keep a lid on these divisions over the past few months, these have now come out into the open. Just the other day we heard from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant explicitly criticizing the prime minister for not coming up with a coherent plan for the day after Gaza, and how that is running the risk of resulting in these victories that Israel has had in the Gaza Strip being for nothing. And we've seen, for example, Hamas regrouping in northern parts of the Gaza Strip where Israel had previously said that the job was done. But going back to Benny Gantz's words and it's worth noting that there's little love lost between Gantz and Netanyahu, that Gantz was meant to replace Netanyahu in a deal to become prime minister in a previous government, which Netanyahu managed two wriggle out of by failing to approve a budget and opinion polls suggest that if there were elections tomorrow, Benny Gantz wouldn't just beat Netanyahu, he would trounce him. But going back to those words from Benny Gantz, what he has said is that Netanyahu in his words must choose between victory and disaster saying that if Netanyahu chooses to lead the nation into the abyss, we will withdraw from the government, turn to the people and form a government that can bring about a real victory. The problem for Gantz is that if he were to leave this government Netanyahu still has the numbers so long as you can keep his far-right ministers in the fold, in his government, that Netanyahu doesn't need to go to the people. There doesn't have to be an election until they are planned in a couple of years' time. So although that would clearly perhaps change the way that Israel conducts the war, Gantz is no dove, but he certainly seems to be slightly less a right-wing than Netanyahu and certainly some of Netanyahu's bedfellows in the government, that if Bernie Gantz leaves the government, then the trajectory of this war could lead to the military efforts of Israel, particularly the effort in Gaza being definitively made a priority over the recovery of the Israeli hostages who are being held in the Gaza Strip. And just briefly, Fredricka, the points that Gantz saying is that Netanyahu needs to come up with a plan that is going to defeat Hamas, return the hostages and also have a plan for the day after that doesn't involve Hamas or Fatah, the faction run by Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, and also to make progress on the normalization with Saudi Arabia and also to do something that will enable the tens of thousands of people displaced from the northern parts of Israel because of attacks from Iran-backed Hezbollah, to allow them to move back to their homes -- Fredricka.",

This happening in 2016. Now has the attention of the Los Angeles Police Department. In a statement from the department, it says they are aware of the video. They go on to say there is not an open LAPD investigation involving Mr. Combs.The Los Angeles district attorney is also reacting saying if the conduct depicted occurred in 2016, unfortunately we would be unable to charge as the conduct would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister walks us through her exclusive reporting, and we do warn you that what you're about to see is very disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New surveillance footage obtained exclusively by CNN appears to corroborate some of the allegations of abuse against music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. The video, captured on multiple cameras, shows Combs wearing only a towel, assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hallway at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. A lawsuit filed by Ventura in November last year and settled the next day referenced actions that seem to match those seen in this video. There is no audio. According to the complaint, Combs became extremely intoxicated and punched Miss Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye, which, according to the lawsuit, prompted Ventura to try and leave the hotel room. The surveillance video obtained by CNN begins as she enters the hallway. The complaint says, \"As she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Miss Ventura. He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her.\" The complaint goes on to say, \"He grabbed her and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her.\" In the surveillance video, Combs can be seen grabbing Ventura and throwing her to the ground. As Ventura lies on the ground, Combs then kicks her twice and attempts to drag her on the floor back to the hotel room. Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone. Combs seems to walk back to the hotel room then returns and appears to shove her in a corner. Moments later, he can then be seen throwing an object in her direction. According to Ventura's now settled lawsuit, the pair began dating several years after they met in 2005. They parted ways in 2019. Combs' attorney said the decision to settle was in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Ventura declined to comment on the video, but her attorney told CNN, \"The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Miss Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\" The video hasn't been seen publicly before and comes on the heels of a series of civil lawsuits alleging Combs' involvement in sex trafficking and sexual abuse, allegations that Combs has repeatedly denied. Authorities searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami in March as part of an ongoing federal investigation carried out by a team that specializes in human trafficking crimes. In a December 2023 statement, Combs responded to the claims in some of the lawsuits, saying, \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) WAGMEISTER (on-camera): Clearly very disturbing footage and violent actions that we are seeing coming from Diddy who up until this point has denied many of these allegations from all of these lawsuits that he is facing. Aside from this lawsuit from Cassie, which she settled back in November 2023, he is facing five separate for lawsuits and he has been fighting back through his lawyers. In fact just last week, we reported on a motion that he filed to dismiss a lawsuit from a Jane Doe, that claim she was 17 years old, a minor at the time of her allegations. And just a few days before that, he filed a motion to dismiss a portion of an entirely different claim. It'll be interesting to see now how this may impact all that Diddy is facing. But we have yet to hear directly from him.",

You need to be with me. They may even afterwards say, you know, I did that because of course you deserved it. But really I love you and I'm just demonstrating my love. You really should stay with me.

Anyone between 18 and 25 will go through basic training. The new law comes as the country faces a shortage of equipment and manpower in the war with Russia.Also new today, Ukraine is evacuating residents in the Kharkiv region as Russian forces mount an offensive there. Officials say Russian shelling is moving closer and closer to the area. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh accompanied Ukrainian soldiers this week, even as Russian bombs nearby and drones raced overhead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATON-WALSH (voice-over): When nightmares recur, they're often the same. Here they get worse. The border town of Vovchansk bearing the blunt horror of Moscow's race to take as much as they can in the weeks before Ukraine starts feeling American military help again. Every street aflame, Russians deeper inside the town. Policeman Maxim is answering one of 35 calls from locals on Thursday to evacuate. The day before, three colleagues were injured. The shelling never stops. MAXIM, UKRAINIAN POLICE (through text translation): Quiet. Everybody get down.",

They're joined by Maria, their mother, who can't hear the shelling or anything too well. Thousands evacuated since Russia invaded again around here five days ago. Why everyone has to leave is clear again as we drive out, as it is with almost every part of Ukraine Russia covets. Just utter destruction, little left to rule over. This is their first moment of calm in many days. Entire lives in plastic bags. She's saying it wasn't like last night was scary and everyone else was talking about significant bombardment, more that it was just better to get out of there. 85. (Voice-over): An armored ride to a new world knowing they may never get back to their homes, tormented for days by shelling. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through text translation): Aerial bombs, everything. And mortars. PATON WALSH (through text translation): Did you see the Russian soldiers? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through text translation): No. They are over there, on the other side of the river, and we were on this side. They were shooting close to us. Firing machine guns and everything. PATON WALSH (voice-over): We head back in with another police unit who soon learned two of the houses they must rescue from are impossible to reach. As we wait, they hear a buzzing noise. They think they can hear a drone here. It's so hard to tell with the wind and the trees and the artillery, but that's a constant threat for them now. (Voice-over): Then our security adviser spots it. They raise their weapons, but will firing make them more of a target? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): What if it's ours?",

All we can do is hide in the trees and hope that if we are seen, the Russians instead have a better target in mind. But they come right overhead. That noise, either the sound of death or someone deciding you're not worth their payload.We decide to leave, but again, we cannot travel fast enough to escape the drones, only expose ourselves and pray they lose interest. Perhaps they did, we'll never know, but behind us, Ukraine is aflame again because however the West's interest in this war wanes, Putin's burns brighter than ever.
