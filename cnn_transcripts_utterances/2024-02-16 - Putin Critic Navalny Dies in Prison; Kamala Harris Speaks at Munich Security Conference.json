The Russian prison service reporting this morning opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died in prison.We are also waiting at any moment for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is set to speak at the Munich Security Conference. As we await those remarks, I'm going to bring back in Clarissa Ward, Matthew Chance. Also joining us is Evelyn Farkas, executive director of the McCain Institute. It's good to have all of you with us. And, of course, Evelyn, you also served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. I believe it was 2012 to 2015. When you are seeing what is playing out this morning, not just the reaction that were seeing internationally and the questions that are being raised, but the fact that Alexei Navalny died in this penal colony near the Arctic Circle. We know how difficult the conditions were, what his health was. Evelyn, what are your questions this morning? What concerns you?",

      "sentences": "I mean, Erica, I think my question is, you know, how weak is Vladimir Putin that he did this now. Because, let's remember, March 17th are the Russian elections. Very recently, you know, the Russians, they control their elections, but they do kind of create a sense of competition. They have opposition figures who are allowed to run. So they are government sanctioned opposition leaders.One of them actually adopted an anti-war platform. He got 200,000 people to sign his petition to run. There were people lining up all over different parts of Russia. So, all of a sudden you had someone who was not sanctioned anymore by the government giving an anti-war message, which, of course, would have caused great consternation in the Kremlin. They would only need to think about Lukashenko and Belarus who had an uprising, also just several years ago on the - on the heels of an - or as part of an election. So, I think that Putin was feeling really weak. The other thing is, this is the first day of the Munich Security Conference, and Putin declared about ten years ago that this organization, that people who come here, the western countries, and that's Europe, Japan, you know, all of our allies, the United States, that he viewed us as adversaries, that we were not allowing him to reestablish his sphere of influence throughout the former Soviet space. So, that's another part of it. And then, finally, Vladimir Kara-Murza just wrote an op-ed in \"The Washington Post.\" He published it. He's another political prisoner who's in jail in Siberia. And he has been poisoned twice. We need to get him out as soon as possible. He's clearly in danger as well.",

We don't know that Navalny was intentionally killed at this point, but he did die in a Russian prison. What are the stakes of Vice President Kamala Harris' remarks here on the global scale in this moment?",

The stakes have certainly changed, as Omar was pointing out, for these remarks that we're waiting on.

      "sentences": "Well, no doubt, Erica, this is going to dominate the conversation over the next few days. This Munich Security Conference just getting underway. I mean there is no bigger stage perhaps in the world when it comes to discussions about global security. And really the conversation was intended to focus on what is going on in Ukraine, the west support for Ukraine and what it would mean if essentially a Putin were to have his way in Ukraine. And here we have the foremost critic of Vladimir Putin dead in a penal colony.Now, certainly the U.S. is trying to figure out what happened here. We are awaiting comments -- or a speech, rather, by Vice President Kamala Harris. That is to be followed by a question and answer session in just a few moments' time. It is unclear right now whether she plans to address it, but it's hard to imagine, Erica and Omar, that she doesn't. This is certainly huge news here in Munich. It is dominating the conversations in the hallways, in this hotel behind me where all the meetings are taking place. We did hear from Secretary Antony Blinken just moments ago. He's been having a series of meetings with various world leaders that will continue throughout the course of the day. He doesn't have a public event until tomorrow. But I want to read a little bit of what he said. He is still calling these reports -- so there isn't a - an official confirmation from the U.S. government. But he said that, \"for more than a decade the Russian government has prosecuted, poisoned and imprisoned Alexei Navalny,\" and that \"his death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built.\" Now, Harris and Blinken are here to essentially reaffirm American leadership in the world, talk about America's leadership in NATO and the importance of that, and essentially paint a picture of what could happen if President Trump were to come back into power. An America that is more isolationist. An America that is perhaps more authoritarian. An America that -- or a world, rather, that would be perhaps more susceptible to the likes of Vladimir Putin. So, that is all being brought into a much starker focus now with the death of Putin's principal critic, Alexei Navalny. Guys.",

How does the U.S. handle challenges to its democratic system.I want to bring in Matthew Chance now. Matthew, you as well have -- have spoken with Navalny in the past here. Can you just provide a little bit of context for (INAUDIBLE) opposition leader in terms of Russia, but a leader in terms of the global scale of really what his influence was and will likely continue to be even in death.",

His opposition organization focused on exposing corruption. And corruption for anybody who knows Russia and certainly for Russians living there is a sort of daily part of life in that country.

We have not been able to confirm this, that Alexei Navalny died.The vice president going on to say, and I'm quoting her here, \"if confirmed it would be further sign of Putin's brutality. And whatever story they tell us, let me be clear,\" she said, \"Russia is responsible.\" She went on to then say that they would have more to say. But very, very strong words out of the gate there. I want to bring in now anchor and chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper, as well as our chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour. Jake, we were, obviously, anticipating that she would address the news of Navalny's death. Those words, very strong out of the gate.

I don't think that I can have such a privilege of being safe in Russia, but I have to go back because I don't want this group of killers to exist in Russia. I don't want Putin ruling Russia.\"Did you get a sense of why he was so determined to go back, knowing that this was always a potential risk?",

I, obviously, was concerned enough to ask him why he was putting himself and his mission at risk by going back. But that, as you say, was the answer he gave at the time. That is almost three years ago. And now here we are.Until it's absolutely confirmed independently, all we have is the Russian service, the Russian penitentiary service, who have said that he collapsed after going out for a walk. They brought the ambulances, they tried to revive him but they could not. And the Russians are saying that investigations are underway into the cause of death. But the very important thing a former, in fact, national security official told us earlier this morning after this news broke, that this is horrible and it's a sign for everybody at the Munich Security Conference right now. It is a sign. And what's happening right now is, for the first time in many years, the delegates here, whether they are U.S. officials, whether they're European officials, the alliance is increasingly nervous because you're seeing what's happening on the battlefield in Ukraine, you're seeing that Ukraine is suffering without a fresh injection of American military and other economic help. They are running out of what they need to hold Russian forces off. This is a major issue right now affecting all the NATO leaders are here. And also you heard Kamala Harris, the vice president, say that she is delivering a message to the Munich Security Conference, to Putin and to the world that the United States continues to remain strong as the leader of this alliance. However, because of what Donald Trump has been saying questioning that over the last several weeks, and, of course, it goes back to when he started his quest for the presidency back in 2015, that he is questioning the U.S. commitment to NATO, to Article Five as a collective defense, and also that comment he made inviting and encouraging, as he put it, Putin to attack any NATO nation that he deemed delinquent. All of this is causing a huge amount of anxiety amongst all the allied leaders and they're very afraid that if this continues like this, it well give succor, it will be of great value and benefit to adversaries, like Putin, and those who are watching from further afield.",
