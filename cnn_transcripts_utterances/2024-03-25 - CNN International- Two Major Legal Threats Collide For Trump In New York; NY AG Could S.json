      "sentences": "Good morning. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York, and we are following all of the fast-moving developments.On a big day, big even by Donald Trump's standards, Trump coming face to face with two legal cases that could result in enormous consequences, and one, he could face time behind bars, and the other, Trump could potentially see some of his biggest properties seized. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee right now inside a New York courthouse. That's where he will find out if he will become the first former President to go on trial. Now, after today's critical hearing in the hush money case, the judge may set a new trial date or rule on Trump's motion to dismiss the case entirely. The other major obstacle legally for the former President is the bill that's coming due. Trump has just hours, just hours to come up with a $464 million bond in his civil fraud case, or he could see pieces of his financial empire seized by New York Attorney General Letitia James. And today's developments will likely be felt well beyond the courtroom with possible political ramifications impacting the 2024 presidential race. And we have this covered from all angles today with our CNN team of reporters along with legal analysts, CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz; Reporter Alayna Treene, and Legal Analyst Michael Zeldin, all with me now from Washington. Katelyn, let's start with you. The trial has been in session about an hour now. What's the latest you're hearing from our reporters inside the courtroom?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The judge is on the bench, and it is not -- it's going a little rocky for Donald Trump's team as far as we can tell. There isn't a decision yet from the judge on when this trial should start. But, what is happening here and what is at issue is that Donald Trump's team made a request for documents from federal prosecutors related to Michael Cohen, who had been under investigation for a long time before this case was charged by state level Manhattan prosecutors. And they got a lot of documents very recently. And so, they've used that to get before the judge today and to ask for essentially a long delay to the trial that was supposed to start. They have also accused the district attorney in New York of some level of prosecutorial misconduct.And so, the judge is right now going over that with Trump's team, and saying it's a very serious accusation that they're making. And perhaps Donald Trump's team should have known better than allow this to become a last-minute issue that they should have known they could have been asking for this material from federal prosecutors a long time ago. What they've gotten may not be relevant if it's about the Russia investigation, the Mueller investigation back before the Manhattan DA's Office started investigating Trump for criminal charges. That's not coming into the trial. So, they shouldn't think that. And the judge even said directly to Donald Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, who is a former prosecutor himself in New York, he said, you were there for 13 years. So, you know that the defense has the same ability as the prosecution to obtain these documents. So, as the judge goes over what is happening here, he seems to be getting a little bit animated about this idea that there are serious accusations where Trump's team has brought him in the court. And he is not finding a lot of meat there to allow them to continue making those accusations. But, we still have to see. There is a long way to go in this hearing still, Rahel.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, they have successfully used these cases all for criminal indictments to fundraise, to galvanize Republicans around him. However, I have to point out that Donald Trump himself is pained by these four indictments. He has said as much both privately and publicly. He has told reporters in the past that he does not want to be indicted, that he wishes he wasn't facing any of these charges. And so, I think that's important to keep in mind for all the bravado that we see from his team, from the politics around this. We could hear from Donald Trump later. We know that he likes to speak around these court appearances and kind of use them as a campaign stop in addition to being a legal battle. Despite all of that, behind the scenes, he is concerned about this.But, I also want to point out that when it comes to this case, in particular, out of all of the four criminal indictments he is facing, this is the one that he and his team are actually the least worried about, and more so I should say that they think it'll be the least publicly damaging despite some of the personally mortifying details in this case regarding hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, we have heard from Donald Trump this morning. He has been speaking on Truth Social. He actually posted on his way to the courthouse. But, I want to point out that he is actually more consumed at the moment with the bond deadline that you were mentioning at the top of the show, Rahel. That is something that Donald Trump, even though he is in court today for this criminal case, or for this hearing about whether we might find out if there is a trial or not, he is really consumed by what will happen with that bond deadline. And as of now, he does not have the funds to pay for the $464 million judgment. And so, that's really been consuming him and he has been railing against that publicly. He has been railing against that in his conversations behind the scenes. And it really strikes to the core of who he is, because, one, it's a public perception. He really does not want people to believe that he doesn't have as much cash that he claims. On the other part, of course, is that he -- it strikes to the core of who he is as a businessman, and it's something that he has avoided for several years. He has been a real estate developer. He has this real estate empire he has been tangling with the legal side of this for many years, even before he became President. But, this is the first time that he is actually facing a scenario like that. Rahel.",

I will just read for you what we saw. He said quote, \"Crooked polls\", he said referring to the politicians. \"There should be no FINE. Did nothing wrong. Why should I be forced to sell my \"babies\" because a CORRUPT NEW YORK JUDGE &amp; A.G. SET A FAKE AND RIDICULOUS NUMBER\", the post went on to say \"WITH HUNT\".So, clearly, this is top of mind for Donald Trump, and again, yes, they are fundraising this. Yes, fundraising off of this.

But, whether this case survives a motion to dismiss at some point in the future, either by the district court or by the appellate court remains to be seen, because remember, the theory of prosecution in this case is that Trump took business records and transformed them into a fraud. Those are generally misdemeanors. But, if they're combined together to create a felony by violating another law, then that's a righteous prosecution. In this case, the problem is that other law which hasn't been specified yet by Bragg is most likely a federal election case.So, the question that judge is going to have to answer at some point is, can you add two misdemeanors to create a felony to violate a federal election under New York state law? So, he has got to deal with that. If he gets past that, the facts of this case are pretty strong for Bragg, because the evidence is quite clear that Trump engaged in a scheme to evade the business reporting requirements under New York state law.",

You're just showing up and railing. And I'm not going to countenance that. And I'm not going to sanction them for that. And I had the question whether or not he is going to sanction the Trump teams for the way it's proceeding in this case.

So, it's very basic blocking and tackling stuff. But, I have to say, I'm a bit of an outlier on this. I do think that a $400 million bond is a lot to ask of a person. And I think that the Court of Appeals or the trial judge could well have a compromise here, where he puts up $100 million, $200 million, and then they take out liens or other collateral against his property, collateral -- protect it from being disgorged someplace else. And I let -- and let the case go forward. I just -- I don't like bail. I don't like bonds. I think that they'vebeen used abusively in the criminal justice system, and now sort of in this case too. I'd like to see a way by which he puts up something less than the money and can still go less than $400 million and still go forward.

And I guess what I'm saying in the prior comments is I think there should be a compromise that's available to the parties, not to deny trump the opportunity to proceed, not to have his properties seized and sold at fire sale prices. I think that the state should be able to satisfy itself that it can obtain the full value of its judgment at the end of the case, if they prevail, essentially forcing him into this fire sale situation, which I just don't like.

Truth Social apparently getting a pretty high valuation. Talk to us about how this might factor into Trump's net worth. EGANexperts that I've been talking to, because Truth Social itself is shrinking in terms of the number of users. The parent company, Trump Media, has very little revenue, and yet, it's being valued at in the billions of dollars. And one professor telling me that it's clearly a bubble. And so, what's happened on that front is Digital World Acquisition Corporation. That is the blank check company that's already publicly traded. You see that stock is up 13 percent. The higher that stock goes, the more the richer, really, that the former President is, at least on paper, because the merger calls for President -- former President Trump to own a massive, massive stake, worth billions of dollars. And the deal does appear to be very close to finishing up. Shareholders of Digital World, they overwhelmingly approved the merger on Friday. Now, SEC filings say that the expectation is for this deal to close within two business days of all of the different obstacles being completed. So, that suggests that maybe tomorrow we could hear that the deal is closing, except I should note that there is ongoing litigation here aimed at stopping the merger. So, that does add to some legal uncertainty. But, this would be a financial win for former President Trump. The problem for him is that there is a lot of restrictions over what he can do with that stake. A lot of deals like this. They have a lock-up restriction. And in centers, they can't sell for six months because it doesn't really look good to have a major shareholder sell as soon as the deal closes. And those restrictions also prevent insiders like former President Trump from borrowing against that stake. And so, for those reasons, experts say that it would be hard for Trump to quickly monetize this stake unless some of those restrictions are waived. And then even then you go back to the problem over valuation, in that a lot of people think that this company would be overvalued.

We've heard from the Biden administration, which convinced its delegation to go to Washington, that they have alternatives. They have other plans that they believe will allow Israel to defeat Hamas but without the humanitarian catastrophe that countries around the world fear would happen if there was this massive ground offensive in an area like Rafah where you've got up to 1.5 million Palestinian sheltering at this point. So, this really widens the gap between the U.S. and Israel. It's a relationship that has been tested significantly recently. We know there is a very significant difference of opinion when it comes to what is happening in Gaza at this point between the Biden administration and Netanyahu's administration. And certainly, this is not going to help matters. So, Israel deciding not to send this delegation later this week. Of course, the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, is already in the United States. He is planning to meet with the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan this Monday. He was planning also to meet with the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to talk about a potential ceasefire, about how to increase the efforts to work to release those hostages from Gaza as well.

It linked it to the hostage release from Gaza, and also pointed towards an immediate allowing of significant humanitarian aid into Gaza.Now, the U.S. actually proposed its own resolution back on Friday in the security cabinet -- Security Council. It was vetoed by Russia and China, which the U.S. accused them of playing politics with that particular veto. So, what we're seeing today is the U.S. Ambassador saying they couldn't vote for the resolution as there were parts of it that they didn't agree with, but they abstained, which meant that it did pass. So, I think what it does is it shows where the international community is at this point that there are growing calls for an immediate ceasefire, something which the Biden administration resisted for some months, but which it is very much behind now.

Well, he is the most solipsistic, most narcissistic politician I've ever seen. And so, he talks about his own problems, not the voters. Right? None of this. All he talks about are his alleged participation in January 6, his alleged hush money payments, his legal problems, his properties.Somewhere out there, there are Americans who are struggling to meet the rent, who are worried about the cost of prescription drugs, and he is not speaking to them. He solidified his space. That's good for him. But, if he wants to reach those reluctant Republicans who voted for Nikki Haley, he has got to get out of his own head, his own problems, and get into their lives.",

But, you are getting, even last week in Ohio, one out of five Republicans opposing Trump. What he needs to do for them is show a face of moderation and unity. And he is, I think, showing anything but that. He is alienating them with increasingly inflammatory rhetoric celebrating the rioters on January 6, for example.According to our colleague, Jim Sciutto, his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told Jim that Mr. Trump actually said admiring things about Adolf Hitler. That's not a way to get moderates. And so, he has to shift. He won't. But, I can't help as a professional to give him free advice. He has got to shift to those moderate voters.",

But, for those persuadable voters, I think the Paul was just talking about, those people who are kind of more centered, I don't think this is helping Donald Trump in any way, whatsoever.There used to be a time in politics when the elected officials or candidates were charged with a federal crimes or hit with major civil judgments, those would be personally devastating and be career-ending.

He -- that Nikki Haley voter, there are a lot of Republicans who are just never going to vote for Donald Trump. And so, that is a big challenge right now in this campaign that we have two, frankly, very flawed candidates where close to two thirds of voters don't like the choice, and they want something else.And so, I think this race ultimately got to come down to what these double haters think, people who don't like either candidate.

Trump has been a terrible fundraiser lately and the Republican Party seems to be in chaos with the Republican National Committee. So, use that advantage to attack as a Democrat. And I'm for Biden.

We expect that to begin in about 10 minutes, at 12 p.m. Eastern. And earlier this hour, you might remember, he won a partial victory in another case, as an appeals court ruled that he could pay $175 million in his civil fraud trial within 10 days, the bond, rather than $464 million that was due today. By most standards and probably even by his own, this is an especially wild week for the former President, as you look at these shots of the courthouse again, set to resume proceedings, set to begin in about nine minutes or so, as we keep a close eye on that.But also, in an OpEd today, CNN Politics Senior Reporter Stephen Collinson writes, \"Donald Trump's tumultuous life has been rocked by bankruptcies, personal scandals, impeachments and election wins and losses, but nothing quite compares to the personal and financial crisis facing the once-and-possibly future president this week.\" And Stephen joins me now from Washington. So, Stephen, you lay out sort of well the sort of roller coaster of events happening between Truth Social and it going public, and also all of these legal proceedings.

But, that's the way Donald Trump's life and presidency and business career has always been, these crisis that he manages to stave off. He sometimes comes close to political or financial ruin, and often somehow manages to put off the inevitable or the moment of accountability.This ruling by the appeals court is a big break, because it's less than half the amount of money he was supposed to come up with by today. What it doesn't mean, though, is that he gets out of eventually having to pay the $450 million that is owed because of this fraud trial and the judgment against him. The appeal in this case is set to go ahead in September. If he loses that, he is still going to have to make good on that award. But, for now, he has put off the consequences of that fraud trial, at least for a few months, as he takes aim at the White House and what would be a pretty significant political comeback if he wins in November.",

It doesn't just involve Donald Trump. There are multiple associates and aides of the former President that caught up in that racketeering case. Often, those kinds of cases take months just to choose a jury. There is no real possibility I think that that goes ahead at least until the late summer.

One possible reason for this is that most of his wealth is tied up in real estate. But, it adds to an impression that has been there for many years that perhaps he is not as rich, as he is saying he was. After all, this case in itself was about inflating the value of his assets, which he was found to have done by the judge in the civil court case. So, that's an issue here.
