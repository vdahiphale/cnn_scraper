When that happened three months ago, Hamlin went into cardiac arrest mid-game. After a routine tackle, he sustained a blow to the chest, stood up, and then immediately collapsed to the ground.Hamlin confirms commotio cordis caused his cardiac arrest. It is a rare phenomenon when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart's rhythm and can even cause sudden death. So joining us now, CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. He's back with us. Thank you for joining us on a different topic this morning, doctor. We appreciate it. So walk us through what happened with him is it comodio or commotio? In the beginning, people were saying both. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, it's commotio. But you're right. People do often say both, commotio is a correct pronunciation. It was an emotional thing to watch that, right? I was watching that game. I love sports. I'm a doctor. And then to watch what happened and that remarkable resuscitation, it was like being inside a hospital even though it was on a football field in terms of what they were able to do. But what happens here now, as you mentioned, the diagnosis was confirmed. Commotio cortis, think of it like this. Here's a heart prop. Heart's constantly beating and relaxing, beating, relaxing. It's happening all the time. What happens with commotio cortis is that right at the time, the heart is about to relax, go from beat to relax, it takes a blow to the chest, and that chest causes these issues where the heart really can't relax as a result of that, and instead starts to fibrillate and go into an irregular heartbeat. Which can lead to the cardiac arrest, and that can happen what I just described, just like that in a split second, which is what we saw and what we now know happened to Damar on that football field.",

Anyway, all right, so this morning's number is, 45. 45percent of Americans say their job gives them a sense of identity, but 54 percent said it's just a job. This is according to the latest poll numbers back in 2021 and why this is so interesting, this 45 percent is cause I want you to take a look at this trend line of your job is more than just a job.It gives you a sense of identity. Back in 1989, it was 57 percent, in the 90s, 55 percent, 2000s, 53 percent, 2010s, 50 percent, and it has now dropped all the way down to 45 percent. So there's clearly more fewer Americans saying that their job is more than just a job. It gives you a sense of identity. More Americans think it's just a job and take a look here. Who thinks their job gives them a sense of identity in 2021? This is another interesting little nugget. High school grads just 33 percent versus post grads 54 percent. I think these folks may have it more, right? On the whole, even though I love my job, but if I had any other job, then I think it would probably be just a job.",
