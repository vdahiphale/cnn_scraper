Super Tuesday voting in the U.S. gets underway in a little more than 48 hours with presidential nominating contests in more than a dozen states. 865 delegates are up for grabs for Republicans. It takes more than 112 delegates to win their presidential nomination, and a strong showing by Donald Trump could make his lead almost insurmountable. Trump racked up more wins on Saturday. He claimed nearly 85 percent of the vote in Idaho's Republican caucuses compared to just over 13 percent for rival Nikki Haley. Missouri's Republicans also held caucuses on Saturday. Trump commanded a whopping 100 percent of that vote. Trump now has 247 delegates compared to Haley's 24. CNN's Steve Contorno has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
