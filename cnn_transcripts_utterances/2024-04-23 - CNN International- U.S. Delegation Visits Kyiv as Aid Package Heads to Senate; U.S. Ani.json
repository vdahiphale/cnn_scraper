Those are those long-range missiles that have proved critical for Ukraine in its sort of deep battle behind enemy lines, over 60 boats. This will boost the existing commitment from the U.K. from around two and a half billion pounds to over three -- to three billion.That's about $3.7 billion. The U.K. already the third biggest backer of Ukraine's military behind the U.S. and Germany. So a significant commitment here. Obviously, we've seen the U.K. has tried to be sort of front and center in this war, a trailblazer of sorts. The first to provide modern tanks, the Challenger tanks, the first to provide those long- range missiles, the Storm Shadows. So, you know, clearly showing that they still want to be out front in terms of the country's backing Ukraine. But I think, look, this is a time when everyone is under pressure. I think you will see Rishi Sunak on these visits to Poland and Germany facing difficult conversations about how quickly the U.K. can boost defense production, how they can maximize the deterrent in NATO, especially given that all eyes are, of course, on the upcoming U.S. election in November. But, of course, a major commitment from the U.K. and coming at a very, very vulnerable time for Ukraine.",

Now, with the confidence, as we look ahead, of course, to the Senate vote and the president's signature, which he says will happen, they can have some confidence that the aid will come. So they could perhaps ration that ammunition less rigorously.But look, overnight, the Air Force saying that it had to shoot down some 15 Shahed attack drones. There were missiles found. You see those -- those pretty shocking images out of Kharkiv of the TV tower collapsing. That is a city that has been under relentless bombardment for months. President Zelenskyy in his conversation, his telephone conversation with President Biden on Monday, saying that Russia is showing its intention to make that city unlivable. So, yes, it will make a difference. But again, you know, you see with this congressional delegation, President Zelenskyy using this moment to call for this to happen as quickly as possible.
