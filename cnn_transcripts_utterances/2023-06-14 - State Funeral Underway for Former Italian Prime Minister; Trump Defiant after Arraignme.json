Here are some live pictures coming in for usnow of the funeral for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Thousands have turned out in Milan to say goodbye to the controversial billionaire. He died Monday at the age of 86, after battling leukemia, dominating Italian culture and politics for years. Ben Wedeman in for more on this. Good to have you with, us. Ben, love him or loathe him, he was an influential figure. Today's a national day of mourning in Italy. The official sendoff in Milan happening, thousands gathered. Who was attending? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We understand there are about 2,000 in the Duomo, the main cathedral of Milan. Among them is the president of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella as well as Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister and various other major political figures. However not all are there. Giuseppe Conte, the head of the Five Star Movement, who was the prime minister of Italy in the darkest days of the COVID epidemic, has decided to boycott the ceremony. As far as foreign dignitaries there, a fairly small turnout. We know that Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, is there as well as the emir of Qatar and the prime minister of Iraq. Notably missing, for instance, is Tony Blair, who, at one time, appeared to be a very good friend of Silvio Berlusconi. Blair and his wife, Cherie (ph), actually had a private vacation at Berlusconi's very luxurious Sardinian villa during his time as prime minister. But he is not. There George, Bush who also had good relations with Silvio Berlusconi also notably absent from this ceremony. Outside, in the Piazza del Duomo, outside the cathedral, we're seeing a fairly large crowd, not quite as large as one might expect perhaps, because it is the middle of the work week, the middle of a workday. But yes. It is a national day of mourning although not everybody here is happy that this day, of all days, has been made a national day of mourning, which actually normally does not happen even when a prominent public figure dies. In, fact the University of Siena for foreigners has refused, for instance, to lower its flags to half mast because, according to the director, it would make the university lose its moral credibility. So as you can, those who've turned out in Milan today are clearly supporters of the late former prime minister. But there are other Italians who don't quite feel the same way -- Lynda.",

But many people believe that he's debated -- he debased Italian public life withsome of his off-color humor, his scandals, his endless legal troubles. Don't forget that, in 2013, he was convicted of tax evasion. So the feeling is that certainly he changed the tone. He made Italian politics a bit more lively than it was before. But he did not necessarily change much in terms of ordinary daily life in Italy. At the end of his term as prime minister, his terms as prime minister, in 2011, the Italian economy had actually shrunk since he came into office back in 1994. And Italy's public debt skyrocketed during his time in office. So it is hard to say if he actually leaves a lasting legacy beyond his change, shall we say, that he brought about in the tone of Italian politics -- Lynda.",

Our thanks to you.Former U.S. President Donald Trump is celebrating his 77th birthday today after an unprecedented court appearance in Miami on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty to 37 charges related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents, making him the first former U.S. president to be charged and arraigned for alleged federal crimes. Trump told supporters after the court hearing the charges are fake and fabricated. And he claims he had every right to have the documents. CNN's Sara Murray reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Former President Donald Trump maintaining his innocence in the face of 37 federal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I hadn't had a chance to go through all of the boxes. It's a long, tedious job. It takes a long time. Which I was prepared to do but I have a very busy life. MURRAY (voice-over):  Trump speaking before a crowd of supporters at his Bedminster golf club, capping a historic day that included the first federal arraignment of a former president. REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  We cannot deny what president Trump did was wrong. I, mean it is clear as day wrong. SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK):  I do not care if you are a Trump supporter or a Trump oppose or.

Nauta could not enter a plea because he did not have a Florida lawyer present.

Trump's attorney objected, insisting that many of the witnesses in this case are people employed by the former president. The judge clarified that Trump could not speak about the facts of the case with any of the witnesses including Nauta and asked to provide a list of witnesses in the case. Also present in the courtroom, special counsel Jack Smith, though he did not speak during the hearing. Trump was greeted by a crowd as a motorcade left the White House. He made an unannounced stop at the famous Cuban restaurant Versailles in Miami's Little Havana where he was met by dozens of supporters. He entered the restaurant with Nauta by his side and spoke to religious leaders. After the indictment, Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, spoke about the charges after previously urging the Justice Department not to indict the former president. MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   I have the opportunity to read the indictment that was filed. I can't defend what's alleged. These are serious allegations and the handling of classified material, as I learned in my years as vice president and my years on the Foreign Affairs Committee is a serious matter that bears upon the national security of the United States.

He signed some forms to that effect, saying he will show up as this case progresses to trial. The other thing is that there is a special restriction the judge placed on him yesterday, something the Justice Department nor Donald Trump's own defense lawyers wanted to happen. But the judge did adds to his provisions -- and Trump has to agree to -- which is that can't discuss the facts of this case with either his codefendant, Walt Nauta, the man accused of carrying those boxes with classified documents throughout Mar-a-Lago, trying to obstruct justice. Or he cannot also speak with anyone who is a witness or potential victim in this case that the Justice Department will identify in the Trump legal team about the facts of the case. So some provisions over what he is able to say behind closed doors. There's also the situation where, now that Trump is under arrest, it's very common for defendants in the United States to be able to know. And they must know that any statement they make publicly could be used against them in the court of law. Donald Trump already is not having any qualms about speaking publicly about this case. Here is one of the things he said at a speech last night just after this arraignment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  As president, the law that applies to this case is not the Espionage Act but very simply the Presidential Records Act, which is not even mentioned in this ridiculous 44-page indictment. Under the Presidential Records Act, which is civil, not criminal, I had every right to have these documents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So he is voicing some legal arguments but he also is saying there, essentially, that these are documents he had, which is the sort of thing that could potentially become part of the case, a statement like that because this case is not about Donald Trump himself having the documents, although he is accused of having them.

It is a national day of mourning in Italy and an unusual situation for a funeral, a state funeral like this. He, of course, was a divisive figure. He had a career that was punctuated with scandals with various legal trials. He was only convicted once for tax fraud-related charges. He was barred from returning to office.
