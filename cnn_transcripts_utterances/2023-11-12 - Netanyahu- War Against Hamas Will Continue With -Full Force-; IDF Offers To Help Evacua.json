Now, of course, the Israelis share with reporters the number of times that they have texted and called residents throughout the Gaza Strip because they can figure out who's in a specific location and find their phone number and call them directly and ask them to leave. But that hasn't gotten enough things out of the way.

      "sentences": "We hear a lot about these new medicines, Ozempic and Wegovy, because of the large amounts of weight loss they seem to produce. Now, Ozempic specifically is approved for type II diabetes. Wegovy is approved for obesity. And one of the key questions is, in addition to weight loss, does that actually translate into a benefit for preventing things like heart attacks and strokes and heart related death?Now, in a landmark clinical trial, we are learning that indeed there is a benefit there. We saw the top line results from this study over the summer. We learned that Wegovy reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart related death by 20 percent compared with placebo. But we didn't know a lot more of the details of that trial. And those are getting reported this weekend at the American Heart Association conference in Philadelphia. Now, the results are essentially supportive of what we already knew, but we are learning more details, mainly that the biggest benefit was seen in preventing heart attack. Also, that no new safety signals about these medicines emerged. Although we did see that more people stopped taking the drug Wegovy versus placebo because of things like gastrointestinal issues, those are really the main side effects associated with these medicines. Now, that question about weight loss and heart benefit, one of the key questions is, is that benefit because of the weight loss or because of other things that this medicine does? And these results don't answer that question super clearly. In fact, experts told us that perhaps it was some mixture of both. In the study, we saw weight loss of about 9.4 percent among patients taking Wegovy. And now that's a little bit less than we've seen in other trials of this drug where weight loss was closer to 15 percent. We also saw that the drug had benefits on other things like blood sugar, blood pressure, lowering a marker of inflammation, and also lowering triglycerides. So, there was this whole constellation of benefits of this medicine, in addition to weight loss, that may then be translating into this heart benefit we're seeing. Now, experts do expect that these results will increase demand for the medicine and may also increase insurance coverage which would be a welcome thing for many patients. This medicine costs $1,300 per month before insurance, and coverage hasn't been great for all patients. But in terms of supply, if the demand really is increased here, that could be problematic as well because it has been in shortage. But doctors are very excited at this conference about potentially having this new tool to not just help with weight loss, but also to prevent heart attacks, strokes and heart related death.
