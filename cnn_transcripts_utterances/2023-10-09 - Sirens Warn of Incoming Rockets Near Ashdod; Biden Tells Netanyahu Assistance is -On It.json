Look at them arcing up. This is the defensive missile system taking off.The sirens were going off around here. And you can see -- I can see black smoke rising just to the left of the Iron Dome. That's new black smoke. Black smoke often indicates an impact. We don't know that right now. But we have seen at least several dozens of these interceptor rockets, the Iron Dome, taking off here. The sirens have gone off. I'm looking down the highway. The traffic stopped here. Everyone is getting out of their vehicles to find a safe space to hide. And you're hearing the booms there of the intercepts that are happening. Look to the right, to the right now, there's another impact it appears. That dirty dust that's rising up from the fields in the distance there, that appears to be an impact of the rocket landing right there now. So, these are rockets -- Hamas rockets coming through Gaza, the Iron Dome trying to intercept them, landing here Obviously, this is part of Hamas' ongoing offensive. And the number of Iron Dome interceptors launched seems to indicate quite a large barrage of rockets that have been fired out of Gaza at the moment. Kasie.",

The U.S. often supplies, helps Israel build this system. They've asked for more help from it. Obviously, this entire situation has been unprecedented. But it does seem like this system is holding for now.

Generally, the stocks are high in anticipation of events like this. The United States supplies more ammunition as required by Israel. I think it goes without saying, at the moment, that those flows of ammunition will be ready, will be coming. That's the commitment we heard from President Biden.The way the system works, the system works across the country. The Iron Domes, wherever they are on the ground, like the one we saw firing out there, interlocks with other Iron Dome firing systems throughout the country. Where missiles are fired from Gaza, the system reads, detects where the missiles are precisely coming from and where they're calculated to be going. And the nearest and best available Iron Dome system fires off to intercept those Hamas rockets as they come into Israeli territory. That's what we're witnessing right now.",

Obviously, that effort has been stymied by the dysfunction in the House and the fight over government spending.Now, that fight continues for more in Ukraine aid, but there's also this ongoing war in Israel that is going to draw a lot of attention away from Congress. Already there's a push in the Senate to get a confirmation for U.S. ambassador to Israel, that post is currently vacant.

He wants an official visit to the White House, which he was granted by the president.Netanyahu is supposed to visit Washington and have that official White House meeting by the end of the year. Obviously, whether that happens remains to be seen. But Biden has expressed a lot of concern with Netanyahu's leadership. Concerns about the domestic overhaul related to the judicial system that a lot of democracy advocates have been concerned about. Now, this completely transforms that relationship. Biden has obviously been a staunch and longtime ally of Israel, and very concerned about the security situation there. So, this will bring them closer together.
