Two million people are in the path of twisters and hail and winds up to 65 miles an hour. This powerful storm is expected to continue throughout the overnight hours.So, we have lots to talk about along with a CNN's senior legal analyst Elie Honig. Also, Lauren Leader, cofounder and CEO of \"All In Together.\" And CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp. You know, it is such a time that we are in right now. I would love to hear from all of you in the sense of, you know, we are in a space, S.E., where there is so much progress and yet still a lot of work to be done. It is a conflicting feeling. How do you feel? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, you know, look, I have been in the space for a long time. I'm a gun owner, and I was a gun rights activist at the time. And I remember, before I quit, a lot has changed since Sandy Hook, and Sandy Hook is one of the reasons I left. The progress has been for law-abiding gun owners, responsible gun owners who have decided in many cases to part with the NRA. And so, they are too extreme, and we want to come out and be part of a solution instead of just defending, you know, the Second Amendment as we did. I saw progress earlier this year when good Democrats, good Republicans got together, and brought some legislation to the table and did not do what they usually do. Democrats usually gum up stuff so it does not pass. Republicans usually say no to everything. That is progress. But let me tell you, things are about to get really scary. The day before Roe was overturned, another case came down from the Supreme Court. New York State pistol and rifle versus Bruen. And basically, in it, Clarence Thomas ruled that if you can't find the law from 1791 when the Second Amendment was ratified, you can introduce new gun regulations. So, in West Virginia, for example, a court there decided that it was unconstitutional to have serial numbers on guns. If you have watched a single episode of \"Forensic Files,\" you know, that is how most cops solve gun crimes. In Texas, a judge decided that it was unconstitutional to prohibit someone who was a domestic abuse or from owning a gun because in 1791 in Texas, spousal abuse was not a crime. This is wild. We don't talk about that enough. That has me very, very concerned.",

The fact is that vast majority of Americans -- I mean, across the board, gun owners, et cetera, want some kind of sensible gun laws, particularly when you look at issues like domestic violence, domestic abuse, having access to guns when there's overwhelming evidence that that often, you know, has exponential risk of homicide in that case. So, you know, Americans want the courts to protect them. They want the Congress to protect them. And families who have had little children sitting through shooter drills, you know, that was a huge motivator for voters in the midterms after Trump was elected.

Down power lines are still very active. We don't want to get too close. It is still a very dangerous situation, according to those first responders we spoke to. That tornado came through here and ripped through the backyards of these neighbors. It was earlier that I spoke to these neighbors and they said while they were aware that there was a risk of severe weather, it was just not comprehensible to them that they thought that they were going to take a direct hit. One of those neighbors said that the storm lasted about 10 to 15 seconds, but still, you can see the type of damage left behind. You know, many of these homes are still without power. You can hear the hum of a generator here behind me as crews are continuing to make sure everyone is okay in this neighborhood. We talk to a lot of eyewitnesses here who are just shell-shocked by what they went through. It is not lost on them that this happened, you know, just before Christmas. I spoke to a little boy earlier who said -- you know, it is just almost heartbreaking, guys. You know, he said he know Santa can still find his home even though it is heavily damaged. We have seen parts of roofs ripped off, backs of houses totally torn. The nature of tornadoes as they come through, they just sort of pick and choose where they want to go. So, you walk down these blocks, you see some homes are relatively untouched and others are just really devastated by the storm that went through here. It is still not quite certain what this neighborhood -- the extent of the damage that this neighborhood has suffered. They will continue to canvas this area tomorrow morning and get more of an indication of exactly what they are dealing with here. This neighborhood, it is a neighborhood that got hit by Hurricane Ida not too long ago. Another tornado ripped through here more than a year ago.
