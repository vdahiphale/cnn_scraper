We'll see what more he says to Jake this afternoon.But this is a test, a moment for his challengers to find out where they think the political winds are blowing. And so far, the ones who are the most interested in trying to pull Donald Trump's voters have not been willing to criticize him. Trump, I think, by announcing this today, and doing so two days after he received that target letter, is basically making a bet that this is going to help him. This is going to help him dominate the news cycle. It's going to help him raise money. And it's going to help him do what he did the last time he was indicted, which is gain in the polls. So we'll see what happens. But I don't think there's any evidence to suggest this indictment will be different from the last one.",

We are following breaking news in both special counsel probes into former President Trump.Right now, his defense lawyers are in front of a federal judge in the classified documents case in Florida. Trump has already been charged in that probe tied to alleged mishandling of government documents. Also today, in the parallel special counsel investigation into 2020 election interference, we now know that Trump is a target of that sprawling probe. He was informed in a letter on Sunday. Those letters often signal an investigation is wrapping up and an indictment is on the way. The former president's allies are rushing to his defense. Here's reaction from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): President Trump was up in the polls and actually surpassing President Biden for reelection. So what do they do? Weaponize the government, go after their number-one opponent. Time and Time again. I think the American public is tired of this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Many of them in line with the speaker of the House. But others are silent, including Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and his top deputy have not said anything. Similar to the past two indictments when McConnell was quiet and Kevin McCarthy was vocal. Underscoring how the two men, the leaders of Congress, deal with the former president, the leader, the frontrunner for their presidential nomination. Some of them also indicating that Donald Trump had little role on January 6th. And I asked several of the House members moments ago about Trump's role on January 6th and whether he believes he was responsible for the violence in the building that day? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So there was bipartisan support to do just that.But there are other calls for other actions that Republicans can take to go after Jack Smith since they control the House majority. Some are talking about going after Jack Smith's budget. That's what hard right members, congressmen like Matt Gaetz and others, are suggesting they should do. The speaker himself has not said whether any action would be taken. He wouldn't answer any questions about if there would be any actions taken against Jack Smith. But, Anderson, that's what the House Judiciary Committee is eyeing. They asked for records from Jack Smith as part of the probe. So the Justice Department does not want to provide that as part of an ongoing investigation. So that will be a point of contention in the weeks ahead.",

He was saying it in a way of defending him. But he did suggest that Donald Trump should have done something on that day. Then he backed off that, and his campaign.
