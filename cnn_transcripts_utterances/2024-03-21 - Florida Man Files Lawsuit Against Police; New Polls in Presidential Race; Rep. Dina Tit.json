All of this happened back in June of 2023 in St. Petersburg, Florida. You're taking a look at body camera video of an officer talking to Heriberto Alejandro Sanchez-Mayen in a grassy lot near some homes. Now, in the video you can hear him tell an officer that he'd fallen asleep after he's asked what he's doing in the area. Initially it appeared that the whole thing would end with a ticket for trespassing, but the officer changes her mind. Now you're about to hear a part of that encounter. The video that you're going to see after this sound here, a warning is a bit disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERIBERTO ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ-MAYEN: You're going to write me a ticket?",

The lawsuit claims that the officer drove in a reckless manner at an unsafe rate of speed.Now, the third piece of video takes place at the jail, where all of this came to an end here. That is where the officer is seen trying to wake up Sanchez-Mayen and drags his limp body out of the van, causing him to hit his head on the bumper. Now, the lawsuit said that the injuries that Sanchez-Mayen suffered left him a quadriplegic and resulted in the amputation of both legs above the knee.

Obviously now Donald Trump's ahead by seven.Now, if you look here, March in 2020, among voters of color, look at that, Joe Biden had a 45 point advantage. You look now at this most recent poll that Ann Selzer put out in March of 2024, Biden still leads among voters of color, but that lead has been slashed to just 11 points. There was just a three-point movement among white voters. The reason why Donald Trump is leading now in this Selzer poll as compared to four years ago, is voters of color. This margin dropping by 34 percentage points. John, I've got to be honest with you, I've never seen anything quite like this from one four-year period to the next.",

I decided to look at our last two CNN/SSRS polls, and it shows a similar pattern among voters of color overall compared to four years ago. Why is this? Why do we see Biden doing significantly worse among voters of color?Look at this. Among voters of color age 45 and older, Biden still has a significant lead. A 35-point lead. Look at voters of color under the age of 45. It's just a four-point advantage, John. Just a four-point advantage. Oh, apparently my sleeve caught it a little bit. Just a four-point advantage for Biden here. So, what's going on in this particular case is, four years ago we did not have this same split among - by this age breakdown. Voters or color basically voted consistently among those older and younger. Now we have a massive split, interesting enough, the reverse split that we have among white voters, where voters of color under the age of 45 are significantly more Republican.",
