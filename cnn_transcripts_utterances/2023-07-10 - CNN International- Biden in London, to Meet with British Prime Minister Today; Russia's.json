Just days ago, the U.S. president's decision to send controversial cluster munitions to Ukraine prompted a rare public disagreement from Sunak, though the White House is downplaying any fracture with the allies. Ahead of his arrival in the U.K., Mr. Biden spoke by phone with Turkey's president and discussed bids from Sweden and Ukraine to join the NATO alliance. Following this is CNN's Nic Robertson, who is joining us from Downing Street in London. Nic, great to see you as always. Tell us more about what we can expect from this meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. How important does this alliance remain after Brexit and other strains?",

So, there is the sense that the pair get on well and have a good working relationship. And look, they've met now six times over the past six months. Interestingly though, across all that time, this will be the first time that President Biden steps into number 10 Downing Street as president.Likely on the agenda, as you mentioned, the run up to the NATO summit, where the countries align and don't align perhaps, on the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO. How that should happen, the methodology, the language that could be used in the communique in Vilnius over the next couple of days. But they're also they're expected to talk about China. These are big joint issues that they faced about climate, big joint issues they face about artificial intelligence and a potential threat therein and the need for controls there, on green technologies, both countries really want to be on the forefront of that. There is a lot of areas where the countries work together. Ukraine is perhaps one of these sort of biggest, as defense partners there, very, very important on the China front as well. So these will be the issues we're expecting them to discuss. Not sure if they'll discuss the cluster munitions. Certainly, as you said, Rishi Sunak saying over the weekend the U.K. is a signature to the agreement that bans the use of cluster munitions, not produce, not to use, and also to discourage other people from using them. So, will that slip into the conversation, not clear.",

But when President Biden's national security adviser brings them both up in the same sentence back-to-back, the F-16s and Sweden's membership of NATO, you know, I think you can conclude that in President Biden's mind, there is a need to keep NATO strong. And there are many ways to do that. And that, of course, involves supporting Turkey in its aspirations for a stronger, more updated air force.[04:05:00] But it also has to balance Greece's desire for the same sort of military equipment, F-16s, and the same sort of upgrades, because there needs to be a balance between Turkey and Greece as well. All of this, of course, ultimately strengthens NATO. But in the idea of the pitch to President Erdogan, Sweden has done everything that you've asked it to do. It meets your requirements. You, President Erdogan, have been through elections, you have won. Now is the time to allow Sweden to move forward. Precisely how that can be connected to the F-16s, what's the language that's used on the phone, not clear. Interesting though, President Erdogan and President Biden expected to have a bilateral meeting in Vilnius. And the final language about Sweden's expected membership of NATO, the final language on that for the communique, that's not clear either.

Certainly, when you listen to the statements coming from Russian officials, they are keen to highlight the United States providing these cluster munitions in a negative way. They are keen to -- would be keen to exploit any differences that emerged from NATO partners. What we've heard from the national security adviser to President Biden, Jake Sullivan, he has said, look, you know, we work together with our NATO allies. We're all working to support Ukraine, all working in different ways. He said we're not hearing any specific criticism on those cluster munitions -- or the United States decision to give the cluster munitions. We're not hearing specific concern on that.And I think one of the sort of underlying parts of the narrative coming from the United States as well, he said there's a lack of overall ammunition that's needed for Ukraine. Ukraine is burning through it at a really massive rate. Every commander you talk to on the front line in Ukraine says we don't have enough ammunition. And this, the United States is saying, is another way to get more ammunition in the hands of the Ukrainians. But it is an area where there will be differences, and perhaps that's why the United States is saying this is time limited. Rishi Sunak, having that statement on Saturday, I think was interesting, if you will, to try to get ahead of what was obviously going to be subject to scrutiny for President Biden and his discussion in a couple of hours.",

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for immediate security guarantees from NATO, arguing that Ukraine is already suffering in a proxy war between Moscow in the West. Ukraine is hoping that NATO can help prevent more bloodshed and Russian war crimes. And right now, the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian officials say that Russia has just committed one more of those. A bomb landed on a school being used as a humanitarian aid center, killing at least four people and wounding several more. Amid all of this, we're seeing the first images of Russia's top army general since the mutiny by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. And Clare Sebastian joins me to sort of unpicked all of those threats. So, Clare, so in an interview on CNN yesterday, Biden said that now wasn't the time for Ukraine to join NATO. Clearly, there's an act of conflict going on. But Zelenskyy continues to push for guarantees for NATO. Why is he doing that?",

And he has been on sort of this tour of Europe over the past week, trying to do some network ahead of the time. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, he met with the Polish president on Sunday in western Ukraine. Some positive noises coming out of these allies, but he really needs something concrete, something written down, something that Ukraine could bank, as it continues to fight against Russia and wait, essentially for the conflict to end, to get a real clear path into NATO. I think weapons supplies and the summit will also prove really crucial to Ukraine, especially those F-16s.",

He appeared is video published by the ministry of defense. We can't obviously verify the date. They say this is a meeting that happen on Sunday, where he's getting a report from the chief of staff of the aerospace forces, a man called Viktor Afzalov, about the Russian air defenses having thwarted several missile attacks by Ukraine. One of them on the Crimean bridge, on the Kerch Bridge. We had actually got video that emerged on Telegram on Sunday of a missile being shot down over that bridge. Russian-backed officials said that that did happen. So this appears to be one of the incidents he's talked about. Also, several attempted Russian -- Ukrainian missile attacks inside Russia. But notable I think because of rumors have been intensifying around the status of Gerasimov. Also I think worth pointing out, but not conclusive in itself, is that the man, Viktor Afzalov giving this report, is the second in command to Sergey Surovikin, who is head of the Airspace Forces. Another general who has not been seen since this mutiny. So, clearly Russia trying to say, look, Gerasimov is here, he's in charge.

Before Congress broke ahead of the July 4th recess, a series of Republicans began threatening to impeach Garland over allegations from IRS whistleblowers that the Justice Department improperly interfered in the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden. And even McCarthy, who has so far taken a pretty measured approach to impeachment efforts, has signaled that he is open to impeaching Garland if these allegations prove to be true. But the big picture here on these investigations is that we're closing in on a period when all of the oxygen in Washington will soon be focused on the 2024 presidential elections. And Republicans want to use this period to thrust what they argue is widespread politicization of the government into the spotlight and damage Democrats as much as possible as we head into election season.
