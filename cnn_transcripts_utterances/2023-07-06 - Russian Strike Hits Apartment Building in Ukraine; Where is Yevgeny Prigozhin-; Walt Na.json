You're looking at this chaotic moment last hour, as Walt Nauta arrived and was greeted by journalists. He is expected to plead not guilty to several federal charges, including conspiracy to obstruct. Prosecutors say Nauta, a longtime loyal aide to Trump, moved boxes at Mar-a-Lago at least five times. During that time, a total of 64 boxes were removed. Only 30 were brought back. CNN's Carlos Suarez is just outside the Miami courthouse where Nauta arrived a short time ago. And we believe the arraignment is literally happening now. Carlos, give us an update.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right.John, good morning. So, 40-year-old Walt Nauta arrived to the federal courthouse here in downtown Miami earlier this morning. He was joined by his D.C.-based attorney, Stanley Woodward. Nauta not did not say a word as he walked out of his SUV and into that courthouse here behind me. Now, CNN has learned that he has also added a South Florida-based attorney, Sasha Dadan. We're told that she is a former public defender with experience trying cases across South Florida. That is according to a source familiar with this situation. As you noted, John, Nauta is expected to plead not guilty to obstruction charges, as well as lying to investigators. His arraignment, we're told, is only expected to last a few minutes. Now, according to prosecutors, Nauta moved at several boxes that contain classified documents from a storage room at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resorts, he moved them to other properties. And then, according to prosecutors, he lied to federal investigators about the whole thing. The move, prosecutors say, was all in an effort -- all in an effort so that one of Trump's attorneys would not be able to find some of the classified documents that had been subpoenaed by a grand jury. Now, the prosecution, the prosecutor, the federal government says that they have surveillance video of Nauta moving these boxes before the FBI searched the property. NAUTA, as you noted as well, is a personal aide to the former president. He was here a when the former president was arraigned. However, because he had yet to get a South Florida-based attorney, he was not able to enter a plea on his charges the first time around. The second time around, when his hearing was rescheduled, he'd yet to find a South Florida attorney, and then bad weather kept him from making it here to South Florida. But again, John, at this hour, we believe that Walt Nauta is being arraigned right now on these charges. We have a team inside of the courthouse getting us all of this information and the details coming out of this hearing. The minute we get that, we will, of course, pass it along -- John.",

      "sentences": "Exactly, Sara.So, what we are seeing in this affidavit from last summer that the Justice Department presented to a judge in Florida to secure that search warrant of Mar-a-Lago to go in there and remove the classified documents that they found, that document last summer tells, very much, much of the story that we also see in the indictment about Walt Nauta, about what he is accused of doing related to obstruction, and also about the false statements he's accused of making to the FBI. He's not named -- he's named as an apparent witness at that time, because he had been talking to the FBI right around that period of time in the summer of last year. But all of these details we're seeing in the affidavit that was released now that the indictment is out, this affidavit from last year, it's why they needed to do this search at that time. They had talked to Walt Nauta by then, and he had said there weren't really boxes that he could remember moving, but they also had surveillance video of him moving boxes at Mar-a-Lago. And they realized at a visit to Mar-a-Lago that federal prosecutors were seeing boxes in this storage room, but they knew that there should have been more there. And they actually wrote in the affidavit to the judge: \"Video footage reflects that evidence has been moved recently. The current location of the boxes that were removed from the storage room area, but not returned to it, is unknown.\" And so that's the reasoning that they were giving the judge, one of the reasonings that they were giving a judge last year to say, we need to do this unprecedented search of the former president's home with the FBI to see what we can recover and to see if there is a case that can be charged. Ultimately, they did charge that case. And that's why Walt Nauta is in court today in South Florida -- Sara.",

Walt Nauta, your take on what you think about this role that we're learning more about that he may have had in the documents investigation, and the case the prosecutors have been building? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, well, I'm glad to be with all of you this morning. I mean, this is sort of just a standard part of the process now. He's entered his not guilty plea, and he's moving forward. I think, probably, the most interesting thing will be the idea of the surveillance tape and how that played into the issuance of the search warrant. It's nothing particularly unusual, if a judge has some belief that maybe evidence is being destroyed or lost or misplaced and may not be available, for a judge to actually go ahead and issue the warrant to protect that evidence. And that seems to be the case here. The issue for the government is going to be talking about and being able to say what was in the boxes that was being moved. We know, if you think about the number of boxes that they allege were at Mar-a-Lago, and you compare that with the number of documents that are in the indictment, it's a relatively small number that clearly would not mean that every box was filled with documents. And so the government is going to need to talk about, what was in the box? What was in the box that was being moved? Are they claiming that somebody is secreting away some evidence? Then what was in that box? And so that's going to become key as they move forward. And we will see. I mean, he's -- this clearly is just another building block in the government's case, and whether or not it's enough to ultimately take down a former president, we will see.",

It lasted all of two minutes, Michael, and Walt Nauta pleaded not guilty, as anticipated, quick, and in and out before they could even probably say much more. And now the process continues. But as you're talking about in this, if Nauta is seen on video moving dozens of boxes of classified documents, yes, they would need to prove exactly what's in those boxes, as you're saying, and then he lied to prosecutor -- investigators as they allege that he did, what does it mean for him and the defense that he will need to put up?",

So, in this case, as you think about we're now talking about a trial, possibly, based on the government's request and this issue about classified documents, very late December, at least, in the year. Well, you're going to have the presidential primaries coming beginning in February. So the government is going to have to do something so that it doesn't give the appearance that they're trying to knock Trump, who, as he enters this case, just like every American enters into it as a presumption -- with a presumption of innocence, they're going to have to do everything they can to show that they're not simply trying to knock him out of the primary season and making him sit in a trial, by attempt -- by appearing to weigh in on a preference for a candidate bringing this prosecution. And so the calendar is going to catch them. And that's why I continue to think this case is likely of not going to have to happen until after the election.",

But when CNN asked him about all that this morning, that story changed. The Kremlin is staying mum, not saying a word about the Wagner leader's whereabouts, as Russian state media has launched a fierce smear campaign, painting the man once considered a Russian hero as a criminal and a traitor. They aired footage also of a police raid at Prigozhin's St. Petersburg home and office and published images of items they say they found during that raid, items like wigs, gold bars, guns, stacks of cash, and multiple passports with different aliases.

And, of course, the first thing that any of us wanted to ask him was about Wagner and about Yevgeny Prigozhin, because he had brokered this deal, supposedly, to bring to an end the dramatic events of last month with Wagner staging a military uprising against the Kremlin.

The Russian missile hit around 2:45 a.m. local, and people were understandably sound asleep in an apartment building there. That building was destroyed. This video we're going to show you shows one of the people who was rescued from the rubble. The death toll stands, though, at five. To give you a sense of the scope of the damage, along with that apartment building, 30 homes destroyed, a dormitory, an orphanage, two university buildings hit as well.

Now, Lviv is where many people fled to during the early stages of the war, certainly fleeing from where we are, the eastern part of the country, to there, because people thought -- it's just an hour's drive from Poland, a NATO member, that perhaps they would be safer. But now, certainly, this is going to raise doubts about the safety of staying there. Now, among the dead was a 21-year-old woman, a journalist, as well as a 95-year-old woman who had survived the Second World War. This incident has also raised questions about the bomb shelters in Lviv. It turns out that, when this strike happened, 10 of those bomb shelters were closed, locked, locked shut, perhaps because nobody was expecting or they were assuming that Lviv would not be targeted.
