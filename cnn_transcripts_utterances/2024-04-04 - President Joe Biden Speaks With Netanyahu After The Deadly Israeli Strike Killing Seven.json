White House Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez joins us live now from Washington, D.C. So, Priscilla, as I understand it, this call is literally happening right now. So, I don't expect you to know what's come out of the call or what the two leaders are exactly discussing. But the fact remains that Biden continues to stand by Israel militarily, just in terms of transferring over a thousand bombs to Israel, also approving about $18 billion worth of military aid in terms of F-15 fighter jets to Israel, as well, getting Congress to approve that. But the fact remains that it's one thing to sort of say that you oppose the way Israel is handling the situation in Gaza from a humanitarian perspective and that you are outraged by the deaths of these WCK workers. It's another thing to actually get Netanyahu to change course. How does Biden actually do that? What tools are at his disposal?",

      "sentences": "Well, one phone call is neither going to upgrade or break the U.S.-Israeli relationship, Bianna.The reality is, if the past is prologue, then I would argue the administration's -- I've described it as its passive-aggressive policy toward Israel -- is likely to continue. This phone call may be strained. The President is clearly and understandably upset as a consequence of the Israeli strike. There may be some disaffection and anger as well about the Israeli strike against the Iranian IRGC team in Damascus, which occurred on the same day as the strike against the World Central Kitchen humanitarian convoy of these three cars. But again, my own conclusion has been a lot of words, a lot of anger, a lot of deep frustration, but no willingness yet, and a great reluctance, I would argue, to impose any serious cost or consequence on Israeli policies for policies the administration may fundamentally disagree with. The levers are there. The President could have pulled any one of the three or four that have been available to him for the last six months. But until now, until this very day, this very phone call, no indication in my judgment that the administration is going to match its anger and frustration with actual actions that you and I would consider significant pressure. But does that mean then that Netanyahu gets a free pass here? You've got to remember that this isn't the first time, when you think about what's happened with the WCK aid workers, that's not the first time that an aid worker has been killed in Gaza. It's almost about 200 aid workers have been killed since the war began on October 7th. And I think that one of the things that people found very tricky was that in the aftermath of these workers being killed, the statement that Netanyahu issued had the words, and I'm paraphrasing, had the words, this happens in war, which triggered a lot of people. It triggered especially Jose Andres himself, who said, look, aid workers are not collateral damage. What does Netanyahu actually need to say to President Biden here? What should he be saying to the U.S. President to continue to count on America's support?",

You mentioned Benny Gantz. It is notable that just yesterday, I believe, he said for the first time that there should be early elections as soon as September. That created a lot of buzz, as well.

They are continuing to push Congress and push their fellow allies to do all that they can to support Ukraine as it continues to fight Russia. But it's hard for them to do that when its own Congress has not voted to approve those billions of extra dollars that are needed to fund this defense for Ukraine. Now, in the conversations in Brussels over the past two days, that was expected to be the focus of the conversation, how to well up support, how to ensure that support continues. And the unspoken, you know, elephant in the room there is the potential of another Trump presidency. We have heard the former president say he would not support continued funding for Ukraine. His allies on the Hill have been the ones opposing this continued funding for Ukraine. So, there is a lot of conversation on how to sort of Trump-proof the alliance if he is elected again. We heard from the NATO secretary general just a few minutes ago, and he said there was an agreement among the allies to move forward on planning for how to have NATO take on a more coordinating role on security support for Ukraine. So, all of this is pushing forward to this meeting in July of the alliance where they hope to have these plans in place to ensure that Ukraine will be fully supported despite or regardless of how the elections go here in the United States. And now the secretary will speak to this a little later today, and we expect him to continue to call for Congress to have that vote next week and to pass that funding. Bianna, Zain.",

And today's ruling is not a surprise, but it is another indication that thejudge in Fulton County, Georgia, continues to move through these pretrial motions, really working through a stack of pretrial motions that are necessary to address before this case can go to trial. Again, Judge Scott McAfee denying Trump's attempt to get this entire case thrown out based on First Amendment claims. You'll remember we watched that entire hearing where Trump's lawyer was arguing that all the false claims that he was making about election fraud and the 2020 election being stolen in Georgia were protected under the First Amendment as political speech. The judge in this case not buying that argument and saying, look, now is not the time to make that argument. You can do so after a trial takes place. Again, we do not have a trial date set for this case in Georgia. The Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has asked for an August 5th start date. We're going to have to wait and see if the judge ultimately puts something on the calendar. But for now, continuing to work through these pretrial motions, even as that question of disqualification for Fani Willis, the D.A., still hangs out there. We're also waiting for an Appeals Court to rule on whether or not it's going to take up the disqualification matter. So, a lot of moving pieces here, but again, a pretty serious box being checked here by the judge in Fulton County denying this motion by Trump and keeping the indictment against Trump intact.",

This is going to be quite a show for about 32 million Americans who live in the main pathhere, plus, honestly, probably about 20 million more, maybe more than that. That's how many traveled to the zone last time we had a big eclipse like this, big total eclipse. We expect more because the zone is actually a little wider. All of this to see something that's going to last for three and a half to four minutes. What does the path look like? Well, it's cutting right through the middle of the country, starting down here from Mexico, in through Texas, all the way up to Vermont, and then on into Canada. This is the area everyone's going to be trying to get to. Some weather questions about storms along the way, clouds up here. It's going to change hour by hour. People will sort it out, but there's concern also about people coming and going on crowded roads in case you get big storms. What are the do's about this? The do's are always wear eye protection. This is something that can really mess your eyes up because you get lured into thinking, well, the sun's mostly covered. Not the case. The only time you can view it without eye protection is in those few moments of totality. You have to be very careful there. And, specifically, they have to be at an ISO of this level, according to NASA, because you want to make sure that you have real protection. Any damage to this lens, crinkling, scratching, throw it away, start all over. And among the other do's, don't look through camera lenses, telescopes, binoculars, or sunglasses unless those are independently filtered. Why? Because those are going to focus that sun, and it could damage your eye just as well. For all of this, though, what people are hoping is that many people are going to come into this area and really enjoy the kind of show that you may only get once in a lifetime. Zain, Bianna.",

That was the first time astronomers could see that maybe the fabric of the universe does bend and shift our perception of stars. And, wow, what a breakthrough that was. Now, the biggest mysteries of our biggest star in the solar system is the corona around the sun. This is the outer atmosphere of the sun, which is millions of degrees hotter than the actual surface of the sun. And nobody knows why for sure. And because the corona is harder to see because the sun is so blinding, during the eclipse, they can study it. And that's why they're going to fly these WD-58 or 57, WB-57 aircraft. They can go very high, twice as high as a commercial flight, go for six hours, and stay in the eclipse path measuring the corona in different forms and fashions. Just one of many experiments going on.",
