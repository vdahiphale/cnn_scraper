And to try to stay ahead of this intelligence which we have seen crop up even including in political ads. So there are some commitments here that are important, some of what you laid out, including, clearly labeling AI generated content, we have seen content, again come up. For example, in those political ads, where it's not clear that its AI generated, or at least it is sort of at the top, left or right corner. And so this is an effort to make that more clearly and as well as allowing outside experts to test the systems before releasing them to the public. So all of this is significant, but to your point, and what you stress, it is voluntary commitments by the seven leading artificial intelligence companies, names you'll recognize, including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, among others. And these executives will be meeting with President Biden this afternoon, and he'll talk more likely about what he wants to see come out of these commitments. We also know that behind the scenes, officials are working on executive actions. And we expect those to come out later this summer, again, all focused on artificial intelligence. So really, there has been this year, an ongoing effort behind the scenes to wrap their arms around this as it emerges. And now it's starting to come up in a more public way.

I just want to show you a heat map. This is from the European Space Agency. This was Tuesday of this week and the land surface temperature for Rome in Italy and Bucharest in Romania hit 45 degrees centigrade, it was 50 degrees centigrade in occasion Cyprus and the city of Catania in southern Italy. So as a result of that some tourist attractions have to have limited hours or even be closed. There have to be tourist operations to try and ensure that any tourists are queuing for attractions have shade and water. This is a big operation. The big question is for the Southern European nations that rely so heavily on tourism for their economies, will it put people off. We have been looking into it currently, according to low cost carrier Easyjet and some travel agencies, doesn't appear to be a huge drop off at this stage. And I can show you Europeans preferred destinations, the most popular spots in Europe right now, according to the European travel commission, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Croatia, all of the hottest locations. But interestingly, ETC did say this thing that people flying to the Mediterranean between June and November of this year, it's declined about 10 percent from last year. Now that could also be to do with affordability and a huge drop off from that post COVID resurgence we saw in tourism last year. But it might be the beginning of a trend and more interesting perhaps is the fact that there's been a surge in popularity, Zain, for Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Ireland, which certainly have cooler climes, so we could be seeing the beginning of a shift. And experts also wonder whether we might see some of these Mediterranean hotspot locations. Perhaps the tourist season that people want to hit is actually before or after July in August, Zain.",

It could have been a whole lot more, a really funny line from one of the English journalist Sid Lowe saying the best way to sum this one up on a wet and windy night in Wellington, the Costa Rica goalkeeper got cramp.

While we certainly are sponsors of the event itself, our relationship with FIFA with the EnglandEnglish football association with specific clubs with New Zealand football is about supporting grassroots clubs, so that we know that when women's clubs, you know, thrive, women can thrive. And we do that in a way that's unique to Xero. Of course, we are a small business accounting platform. And we believe that clubs need to be financially sound. And so, we're providing a variety of education and financial literacy tools as part of our long term partnership with FIFA in clubs around the world.",

I mean, women are making aquarter on average compared to what their male counterparts -- . And by the way, the women's football team, Team USA, for example, is one of the best teams in the world. I mean, they've won the World Cup twice, we will see what happens this time around whether they win it for a third time, but that is incredible. They have an incredible record. You know, obviously in terms of just making it much more equal financially, TV coverage is a huge part of that, getting more eyeballs on the sport is an important part of that. When you have gender equality in a sport that is popular, like soccer, like football, what is the sort of wider ramifications for society at large?",

I think that U.S. team andU.S. Soccer made some big strides in announcing equality of that prize pool for both men and women. And as you hit it, you know, when players and teams of all sizes thrive, you can really see this, this sport, attract even more top talent and become even bigger. I mean, there is no doubt that as we talked about, you know, women's coverage and women's interest or people's interest in women's soccer is exploding. But once that prize pool and kind of financial equality happens, you then see a higher and higher virtuous cycle. And the attraction is really top talent top talent increases top viewership top viewership increases the prize pool, and away we go. So I think there is a lot to be said, for FIFA's intention to get equality here in the 26 and 27 World Cups, that's what they've stated. We've seen the U.S. Soccer Association make the same commitment. And it is very important to have that virtuous cycle up into really making this a world class sport as it deserves to be.",

One a film about an iconic doll beloved the worldover, the other the story of the man they call the father of the atomic bomb, very different. This summer though strange bedfellows Barbie and Oppenheimer are battling for Box Office supremacy as their respective star turns hit theaters. It could be the highest grossing movie weekend of the year in the U.S. and a rash shot of summer excitement during a time of Hollywood, -- Labor chaos. Jason Carroll is queuing up for his tickets right now. He joins us live now from outside a movie theater in New York. I think I used to live around there. I think you are somewhere in Midtown. But I used to live near anyway. So it's nice to see my former home behind you. But one thing that I'm really excited about is not just watching both movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer. But if Barbie does really well, it could be the highest grossing movie for a female directed film that is huge. Walk us through it. JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, yes, could be a lot of first here. There's a lot of hope, and also a lot of hype surrounding all of this in terms of hope. The hope is that these two films can really do something to bolster the theater community since they really been struggling post pandemic. But the big question that a lot of fans have is which one to see first. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARROLL (voice over): Probably not much of a surprise when one hears something odd has come out of Hollywood. But now there's this. That's not a clip from a real movie. It's a fan driven mash up of two. And it's the answer to anyone out there trying to figure out what to do when two potentially blockbuster films open on the same day. Barbie, Oppenheimer. The internet's answer is to see both Barbenheimer.",
