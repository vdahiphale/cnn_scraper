And he has virtually no detractors in the party. Right now, I don't know if there is any reason for DeSantis to have to respond. I think what Trump is doing looks weak, desperate, and none of it is really sticking. He is kind of flailing things at the wall. Some spaghetti here. It is kind of running down and not sticking up there. I think DeSantis is OK for now. Obviously, Trump is not going to stop and he'll ultimately have to engage him.

      "sentences": "Well, look, this poll, the CNN poll out today is better for DeSantis than some of the other recent national and state polls have been.But whether the poll showed Trump ahead or DeSantis ahead, Brianna, they all show some similar patterns that I think are going to drive this race. The most important is, as in 2016, there is an enormous divide in attitudes about Trump along lines of education in the Republican coalition. In this poll, Donald Trump is winning 43 percent of Republicans without a college degree, which is very similar to his showing in 2016. But he is only winning 23 percent of Republicans without a degree, which is considerably weaker than his already modest showing in 2016. Those white-collar voters, ultimately, I think have to be the foundation of any coalition that can beat him in the primary. I think one question for DeSantis is that he is leaning so hard into culture war confrontations, basically saying he is offering Republican voters Trumpism without Trump. I will fight your cultural wars but I am not facing investigation for, you know, hush money to a porn star. The risk for him is he is going so far in this direction that he does not consolidate what is clearly the biggest bloc of voters in the Republican electorate that are dubious Trump, which are the college educated Republicans.",

It is still at a minority here but that is a big minority, 38 percent. It's nearly doubled. What do you think is going to happen here? Will that continue to shoehorn Republicans into continuing to play footsie with white nationalism even if they don't want to but they're going to go that direction?",

I think it is completely wrong.You do not have to do anything with it in order to be the Republican nominee. It has no place in our party and no place on the American political spectrum. I do think there are legitimate concerns being raised by Republicans out there about corporate endeavors and other sorts of cultural push and pull that, you know, some people on the left want. Some people on the right want to go against that. So you're going to have that kind of debate. But it is a far cry from saying, if I oppose, say, DEI, you know, and Corporate America, I am somehow in bed with white nationalism. So I just don't really accept the premise of that idea. [13:40:06] Trump - to go back to what Brownstein said a minute ago, I think he's exactly right. Trump, on the non-college, totally correct. DeSantis, on college educated is correct. And I would say, I have an easier time believing DeSantis can cut into the non-college than I think Trump could cut into DeSantis' existing college educated base. That is why I've always thought, even in the polls that show Trump ahead DeSantis has more room to grow than Trump because I'm not sure where he'll find the extra coalition out of college educated voters.",

That if there was another Republican who was saying something that they thought was bigoted, and they didn't think should represent the party, they would come out against it. Right? I mean, but sometimes you'll see that they don't come out as vociferously as they used to.

And so I think what you'll find, if you look into it, is that when people stray off in this ridiculous direction, most Republicans actually know the difference between right and wrong on this. I'm not saying Trump does necessarily because he obviously makes terrible decisions. But I think, at least in that most recent example, where somebody was trying to include somebody that has sort of a stupid and horrific ideology, it was widely condemned by virtually every corner of the Republican Party.",

There are very few Republican voters, very few Americans over all who share the precepts of outright white nationalism. There is no question the Republican coalition, particularly in the Trump era, is centered on the voters most uneasy about the way the country is changing, demographically and culturally. You see in polling, up to three-quarters of Republican voters say discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities. Over 70 percent say the growing number of immigrants is undermining American culture. Three-fifths to two-thirds say society is too soft and feminine and it's punishing men just for acting like men. Donald Trump, in his speech in Iowa, noted last night that he got louder applause talking about how classroom teaching of race, gender, and sexual orientation than talking about economic issues. That is where the energy in the party is now. That is what DeSantis is trying to appeal to by essentially offering Trumpism without Trump. The question remains, though, is that a national majority? I mean, the dividing lines between the parties now is not so much economic as it is how you feel about the way the country is changing. That is a fundamental fault line in our politics. And it is clear the energy in the Republican Party is for candidates who express resistance to that in all sorts of ways, from classroom censorship to book bans to what is happening on LGBTQ rights in the red states.",

He made that announcement last night.Our team has obtained the transcript from what was a hearing late last week where this judge explained why he wanted to keep the date and time of tomorrow's hearing off the public docket until the very last minute. He put it this way, \"Because of limited security resources and staffing, I will ask the parties avoid further publicizing the date of the hearing. This is not a gag order, but just a request for courtesy given the death threats and hazarding phone calls and voicemail that this division as received.\" \"We want a fluid hearing with all the parties being heard. I think less advertisement of this hearing is better.\" But, of course, news outlets over the weekend ended up reporting all of this. And the judge did finally announce the hearing last night. And the reason this is all unfolding with so much scrutiny and a little bit of secrecy is because this is the first major abortion case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June. And this judge is being asked by an anti-abortion group to block access to an abortion pill that's been approved by the FDA for 20 years and it's used in the majority of abortions nationwide. Meaning, the majority of abortions are now performed with this medication. So if this drug, Mifepristone, is blocked, women in states that already ban most abortions, they'll have their access to abortion virtually disappear. And even women in states where abortion is still legal, they will have a much tougher time because access to in-person clinics will be harder to come by if this medication abortion is no longer available since it's the most common method of abortion up to about 10 weeks. Brianna, there is a lot on the line here in this politically charged case that really could affect millions of women who might rely on medication abortions now and in the future. So this is a hearing that will play out in a Texas courtroom. It will be tomorrow morning. 9:00 a.m. Central time, 10:00 a.m. Eastern. It has drawn a lot of scrutiny, a lot of controversy, and who knows what we'll see outside the court tomorrow. But obvious concerns about any violence or protests - Brianna?",
