Now it's not without its risks. There could be hostages in those tunnels.

New video shows what overwhelmed hospitals are now facing and we want to warn you, viewers may find the images disturbing.The video was shot at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Wednesday, and shows those injured being treated on the floor amid chaotic scenes. Many casualties were brought in on Wednesday after a reported strike. Several other hospitals in Gaza also reported receiving a high number of civilian casualties that same day. The Hamas-controlled health ministry said Wednesday, the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 18,600. And it's not just the expanding war but also the weather that's bringing more misery to Gaza's displaced population. Heavy rain has flooded makeshift tents and some have had to dig trenches to try to keep the water out. In less than two hours, the Russian president is scheduled to hold an end of year news conference for the first time, since his country invaded Ukraine. Vladimir Putin will likely be asked about his recent announcement that he's seeking a fifth presidential term with the elections in March. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian leader might enter the new year in high spirits after the U.S. failed to pledge any new military aid to Ukraine. And that lack of funding from the U.S. has Ukraine's president trying to strengthen ties with the European Union. Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Nordic leaders in Oslo on Wednesday with the Norwegian prime minister pledging nearly $800 million in additional support for Ukraine.

Now, just for context, this would be a strictly political decision if they do manage to come to consensus on starting negotiations for Ukraine to join the E.U.In reality, this process takes many, many years. The average, according to the Pew Research Center, is four years between starting negotiations and actual membership. So, it wouldn't be an immediate membership for Ukraine. But obviously, it would be a major boost, given the weak that Ukraine has had with failing to get U.S. aid through Congress. Now, obviously, consensus is not guaranteed. You talked about the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. I want to read you a tweet that he put out just yesterday, which makes his position extremely clear. He said, Ukraine's swift accession to the European Union would have devastating consequences for European farmers, the E.U.'s budget, and European security it serves the best interests of neither Hungary nor the European Union, and therefore, we cannot support it. Now, there is more to it than he laid out there. The backdrop to this is that the European Union has been freezing 10s of billions of funds for Hungary they then unfroze some of that yesterday, which one European member of parliament described as the biggest bribe in E.U. history.

And it's interesting to think that more countries voted to demand a ceasefire in Gaza than voted last year to condemn Russia's aggression in Ukraine.And so, I think the U.S. veto the ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, its opposition to the G8 Resolution has made it increasingly isolated internationally, and that's putting a lot of pressure on Biden. It's clearly a worry for him. His comments about indiscriminate bombing are really a signal to Israel, I think, that U.S. support is not necessarily totally unconditional or open-ended when it comes to this particular operation.",

And I think that if Biden did want to send a signal of his disapproval of the way that the current campaign is going, not vetoing that proposal would be an interesting move. If I had to guess, I would say it would be unlikely.But I think the key thing that Biden needs to do is get out of this zero-sum politics of just a ceasefire on its own. There needs to be a package that includes some sort of transition that reassures Israel on security, but also reassures the region and the Palestinians that there is a plan for the day after because, right now, my sense is that a ceasefire on its own is a nonstarter for Netanyahu, and that's really what putting a lot of pressure on Biden, why he's sending people to the region, including Jake Sullivan this week, to talk about what some of that package might look like.",

I expect that will be a key line from Jake Sullivan's trip to Jerusalem today. But Netanyahu has said that he will not allow the Palestinian authority back into Gaza. So the short term, it does not seem like there is PA option.In the long term, that may be what is needed. And the U.S. now seems to putting a lot of emphasis on the idea of an Arab coalition to help the transition. Early this week, in Qatar, many Arab leaders said they wouldn't send a presence or troops. But I think this then leaves us with what may have seemed like an unimaginable option, which is a bolstered U.N. or the U.N. plus some other presence in Gaza. And this is something that I think needs to be considered seriously. The U.N. is already on the ground there. You've got the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. U.N. agencies are delivering humanitarian aid. There is a political office in Jerusalem, some of the long-standing U.S. Military Observer Missions are in Israel right now, (inaudible). There is a U.N. Peace Operation along the Lebanon-Israel border. And so, this is a lot to draw on already. Of course, Israel may not trust these on their own. But some often were it maybe a U.N. plus some sort of transitional presence, maybe partnering with some of the Arab neighbors, maybe jointly led by the league of Arab states in the U.N. It could include some European troops too. UNFIL (ph) has mostly European troops along the border because Israel trusts them more. I'm not advocating for any of these, but I think these are the kind of options bringing together different actors with the U.N. involved.
