It's not until now that the winds have eased just a little bit as Debby continues to push inland.And we've been able to come out and kind of see if there's any damage around. And we did find a tree that totally snapped here. You can see where it just got caught. The bark totally shredded. And it's laying down on this house here. All of the branches that even took down a piece there some of the metal and the shingles there, some of the gutter from this home. We had some intense winds this morning because we had the category-one landfall with 80-mile-per-hour winds. This storm was able to rapidly intensify right before landfall because these ocean temperatures are just so warm. But really the story here is that the residents are at least happy that this is not as bad as Idalia was. Idalia hit just nine miles away from here last year. It was a category three storm. We've even found some pictures of some homes, businesses and buildings that have been hit by both. A lot of this area here has been hit by both, seeing some of the flooding from a Debby this morning and getting hit by Idalia. A lot of the docks that we were at this morning, we're brand new, just put in place after they were destroyed last year. Now, as we go through the rest of the day, we're really looking at a flash flood threat. Let's take a look at the radar. You can see the intense heavy rain bands continuing to push north, getting into northern Florida and parts of Georgia. As we continue as we go through the day today, we will continue to have a tornado threat. We have a tornado watch in effect for much of north Florida going into Georgia until 4:00 because we still have these outer bands that are twisting and spinning and can drop some brief tornadoes. After that, the track is concerning because it doesn't go anywhere. We lose all steering currents. This thing slows down. And that will prompt some prolific rain totals. We're looking at 10 to 20, even 30 inches of rain possible parts of the low country of Georgia and South Carolina, which would be unprecedented and can again be catastrophic -- guys?",

Some of the windows have been smashed, boarded up now.Protesters, rioters, rather, attempted to torch the building at one point. And there is a huge amount of concern around the safety and security of Britain's minority ethnic communities. The government has pledged further support for these communities. They've announced further protection for mosques, for example. We've seen a lot of Islamophobia being expressed at these riots. But of course, the government has said that has already carried out a number of arrests, hundreds of arrests, in fact, as some have appeared in court earlier today. But that they are still continuing to look for those involved. But this is a priority for the government. That being said, we have seen signs of support as well for minority communities, community members, volunteers showing up to clear the debris following the unrest over the weekend. We've seen people coming out in support of immigration, of asylum seekers and refugees coming to the United Kingdom. But on the flip side, we are also hearing from far-right organizations calling for further riots throughout the week, including in the capital, London.

LEE CARTER, FORMER REPUBLICAN POLLSTER &amp; PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY PARTNERS: Here's a real opportunity to be sure. And I think it has surprised the Republicans in a very meaningful way. I think most people looked at Kamala Harris as someone who was not a big threat. I think she had very unfavorable numbers. And for the last two weeks, she has done nothing but close the gap where Trump was really weak. And I think -- I think she's done that for a number of a number of reasons. One, she's run a very smart campaign. We haven't really heard a lot of conversations, we haven't heard a lot of interviews with her, but she's done some really smart campaigning. And number two, we're watching the Republicans, in many ways, just hurt themselves more than anything. With J.D. Vance, with Donald Trump's comments about Kamala Harris and now about the governor of Georgia, it's just unfortunate. Instead of acting and talking about what's important to most Americans, which right now is the economy, which is immigration, which is women's freedoms and women's rights, those are getting totally left to the side as people are trying to defend or explain away some ridiculous comments that have been made by the former president and his V.P. pick.",

You know, I think just acting like a president is a big deal. And this has really been interesting to watch. This -- I guess, Donald Trump's the latest illustration of Mike Tyson's famous quote, \"Everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face.\" The last two weeks, Kamala Harris has punched Donald Trump in the face with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of fundraising, with incredibly strong momentum and energy and messaging.
