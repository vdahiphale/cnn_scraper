Supporters of this ruling from the judge say that the decision makes handgun sales safer and more regulated. Critics will argue this move now makes it easier for younger people to get their hands on guns. Let's talk about this.Joining me right now is Jennifer Mascia. She's a CNN contributor and also a writer for The Trace, a nonprofit focused on covering gun violence in America. Jennifer, this ruling from this judge seems to go against something of a trend that we've been seeing recently in other states, which is raising the age for gun purchases. What do you make of this ruling in Virginia and what do you think the impact is?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is just the latest in a like a rash of rulings that have overturned foundational gun laws across the country. And this is happening because of a decision last summer. The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association versus Bruen, that seems to have opened the floodgates for a number of legal challenges.The justices ruled that in order for gun law to be constitutional, it has to have an analogue in American history. So basically, it was a gun law 150 years ago, it can stand today. And so that's put a number of laws into question. It's a free for all with gun rights groups and lobbyist groups challenging bans on possession by people who are subject to restraining orders. A 54-year-old prohibition on buying guns while under indictment for certain crimes fell in Oklahoma and Indiana, a 32-year-old law barring the removal of serial numbers from guns. I mean, these are rights or these are laws that a lot of Americans have taken for granted. But they're all coming up for question. Much like last year, the abortion decision, it kind of opened the floodgates for a number of challenges to state laws. That's kind of what we're seeing now with guns.",

So a lot of gun violence victims also fall within this range. The rationale is that, you know, gun ownership is a responsibility that maybe younger people whose minds have been fully developed, are not mature enough to handle.Of course, on the other hand, gun rights advocates and lobbying groups argue that if you can serve in the military, you can also -- you should be able to carry a handgun. Of course, you know, in the military, your gun handling is closely watched, you are trained. So it's quite different than teenagers carrying guns in public concealed guns in public. And the danger is that, you know, some 18-year-olds are high school students. So the danger is that there might be more guns in high schools now.",

And when you look at what US officials are doing here, their outreach extends to countries including Brazil, Norway, Germany, a former Soviet bloc country as well. These are countries that have recently arrested Russian spies. What they're trying to do is see if any of these countries would actually be interested in working with the US to offer up something on the table for Russia, as they try and secure a deal that can get out Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, that Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in Russia on charges of espionage about six weeks ago.And they're also going, however, John, to countries, US allies who don't actually have Russian spies in their custody. And the effort here is to try and see if those countries can offer anything up to the United States that could give them more leverage at the negotiating table, essentially to try and gin up a creative offer to the Russians. This is a global effort ongoing right now. We don't know the exact status of how these conversations with these countries are going. We do know that last year, the US did go to Germany because Vadim Krasikov, he is a Russian intelligence officer who is in German custody right now on charges of murder. They went to him because the Russians actually said that he was someone that they wanted as part of a prisoner swap. Now that didn't go anywhere. So it doesn't look like Germany is actually playing ball there. But we'll have to see if these other countries engage in a substantive way that allows the United States to offer something on the table to the Russians. And we should note that this strategy has taken root really late last year and has increased in its intensity over the last few months and weeks, of course, After Gershkovich was arrested. But really it started when the United States was able to get out Brittney Griner but they weren't able to get out Paul Whelan as part of that prisoner swap late last year.

Rental car companies are holding on to their cars right now, which means that less used cars are moving into the market. Because essentially, they're saying we don't want to pay higher prices, we're going to hold on to cars longer. And that means they don't put their used cars into the market for people to buy.So the advice from car experts right now, if you own a car and you can hang on to it for a little bit longer, try to do so until you can see some good cash rebates on deals. And then if you lease, maybe buy out your lease, if you're not seeing good lease options out there. Moral of the story here, unfortunately, high interest rates, they're going to remain high and high prices on cars going to stay that way. So it's not a great market for a car but if you look for really good deals, you may find a couple but experts saying it's not getting better.",
