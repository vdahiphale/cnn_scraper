And it comes as we are getting new details about what Special Counsel Jack Smith is focusing on.Overnight, CNN learned that the special counsel now in possession of a batch of documents from former Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani's team, that tried to find fraud after the 2020 election. The documents include affidavits claiming there were widespread irregularities and also shoddy analysis supporting and supposedly revealing fraudulent activities. And CNN has also learned that the special counsel is interested in a February 2020 Oval Office meeting where sources say that Trump actually praised U.S. election security. I want to bring in now Katelyn Polantz. She's of course CNN's senior crime and justice reporter. She is just outside the court in Washington, D.C. So, Katelyn, bring us up to speed. I mean, what more are we learning about the stack of documents now in the special counsel's possession?",

We don't know if they are ones that they would be working towards a different case than the one that has already been indicated to Donald Trump, he may be charged with, or if it's that same case.But these documents come from a pretty key figure, a person working very closely with Rudy Giuliani after the election. Bernie Kerik, a longtime friend in New York, also a political figure himself. And Kerik was essentially an investigator or a coordinator, somebody who was sharing information with Giuliani, and keeping a lot of paperwork around the efforts that Giuliani and others were taking to try and undermine the vote of Joe Biden as president. Reports on Dominion voting systems, some of that election secure information that was the computer systems. There was also information that they had in reports about voter fraud that they believed could say that Donald Trump was the winner of the election. That's information that now, these records, the special counsel has en masse, that they didn't have before. Kerik has been holding them back not just from them, but also from the House Select Committee. And so just in the last couple of days, the Trump campaign has decided they're going to allow Kerik to share these documents with the special counsel's office and others. There were also some private plaintiffs in a lawsuit that are suing Giuliani. They were looking for these documents, too. And so those documents, they're going over the special counsel's office. What they're going to do with them, what they're going to find in them, is still remaining to be seen. And Rahel, it's still pretty early today, on Tuesday, one of those days that the January 6th grand jury that the special counsel's office has used for months typically meets. We have not seen the prosecutors from the special counsel's office over at court yet today. So we don't have an indication if that grand jury is going to be in as expected today. But anytime the grand jury is meeting, they can do a lot behind closed doors. They can learn about documents that the special counsel's office has collected. Also learn about witness interviews. Also hear from witnesses, though, we haven't heard of any witnesses that are scheduled to be coming in after a whole bunch of them came in on Thursday and had some pretty dramatic sessions in that grand jury. And of course the other thing that can happen anytime a grand jury is meeting is that they can be asked to approve an indictment. And we are still waiting to see what happens with the possible indictment of the former president after the Justice Department told him he is very likely to be charged related to the 2020 election.",

Prosecutors do not need permission from a judge or anyone else to seek an indictment. There's no particular pomp and circumstance around it.Here's what happens, as a prosecutor, when you get to the point when you decide we're ready to ask for an indictment, you go into the grand jury. Typically, you would give them some sort of summary of the evidence, especially in a case like this. You would say you've heard testimony over the last eight months. Here are some of the highlights, here are some of the transcripts. Do you have questions? Then you present a draft indictment. You say there are however many counts in this indictment. Let me walk you through the law, and then you lead them to vote. And this can happen very, very quickly. We don't know when as Katelyn just said properly, but you can walk into a grand jury as a prosecutor with a draft indictment at 9:30 a.m. and walk out with a signed indictment at 11:00 a.m. It can be that quick.",

Meaning the judge can see it but that's about it. And then at that point you would normally give a heads up to the defendant. You would say, hey, we've indicted you. We're going to need -- in a case like this where you're not going to have an arrest, you're going to have a surrender, we need to set up your arraignment.Now the defense lawyer would say, thank you, would you please send me a copy of that indictment? That's actually up to the prosecutor. And so at that point, Donald Trump's team is free to tell all of us, Donald Trump is free to tell all of us as he's done in the past, hey, I've been told I've been indicted, or perhaps I have the indictment, here it is. The latest we could see this indictment would be at the arraignment. That is the latest point when the indictment could get unsealed. But I should also note, DOJ can actually unseal it before the arraignment. That's what happened last time. So on day one, they told Donald Trump's team, you've been indicted. We need an arraignment. On day two, Jack Smith unsealed the indictment and then a few days later there was the arraignment.",

I could see them actually being used by the prosecution primarily but also potentially the defense. If you want to defend Donald Trump, you go look, people were giving him stacks and stacks of documents. He didn't necessarily read all hundreds of pages, he just saw that and said, OK, they must have evidence.",

And Rudy who's a former prosecutor and his own lawyer, Robert Costello, who is a former prosecutor, would not walk Rudy in for that kind of meeting unless they have some kind of assurance.So it doesn't look to me like Rudy is in the immediate defendant crosshairs of the SDNY. On the other side, I cannot see a world where a federal prosecutor calls Rudy Giuliani to the stand as a witness in a trial. He has major credibility problems. So my best assessment here is they're trying to do due diligence. See what Rudy has, see if it's any -- you see if it's information you can corroborate elsewhere and then move on.",

And there's small text on the bottom calling this a black day for Israeli democracy.And even though this is an advertisement, just goes to show you just the fact that these newspapers would accept this advertisement to take over all over their front pages, that gives you a sense of the mood for much of the country. Now all of it. Some people are very happy with what happened yesterday. But for many people in the country, especially those protesters that we saw all of yesterday and throughout the night, they see this as the beginning of the end, as they say, of Israeli democracy. Overnight, we saw even further protests getting a little bit violent, clashing with police. We know dozens of protesters were injured as they clashed with police on major highways both in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem. We also know that at least a dozen police officers were also injured in the melee. Now this morning, things have been a bit calmer. Last time the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as we noted giving a statement saying that this step was he said necessary for what he said was strengthening democracy but still said the door is open to further negotiations with the opposition because keep in mind, the legislation that was passed yesterday, it's just the beginning. It's just one step to this massive judicial overhaul plan that the Netanyahu government is planning to push forward. This would completely overhaul the Israeli judiciary. Now petitions have already been filed in the Supreme Court to stop this legislation. No temporary injunction has yet been filed.

As we mentioned, their experts visiting the power plant over the weekend. They said that they saw what are called directional anti-personnel mines. Directional of course being important because apparently the direction of these mines is facing outwards away from the plant. Personnel mines, relatively small, designed of course to hurt, to maim, to kill humans. But this does speak to the fact that Russia is very much in control of the plant. The IAEA says that they had been told prior to this that there were mines not just outside, but explosives also inside the plant that raises significant concerns. Ukrainian officials have said that the Russians have placed explosives on the roof, and that could lead to a terrorist act, something that Russia firmly denies. But, John, perhaps in the understatement of the week, the statement from the IAEA, after seeing these mines on the periphery of the plant and this buffer zone outside the plant said that they are inconsistent with IAEA safety standards and nuclear security guidance -- John.",
