Now, the Israeli bombs began to fall early in the morning for the sun rose. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice over): As dawn broke, Israel launched the first of a series of punishing airstrikes, starting in South Lebanon, pummeling what it claimed were Hezbollah targets, hitting, hitting, and hitting again. While Hezbollah battered over the past week, it struck back as it did early Sunday, its missiles reaching deep into Israel to Haifa and beyond. Many others intercepted through text messages and by breaking into local radio broadcasts, Israel warned people to leave and stay away from buildings where Hezbollah might be operating. But the bombing was enough to send thousands fleeing north, the roads packed. (AHMED speaking in foreign language.) WEDEMAN (voice over): \"Strikes, war planes, destruction\" says, Ahmed (ph). \"No one is left there. Everyone has fled. We took our belongings and left,\" yet even those fleeing vowed they will return. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) WEDEMAN (voice over): \"We will be back God-willing,\" shouts this man. \"We will be back. Tell Netanyahu, we will return.\" When and how and to what, unknown. The death toll for one day reached into the hundreds, the wounded well over a thousand, coming after a week of pager and walkie-talkie blasts, and a deadly strike on Southern Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander, but also many civilians. All classes in schools and universities across Lebanon have been suspended, with some schools been turned into shelters for the displaced. [16:05:12 ] Seventy-year-old, Jena Ayyesh (ph) fled her village at 5:00 AM taking shelter in a training institute in Beirut. (JENA AYYESH speaking in foreign language.) WEDEMAN (voice over): \"I buried my son a week ago under bombardment,\" she says. \"My other son stayed behind. He didn't want to leave our home.\" With Israel's air offensive intensifying, it may be some time before Jena sees her other son again, if at all. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera): And the Israeli military spokesmen are saying that they conducted about 1,300 strikes on targets in Lebanon. One of them was on the southern suburbs of Beirut. Apparently their target was Ali Karaki, who is the commander of Hezbollah forces in the South Lebanon. However, Hezbollah put out a statement saying that he was not harmed in that strike -- Richard.",

So after the Hamas' attacks, Hezbollah were a threat and Hezbollah began a day after the Hamas attacks, October 7th last year, with strikes into Israel. Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people from that northern border, but there was always the question going to be, of what does Israel do about the Hezbollah threat? Does it, as the defense minister wanted to, back in October 7th, want to go into Lebanon and take on Hezbollah? At that moment, no. He was persuaded otherwise by the prime minister. They fought in Gaza, but now that war is winding down to a degree, the focus again falls on the north and the pressure on the government to get its civilians back home along the border. It is a very big question that has been out there, but I think what we've witnessed over the past week since the IDF decided to make or since the government decided to make returning civilians to the northern border, part of its war aims is a decision that was going to confront that Hezbollah threat because Hezbollah has been saying they've been firing across the border to support Hamas in Gaza. And now, the Hezbollah proposition is being tested and I don't think anyone actually at the moment knows where that will stop.",

And in each of those instances, I don't know if you could quite say, Israeli leaders ignored that encouragement or pressure, but the two sides did appear to be at odds, right? And then also, I neglected one, and that is on negotiations for the ceasefire and hostage deal.

The Americans being among the most, if not the most important supporters of Ukraine in this war against Russia. So President Zelenskyy, taking the opportunity, this week to not just come to the United States, come to the UN General Assembly to generate continued and increased support for Ukraine's war against the Russians, but also to essentially tell the world that we do see an end game to this, we do see a way out, a way to a diplomatic solution. It is not just about the military solution of defeating Russia and pushing them back. What that entails, we don't know. Of course, there is some speculation that their incursion into Russia when they took that large piece of territory in the Kursk Region of Russia, could be used as part of a trade. We have heard President Zelenskyy reject the notion of giving up any of the territory that Ukraine lost after 1991. Of course, they lost Crimea back in 2014. They've now lost around 30 percent of the country. So we have President Zelenskyy already here in the United States, in New York. He spoke earlier today. As you mentioned, he is going to give his speech on Wednesday, but then the big day, Richard, for the future of the war, he will be going down to Washington to present that plan, not just to President Biden, but to Vice President Kamala Harris.

Now, President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials that I speak with across the board are extremely careful at not coming across as a partisan issue. They don't want to be say a Democratic issue and not a Republican issue. They want to make sure that both parties support them, certainly when it comes to aid. And we have seen that in a large way, but of course there has been some erosion on the Republican side. Now, listen, President Zelenskyy says that Trump has told him that yes, they will continue. He would continue to support the Ukrainians, continue to give them what they need, but I just want to point out now a very interesting couple of lines in an interview that came out yesterday in \"The New Yorker\" of President Zelenskyy in which he told the interviewer, \"My feeling is that trump doesn't really know how to stop the war, even if he might think he knows how.\" And then when talking about the potential future Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy says of him: \"He is too radical.\" So those aren't necessarily the nicest words from President Zelenskyy, but he does generally hedge his bets -- Richard.",

Kamala Harris has favorable ratings, they are higher than Donald Trump's, but ultimately, I think what may doom Kamala Harris in this election has nothing to do with her at all. It is the fact that the man who currently holds a job, Joe Biden has an approval rating that is hovering right at about 40 percent. I can't think in all of the years of polling data of a president, even if the president was going adios amigos, the successor within their party was able to win with the president with that low approval rating. I think that's the underdiscussed factor going on here. The fundamentals actually probably slightly favor Donald Trump, given that we've had a slowdown in the jobs report, given that people still are feeling the inflation. Really the best economic piece of data you have out there is that S&amp;P 500, and to be honest, Richard Quest, I am not sure that will ultimately be enough. But guess what?

An increase -- large increase, in the death toll from Israel strikes on Lebanon from what wewere talking about at the beginning of the program.

Israel says it hit more than 1000 Hezbollah targets, including stores of munitions. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Sunday's state elections in Brandenburg shows his party still has a mandate. According to exit polls, it gave his social democrats a narrow edge over the far-right alternative for Germany. The AfD still has a large enough minority in Brandenburg to potentially win concessions. The Croatian Prime Minister Andrei Plenkovich knows all about working with politicians on the far right. He formed a governing coalition this spring that includes the homeland movement party. Croatia, of course, has remained a strong voice for the E.U. and it benefits, of course, that its members receive. The prime minister of Croatia -- prime minister is with me now. Prime Minister, it is good to see you, sir. I am grateful. This shift to the far right.

So, this is one of the major reasons. The second reason is, of course, not only the consequences of COVID in terms of economic and social crisis, but then, of course, Putin's brutal aggression against Ukraine for last 2-1/2 years causing the biggest energy crisis around the world, and especially in Europe, and the rise of prices of energy. When you combine these three elements with migratory crisis, COVID crisis, change of our habits and the energy crisis with inflatory pressures I guess this is one of the major reasons why people decided to vote for some other political options, rather than the mainstream.",
