This is what you need to know as you're starting your day. Rubio's rise, the man Donald Trump once called Little Marco, is set to be the nominee for secretary of state. And Mike Huckabee, former governor, picked to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Bitcoin's on a rise, jumped up 25 percent since the election in the crypto comeback, what's driving those gains. And the COP commitment, multilateral banks promising to boost climate finance aid. Also, the perfect blend. The aviation startup says it's radical blended wing design will make it fly longer for less. We'll talk about that in the show ahead. We begin, though, with the latest announcements on the Donald Trump staffing for appointments to the federal government and the cabinet, and we're getting them thick and fast. A clear idea is now coming of what the new administration might look like. In the past few hours, Mr. Trump said he would choose the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as his ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is an evangelical Christian pastor who's been a staunch defender of Israel over the course of his career. He also supports Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Florida Senator Marco Rubio is highly likely to be the next U.S. secretary of state. For some reason, Donald Trump has not actually confirmed that particular appointment or nomination. And in the past few minutes, he -- the president-elect has announced he's choosing the former U.S. intelligence chief, John Ratcliffe, as his director of the CIA. Put them all together, Kristen Holmes has more on the president-elect's efforts in building his team. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President-Elect Donald Trump's administration is coming into focus, as the president builds out his cabinet. Announcing Tuesday that former Arkansas governor and Trump loyalist Mike Huckabee would serve as ambassador to Israel, as Huckabee has been a staunch supporter of Israel's and could strengthen ties between the country and evangelical Americans. CNN also learning that Trump is expected to select Marco Rubio as secretary of state. The two men, once rivals, facing off in 2016. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  Have you seen his hands? They're like this. And you know what they say about men with small hands. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  When little Marco spews his crap about the size of my hands, which are big.

HOLMES (voice-over):  Rubio, the most hawkish of his choices, is known for his tough stance on China. Trump has placed loyalists in three other key positions. The president-elect posting on Truth Social today that he has tapped Florida Congressman Mike Waltz as national security adviser. A former Green Beret, Waltz was often by Trump's side on the campaign trail. Trump also choosing South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as head of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem also once thought of as a potential pick for VP. GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD):  We already knew that President Donald Trump was a fighter. HOLMES (voice-over):  But faced political backlash after revealing in her memoir that she shot her 14-month-old dog, and falsely claiming she had met with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. Each of these roles, aside from Waltz, must be confirmed by the Senate. However, Trump is expected to create roles that hold an enormous amount of power, that don't need to go through the same approval.

He's had a very successful real estate career, but to put it mildly, that does not translate into a successful Middle East envoy, but he has the most important qualification, he is close to Trump and Trump trusts him. In that sense, we saw Trump do this in his first term with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who also had real estate experience, but suddenly, became in charge of a whole lot of things, including the Middle East, especially with the Abraham Accords.

But some things that parents need to consider before they post. So, things like your child's physical safety.

Is it to save the planet or is it to save their own skins? And what you basically find is a lot of countries are importing very expensive fossil fuels, and they would rather not do that. So, instead, they import solar panels, they import batteries, and if they do that, they don't have to import expensive oil and gas and coal, and that saves them from, you know, using their scarce dollars that they would rather conserve for a rainy day. And so, there is a lot of other incentives in play here for -- especially fossil fuel importing countries to switch very rapidly towards going clean, and I think that's basically the biggest reason why a country like China moved first and moved fast in the 1990s and 2000s to develop its clean energy, because it wanted to essentially not be subject to an oil and gas industry that is dominated by the U.S., by the Gulf Kingdoms, by Russia, but not China. And so, we see a lot of similar countries like Brazil, India, Mexico, countries that are importing hydrocarbons, choosing to go green to save on their scarce dollars.",
