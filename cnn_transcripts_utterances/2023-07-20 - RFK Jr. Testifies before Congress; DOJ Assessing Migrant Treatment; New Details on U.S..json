The case focuses on his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The jury is expected to hear from more witnesses. It is also possible that the former president could take the stand, although that is highly unlikely. Today is the last day that his lawyers could present their own witnesses or evidence in his defense.",

But it's become so much more than that because Republicans are delving into what they see as the government's role in silencing conservative speech online. And their star witness is the long-shot Democratic presidential candidate and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. This is a live look at the hearing that's getting underway right now. He just, this week, was rebuked by his own family for pushing a conspiracy that Covid-19 was ethnically targeted to spare Jews and Chinese people.CNN's Lauren Fox is watching this one for us.

Specifically claims that Texas troopers have been ordered to deny drinking water to migrants despite blistering heat and even push them back into the waters of the Rio Grande towards Mexico. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security says that if the claims are true, the treatment is, quote, cruel and inhumane. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez broke this story and joins us now from the White House. So, Priscilla, this could be the first step toward an investigation. What more are you learning?",

Those discussions happening between the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department as they watched what was unfolding in Texas with Texas Governor Greg Abbott sending migrants to Democratic-led cities without coordination, then setting out buoys along the Rio Grande, which poses a potential drowning risk to migrants. And now amid these reports about mistreatment of migrants. And so this is a, again, significant development coming from the Justice Department amid those reports that Texas troopers were told not to give water to migrants in the blistering heat and also to push them back to Mexico. Now, Texas Governor Abbott has denied that there was any order or direction to that effect. But the White House press secretary weighing in just yesterday calling this just atrocious. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is what we see over and over and over again from this Texas governor, from Governor Abbott. And it is - it is -- all we're asking for - all we -- as a country, and what we should hold near and dear, is the basic human decency. Basic human decency. And we are just not seeing this from this governor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it happened just hours before the Women's World Cup was set to kick off. A gunman opened fire at a construction site in the center of Aukland early this morning and two people were killed. The shooter was later killed as well. People believe that the incident was related to that man's work there. They determined there is no broader ongoing security risk and that the World Cup opening ceremonies and first match, they went on as planned. An EF-3 tornado ripped through North Carolina yesterday. At least 16 people were wounded from it. And it left a long trail of destruction behind. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado was on the ground for 16 and a half miles. Winds peaked at 150 miles per hour. And you can see what it did. I think we might be looking at the wrong video here, obviously, but what it did do was it left a ton of destruction in its path, even flattening a Pfizer plant in Nash County, which is east of Raleigh. No one was injured, though, at the plant but they're now trying to determine how this will impact production there. The tornado also shut down a major interstate. Someone is waking up super rich today. A single ticket sold in downtown Los Angeles has won one of the largest Powerball jackpots in history. A little over a billion dollars. We'll show you the lucky numbers because I don't really know if it matters anymore at this point. The lump sum take home after taxes is $558 million. The longer payout over time, $1.08 billion.

In fact, take a listen to the chief talk about what else they would like to do in the next few days.

As you can see, there are many questions left to be answered, but only Carlee can provide those answers.
