Jean Carroll in the same room for the first time in decades, and that has an enormous impact on a survivor of sexual abuse. I've seen this so many times in the courtroom. That's emotional for her.

Jean Carroll and about the case.Now, again, he can hold his press conference and get his larger message across if he feels they're trying to interfere with the election, they're coming after me, this is all political, I'm a victim, without going after E. Jean Carroll. But what we've seen again and again and again is he has not successfully been able to do that. Either he doesn't want to or he's just incapable. We saw with the civil case, right? Last week that was a personal, because it's about his business, and he's just completely incapable of staying on message and staying disciplined and not violating, for example, a gag order.

One, is that a problem? Is the 65 or the 31 where people should be focused more? And does that split look the same in New Hampshire? I don't know. BASH:  It's such a good frame of a question, because the answer is both. I mean, both of those, the yes and the no, are very instructive for us about where the Republican electorate is, or at least where the electorate was, the caucus-goers in Iowa. Because, yes, you can look at, oh, my goodness, two-thirds of -- almost two-thirds of these people say, we don't care, it's fine.

She's appealing to the kind of voter that tends to go out for a Republican like her in these primaries. And yet New Hampshire takes pride in a lot of their traditions.One of the traditions is the WMUR debate, the big, most important political station, if you will. People out there know what stations are anymore. And so, like I said, people in New Hampshire take pride in that. And she's effectively saying, I'm not going to do it. It's supposed to be this coming week. I'm not going to do it. So, we'll see if it hurts her.

The main question now, though, is what this big win in Iowa means going forward, particularly here in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire primary one week away.So, I asked our friend, Jeff Zeleny, our senior political correspondent, which counties in Iowa are the most like New Hampshire. He told me, Linn County, which is where Cedar Rapids is. You can see Donald Trump just trounced Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis there, an 18 point win, Haley narrowly edging out Ron DeSantis, so not performing that well here. What makes this a New Hampshire-like county? Well, it's suburban, much like much of New Hampshire. Forgive me, New Hampshire residents, but it's basically one big suburb of Massachusetts. Your suburbs also are more educated voters. Another county that looks a little bit like New Hampshire would be Story County, where Iowa State is. Again, Donald Trump beat Nikki Haley but only by four points here. You can see a lot more college educated voters here. But, again, Donald Trump with the edge. This was a county that Marco Rubio won in 2016 that Nikki Haley would really have to win. I'm highlighting these counties because they have more independent voters, which are voters that Nikki Haley will need in New Hampshire if she hopes to have a chance there. But independent voters in Iowa went for Donald Trump, 42 percent of the vote, Nikki Haley 34 percent Ron DeSantis 18. In New Hampshire, independents will be a huge, huge issue. Let me show you the voter registration here, undeclared voters, 343,000, Democrats, 268 -- Republicans, 268, Democrats, 262. These undeclared voters will hold major sway in the Republican primary. They can vote. The big question, and Jeff Zeleny posed this to me via text, are, are independent voters in Iowa similar to independent voters in New Hampshire? Probably not. They act a little bit differently. How do they know? Well, we can look historically. As we said, Donald Trump's victory in Iowa, the biggest margin ever for Iowa caucuses, edging out this, George W. Bush got the highest percentage before, 41 points. Now, the thing about Bush's victory in Iowa in 2000 is he went on to lose New Hampshire badly to John McCain by almost 20 points. Now, again, McCain didn't really compete in Iowa, but you can see the so- called independent voters in Iowa. They didn't make much of a difference in 2000. They had a huge difference in New Hampshire in 2000. So, those independent voters, they seem to behave very differently there in Iowa and here in New Hampshire.
