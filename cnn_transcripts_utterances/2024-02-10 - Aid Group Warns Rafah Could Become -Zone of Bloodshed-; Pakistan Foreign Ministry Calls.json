We still actually don't have a final result more than 40 hours after polls closed on Thursday. So the Nawaz Sharif's party, the PLN, has not won the most seats in parliament. That goes to the independent candidates affiliated with former prime minister Imran Khan's party, the PTI. None of the political parties at the three major political parties of the country, including the independent candidates affiliated with Imran Khan, have won an outright majority. So now what we're going to have to see is, is who makes a coalition. The most number of seats are again, with those independent candidates, Nawaz Sharif came out and made a rather bizarre victory speech. However, he confessed that they, again, do not have the majority to form a government. So the party of beloved Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, him (sic) and his father have become kingmakers. And they're going to be one of the main movers and shakers in deciding who they will join to form a government with. So it's going to take a little bit more time. There is a lot of rage and anger here amongst the very young, vibrant voters who have come out. And what many are saying have sent a rebuke to the country's powerful military, which according to Khan's supporters and a quantum brand, Khan is well had been responsible for the crackdown on these candidates that also, as you know, lost their very popular electoral symbol, the cricket bats. These candidates who have won a majority at -- who have won the most seats in parliament at the moment, were contesting with symbols like crockery and kitchen utensils. And even then, they've come out ahead. So interesting times. But again, we're still waiting for an official announcement from the election commission of Pakistan.",

The United Nations says last month was the most violent month in more than two years. CNN's Sara Sidner reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A state on the brink of collapse. Haitians are once again rising up in protest, demanding presidential elections that were promised but never delivered. It's been nearly three years since Haiti's president, Jovenel Moise, was assassinated. The power vacuum gains, exacting brutal violence on the population, have over-run the capital Port-au-Prince. The current prime minister, Ariel Henry, has been urging calm and says he will not step down but swaths of the population are rising up against him. Henry took control of the country after being chosen by President Moise shortly before his assassination. A 2022 CNN investigation revealed that investigators believed Henry was at the center of it and a judge overseeing the murder case told CNN that Henri was a main suspect in Moise's assassination, something Henri has denied often. He wrote in a series of tweets, \"The divisionary tactics to seed confusion and impede justice from doing its work serenely will not stand.\" But Henry is largely seen as an illegitimate leader by the Haitian public. The final straw, he promised to move forward with long-delayed elections, signing a deal with representatives of political parties. But the elections never came. Henry now saying elections will be held when the unrest and violence finally subside. Protesters are calling for him to step down. And amid desperation, some Haitians are rallying around a polarizing figure, Guy Philippe.",
