So, it looks like his name will be on the ballot after all.In Maine, Donald Trump is demanding the secretary of state there recuse herself from a similar question.

But that decision is still on the books in Colorado, and it is a really big one. It goes into a lot of depth about Donald Trump being an insurrectionist, according to the Colorado Supreme Court, the highest court in that state, and also their decision that they have the ability to remove him from the primary ballot as the court, as the state. And so all of those questions are going to be very likely before the Supreme Court quite soon.The Colorado GOP is asking for the Supreme Court to weigh in on this idea that anyone in a position of power, like a court or a secretary of state, could be removing a candidate from the ballot. They write in their petition that was filed with the Supreme Court. The Colorado Supreme Court has removed the leading Republican candidate from the primary and general ballots, fundamentally changing the course of American democracy. And its significance is not merely political but legal. Rejecting a long history of precedent, a state Supreme Court has now concluded that individual litigants, state courts, and secretaries of state in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, have authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. So, we're really in uncharted territory here where states are looking at the insurrectionist clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, doing different things with it. And now, the Supreme Court is being asked to set the law of the land. John?",

What it says is that if you take the oath of office to defend the Constitution of the United States and then you violate that oath by engaging in insurrection against the Constitution, just as Donald Trump did in inciting the January 6th attack on the Capitol, you may not serve or run for effectively any office, especially the presidency. It doesn't say especially the presidency, but it stands to reason that if they were concerned about someone who engaged in insurrection having power in our democracy, the last place you would want such a person is in the presidency of the United States.",

Those are actually political arguments, that he needs to be convicted before he can be excluded, that he's so popular and so powerful and so rich that no court can hold him accountable and keep him from serving on the ballot. But the legal questions are very different. And the precedent is clear that no conviction is needed.Free Speech for People, the organization that I work with reestablished that precedent in a challenge to Marjorie Taylor Greene, in which the courts held once again, as they had held in the past, no conviction is needed. The only issue is, did the person take the oath of office, and did they thereafter engage in insurrection? And those are quite clear. Everyone saw Donald Trump take the oath of office on T.V., and everyone saw Donald Trump incite and engage in the insurrection of January 6th, also on T.V.",
