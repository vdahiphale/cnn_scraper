But there are a number of Republicans who are making the argument that Joe Biden had said one thing and then done another now.There are also Republicans in the House who had worked on that impeachment probe -- someone like Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who said if there was nothing to their probe why is Hunter Biden being pardoned now? Obviously, these were different issues. But it's important to point out that the Republican backlash has been swift. Here's another Republican senator, Ron Johnson, who said, \"Just confirming that under Democrat governance, there truly is a dual system of justice. One that protects Democrats and another weaponized against their political opponents.\" But it's not just Republicans, Kate, that have criticized Biden. You are also hearing from a small number of Democrats, including Rep. Greg Stanton from Arizona saying, \"I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong.\" He also goes on to say, \"This wasn't a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers.\"  Kate. BOLDUAN:  Lauren, thank you so much for that -- John.",

It has a little wire on it that goes in like a needle and it constantly gives you feedback and what your glucose levels are after everything you eat.And the idea is that for people without diabetes maybe you'll see unique insights about yourself. How do you respond to different foods? How do you respond to exercise, sleep, stress? Can you see that reflected in your glucose levels? And are there changes that you can make to improve your health? So as you said, these devices have been available for people with type one diabetes where they've really been revolutionary. Before, people had to rely on just pricking their fingers to get information about how much insulin they needed to give to themselves. This year they were cleared by the FDA for use without a prescription. They're available from companies like Dexcom and Abbott, and they cost about $89 out-of-pocket if you want to try one of these things and you don't use insulin and you don't have a prescription. So I applied one of these back in September. I ended up wearing three different ones over a course of six weeks. Kate, I have to tell you the first thing I felt putting this on was anxiety. I didn't expect to feel that way. I was sort of just curious to see what would happen. But then when I was faced with the glucose ramifications of the things I was eating I constantly started trying to game the system and keep my glucose as low as possible. I learned from multiple experts that is not really how you're supposed to be using these things. You should be eating the way you normally eat and see what then happens in response to your glucose. You can see one day of my glucose readings there. I head Greek yogurt for breakfast. That has a lot of protein in it. I didn't have any real glucose reaction to that. But later in the day I had an apple. You can see there is that second sort of purple spike there. Just an apple alone sent my glucose up quite a bit. But as you can see it's within that normal range of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter. And so I was sort of left wondering does that kind of spike matter? And what I found from talking with people across the spectrum from research to medicine is that there are a lot of opinions about this -- very strong opinions -- but not a lot of firm consensus on whether glucose spikes within that range are important for your health. One thing I did find though is I talked with our colleague Sanjay Gupta about this. He has tried a glucose monitor and he's seen big enough spikes that he's actually changed the way he eats. So for some it could be really helpful. For me it caused a lot of anxiety and kind of apathy I have to say -- Kate.",
