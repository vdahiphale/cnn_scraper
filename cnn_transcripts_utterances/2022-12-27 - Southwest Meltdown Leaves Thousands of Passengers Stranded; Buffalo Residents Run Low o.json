But Southwest is the one that's having the hardest time recovering.So, weather is airline agnostic. It happens -- all airlines experience it pretty similarly. Southwest was exposed primarily in Denver and Chicago. But it's the recovery that southwest is really botching up here. So, of course, we've heard a lot of it has to do with the staffing issues and the crew scheduling system that's broke down in the fact that people, these staffers are calling up the crews, the pilots, and waiting hours on hold to try to get their replacement flight schedules. But it's also Southwest's unique route system. So, Southwest doesn't operate like many of the larger, bigger airlines, the big three in that they have major hubs where crews leave the hub and return to that hub possibly later in the day or at the end of their trip. Southwest planes zigzag across the country. And it's that complexity to the airlines operation that has made it really hard for the airline to recover from this winter storm.",

Polo, let's go out to you first. A lot of the power has been restored in Erie County. That's great news. We want people to have heat and power.

They want to make sure that there's enough food there for folks who are still basically sheltering in place and then obviously those men and women who have been going, they were going car-to-car and now just going door-to-door in some of these neighborhoods that are still snowed in, in and around Buffalo, which is widely considered ground zero of this massive weekend winter storm. So, that is certainly one of the big concerns today.The second is clearing out roads, continuing what they really started yesterday, when there was finally a break in the weather, and that's making sure that these roads are drivable, especially living in and out of some of the critical infrastructure, like medical facilities, for example. So, that's why they are relying heavily on help from the -- not only from the community but also from surrounding regions. What you have are other municipalities, according to local officials here, that are sending in personnel and also equipment to be able to do those welfare checks that you mentioned a little while ago. Those are critical. Because not only do they get sort of a gauge where some of those most vulnerable folks are in the community, in their homes, some of which have been without power for days, but also, sadly, that's when they are finding out that there are also many people who sadly did not survive. That death toll, it is difficult to track because it continues to climb up.

And so I asked her how they were doing, and she says that those were burns from the cold, from them -- riding on a train in Mexico, from Mexico City to Juarez, and that just shows the conditions that these individuals have to go through. But she says that she's here, deep in faith, hoping for a better opportunity, in a sense these are the roots of the American dream that you see around me.Let me show you around, while I tell you a little more about what's happening here in El Paso. This is a church that turns into a shelter overnight. Capacity is at about 120, 130, so a lot of the people that you see here end up sleeping on the street because the church fills up very quickly. Now, people from El Paso drop off clothes, like you see here, and they drop off food. There's another group back here who brought hot chocolate for all of the individuals here. Jessica, there is so much need. A lot of these migrants don't have money to leave El Paso. They don't want to stay in El Paso. They're hoping to go to other parts of the United States, but they don't have money, they don't have transportation, they don't family in other areas. And so they're really stuck here. And officials in El Paso say it's testing the infrastructure of this city because there are limited bus lines that leave El Paso. There's only limited flights that leave every day. And with the recent cold snap and all of the delays and cancelations around the country, it's only going to make that situation worse here in El Paso, an official tells me.

Some of them are in El Paso on the streets, because our immigration system does not have the capacity to, or resources to deal with it. And to be honest, to be very blunt, when we see migrants overwhelming the points of entry at the border, the migrants are not the problem. They are symptomatic of the problems with our extremely outdated immigration system, which has not been updated since the '90s. We need a 21st century immigration system. And despite the Biden administration, as Rosa mentioned, is taking various measures, I'm not convinced that that will be enough right now, for example, under Title 42. A migrant can be turned back in a matter of minutes. Say, five to ten minutes, they can be back on the Mexican side of the border. Meanwhile, if they pursued a lawful asylum claim and went through all the proper channels, that, on average, takes 4.5 years. Now, surely, as a country, we can come up with a humane and effective solution where asylum claims are processed and not taking either a matter of minutes or 4.5 years. And that is the job of Congress. So far, Congress -- members of Congress on both sides have not shown the political will to tackle immigration, Republicans because it's very animating issue for the base, Democrats because they are hesitant about being seen as in favor of amnesty or open borders. And what happens continually, it happened in the Trump administration and it's happening now, is these immigrations cases go to the Supreme Court, which then will make a ruling. And Congress never set up -- our system was never designed to have the Supreme Court making decisions on immigration policy. That is the job of Congress. So, in my view, each time we see these politicians making their photo-op trips to the border or very loudly complaining about the Biden administration, and that includes some Democrats as well, for the border states, the question should be, why aren't they in their role as elected public officials tackling this immense problem, which we have with our immigration systems, to ease the migrants' suffering and to bring our asylum system into the 21st century so it can be effective and safe and humane.",
