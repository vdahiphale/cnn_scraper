This video shows what was the Russians' final stand here, the brigade says, but Vladimir Putin's army continues to put up stiff resistance, a drone pilot tells me. They are good grunts, he says, sometimes it's very difficult to knock them out of those positions. But the Ukrainians have been making significant gains here after launching large scale offensive operations across Southern Ukraine. Heavy combat now nearly constant. (on-camera): This is the area of Ukraine where the heaviest fighting is currently taking place. And you can see what it's done to a lot of the buildings in the cities and villages around this area, and that fighting is set to get even worse. (voice-over): We're with the 68th Jaeger Brigade, the soldiers confident and grateful for US-supplied vehicles saying it's not only the firepower but also the protection that matters. A lot of times it saved my life, he says. It saves our lives every day from shrapnel, shelling and bullets. But some vehicles have already been lost and the Russians continue to fire back with frequent artillery barrages, but also using jets to try to hit Ukrainian forward positions. We had to take cover as a plane drop bombs nearby. Not the only time we had to scramble. (on-camera): So we've had to evacuate to this shelter now because apparently the guys fear that there could be aviation bombs coming in fairly soon. You can see the situation here still very kinetic. There's a lot of shelling still going on. (voice-over): Still, the deputy brigade commander says his soldiers are just getting started. Our counter attack will definitely be successful, he says. We believe in victory. We are moving towards our goal, we are advancing. On this part of the frontline, the Ukrainians believe they have the gear, the manpower and the determination to advance far into Russian held territory. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Velyka Novosilka, Ukraine.

But when you suck a force into those obstacle belts into what's called a kill zone, then it's up for -- up to the soldiers to defend those obstacles. And I see you're showing some pictures that were just released today, those are indicators that some Russian forces have fled those obstacle belts. So, what we're going to see probably over the next couple of days, as the Ukrainian force enters, the third and fourth obstacle belt is how hard are the Russian defenders going to fight?

After an overcrowded fishing boat capsized in high seas, and then sank off the coast of Greece. The Coast Guard released this aerial photo of the blue and battered boat. Every part of the upper and lower outer decks appears to be covered by migrants reportedly heading to Italy. The exact number on board ranges between 400 to 750. So far, more than 100 people have been rescued, at least 79 others are confirmed dead. The boat was first spotted Tuesday in international waters. Hours later, the Greek Coast Guard was reportedly notified the engines had failed. Not long after that the boat capsized. Minutes after that it sank. Greek officials say repeated efforts by the Coast Guard and other merchant vessels to offer assistance before the boat went down were rebuffed. CNN's Barbie Nadeau reports Greece has now declared three days of national mourning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Exhausted migrants who survived a shipwreck rests at a rescue center in Greece. The Greek Coast Guard responded to the latest Mediterranean tragedy on Wednesday. They say no one on board was wearing a lifejacket. Scores of people drowned, the death toll continues to rise. Hundreds of migrants crammed onto a boat in Libya hoping to reach Italy or get rescued on the way, but that didn't happen. Their boat sank in the Central Mediterranean, the most dangerous maritime crossing in the world. YANNIS KARVELIS, GREEK REGIONAL HEALTH DIRECTOR (through translation): It is indeed a tragic situation, a very difficult situation with very large number of shipwrecked people, a number that I think we have not faced in the past to such an extent and volume. NADEAU (voice-over): This is the deadliest first quarter on record in the Mediterranean since 2017. In February, a migrant boat carrying more than 100 people broke off the rocks of Calabria in Southern Italy. 94 bodies were recovered. Despite the dangers, the number of undocumented people seeking a better life in Europe has soared in 2023. The Italian government says more than 55,000 people have arrived by boat since January. They're fleeing conflict at home, the climate crisis and sweeping economic inequality. But European leaders can't seem to agree on how to solve the crisis, which has grown increasingly deadly. Ongoing negotiations with Tunisia and Libya where most of the boats come from have stalled. So the boats keep coming and the death toll keeps rising. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That mixed message led to a fairly wobbly Wednesday afternoon on Wall Street. A lot of alliterations there -- thank you, thank you. Markets at the end of the day are little change. In Asia, markets are trading mostly higher this hour not because of the Fed decision but because China is heading in the opposite direction, cutting key interest rates to stimulate the economy. The European markets closed before the Fed decision was announced, they were much changed as investors waited to hear what the Fed was about to do. So we'll see what happens there in a few hours. Back in the U.S., this is the futures right now, about eight hours before the opening bell. The Dow is flat, Nasdaq flat, S&amp;P flat. So, why did this pause on rate hikes actually happen, and what does it mean for inflation as well as the U.S. economy? CNN Business Matt Egan has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This is a pause, not a finale. At least that is the message from the Federal Reserve. The Fed deciding unanimously to keep interest rates steady. That is a significant shift after ten straight meetings where they raised interest rates.And yet, the Fed is making clear that they are not ready to declare victory over inflation, at least not yet. Fed officials are penciling in another two quarter-point interest rate hikes this year. During a press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell -- he called out the fact that core inflation, which excludes food and energy. He says that has not cooled off enough. And he opened the door to another rate hike at next month's meeting, calling the July meeting, q quote, \"live meeting\". So what does all of this mean? Well, for consumers, it is certainly good news that the Fed is taking a breather here with rate hikes. Because we've seen borrowing costs rise (ph) for mortgages and credit cards and car loans. And so, there is some relief there, at least for now. The pause also means that the Fed thinks that their inflation fighting medicine is working, that the economy doesn't need these monster interest rate hikes every single meeting just to get inflation back down. One very important point that Powell stressed again and again during the press conference is that these rate hikes, they hit the economy not immediately, but with a lag. It's kind of like if you take antibiotics. You might not feel the impact right away, but it doesn't mean the medicine is not working, it's just taking some time. And so all along, the risk here was that the Fed was moving interest rates so fast, so much higher, that they were going to overdo it and actually cause a recession. So, that is why Powell said that they are moving slower now, to look around and see what the impact is on the economy. So again, that doesn't mean that the Fed is done raising interest rates. It doesn't mean that the war on inflation is over. It's just moving in a more deliberate phase. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Tropical storm Biparjoy, barely hanging on to it s cyclone category here, a long and winding road in the water, finally moving to the north, but moving so very slowly.Now, that's a good thing in the water, and especially because there's so much dry air to the north that it's not getting any stronger. That slow motion, that slow movement will be a bad thing when it comes onshore and makes very heavy rainfall. And I do believe that that is probably the biggest threat with this will be that inland freshwater flash flooding, rainfall flash flooding. We're going to see tremendous amounts of rain due to the slow nature of the storm. Even in 36 hours, it's barely onshore, maybe by 100 kilometers or 60 miles on shore. So, still raining very, very heavily. Yes, there will be some wind, but that's not the main threat. The main threat with this will be a little bit of surge, 2 to 3 meters along the immediate coast. But then as it gets inland, all of this will rain out. The storm is just going to sit over the same place for hours and hours and hours. So, certainly, 8 to 12 inches of rainfall over 250 millimeters, if you do it in metric, that's where the heaviest rainfall will be. And that's where the biggest threat will be with this storm.
