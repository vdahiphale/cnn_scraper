Then, the death of Alexei Navalny shakes Russia. Where does Putin stand now? From Moscow, former MP and Putin ally Sergey Markov joins me. And, how policymakers should handle a fragmented world. The IMF's Gita Gopinath on the state of the global economy. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. As the war here approaches two years, Russia claims to have captured a key village in the Kherson region. But Ukrainian officials say their forces continue to hold their positions. Russia has made gains in Donetsk, though. While Ukraine says it hit a training ground for Russian troops near the Dnipro River. And while ordinary Ukrainian civilians follow these military developments closely, they are mounting their own resistance by simply carrying on, refusing to be cowed. Just buying books and reading them is an act of resistance here these days, as we discovered in Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  This bookstore is called Sens or the meaning. And opening in Kyiv just days before the Russian war enters a third year sends a clear message. And Ukraine's greatest living novelist, Andrey Kurkov tells us there is much to say about Ukraine's culture, identity and resistance. He wrote the forward for this tome full of 12th century artifacts.",

And people come in hungry for nonfiction these days, for the history of their region.

So, I'm just wondering, again, what is the way around that, and do you think, because we listened in -- you know, in Munich to a lot of the Republican senators who were there, who just seemed not to want to know.

But now, as we see, they are losing some territory, and really the fight is absolutely desperate. They also have no hope at all yet of getting into NATO. But there was also another announcement in the E.U. that their invitation for accession procedure will be delayed.

As long as he just stayed at it, the West would get tired. I even hear written that he thought that the Tucker Carlson conversation brought him back into the international sort of spotlight and rubbed a little of the pariah status away.

If you want to build a country where a thousand of your youngmen a day are sent across the front lines to be put into a meat grinder and you want to tell their mothers what happened to them, then you can have Putin's Russia. If you want to have a situation where you're about to have an election in less than a month, which is frankly no more than a selection because you've killed off or imprisoned or silenced any serious opponent, that's Putin's Russia. If you want to deny the next generation, the technology, the education, the investment in their future, that young Russians want, then that's Putin's Russia. So, you're right, Christiane, he's turned the entire country into a bloody war machine. And by the way, deepened its dependence on neighbors like China. Deepened its dependence on pariah states like Iran and North Korea. I sympathize with Zhenya Albats because that is not the Russia that she wanted. It's not the Russia that, frankly, we wanted. We wanted a partner that was going to be westernizing, that was going to be European. But that's not what Putin has done. And as desperate and awful a situation this is for Ukraine, Putin's also destroyed his own country through all of this. And we will continue to tighten the noose on him and force his choices to be -- to come to the table in a serious way or live with the Russia that he's wrought, which is not the Russia he promised his people.",

In 2019, that number was less than 1,000. So, we are seeing an increase in restrictions. While we don't necessarily see a decline in globalization, which is if you look at the overall amount of global trade as a share of GDP, what we are seeing is fragmentation, which is some countries are trading more with likeminded countries as opposed to others. So, if you look at, for instance, the two powers, the U.S. and China, and countries picking partners to trade with, we've seen a significant reduction in trade between the U.S. and China, in terms of direct trade links between the U.S. and China.

Now, again, I will absolutely accept the fact that we've had a period of hyper globalization where not enough attention was paid to communities that were getting negatively impacted and also, not attention -- enough attention was being paid to the resilience of these supply chains. And we saw that the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have all exposed that. And so, it is right for countries to pause and, you know, figure out how they're going to make sure that their economies are much more protected and that people are much more protected. The only thing I would warn against is going down a slippery slope where, ultimately, all this then becomes just about economic competition.

And so, that kind of a strategy, which is building up infrastructure is -- it's a good thing. It helps everybody and not just the manufacturing sector. The other thing we have to keep in mind in terms of manufacturing is, again, recognizing that there's a whole lot more automation now in manufacturing than it used to be in the past.

Despite all of that, we have resilience. So, I think we have to pause and just recognize that this integration that we have seen has helped countries remain resilient and make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

We are actually seeing signs of an overheating economy with inflation going up. So, that is one important factor that has held up growth in Russia. They've also been able to continue to export oil the way they've done in the past. So, they're getting a large amount of export revenues from oil, which have also helped them in terms of stabilizing their economy and growing their economy. But at the same time, we should recognize that they have lost, Russia has lost an important amount of human capital, as several of the high-skilled workers have left.

And we have many countries that whose fiscal deficits are too big, they're spending much more than what their revenues are bringing in. So, it is our advice that this is actually now a time to consolidate on the fiscal front, to build up baffles, also because this is not going to be the last -- you know, we're not done with shocks. We're going to see many more shocks going into the future. We're also seeing interest rates going up. And interest rates likely will be higher than they were during that period right after the global financial crisis when everybody pushed interest rates down to rock bottom levels. You know, the interest rates at which governments are borrowing is going up, that will then crowd out necessary spending that they will have to do.

So, without that, we have seen inflation coming down quite a lot. That gives us hope why you could end up with a soft landing. Now, there are several reasons why maybe we end up here. What we saw were a lot of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and also the energy prices that went up during the war, those have unbound and that has helped everybody in bringing their inflation down. But we still have the last mile. And I want to flag that, is we do have the last mile in getting inflation back down to central bank targets. So, we're not done. The approach of being cautious is the right one, which is what central banks are signaling, to be data dependent, and to see, you know, what happens to inflation with every reading. Now, I think we should be careful not to extrapolate from one data point and either have euphoria or to have panic from it. Our expectation is that inflation will continue to decline.
