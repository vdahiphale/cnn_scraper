I'm Sara Sidner in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. President Biden dropped into Kyiv this morning for a surprise and historic visit to mark the first anniversary of Russia's large-scale invasion. You can see him being received by President Zelenskyy and First Lady Zelenska this morning. It's the only time in recent history that a sitting U.S. president has visited an active war zone that doesn't feature a large U.S. military presence. Today, the two took part in a wreath laying ceremony at Kyiv's Memorial Wall and visited a plaque installed to mark Biden's visit in the Walk of the Brave in Kyiv's Constitution Square. President Biden announced half a billion dollars in assistance to Ukraine while there and new sanctions on Russia. In a press conference, both leaders extolled the virtues of their relationship and Ukraine 's fight for freedom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  This is really the most important visit in the whole history of the Ukraine-U.S. relationship. This is a visit at this most difficult period for Ukraine. When Ukraine is fighting for our own liberty, for the liberties of the world. And this underlines the results that we have already achieved and what sort of historic achievements we might gain all together with the whole world, with the United States, with Europe. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for, for as long as it takes and that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes.

Another is to put a young boy into the tank and send him to die for another country.

One country votes for us in the United Nations, but doesn't provide any practical support. Another country is not voting in the United Nations, is not openly providing support but is doing it discreetly. So, I don't think there is kind of one umbrella that you can put all of these countries under it. Everything is very nuanced. We have certain red lines and we are very clear about it, and there are two of them. The first one, know -- if you are calling for peace, make sure that your peace idea is not based on their -- on the need for Ukraine to concede territories. No peace initiative can be based on the idea that Ukraine has to concede territories. We've been there, we've seen it, it doesn't work. And the second point -- second red line, do not provide support to Russia. Be it weapons or circumvention of sanctions, or anything else because Russia is the aggressor and we are -- and Ukraine is exercising the right of self-defense. This is why Ukraine has the right to receive weapons and Russia doesn't. If these two red lines are met, I think there is a lot of space for cooperation.",

It still goes on. But if you are committed to success, it actually motivates you. It moves you, drives you on, it moves you forward. And we did succeed in changing a very important optics sometime last year because if you see what leaders were saying in the beginning of the war.

Will you say that, you know, we talk a lot about how doctors and other medical personnel are burned out. But you say they're not burned out, they're demoralized. Talk a little bit about that. Why do you say that? DR. REINHART:  You know, doctors have worked hard for a very long time in the U.S. They have been overworked. They have been exploited by medical systems. Nothing about that is particularly new. In fact, over the last couple of decades, doctors work hours have declined. We have better working conditions than we used to have. But the pandemic disrupted our impression of the system for which we work. I think one of the most demoralizing things, the things that leads to what has been referred to as burnout is when the system that you work is not serving the ends that it claims to serve. We, as doctors, want to serve our patients. I really believe that about the colleagues with whom I work, and we are constantly failing them. Not through any lack of effort on our part but because our health systems and our welfare systems are not set up to allow us to succeed. And doctors have played a very large part in producing that reality over a long historical period. We have, in some sense, allowed ourself to be paid off. We have highest in the world compensation for physicians, and we work in the least effective health care system in the world among wealthy nations.

But you're saying that physicians are also leaving the field. And if they haven't, they're talking about it. Why do you think that is, like, why now? DR. REINHART:  I think why all of these groups are now unable to sustain the belief that they used to have in the systems or at least some marginal belief, is because the pandemic accelerated death. Bureaucratically ordained death that didn't have to be. Put it at a rate that we had never seen before. There was a study in the proceedings at the National Academy of Sciences, a top science journal, that estimated 338,000 lives could've been saved had we had a universal health care system in the U.S. like every other industrialization in the world has. When you're working as a doctor or a nurse or a staff member at a nursing home, and you are seeing death after death that did not have to happen, and your reading about it constantly in the news. \"The New York Times\" has been publishing expose after expose of the corruption in the health care system and who is profiting from, who is deliberative designing the systems to produce these outcomes. This set is -- has led to what I call in the SA collapse of American medical ideology. That is the stories that we have told ourselves about ourselves for so long. That have sustained our motivation despite poor working conditions, despite the fact that trainees and nurses and doctors, even senior doctors are exploited by this system.

But I think what you have is a field that is entirely inconsistent with the ethical values that it holds up. If you go through medical schools right now in the U.S., you will hear in every single medical school that you might attend, long speeches about health equity, health justice, how this is what our institution is designed to serve. And then you go work in the hospitals. I've had experiences like this. And you that -- actually the policies that dictate who comes into this hospital, what kind of care they get, what kind of aftercare they don't get is not guided by the ideas of health equity or health justice or even care. It's guided by a goal of maximizing revenue, and in many cases profit.",

Well, I guess by some center that would be universal health care. I mean -- so, people do think we -- they're, by some measure, we have universal health care now because we do have the Affordable Care Act that people have access to health care who didn't have it before. Millions of people do. Why, in your view, has that not fixed the problem? DR. REINHART:  Just to clarify for that last point. You're right that Affordable Care Act dramatically expanded health care access, this is extraordinarily important. But there are still over 30 million Americans who do not have health insurance and do not have continuous health care access. They can only get access only through emergency departments. And it's very substandard care. It's broken off. It's very ineffective. It leads a lot to medical errors. And there's also the fact that people who do insurance are underinsured. I work at a hospital where I can't treat a lot of patients who come in with certain kinds of insurance. I have to refer them out. Sometimes it takes days for them to be transferred from our emergency department to another hospital. And that's not unique to my hospital. I'm not a fan of that policy. But that's true at countless hospitals around the country. So, simply the fact of insurance coverage does not insure good care. And I think the fundamental group of what determines care structures and all of these contexts is around motivation. And that is imbricated with for-profit pharma system, a for-profit insurance system. The Affordable Care Act expanded health care access, which is very important, but it also more deeply entrenched the insurance structure. Do you have private insurance that are making money off of this. So, it also enhanced insurance company profit substantially. What you've seen during the pandemic, for example, as hundreds of thousands of people have died unnecessarily are record profits in many hospitals, in the pharmaceutical industry, and the insurance industry. What we have is a fundamental decoupling of health care, of actual care and health outcomes with -- and the goals of the system.",

Black doctors, like in theNational Medical Association, which was formed because the AMA, the American Medical Association, would not allow black doctors to join, and in some cases, they excluded them from privileges at white hospitals. Black doctors have been saying this for quite some time, in fact, you know, for decades. Why haven't the other folks in the profession listened to them? DR. REINHART:  This could be an important point. I think whenever you design any system, you have to design it from the bottom up. So, not just public health, but if you're talking about health care profession, to make it be ethical and accountable to its members, it should always be looking at those who have historically been most excluded and empowering them to lead the field forward. So, it has to be less exclusive than it has been, to be better than it has been. I think black doctors in the U.S. have a very important position, and they are leveraging it. A colleague of mine, Alicia Maibing (ph), he's actually working for the AMA to try to promote health equity. There are limits to working within such powerful institutions whose intrinsic motivations are not necessarily in line with this. I think this is what a lot of black doctors and other progressive doctors around the country have faced. We can I advocate for these things, but if we are working within an extremely powerful systems and the majority of physicians around us do not very actively join us, it's very hard to upend the power structures. It's much easier, frankly, for those power structures to absorb dissidents into positions of leadership and in the process, silence them. And I don't mean that the doctors themselves have bad motivations, we realize this is happening. This is a structural force, and we see this all the time.",

And I'm just trying to figure out, you know, that's one of the things that you suggestin your piece is that doctors should unionize. But I'm just trying to understand how that actually works. And frankly, I am just curious how you overcome this sort of cultural resistance that the people who are currently in the field have to this, they are just not used to thinking of themselves in that way. So, I'm just curious like why you think unionizing solves this problem? DR. REINHART:  Yes, I don't. I think it's an important step. I think doctors need to learn to organize together and organize beyond their field, need to organize with other health care workers, with techs, with nurses, and beyond that, they need to organize with their patients. We need to organize with our communities and ground ourselves in those, not in the values of these powerful very wealthy health care institutions for which we work. I think one step that is immediately achievable that doctors can take towards that is to begin to organize together.",

It's just interesting that, as a culture, we kind of accept that story but we don't do anything about it. You know, I'm just curious like what do you think of that, if you think about that. DR. REINHART:  I think about this all the time, and I think that's a really, really important point. And I think a lot of young doctors have -- they still hold on to these ideals of equity, of justice, they hate it when they have to exclude patients from care, when we see our patients suffer for preventable reasons. And there's a dedication to this idea of the great doctor, the great humanitarian who is going to sacrifice themselves for this. And this is part of why we're so easily exploited. Many people in the field are very idealistic. They are happy to work 120 hours a week if they think that it matters. I mean, I often work over 120 hours a week because I think it matters. I don't know how that's clinical. But the problem with that is something that Che Guevara pointed out, a physician that's part of the social medicine tradition. He gave a speech in about 1960, we called \"On Revolutionary Medicine.\" He described it in his own biography. He said, you know, I trained as a doctor and I had this vision of myself as the heroic doctor who would redeem the world in front of me. And overtime, I've realized that that fantasy is part of the problem. It's not individual heroes who are going to be able to do the work that we need to do. We have to bind together at the collective, and not just as a collective of doctors, as a collective -- you know, well beyond that. In terms (ph) of our rights (ph) about the entire population working on itself, that would be caring for itself. That would be revolutionary medicine. You can have revolutionary medicine from a single doctor or single group of doctors or a single hospital, it has to be a collective mobilization.",

REINHART:  It's those relationships with people who are working every day to address the problems that I'm thinking about all the time even as I work in a hospital, I can't address them. It's my relationships from my long -- my decade (ph) ethnographic work from the south (ph) in Westsides of Chicago of people who are suffering from health care exclusion, who can't get access to housing. I leave the hospital and I am demoralized, very often. I'm frustrated that I couldn't do better by my patients. I don't have the resources to do it. But then I get a call from somebody who wants me to come visit them, because they are having a difficult day, that is what gives me a sense of meaning and continuation. So, I think that's how we counter demoralization. We bond together in relationships and in collective movements to make things better.",

Last night, the Red Carpet was rolled out for the BritishAcademy Film Awards, better known as the BAFTAs. Dominating the event with seven wins, including best picture and best director, the antiwar film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" set in the trenches of World War I. The film is based on a 1929 novel and the director, Edward Berger, recently spoke with Christiane about why he was motivated to take on this classic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDWARD BERGER, DIRECTOR, \"ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT\":  Obviously, in Germany, we grew up with the inheritance, with the DNA of war, of what Germany has brought to the world. And so, I always feel a deep sense of guilt or shame and responsibility towards that history, to talk about that, to make sure that we don't forget what we did. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
