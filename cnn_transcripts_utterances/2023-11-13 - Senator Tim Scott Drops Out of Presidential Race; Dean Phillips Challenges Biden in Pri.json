Troops advance in Gaza where the W.H.O. says the largest hospital isn't even functioning.Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt. It's Monday, November 13th, and it's 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, also 5:00 a.m. in South Carolina where last night, Senator Tim Scott stunned Republicans and \"Fox\" host Trey Gowdy by abruptly announcing he was suspending his presidential campaign. The timing took many of Scott's aides and donors by complete surprise. But it's been pretty clear since last month when a Super PAC supporting Scott canceled a multi-million dollar slate of TV ads. As Scott struggle to be in traction, and fears -- and fiercely negative race, his team worried about whether he'd even qualify for the fourth GOP debate next month. Scott told \"Fox\" that he's not going to back another Republican in the race, but that he would try to advance the message about the kind of person that voters should pick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC):  I am going to remain as committed to making sure that this country chooses the right person. I think what our country is going through right now is a very challenging time, and our goal should be to unite this country and not take advantage of the divisions of this country. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT:  Scott also told \"Fox\", he has no intention of accepting a vice presidential nomination, reaffirming the position he took on the campaign trail. There are reasons why that he probably wouldn't be offered it, but fair enough. And Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips is escalating his long-shot challenge to President Biden for the Democratic Party's nomination. Democrats have frankly overwhelmingly rejected Phillips' quixotic campaign. He told me he believes he likely torpedoed his own political career, but he says that Biden's approval numbers are historically low, and that the president is in grave danger of losing to Donald Trump next year.

But with less than five days to go before a potential federal government shutdown, house Republicans are working on a two-step plan to try to avert it.New House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a plan on a GOP conference call, Saturday, saying, quote, \"I wasn't the architect of the mess we are in.\" That's according to a source on the call. The first bill would extend funding until January 19th at the same levels including money for military construction, the VA, Transportation, Housing and the Energy Department. The second bill would extend funding until February 2nd for the remainder of the government. Neither bill includes additional aid for Ukraine or Israel. All right, let's bring in Farnoush Amiri; she's congressional reporter for \"The Associated Press\". Farnoush, I guess the good news on the shutdown thing is that we should be clear for the holidays if they can actually manage to get it done. Let's start there though, how is Speaker Johnson threading the needle on this? Because he's clearly giving in to hardliners on this two-step situation. Is this something the Senate can buy?",

That's been there, you know, objective since January. That's why McCarthy was ousted from his job. He was ousted for the exact thing that Mike Johnson is trying to do now, which is pass a clean CR. But I think the difference this time is that Mike Johnson told them he would have to pass a CR. That he would propose a CR, and that it would have to pass the floor for them to be able to do single subject bills. So, what -- you know, they do after that, I think after that February 2nd deadline is going to be what's interesting.",

General, thank you very much for being with us this morning. What message is Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps trying to send with these attacks on U.S. forces? Are they escalating? Are they trying to start a war with the U.S.? BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE:  I don't think, Kasie, that they want to start a war with the United States, but I do believe that they are testing, probing to see, you know, where is that point where we will strike back. And so, this gives them some opportunity to demonstrate strength in the face of U.S. deterrence efforts, but I think Secretary Austin and the president have been showing restraint thus far, but they will cross that line pretty soon.",

Just in at this hour, former British Prime Minister David Cameron has been named the new Foreign Secretary in the U.K., this part of a cabinet reshuffle after the Home Secretary was fired just hours ago. Let's bring in Max Foster live in London. Max, good morning, it's always wonderful to see you, can you please explain -- I think I've heard -- you know, David Cameron is a familiar figure to those of us here.But this reshuffle is very significant in terms of the Israel-Hamas war and the reasons for the firing of the Home Secretary are pretty explosive. What's going on? MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so, this all happened in the last hour, and it's pretty surprising stuff, I have to say if what's being slightly called out particularly by this man, David Cameron coming back as Foreign Secretary. He of course, led the remain campaign as prime minister to stop Britain leaving the European Union, and he lost and he ended up leaving. But now he's back as Foreign Secretary, quite well respected, I think on the international stage. There was a lobbying scandal though here in the U.K. he was caught up with. So we'll wait to hear what he says about that, and what the reason was that Rishi Sunak hired him again. He's been talking about representing change, Rishi Sunak, and I think David Cameron really doesn't represent any sort of change. But this came out of -- happened at reshuffle, and the early headline was the Home Secretary Suella Braverman had been fired. A very controversial divisive figure, not just in the U.K., but also in the Conservative Party. Her least -- her most recent controversy was leading up to the weekend protest, the Palestinian protest. She accused the police of being biased in the way they police these protests, and not clamping down on Palestinian protestors in the same way as they did on right-wing protesters.  The Labor Party accused her of inciting protests over the weekend and violence and protests. The police refused to change their policing, and they were vindicated really over the weekend when there were big protests, and there were generally peaceful with only a few arrests over the weekend. So, a big change here, just to add the previous Foreign Secretary is now the current Home Secretary, that is Mr. Cleverly, of course. So, a big shift here and quite surprising I have to say.",

That's what a lot of the analysts I'm speaking to are saying withinIsrael. So, he has to put off this reckoning as you described it, and that's the only way he can do it. So, let's talk about the intelligence failures later on. He's also got to come up with some answers for it, because he was the prime minister during these Intelligence failures. But he's also suggested that he wasn't warned at all. It was the Intelligence agencies that failed on this.
