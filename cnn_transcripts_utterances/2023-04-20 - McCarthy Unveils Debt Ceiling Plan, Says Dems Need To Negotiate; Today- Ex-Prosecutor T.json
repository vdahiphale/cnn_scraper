McCarthy's proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion.That would delay the next debt ceiling deadline until March 2024. It would also cut funding for federal agencies down to 2022 levels. It would block the administration's student debt cancellation program. It would create new work requirements for those on public assistance, and a lot more. The clock is ticking. Experts predict the U.S. could default as early as June. Let's talk about this and much more with the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Karine, good morning and thank you.

A Trump-appointed federal judge ruled that one of Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg's former prosecutors must testify to the House Judiciary Committee today. Bragg sued and tried to block the subpoena but lost after the committee chairman Jim Jordan argued the court has no authority to block it.CNN's Kara Scannell joins me now. Good morning to you. The reason behind this ruling? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Well, the judge -- this was a spirited oral argument yesterday and she ran it like a tight ship, but she really hammered Bragg's team on a lot of these questions. So in her order, she denied their request to block the subpoena. She said there were a lot of politics at play here -- politics on both sides, and in her order she actually leans into this on Bragg. She says, \"The court is further unmoved by Bragg's purported concern at the prospect of injecting partisan passions into a forum where they do not belong. By bringing this action, Bragg is engaging in precisely the type of political theater he claims to fear.\" The judge says she's putting all of that aside. The issue before her is this subpoena and whether Congress has a valid legislative purpose. The House argued they had several legislative purposes here. She even got one of Bragg's attorneys to concede during the hearing that they had -- that the House had a legislative purpose because they oversee federal funds -- funds that Bragg's office acknowledged they had used as part of this investigation.",

So for consumers, you're seeing these lower prices come in here and you also have these tax credits. The Treasury Department has clarified all these rules. And so, there's $7,500 in tax credit for about 18 different car models, four different car brands -- Tesla, Ford, GM, and Volkswagen -- that are available right now, depending on how much money you make.
