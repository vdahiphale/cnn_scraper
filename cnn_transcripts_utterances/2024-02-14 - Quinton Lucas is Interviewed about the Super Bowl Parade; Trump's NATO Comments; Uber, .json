We do have live pictures from downtown Kansas City, a wonderful place. You can see the people already lining the streets. Three-time MVP Patrick Mahomes will lead the team on the two-mile parade route. Now, we do want to note, it's unclear if Taylor Swift will be in attendance. She has a show Friday all the way across the world in Australia.We are joined now by Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas. Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. How will this Super Bowl parade be different from all your other Super Bowl parades? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D), KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: You know, it is hard to describe just how fun a Super Bowl parade is in the first place. But you add beautiful weather today here in Kansas City. In addition, there is also a Swift factor. Even if she doesn't come, it seems like we have so many more teenage girl fans than we ever have of our football team. The game itself was interesting with an overtime win. So, I expect this to be one of the biggest parades we've ever seen in the history of Kansas City.",

I know there has been -- it's hard to say controversy, because it's usually just dudes on social media saying they don't want her mentioned. But my view is, she is nothing but an additive (ph). I've loved this team since I was born, but I love that we've added somebody who says, yes, Kansas City is cool, it's a dynamic place. She goes out to our restaurants, and everybody loves her.

They are often susceptible to carjackings, to violent crimes and they say that as they are taking home less and less pay, the companies like Lyft and Uber are making more and more profits.We reached out to some of the companies. Lyft saying that they're constantly working on ways to improve driver experiences. DoorDash says that they're always listening to their dashers and looking for ways to improve the platform. And then Uber Eats saying that we tried to engage with our couriers to look at how to improve the experience. But obviously, this has been something that's been going on for a while. This is not just a Valentine's Day movement. But the problem is rideshare app drivers are not unionized, so they really have to mobilize on their own.
