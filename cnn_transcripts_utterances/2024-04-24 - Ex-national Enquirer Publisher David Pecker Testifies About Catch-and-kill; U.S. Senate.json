A sweeping foreign aid bill heads to President Joe Biden's desk after the U.S. Senate finally passed the measure, providing billions in vital military assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.A new deadline has been set for pro-Palestinian protesters to leave an encampment at New York's Columbia University. The school's president is threatening alternative options to have them removed. And the self-described eyes and ears of Donald Trump's first U.S. presidential campaign took jurors deeper into the hush money criminal case against him. Urgently needed supplies of ammunition, artillery rounds, air defense systems and long-range missiles are expected to be airlifted to Ukraine within days. After the U.S. Congress finally approved a military aid package which had been stalled for months by Republican lawmakers. Ukraine will receive nearly $61 billion from the $95 billion foreign aid bill which was approved by the Senate just a few hours ago. The rest will go to Israel and Taiwan. President Joe Biden says he will sign the bill into law in the coming hours. In a social media post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the Senate's passage of the bill. Ukraine has been losing territory to Russia since December when U.S. military assistants dried up. After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell addressed the chamber. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We tell our allies, we stand with you. We tell our adversaries, don't mess with us. We tell the world, the United States will do everything to safeguard democracy and our way of life. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It's time to reaffirm some basic truths. Alliances matter. Foreign nations' respect for American interests depends on our willingness to defend them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This has changed how a lot of Republicans view whether or not the United States should have a more robust presence in the world, whether they should pull back from it's -- for its support of foreign wars.This debate between the so-called national security hawks and the isolationist wings of the Republican party had played out for months and months and months. It had really stymied action on all of this. Now, one person who has been in the forefront on pushing this aid has been Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. He, of course, shepherded it through a $95 billion aid package, along with Democratic leaders a couple months ago, two months ago. In fact, that plan included aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, and to Israel. Then, essentially, he went nowhere in the Republican House for more than two months until Speaker Mike Johnson decided to make a move and try to move on a similar plan, what's the modifications, with some changes, and send that back to the Senate on Saturday (INAUDIBLE) ultimately leading to Senate's final action early this week. Now, McConnell, as he was discussing all of this pinned the blame on the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson for stoking that anti-Ukraine sentiment within the GOP. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Whether it was to keep the government open, whether it's to reauthorize a foreign intelligence surveillance law as well as to actually move ahead on authorizing national security problems -- programs as he did under the National Defense Authorization Act late last year.All these actions over the last six months since becoming speaker have prompted this rebellion on the far right including lead right now by Congressmen Marjorie Taylor Greene who has called for his house to threaten to call for such a vote but there's a belief that Johnson being able to survive such a vote if it were to actually come to a head on the House for because potentially Democrats could come to his defense. And also, the former president himself Donald Trump defending the actions of Mike Johnson in an interview earlier in the week. So, a lot of questions about Johnson's future but the moment there is a belief and there's a relief among supporters of Ukraine aid on Capitol Hill that after months of battling finally this chapter is done for now.

But the pressure is on and the clock will be ticking for ByteDance to either sell TikTok's U.S. operations or to shut it down completely. Now, TikTok is of course, the very popular social media platform. It is based in Los Angeles and Singapore. It is a unit of the Beijing- based ByteDance, which is the privately-owned tech giant based in the Chinese capital. And that is why it's been fueling fears across the U.S. that Beijing could be using it to spy or to shape public opinion in America. TikTok and its CEO have denied that saying, look, it is an entertainment app, it doesn't allow the Chinese government or any government to influence its recommendation model.But what is next for TikTok after this legislation being pushed forward? Can it be sold to someone else? So, the Chinese government has said it is against a sale. It does not want ByteDance to give up TikTok's algorithm. The Chinese government may allow TikTok to be sold without the algorithm, but that would strip TikTok of its core technology and the secret to its success. And analysts say, what could happen next is profound. If you look at the ramifications here, the entire tech world could be further split into two tech spheres, one aligned with the United States and the other aligned with China. I want to share with you this commentary that CNN received from Alex Capri. He is with the National University of Singapore. He is a lecturer at the business school there and he tells CNN this, \"A ban is a loss of soft power for Beijing, what little it has in the West. But a ban in the U.S. will spark renewed efforts to spread Chinese digital footprint in Southeast Asia and other mostly developing markets worldwide.\" Now, again, Nick, we are awaiting comment from the ministry of foreign affairs, we are also waiting any comment from ByteDance based in Beijing. TikTok meanwhile has said it plans to challenge this legislation in court. Back to you.",
