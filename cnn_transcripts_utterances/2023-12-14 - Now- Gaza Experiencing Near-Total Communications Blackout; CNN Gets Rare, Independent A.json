As of tonight, there is a near total blackout in Gaza, no way to get a message in or out. Just before the show, we tried to speak with a Palestinian man who is in Gaza. Now, when we first heard from Raed Redwan this morning, he was able to share with us something. The video that you are looking at here, this is of shelling and flares outside his window, of his home. At one point, he said he could hear the screams of his neighbors, while the shelling was happening. His father and his grandfather both were killed. His home was completely destroyed. And he wanted to come on hours like to share his story with you to talk about what life is like, what existing is like in Gaza. But, he has been silenced. And as you can see from this graph, this is what the communications blackout looks like. And it is that orange line that just down at the bottom. It is sixth, and near total blackout since the start of the war. Only 6 percent of places in Gaza have any kind of signal tonight. This as \"The Times of Israel\" is reporting this evening that Israel's flooding of tunnels in Gaza appears to have been successful. Now, it is not clear what successful means. But CNN has reported that the IDF was flooding some Hamas tunnels with seawater. And what is happening inside Gaza tonight is why the Biden administration is now pressing Israel to wet wrap up its sprawling ground invasion and air assaults on Gaza. A senior U.S. official telling CNN they want Israel to start using smaller groups of forces, and to carry out more precise missions, a move the United States believes would reduce mounting civilian casualties. As it is right now, and this is a stunning number from U.S. intelligence today, U.S. intelligence sources saying nearly half of all Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza are so called dumb bombs. Unguided bombs, that certainly help explain the enormous civilian death toll, an issue that President Biden talked about today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the issue of civilian casualties was obviously one of the main issues that he discussed. But as you said, I think one of the key topics that is part of the disagreement, the current disagreement between the U.S. and Israel, is, when do you take the current operation that is very, very high intensity operation, and scale it down to what the Israeli, and U.S. officials call a low intensity operation? And the U.S. wants this to turn into a low intensity operation within weeks, because first, it will get civilian casualties down, it will allow more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. And, I think most importantly, the U.S. believes that once the high intensity face is over, regional tensions, in Lebanon, in Syria, in Yemen, all of those will go down, and the risk of a regional war will decrease.",
