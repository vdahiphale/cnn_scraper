All along, the U.S. southwest so we'll see temperatures between 5 to 10 degrees above normal. While fewer people are under a heat threat today. The misery is expected to spread eastward through the upcoming week. Now, much of southern Europe is also suffering extreme temperatures. Right now several countries are trapped under an atmospheric heat dome. In Greece, the heat plus dry conditions have stoked wildfires, which have been burning for six days now. The largest fires are on the island of Rhodes, a popular tourist destination. 2000 people on that island had to be ferried out of harm's way, thousands of others were evacuated to the northern end of the island, which so far thankfully, has been unaffected by those fires. Now, all this as Greek in Greece injures a heatwave that is likely to become its longest on record. Now, CNN has reporters right across this developing story.

And that's not something we knew either.Now, this transient heart block, it's -- it's when electronic signals, which control the heartbeat are either partially or completely blocked, and it can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, because it, for example, can prevent blood being pumped around in the way that it should. So that is what Netanyahu has been suffering from and what this pacemaker is designed to resolve so that he could just go about his business, as usual. Now, certainly before he went under the night, he seemed to be in good spirits. He said that he was feeling good, but he was just paying attention to what his doctors were saying. But I think people will be a bit surprised that there hasn't been more transparency about the health situation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is generally seems to be in reasonable health. He's 73 years old. He's not one of those leaders that you see going out jogging on the streets, and he is known to like the fine things in life such as champagne and cigars, something that is linked to his corruption trials. But as I say, he's not in as bad a state as let's say, Ariel Sharon was before he suffered a stroke and then ultimately died. But certainly, Netanyahu says that he's -- he was feeling fine.

The problem is that here in Coachella the temperatures don't drop that much overnight. And so a lot of the people that I talked they told me they're worried about next week about the summer, but in particular about what those temperatures are going to look like in August.

Let me show you around while I'll tell you their story. We're on the banks of the Rio Grande and the state of Texas has deployed several layers of border barrier. There are two sets of concertina wire, and then the buoys in the middle of the river.These women say that they encountered Texas National Guard members, where you see the concertina wire right by the river and they say that they asked for water and that the soldiers denied them water. One of them said that they were told that it was not their responsibility. Did they deny your water? She says that the Texas National Guard at first denied her water and then afterwards they did give them water but it was one bottle of water for two to three people. The second woman says that the second time that she asked for water the Texas National Guard members showed her handcuffs. And I want to go back to the river because the woman says that the Texas National Guard members asked him to keep on walking on the water. Well, later she says that law enforcement and airboats started circling them on the water and the Wake kept on knocking them over. Eventually, they were provided water, she said. Now, the Texas National Guard has not responded to our requests for comment regarding those specific allegations. But overall, the Texas National Guard has denied allegations that they were given any orders not to give migrants water. Now, the stories of these women come after a Texas State Trooper blew the whistle saying that there is the inhumane treatment of migrants here on the border. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass.

A source tells CNN they are pursuing a theory that accused killer Rex Heuermann lured his victims into his house when his family was away. Authorities also say they are combing his house and possessions for any articles that might have belonged to the victims. And they are what police are calling trophies.

They continue to do so in this working theory that either some or all of the victims may have been murdered at the house of suspected serial killer Rex Heuermann. That's according to a source that's close to the investigation who says that documents stated before each of the victims went missing over a decade ago triangulation of their cell phones actually placed them in Massapequa Park, Long Island about 40 miles east of New York City, which is where Rex Heuermann lived with his family.Add to that, that when authorities would have been able to confirm that his wife was actually at a town at the time of the murders potentially presenting an ideal sort of opportunity for the murders to take place here. Now, in terms of the investigation itself, we're told that authorities in other jurisdictions are now taking a closer look at some open cases, some outstanding cases that they have including in Las Vegas, Nevada where detectives they're looking at missing persons cases to see if they could share a potential link with Gilgo Beach suspected murder. But also in Chester County, South Carolina where Heuermann not own property but his brother lived. Investigators they're serving a series of search warrants hoping to collect any potential evidence and then also in Atlantic City, New Jersey where police are revisiting the murders of several sex workers. According to the Suffolk County Commissioner, police commissioner so investigators really sort of broadening their scope to see if there are any other potential ties there as Heuermann continues to maintain his innocence after pleading not guilty.

Over the last four decades, only 11 golfers have had at least a five-stroke lead heading into the final round of a major and nine of them went on to win. So it looks like you're sure thing but you never know a meltdown could be possible. It's far from over. Thanks to Spain's Jon Rahm the two-time major champ had around for the ages that were in Liverpool yesterday shooting an eight-under-par 63 including seven birdies on the final nine holes set the record for the course during the open and still Rahm finds himself six strokes back of Brian Harman, the 36-year-old from Savannah, Georgia, just displaying incredible resilience after voguing two of the first four holes, answering with four birdies the rest of the way on the way to a 2-under 69. So he's 12-under 5-shots clear a fellow American Cameron Young, who carded a 5-under 66 on Saturday.",
