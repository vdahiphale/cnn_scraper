The ruling that had, until then, federally protected a woman's right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. In the last two years, the Dobbs decision has impacted the reproductive choices of countless Americans and unleashed a completely unsettled political landscape. Looking at a map of abortion restrictions in the U.S. its clear states are moving in vastly different directions, 14 establishing year or total bans. In some red states, employing new strategies aimed at further restricting the abortion pill, Mifepristone, emergency abortion procedures, and even throwing into question the legality of fertility treatments. Our panel is back with us now. And, John King, I want to start with the Biden campaign is out with a new ad this morning because we have seen this - this is going to be the first test that we have at the presidential level since this happened. It's just been two years. We've seen it really make an impact in some of these midterm races, in no small part due to very emotional, personal stories around this issue. Let's watch this.

I think what's interesting to me is, Arizona - the Fox poll came out I mean a couple weeks ago. Arizona, 68, 70 percent of folks want to enshrine abortion. However the wording was, support abortion at that state level. Trump was winning by five. Now, maybe that doesn't hold, but what I'm interested to see, and I think the - the Trump folks are too is, is there a separation between the folks that believe in abortion at the state level, but also would vote and support, you know, Trump at that level? And I think the other thing too is, unlike 22 we're seeing a seance of immigration where I think you're right, like there's an uncomfortableness on the right, talk about abortion, and - like there is on the left with immigration. So, you have these two competing issues that act as a lot - I think in a lot of ways single issues, motivating factors for a lot of voters. Which one wins out?

They don't vote every single election, right? They maybe vote one out of four, two out four election cycles.So, I think that is a way to kind of break out a little bit of that staticness (ph).
