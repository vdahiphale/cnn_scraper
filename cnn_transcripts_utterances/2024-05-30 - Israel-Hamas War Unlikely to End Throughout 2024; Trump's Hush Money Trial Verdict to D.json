      "sentences": "Good to have you with us. Israel's national security advisor is warning the war in Gaza could last another seven months, at least through to the end of this year. That means Rafah likely will not be the final battle against Hamas. As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested, new video geolocated by CNN shows Israeli tanks in a neighborhood in Rafah signaling a push farther west.Meanwhile, Israel says it has found 20 tunnels that crossed into Egypt, which Hamas has been using to smuggle weapons into Gaza. The IDF says it now has operational control of the area. Video released by the IDF shows what it says are rocket launchers and other terrorist infrastructure. Egypt denies the tunnels exist. So let's bring in CNN's Scott McLean, who joins us live from Istanbul in Turkey. Good morning to you, Scott. So what more are you learning about developments on the ground in Rafah? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Rosemary. So the Ministry of Health in Gaza had yesterday said that two Palestinian Red Crescent medics were killed inside of an ambulance that they were in going to pick up injured people and transport dead bodies elsewhere in the city. Now, they say that this happened in an Israeli bombardment. The IDF said that it's looking into the circumstances, but also put out a short statement explaining what they believe at this stage to have happened. It said, in part, a suspicious vehicle approached IDF troops in a manner that raised suspicion and posed a threat to the forces operating in the area of Rafah. Accordingly, an IDF tank fired toward the vehicle. Now, this is not the first time that this has happened. The U.N. says that since the war began, well over 250 aid workers have been killed. A few weeks ago, Human Rights Watch put out a report saying that on eight separate occasions, Israel targeted areas that were knowingly being used by aid workers. Now, in terms of the military situation, you mentioned it already, Israel says that it is in control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. It says it's in tactical control. It doesn't necessarily mean there are troops stationed along the entire length of it. But in having control of that area, it says that it's discovered these 20 tunnels that you mentioned and more than 80 entrances to those tunnels. Of course, for years and years, the Israelis have been suggesting that tunnels are the way that smugglers are getting weapons into the Gaza Strip. But Egypt, though, is denying the existence of these tunnels at all. So this comes from a senior Egyptian official speaking with state affiliated TV in Gaza saying that Israel is spreading lies to cover up its military failures. Now, Israel says that it informed Egypt about the tunnels. This senior official, though, anonymous official, is saying that no communication has been had between the two sides on the existence of these tunnels at all. It's also worth noting that back in February, Egypt made abundantly clear that Israeli troops along the length of that border would be, without its permission at least, a violation of the peace agreement between the two countries.

Russia spends nearly 7 percent of its GDP on defense, with plans to go even higher, far more than the U.S. or any Western nation. Even if Russian weapons are lower quality, an old military adage says that quantity has a quality of its own. When Russia burned through its own supply of artillery ammo too quickly, North Korea sent millions of rounds that made their way to the front lines. Iranian Shahed drones have expanded an already deadly Russian arsenal, and the Kremlin wants more. The U.S. effort to produce weapons at the speed of war took precious time to close the gap. For years, the U.S. relied on decades-old plans like this one in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to make artillery rounds, a World War II-era defense industrial base that suddenly fell far short. This new artillery plant is part of a surge in weapons production that isn't done yet, with pressure on the U.S. to supply Ukraine's military as it modernizes its own. SEN.

Officials say North Korea deployed 10 short-range projectiles, which flew about 350 kilometers and landed in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. South Korea condemned the launches and also accused the north of jamming GPS radio wave signals for two straight days, but says its military operations were unaffected.And now to a much messier provocation. The Hermit Kingdom has floated more than 260 balloons filled with filth over the border and South Korea has warned the north to stop immediately. Images just in to CNN show a large trash-carrying balloon that landed near Seoul on Wednesday. Officials say the balloons have been spilling all sorts of rubbish onto South Korean roads and sidewalks and the U.N. says it will carry out a formal investigation. CNN's Will Ripley has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This seems to be a new strategy by North Korea, sending so far hundreds of these trash- filled balloons into South Korea. Local residents have actually been getting warnings to avoid outdoor activities because authorities just don't know exactly what is inside these things. Photos show plastic bags with garbage and filth as South Korea described it, you know, scraps, paper, dirt, that sort of thing. North Korea says this is a response to South Korean activists sending prohibited materials. For a long time now, South Koreans, a lot of NGOs, sometimes former North Korean defectors that are now living in South Korea, they send into the north, sometimes using balloons, leaflets, food, medicine, even media like Korean dramas or K-pop, music that is forbidden for North Koreans to listen to, programs that are forbidden for North Koreans to watch, but they send them from South Korea anyway as part of this propaganda push to try to convince the north that there's a better way of life in the south. This has been going on for a long time. North Korea has long accused the south of psychological warfare and has promised retaliation. So now, by sending these hundreds of trash-filled balloons, they want South Korean authorities to experience the headache of cleaning up and locating all of this, just like they say they've been dealing with for a long time. But for North Koreans who receive content, particularly from South Korea, the penalties can be extremely severe. Remember, we showed you rare footage of those North Korean teenagers apparently sentenced to hard labor for viewing and distributing South Korean content. There was a time, 2017-2018, when there were some brief periods of cultural exchange between the north and south, part of that diplomatic detente. And at that time, North Koreans were allowed to legally get a glimpse of South Korean culture. But those days seem like a distant memory now, with information controls arguably tighter than ever inside North Korea, and now these trash balloons being sent to the south, part of this tit-for-tat back and forth, and just yet another sign of the escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula.

We have infrastructure problems in the city that cause about 40 percent of the water that comes in and freshwater to the city to be lost. That's not for lack of repair, but it is for soil subsidence and compacting over time. Mexico City is a lake bed, basically, and as the soils dry out and compact, then pipes are damaged and broken. At the same time, we also have earthquakes in the zone, which means we have more infrastructure repairs that are required based on that. And then we have contamination taking place in certain zones, which is bringing the idea of water scarcity to the attention of many residents who didn't necessarily face it before. So for example, the Benito Juarez delegation recently faced an issue that they're calling potentially sabotage. It's something that the government's trying to push right now, that it was actually a case of sabotage. But the issue is that the water contamination brought to their minds and to their use the idea that, oh, we need to actually think about this resource as something that's not infinite. We've seen residents on the far east of the city in areas like east of Palapa and also in the southeast of the city in Xochimilco facing these kind of restrictions for a very long time.",

So it's not the ideal setting to try to bring in desalinated water, although there is some discussion of should we do more of this type of plant.Desalination has its own problems in that we're dumping back in brackish water to the system, which is going to cause further contamination and damages the coastal areas to an extent and the ecosystems along them. What's more sustainable and would be a better solution for the city is actually water recycling. And that's something that culturally is a bit of a harder pill to swallow, but I think it's a very relevant one. And we've seen examples worldwide of how water recycling can be very effective for large cities.",
