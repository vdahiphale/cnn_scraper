Ahead on CNN Newsroom, in France, hundreds have been arrested after another night of chaotic protests. This ahead of the funeral, the teenager whose death at the hands of police sparked this public outbreak.Plus, Ukraine's intelligence chief claims that Russia intends to assassinate exiled mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. A live report ahead. And Apple is now worth a record breaking $3 trillion. What's behind the tech company's massive market cap? France has gone through a fourth night of chaotic protests that were sparked by the fatal police shooting of a 17-year-old boy. Authorities say they detained more than 400 people who showed up to rally Friday night, despite a ban on large gatherings. More than 4,500 officers were mobilized to try to contain the unrest. In several cities, police pushed back protesters who threw fireworks and burned property in the middle of the street. Officials are condemning the chaos, saying it will not bring justice to the dead boy. In the day ahead, the teenager named Nahel, will be honored at a funeral in Paris. Well, the shooting has revived a heated debate in France about discrimination in policing. And now the U.N. is urging the country to address the issue. CNN's Paris correspondent Melissa Bell has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another night of anger on the streets of France. The name of 17-year-old, Nahel, killed by a policeman on Tuesday now a rallying cry. The debate around race in France is a difficult one to have. DANIELE OBONO, FRENCH MP: The problem is on the political side. There's still reluctance to acknowledge this reality, its systemic impact. BELL (voice-over): Within the protests, the names of other people whose deaths many linked to police violence over the years. Names like Adama, Bouna and Zyed. The French Foreign ministry denying allegations of systemic police racism or discrimination from the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights. By Thursday night, some 40,000 police, including elite SWAT teams, tried and largely failed to bring order to the streets. MAME-FATOU NIANG, CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY: These are the populations that are overwhelmingly black, brown, and the result of this colonization that are still being policed the same way colonial arrears were policed from Algeria to Senegal to Indochina, Vietnam, et cetera. BELL (voice-over): As the eyes of France follow the fight for justice for Nahel, there is little sense so far that this is the country's George Floyd moment of reckoning.",

The Russian president is suddenly appearing in public, making sure to stay on his military's good side and seemingly trying to assert his authority. Matthew Chance explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Near the front lines, a tattered looking Russian army unit is grilled on camera about their treatment. Are you offended or used as cannon fodder? The commander asks. No, is the response. We are well trained and well fed, the commander insists. All this talk of mistreatment is nonsense. A week after an aborted uprising in Russia, amid complaints the Ukraine war is being mishandled, keeping the military happy is suddenly a priority. Already, President Putin has thanked Russian troops for not taking the rebel Wagner side. You prevented a civil war, he told them. Now he's giving them a 10.5 percent pay rise. Little thank you, perhaps, for keeping him in power. There are new uniforms, too. A summer outfit, says a soldier on the Defense Ministry video. Even new summer boots for the front line. We all like it, the soldier says. It's very comfortable. But Putin's own comfort levels are in question. With the Russian leader cheek by jowl with a jubilant crowd in Dagestan in southern Russia this week, perhaps an attempt to reconnect amid concerns he's grown too distant, shaking off memories of his strangely elongated table. The serious challenge to his authority this week appears to have drawn out a new side of Russia's leader. And his loyal deputies insist the country's stability is not in question. SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Russia has always overcome its problems and come out stronger and stronger. It will be the same this time, too. Moreover, we feel that this process has already begun. CHANCE (voice-over): Problems like Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader last seen leaving the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don after aborting his rebellion. He's meant to be exiled in Belarus, but so far there's been no verification he or his fighters are actually there, although recent satellite images show a disused military base in Belarus where rows of tents have suddenly appeared, preparation, perhaps, for a new mercenary base. Back in Russia, though, the head of Prigozhin's nationalist media group, Patriot, has announced the propaganda outlet and troll factory is shutting down, effective immediately. As the Kremlin rapidly withdraws its support from Prigozhin, his vast Russian business empire is no longer in fashion. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So before the Prigozhin rebellion and that Zelenskyy shared and other officials shared that their plan was essentially to take enough territory in their counteroffensive operations to force Russia to the table by the end of the year to negotiate.Now, we knew that this was a crucial year Zelenskyy has already sort of painted it as the, you know, that he doesn't really want the war to go on beyond 2023. So we knew that. I think we also know that in terms of the counter offensive, the U.S. has admitted that they see it as not having met expectations so far, but will continue to support Ukraine. I think the success of Ukraine being able to do this obviously rests on that counter offensive. It rests on that continued supply of Western weapons. And we are now some ten days out from a crucial NATO summit as well, where we'll get a sense of the kind of security guarantees that the West is willing to provide Ukraine and if they're willing to advance that timeline towards NATO membership, all of that will play into whether Ukraine can in fact realize this plan.",

Police on Thursday blocked Rahul Gandhi from visiting relief camps in Manipur, where fighting between ethnic groups has killed scores since May. Security forces said it was too dangerous to allow the Congress party leader any further along the road. He later visited by helicopter. But Gandhi and his supporters say the Indian government halted his progress in the latest attempt to stifle the opposition. People in Manipur and across India will vote next year in the country's general election. Two-term Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rule in BJP appear in an unassailable political position.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives writing in a note Friday that Apple breaking the $3 trillion market cap level was a, quote, historic moment for tech. So, what's behind the rally in tech? Well, part of it is the artificial intelligence frenzy that's largely been driving the performance of critical chip makers like Nvidia.

It was like a Ph.D. course for me. So when I had the chance to buy a camera, sold my iPhone, bought the camera, it was all in. Wherever I was trying to get to, there was always these gatekeepers were preventing. It was 100 percent out of frustration. Then I decided to go to school, apply for schools in U.S.My going to school in New York was just 100 percent grace. I gained partial scholarship to majority of the schools. But then if you ask me for $30,000, right? But then I met a wonderful brother, friend now who helped me, who was Brandon Stanton of Humans of New York. MADOWO (voice-over): Stanton, the founder of the popular Humans of New York platform, met Paul in Ghana in 2018 and sponsored his application to attend the International Center of Photography in New York in 2019.",

I knew that if I set up something like this, it will serve the community, it will build the ecosystem.The reason why I named it Dikan was the fact that it wasn't about me, but creating a conscious effort that let's take the lead in solving problems in Africa, the creative industry. This is something we can all collectively do. And this is my portion. I'm taking the lead in solving a small portion of it and encourage others. Kids come here, you know, for our visual literacy program, and I think that in one day, they will say, I grew up close to Dikan and Dikan influenced my life, and that's what keep me going. When I walk around, people approach me, and the joy and the comment, the encouragement, people asking questions, you know, using the resources, the sacrifice and all that hasn't really paid off.

The vision is big. You know, currently, we are looking to raise about $6 million for the building itself, for capacity building, and also for programming internally. We're going to have workshops, purposely for women only, you know. And at the end of the day, they can produce a body of work which can be screened. I want to be remembered as somebody who created the path for many other things to follow through. And Dikan will be a living example of what it is to think about Africa, to think about how we can take care of each other on this continent. And I want more Dikans across Africa. I really truly support other institutions with books and other things. And I truly want Dikan not the decant itself, but the idea of having such a space, of being a home of storyteller.
