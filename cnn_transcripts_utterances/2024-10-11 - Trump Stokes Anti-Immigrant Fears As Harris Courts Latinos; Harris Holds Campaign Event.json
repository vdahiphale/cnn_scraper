Both sides ramping up their appeals to key voting groups. The presidential race remains neck-and-neck with just 25 days to go.Also this hour, new reporting on Trump's efforts to tighten his security ahead of the election and after attempts on his life, why he's asking for access to travel on military aircraft with anti- missile systems instead of on his own plane. Plus, in Florida, new rescues of hurricane survivors trapped by dangerous floodwaters and wreckage, CNN is in the disaster zone where the death toll is still rising and people are suffering two days after Milton's onslaught. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. And we begin with Donald Trump's newest efforts to win votes by spreading debunked claims about the actions of undocumented immigrants. First, it was in Springfield, Ohio. Now, it's Aurora, Colorado, where he's been holding a rally and playing up local fears about gang violence. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in Aurora. So, Kristen, tell us about Trump's message and why he's chosen Aurora, Colorado, as his backdrop.",

Now, one thing to note is that Colorado is a very blue state. It is not a state in which he is speaking to swing voters. That's not why he's here. Instead, he is here to perpetuate this rhetoric around immigration.He has been saying for months that Aurora was taken over by Venezuelan gangs. Now, this is despite the fact that the governor of Colorado has said that is untrue, that the mayor has said that these comments have been blown out of proportion, that that is not what's happening in Aurora? In fact, the mayor actually said that he hoped that Donald Trump's visit today would shine light on the fact that Aurora wasn't overrun by Venezuelan gangs. But it was a very dark speech, Alex. Just take a listen to part of what Donald Trump said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She has had them resettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens. That's what they're doing. And no place is it more evident than right here. Because in Aurora, multiple apartment complexes have been taken over by the savage Venezuela prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was surrounded by posters of what his team said were Venezuelan gang members or gang members that were migrants. They've had different labels on them of where they were from. And one said illegal immigrant. At one point, they had an image that looked to be A.I. that had hooded figures with guns that said, your apartment complex is under Kamala Harris' presidency. The next slide said, you know, things were better under President Trump or will be better under a former President Trump.Now, the other thing to note, I just want to put this out there, he did announce a new policy for if he was reelected, where he said he would essentially create a federal program that would expedite the process of getting rid of deporting migrant gang members, undocumented migrant gang members. Again, he is clearly appealing to his base here. But we saw today a crowd of thousands of people who were relishing in this messaging.",

And I hearken back to another election where he was talking about the caravans coming in over the border. This is another version of that. And he clearly believes that this is the issue that will get him over the top, that is the most salient. And we know that he's leading on this issue with voters, poll after poll shows that. Now, Kamala Harris understands that this is not her best issue. And instead of talking about the problem, she is trying to focus more, as Eva was saying, on the solution. How do we fix it? And Donald Trump told Republicans not to vote for this bill that was pending in the Senate that would have fixed it. So, she's focusing on it in a different way. I mean, she understands this isn't her best issue and Donald Trump, on the other hand, is trying to embellish it and make it more of an issue for him.

She's going to continue to do more. She's got to do more with Latino men. They just announced Hombres con Kamala and she's going to continue to reach out to Latino men where they are and talk about the issues that they care about most. But, look, I think what's important, in last night's town hall, she hit it out of the park. Latino families are looking for somebody that is going to fight for them every single day. There's only one candidate in this race that wakes up every day and will fight for the issues that Latino families care about most.

I think the Senate's already done, but I think the House is really a tossup. And so if Trump can help in some house races out there and help drag a couple of Republicans along with them, that's a very good thing.So, no, I don't think he should be criticized for trying to do what's best for his overall party.

He knows that there's an opportunity or else he wouldn't continue to repeat this dangerous rhetoric.But what he's doing is not just to advance his political cause. This is talk that is putting the lives of immigrants and non-immigrants alike. It's not like folks are able to just discern who was born here and who wasn't born here. He is putting people's lives at risk when he talks this way. But he does see that he has the edge when it comes to immigration, unfortunately.

He tells her, there's nothing wrong with your body, except a few wounds, and then you'll heal. Leyan is one of the lucky ones. A survivor from an Israeli strike Thursday on a school turned shelter to thousands, which according to Gazan health officials, killed at least 28 people. This day, those same officials announcing more than 42,000 Palestinians killed since October 7th last year. The IDF said they were targeting a terrorist command and control center at the school compound. Displaced like the school they were sheltering in reduced, mentally broken.

They paint a very dire picture that they haven't been able to get any aid into the north of Gaza since the 1st of October. So, they paint this picture to give us an understanding of how much that aid they're talking about. In August, rather, 700 trucks of humanitarian aid went into Northern Gaza. In September, it was ramping down. 400 trucks of aid got in. This is large quantities, about 400,000 people there, and now nothing. The U.S. is so concerned that officials have been in touch with Israeli counterparts, reminding them of their obligations under international humanitarian law in war, and that is, as the force on the ground there, they need to make sure that food is getting in, fuel is getting in, water is getting in. Hospitals there right now say they don't have enough fuel, the ICUs will be shut down, the people in them will die and all of this while the war is raging around them.

I mean, that's essentially what Obama was saying to these people, like why aren't you on board with Kamala Harris? You know, and I'm so disappointed in you. I'm here to scold you. And there are good reasons why they may not be on board with Harris or the Democratic Party. And so I don't really see them as having a conversation with a persuasion conversation with them. I see them as saying, you know, shut up and show up. And I'm just not certain that's going to be persuasive this time around. So, if Trump can cut into some of those margins with male voters that are black or Hispanic or working class all over the country, good for him.",

And he wants the ability to use what's being called Camp David vehicles for his primary motorcade, as well as access to other military assets, like drones with thermal monitoring.
