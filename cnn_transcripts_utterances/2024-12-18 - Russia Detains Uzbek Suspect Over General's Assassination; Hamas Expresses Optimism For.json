Meet the couple who took their romance from the mountains of Bolivia to the main streets of New York. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in Brussels at this hour, meeting with European leaders to discuss the situation in Ukraine, where the possibility of deploying peacekeeping troops in his country might be on the table. The meeting comes one day after Russia accused Kyiv of what it called a terrorist attack, killing a top Russian general and his aide. Russian authorities wasted no time in arresting a suspect. They say a 29-year-old from Uzbekistan confessed to the killing. Russian investigators say he was recruited by Ukraine and was offered a reward to kill Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. The general died in a bomb blast outside his Moscow apartment early Tuesday. These pictures were taken in the moments just leading up to the blast. Russian officials are vowing to take revenge for the attack.

Now, the Russian authorities are saying that he is suspected in connection with the assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who, of course, was killed when leaving his apartment yesterday by a bomb blast. And the Russian investigators are saying that they believe that Kurbanov was recruited by Ukraine's intelligence service, the SBU. They say that he was told to get a electric scooter and then was given a homemade bomb and parked the scooter with the bomb in front of the door that later the general, together with an aide, would come out of. Now, as part of this plot, the Russians say that Kurbanov also got a car- sharing car -- rented a car-sharing car, and parked it outside of the door of that building as well. They say that that car was outfitted with a camera that had a live feed that went straight to the city of Dnipro in Central Ukraine where it was monitored by Ukrainian security services. And when the general left his building, that is when the bomb was detonated. Obviously, General Kirillov was killed yesterday when he left his apartment building. That blast seemed to be massive. When we were on the scene, we saw that even in the houses adjacent to where this blast took place, that windows had been shattered there. Russian politicians obviously irate about all this. The Kremlin came out and commented on all of this for the first time today. The Kremlin spokesman saying that all of this shows that Kyiv, as he put it, does not shy away from terrorist methods.

He is going after this former congresswoman not only because of her last name, the Cheney last name signals an old Republican Party, an establishment Republican Party that we all know that Trump wants to show that he has blown up and remade entirely in his image. But going a step further, the fact that Cheney became so notable in her -- in her going after Trump in that January 6th Select Committee is really the only thing here that he continues to gripe over.

One branch check the other. If Johnson is going to make a deal with people, then that is his prerogative as the head of that chamber of the legislative branch. And what I see Trump doing right now is obviously he's still not taking the oath. Obviously, he is not in the White House where the loyalists around him can start to fill his brain with other thoughts. So I would just say this, the conservatives who are really mad about the continuing resolution and spending from the federal government, these are the same conservatives that have always screamed about reckless spending. What is going to change now in this next two years? That's what I'm looking for. And we frankly have no indication of what is going to change. I think it'll continue to be business as usual because that is what Congress is designed to do, is to essentially stop and fill gaps. And we're just seeing Congress do that more and more. It's not going to change until we see systemic reform with Congress, which hasn't happened. And Trump getting back in office doesn't automatically do that. So I share this to say, anybody who's upset about Trump re-entering the White House, there is still tremendous hope that this Congress, though it'll be fully led by Republicans, can still achieve things for the American people and get the work that they're tasked with done.",

Might as well take it up now, ask for expedited briefing. Everything will be due into them by January 3rd and then as you said the arguments on January 10th. Think of what's at stake here. It's a major First Amendment case. It will affect some 170 million users of TikTok in America. And it's a big First Amendment question. So the justices probably thought they're going to have to take it and they're going to have to decide it fast. There was a request from TikTok, Bianna, to put the law on hold, to not let it take effect on January 19th, and the justices said that they would wait to consider that part of the request. But as you know, this all traces back to an April law passed by a bipartisan Congress signed by President Biden that said that TikTok would have to be banned in the U.S. unless it divested itself of Chinese ownership. TikTok, Incorporated is an American company, but the ultimate parent company here is ByteDance, which is owned partly by China. And when that law was passed, it responded to years of concern, national security concerns that China could manipulate the content or collect users' data. So I have to tell you that the federal government made a very good case in a lower court, and a lower court decided earlier this month to let the law stand. So now it's all in the hands of the nine justices and all in their hands to act very quickly. Bianna.",

The two leaders during Trump's first term had a good relationship. And I think that can be -- we can see that again. But before we get there, I think Ankara is also looking at the new dynamics in Syria. So much of Eastern Syria when there was Assad dictatorship in power, was governed under a model where you had a Kurdish group that Turkey opposes, that kind of ruled these areas in a consensus of public support by conservative, religiously conservative Arab tribes and Kurdish populations. That consensus has now broken down because earlier these Arab tribes did not want to live under Assad regime control. Now Assad is out. I think that given a choice, these tribes would rather live under Damascus than under the Kurdish group. And so the popular base of SDF is imploding. And I think Ankara's pressure is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. I think that we're going to see SDF-led areas shrinking in size in the coming days, perhaps to Syria's purely Kurdish-majority areas in the country's extreme northeast. I don't think we'll see a Turkish incursion. I think this will happen through negotiations between the new government in Damascus led by the HTS. It will be supported by the tribal Arabs who live in the desert, who have so far agreed to live under SDF rule, but who now are opting to live under HTS rule in Damascus. So we're going to see a process of Syria's re-centralization in which there could still be a role for SDF to play, especially in terms of containing ISIS and maintaining prison camps, but that'd be limited to the extreme Northeast of the country. A much smaller footprint for the SDF is what I'm predicting going forward.",

Andwe've known for some time that the sort of doom scrolling or whatever you call it, more than three hours being on social media for teens is associated with doubling depression risk. So that's obviously concerning. The average amount of time people are spending, teens are spending on social media is five hours. Just three hours can double your risk of depression. But what's more interesting, I think, lately is this fact that they've measured these changes that occur in the brain. So for example, the outer part of your brain called the cortex, the gray matter, that can thin in response to a lot of social media use or just the scrolling constantly. That can affect your cognition. But also the area in between the gray matter is called the white matter, and that can also be affected, and that can slow down your speed of processing. So scientists are starting to get a better idea of sort of this brain fog thing that people describe and finding out what is happening in your brain, what sort of causes that, and those are two things that might be sort of being attributed to that. There's two main things and these studies are really fascinating, I got to say, if you look into this. First of all, we're just surrounded by it. So the immersion in all of these different platforms for adults and teens is very significant. But there's three main criteria that the algorithms really look at. One is this idea that if you've watched five videos of the same thing, you're more likely to watch another one as opposed to just watching one. So if they get you going two or three of them, how much you watch is going to make a big difference. How similar is the content? They actually want to give you very similar content to keep you going on this. It's really interesting when you dig into the algorithms. And even where you're watching the content or consuming the content. If you're doing it in a place where you're not as distracted, that's going to keep you down the rabbit hole longer as well.
