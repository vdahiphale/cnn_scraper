Here, prosecutors allege that the senator and his wife accepted bribes in the form of a Mercedes, some gold bars, which you just referenced and stacks of cash in exchange for the senator using his influence to help certain associates and he is indeed very influential.He's the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has a lot of power to wield. Prosecutors allege that among the things that he did to try to help his associates, trying to influence the selection of a U.S. attorney in New Jersey to help one of his associates. They also allege that he tried to influence the Department of Agriculture to protect an associate's monopoly on the importation of halal meat. They also allege, and perhaps most significantly, that he tried to help the government of Egypt by steering aid to that country and also sharing sensitive information with the government of Egypt. Now, earlier today, the U.S. attorney discussed this case at a press conference. Let's take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: There are things that Sen. Menendez says he can do for his constituents and things that he says he cannot do for his constituents. He put it all on his Senate website. So, for instance, it says he cannot compel an agency to act in someone's favor. It says he cannot influence matters involving a private business. It says he cannot get involved in criminal matters or cases, period. But we allege that behind the scenes, Sen. Menendez was doing those things for certain people, the people who were bribing him and his wife. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Although lawmakers are not staying there, they only have eight days to hammer out a deal to avert a government shutdown, but a group of Republicans blocked progress all week.So Speaker Kevin McCarthy sent everyone home with those GOP hardliners showing no signs of standing down. The private sector is now sounding the alarm about the economic costs of a shutdown. Let's get a sense of the stakes with CNN's Matt Egan. Matt, corporate America would really like these politicians to get together and perform a basic function, which is keeping the government functioning. What kind of costs are they talking about?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, the CEOs have a pretty simple message for Congress, it's don't shut down the government. But these business leaders, they've seen this before, so they are preparing for what they fear could be a long and chaotic government shutdown. And they say this would be just one more headache on top of inflation and worker strikes and high borrowing costs. And this would be a self- inflicted headache.Now, the Chamber of Commerce executive, Neil Bradley, he told me, we are deeply concerned. The concern is growing almost by the day, because once we are in a shutdown, there doesn't seem to be a clear path out. Another trade executive told me that we just don't want the unpredictability that comes with a shutdown. It's just not good for business. Now, we should note that economists say that the economy at large probably would be able to get through this relatively unscathed. Goldman Sachs sees just a tiny hit to GDP for each week that the government shut down. And history shows the stock market barely budges during shutdowns. Still though, Jim, it feels like a shutdown is really the last thing the economy needs at this point.",

For example, workers, federal workers that are deemed nonessential, they would be furloughed. Other workers, including TSA officers, air traffic controllers, they would be forced to work without pay and that could cause travel chaos across the country.That's why the U.S. Travel Association estimates that a government shutdown would cost the travel economy up to $140 million a day. We could have delayed food inspections at the FDA, national park staffing shortages if the national parks stay open at all. And this is interesting, economic data, including on inflation and unemployment, that would get interrupted. So that means you could have a situation where Federal Reserve officials have to make key decisions on interest rates without having a clear picture at the economy. Obviously, that is not good. Now, publicly, business executives, they are urging Republicans and Democrats to come together, keep the government open. Privately, though, there is growing frustration at Republicans, given all this GOP infighting we've seen in the House. Jim, hopefully, if there's a government shutdown, it's a short one or better yet, no shutdown at all.",
