And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Russia launched a barrage of missile strikes on several Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv overnight, causing casualties. Ukraine's Prime Minister says a maternity hospital and shopping center in the eastern Dnipro region were also hit. And Donald Trump has been removed from the Republican primary ballot in the state of Maine. The move is based on the 14th Amendment's Section 3 insurrectionist ban in the U.S. Constitution. Colorado removed Trump from its ballot earlier on this month, but his name will remain on the primary ballot in another key state, we've just learned, California. Exclusive reporting from CNN sheds new light on the Trump campaign's actions after his 2020 election loss. CNN has examined recordings and e-mails that provide a behind-the-scenes look at efforts to keep Trump in office and plans to use fake electors to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory. CNN reporter Marshall Cohen has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "We've known bits and pieces of this story, but now we're getting the full picture.It comes from Ken Chesebro, who in many ways was the architect of the fake electors' plot. CNN has obtained recordings of his recent interview with Michigan investigators and hundreds of e-mails that he turned over. They reveal the last-minute scramble on the eve of January 6th to get those fake certificates to Washington, D.C. Take a listen to Chesbrough describing what happened when Trump campaign officials realized that the ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail. KENNETH CHESEBRO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY: The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time. So, the general counsel of the campaign was alarmed and was chartering -- they didn't have to charter a jet, but they did commercial. This is like, yeah, so this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there. And they had to enlist, you know, a U.S. senator to try to expedite it to get it to Pence in time.",

      "sentences": "Now, remember, they needed to get those ballots to the House floor because they wanted to have Mike Pence throw out Joe Biden's real electors and replace them with Donald Trump's fake electors.In the end, the campaign didn't charter a jet. Staffers booked last- minute tickets on commercial flights, and they ferried the ballots to D.C. on January 5th. Once they got to D.C., there was a series of handoffs and couriers that even included some help from Senator Ron Johnson's office. The ballots eventually reached the Capitol in time, but Pence's team said they didn't want them. He refused to go along with the plan. By the way, this episode is vaguely referenced in special counsel Jack Smith's indictment against Trump. Sources tell CNN that some of the people involved, including the staffers who were on those flights, have even spoken to Smith's team. But it's not clear how many of these details from the last-minute scramble are going to factor into Donald Trump's criminal trial, which is scheduled to begin in March.

The National Weather Service is calling it exceptional, something we haven't seen in many years.They're warning that that recurrent risk is extreme. It is dangerous and could cause a threat to life from drowning. Some of these waves have been so high, some of them already measuring by buoys up to 28 feet in some parts of California. And in some parts, they could be even higher than that and cause some damage. Here's the culprits. We have multiple storms that are swirling into the west coast. There's one swirling up towards the Pacific Northwest. And then here's another one on its way that's packing a punch with intense winds as it works its way eastward into California going into Friday. Here's a look at some of these coastal alerts from the U.S.-Mexico border up into Oregon. Looking at some high surf alerts for wave heights from Santa Barbara down towards San Diego. You're looking at high surf warnings for up to 25 feet for some of those waves. For the San Francisco Bay Area, up to 40 feet. When you have waves that tall, they could be destructive. You're talking about damage to piers and jetties, so something that they'll have to watch out for. Also, when you have waves that high, you're talking about inland flooding. You've got some coastal alerts, again, from San Diego up to San Francisco for that minor coastal flooding. Some of those low-lying areas could get some inundation. Because also on top of that, we have the maximum high tide for the month so far. That's happening right now. So, again, adding insult to injury with some of these taller oceans that are kicking more and could send some of that flooding inland. Also, like I mentioned, packing a punch with the winds. Wind alerts for these wind gusts up to 50 to 60 miles per hour going through the weekend. And you can see that happening, especially going into Friday in San Francisco and areas to the north where you could get those gusts up to 60 miles per hour. But I want to point out, look at how intense the wind is in the heart of this storm over the ocean. That's why these waves are so intense, because those winds kind of churning the ocean, picking them up and sloshing them towards the California coast. So, something that they'll continue to have to watch because here's another wave. So, this will continue, this threat, going into the weekend. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Stay safe.In Moscow, some Russian celebrities are now facing intense backlash for showing up barely clothed at an almost naked themed party. It comes as the country implements an increasingly conservative social agenda. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NOBILO (voice-over): Dress code optional. Quite literally. An almost naked themed party hosted by a popular blogger in the lead up to the holidays in Moscow has gone viral in Russia. Blogger Anastasia Ivleeva organized the party in the heart of Moscow's nightclub district on December 21st. Partygoers showed up half clothed or with barely anything on, with outfits made of mesh, lingerie, and other creative materials to strategically cover limited parts of their body. But photos of the almost naked partygoers have sparked outrage across some parts of Russian society. Internal criticism has mounted about how a party of this nature could go ahead as Russians continue fighting on the frontlines in Ukraine. Orthodox church officials, pro-war activists and pro-Kremlin lawmakers have all denounced the scantily clad partygoers. Attendees are now facing legal action. A court verdict against the party said the event was aimed at propagating non-traditional sexual relationships. Rapper Vacio, who showed up wearing a sock covering his intimate areas and not much else, has been found guilty of petty hooliganism by the Russian courts. He has been sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined 200,000 rubles or roughly $2,200. Planned New Year's parties organized by celebrities who attended the party have been replaced with other stars. Ivleeva apologized via her Instagram page, posting a 21-minute video asking for forgiveness and a second chance. Other celebrity partygoers have followed suit. In a previous video, Ivleeva claimed the event was an opportunity to showcase photos created during her tenure as the chief editor of the now defunct Russian edition of Playboy. Ivleeva also faces legal action and hefty fines. A collective lawsuit filed against Ivleeva on Tuesday by 22 people and initiated by a Russian actor seeks compensation of one billion rubles, that's $11 million, for moral damages. Backlash against the party comes as authorities in the country are pushing an increasingly conservative and homophobic agenda. Just last month, Russia's LGBTQ community movement was deemed an extremist organization by the country's Supreme Court. (END VIDEOTAPE) NOBILO (on camera): Wrongfully detained American Paul Whelan marked the grim fifth anniversary of his captivity in Russia on Thursday. In an exclusive phone interview with CNN, Whelan revealed his state of mind after five years in detention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL WHELAN, WRONGFULLY DETAINED AMERICAN IN RUSSIA (via phone): I start the day, you know, singing the national anthems of my four countries, and, you know, things get progressively worse from there. But, you know, there are people I speak to. I make calls home, I write letters, I read books, but it's extremely difficult being innocent and in prison and waiting for people to help you. It's a disintegrating experience. Your mind, your body, your soul, everything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Unfortunately, I think no matter how tirelessly the U.S. government wishes it could bring Paul home, without the cooperation of the Kremlin, it's unlikely to happen. And so, I think there's this very frustrating point with Paul's situation where he may have to last another 11 years or some part of that before the U.S. government is successful at bringing him home.
