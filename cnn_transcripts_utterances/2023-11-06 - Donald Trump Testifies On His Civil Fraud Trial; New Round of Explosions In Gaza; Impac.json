The question, can Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin chart a path forward for Republican candidates that is not a Trump path forward? In Kentucky, can Democratic Governor Andy Beshear hold power in that red Commonwealth? And will Ohio voters continue the trend and establish a state-level right to abortion? We're gonna get into the big races and issues driving tomorrow.Also, this hour, Hamas and its money, how the terrorist group is funding its side of the war, its big money tunnel exploration. My guest ahead was a finance tracker at the Treasury Department and worked the Hamas file. And leading this hour, a historic day in the New York courtroom, Donald Trump taking the stand in the civil fraud case that could bring down his family empire in New York, New York. He repeatedly went back and forth with the judge who accused Trump of rambling in long-winded testimony. Trump himself today called the case election interference as he runs for president in 2024. He called the New York attorney general who brought this case a political hack and a racist. Let's go now to CNN's Paula Reid who is outside the courthouse in Manhattan. Paula, Trump's strategy on the stand, not surprisingly, attack, attack, attack. Now his lawyers are debating a motion for a mistrial. Where do things stand?",

Trump acknowledged at least some role in helping to value these assets in his real estate portfolio, undercutting the argument by his own attorneys where they had been trying to put distance between him and these estimates that the Attorney General's office is trying to prove were fraudulent and should result in these massive penalties.Now, Trump, it appeared his goal today on the stand was to use this time to attack the Attorney General and the judge. And at first the judge was trying to rein him in. If he went off course or didn't answer a question directly, the judge would cut in. But as the day went on, the judge did that lesson last and instead deferred to the assistant attorney general who was ultimately able to get some answers that are helpful for this phase of their case.",

That is significant.But when this moves to a criminal case, which is what he's facing in Fulton County, Georgia, and two federal criminal prosecutions, there is the possibility for jail time. So that threat could always alter someone's behavior, alter their conduct, but it did appear today that he was willing to potentially expose himself to greater legal peril or what he may perceive to be inevitable legal peril to get his message across. And that is that he believes he is, a victim of political bias and sort of try to paint himself as a martyr in the court of public opinion, even if it increases his exposure in the actual courtroom.",

Just a reminder of how this messaging is, they wanted those sound bites and obviously there was no camera inside the courtroom with Trump, but we had reporters in there, essentially pushing out what exactly Trump was saying.What was interesting about it was we knew he was going to go to the cameras and say this stuff about election interference, it being a political retribution, that it was his rivals or Democrats who were coming to get him. That's the reason he was going through all of these various trials because he is in fact running for president and they don't want him to win.

Now, we spent some time in Franklin County. This is a county that's highly populous, and we saw a lot of ballots still being dropped off. Early vote numbers statewide, though, Jake, certainly show that there is a lot of interest. It is expected -- if these trends continue, if you look at early vote numbers and moving forward, that it is going to potentially be a high voter turnout for this off-year election, higher than in 2019, the last off-year election.

They are testing right now. They're probing to see whether this is their moment. And it's interesting because, of course, the U.S. has naval assets stationed off the coast and near Iran in the Persian Gulf.
