There is a feeling that something has changed. Something is different. We'll talk about it over the program. The markets and the main events. Today, it is travel chaos in the US, after a national computer system failed. Succession planning at LVMH. The world's richest man has promoted his daughter. And the era of cheap money may not be over. Olivier Blanchard joins me to discuss why high interest rates may not be here to stay. We are live in New York as you would expect, middle of the week, Wednesday, January 11th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Flights in the United States are slowly getting back to normal after a major computer failure dramatically disrupted air travel this morning. For two hours, the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration stopped planes taking off. It is called a ground stop. It was after a crucial safety system went down. And the ripple effects as you would expect. Well, more than seven and a half thousand flights were delayed, and also 1,100 cancellations. Here is another look at the impact of the disruption. This is what the skies over the Northeast and the South looked like at 8:30 yesterday morning. Now look this morning. Considerably less, and that's because there were those that were in the air, they carried on. There were those that left before, they carried on, but no more joined the throng before being allowed to start again. Worryingly, the cause of the outages are still unknown. The US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told us the FAA's technology must be reviewed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I do want to mention,you know, through at all, we did not see scenes of chaos here at this airport, nor do we see long lines. We've been here since seven o'clock this morning. And airport officials credit that to the fact that January is a slower time of year to travel. And of course, Wednesday is also a slower time of the week. But as you mentioned, flight operations have resumed as normal per the FAA for the most part. But as you'd imagine, a lot of the airlines are now dealing with this ripple effect. They are here playing catch up, trying to get these planes, many of them back in the air back on schedule, getting passengers rebooked as well. And hence, we are still seeing the number of delays and cancellations still tick up very slowly. So, as of now according to FlightAware.com, the number of delays as now for flights in and out of the US is now at around 8,300; number of cancellations at about 1,200. So obviously a lot of passengers are really inconvenienced. I've been talking to a lot of people throughout the day. People have been pretty calm. They've been taking things in stride for the most part because they realize that this is not nearly as bad as what we saw two to three weeks ago during that Holiday nightmare, that winter storm causing massive, massive delays and cancellations and of course, the Southwest Airlines meltdown debacle.",

And this was probably two or three decades ago. And then they started over again, and again, and then again. They keep changing contractors. Just a few months ago, they dumped another contractor and not with this program, another one. And so the FAA isn't really on top of the contract.

And it's a revolving door in the government. I mean, you put somebody in charge, and Congress holds hearings and said, your head is going to roll. Well, likely, it is not. They're going to hit the revolving door before that ever happens. And I really think that it is a lack of understanding. For example, this system is not one, you know, it's really nothing more than an electronic billboard. But it's an electronic billboard that goes worldwide. I mean, in Europe, they have to consult this before they fly into the US to know which runways to use at which airports, and what they haven't realized are the literally hundreds, if not thousands of different contractors that have to coordinate in the system, and then airlines and contractors around the world around the world are allowed to connect. So I'm not surprised at all that the system failed and the redundancies aren't there, even though back in the beginning when they were building the next-gen system, they were supposed to have three systems; one to run, one for maintenance, and one is a backup and we just don't have that.",

It has been gaining steam steadily throughout the courseof the afternoon, and the triple stack is also doing very well. It's up three percent since the year began and it looks like it'll be a four-day winning streak. And in fact, interestingly, that'll be the first four day streak since September. So you can see things -- I guess, the issue is whether there is a mindset change. Rising inflation brought the era of cheap money to an abrupt end. Olivier Blanchard believes it's only a matter of time before it returns. He is the Chief Economist at the IMF, and he says the underlying forces that led to rock bottom rates still exist. The Federal Reserve's goal of two percent inflation may be too ambitious, arguing it can loosen up once inflation hits three or four percent. Olivier is with me now. He is a Senior Fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics. Your book is \"Fiscal Policy\" or essay is \"Fiscal Policy Under Low Interest Rates.\" And your fundamental tenet is that debt -- debt when used properly, is a good thing.

The argument is that if interest rates were going to low levels after we finished the fight against inflation, which will come, I think within a year or two, then I think interest rates will be very low. And when interest rates are very low, then it makes sense to actually use fiscal policy and possibly deficits and possibly debt to do useful things. There is more room to play with, than most people believe. So I think the big question is, you know, what happens to interest rates looking a few years out?

My sense is that we've seen this during the COVID crisis, the markets have given a pass to fiscal policy where it was used for the right things, mainly in Europe to protect people against the high gas prices, for example, electricity prices. In that case, I think the market realized that there was enough room to do it, and it was a good thing to do.

We have to decrease the goal in order to get from three to two. I think, there will be a very serious discussion. People will say, are we really ready to have maybe even a recession in order to get to two? So I think the issue will come up. And what I've argued is that, again, ignoring the political economy of it, which is very important is that three percent is a perfectly reasonable and actually desirable number, rather than two. And the reason for this is, I mean, there are many reasons, but one of them is that if you have inflation running on average at three percent, then you have nominal rates, dollar rates at three to four. And the room that monetary policy has to play with is slightly bigger. It can decrease the rate from four to zero, where if it were two, then it can only decrease the range from three to zero. So I think it gives a bit more room for monetary policy to help when needed, and therefore less need for fiscal policy to help. So I'm pushing the idea that three percent is a better target. At this stage, I think the Central Bank should be silent about this, they should say first we get to three, and then we'll see what we do. I don't think it would be wise to have a debate in Central Banks at this point, but they just wanted to raise the issue.",

So theworld's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has promoted his daughter to run Dior, one of LVMH's 75 signature brands along with Louis Vuitton and Moet &amp; Chandon. The promotion sets up possibly Delphine Arnault to run the whole thing one day. You see, there are five children in all. In some shape and form, they are all in leadership roles. The oldest son is running the family's holding company. The others are at Tiffany, TAG Heuer and Louis Vuitton. Jim Bittermann is in Paris. So the first question, just set the parameters. Let's stick with \"Succession,\" if we may. Do the siblings all get on? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  As far as we can tell, there are no knives in anyone's back. The fact, is they do get together. There are apparently some family lunches on Sundays or whatever. Of course, we would love to be a fly on the wall for those. But the fact is, they do seem to get along. They have been groomed for now decades by their father, Bernard. The world's richest man, worth supposedly 160 billion, according to \"Forbes\" magazine, has been grooming very carefully his two children by his first wife and the three children by his current wife. And all of them are being now, as you said, are in management positions. But what was most interesting in the last two months, actually, the changes that are taking place in the management which seemed to be an effort to consolidate the family's hold over LVMH. Last month, Antoine Arnault, the second child of Bernard, was named to be the CEO of the family holding company. So that is a very important position because it own 56 percent of LVMH. But today, what was announced, Delphine Arnault, who's the oldest child, has been named to be the head of Christian Dior. And she was at LVMH; the head of Christian Dior was moved over to LVMH. So it sounds like moving the chairs around. Except that she now has had working experience at the two top brands in the LVMH empire, the ones that account for almost 50 percent of all the income of LVMH. Richard.",

The Emirates stadium is already iconic. And we are going to have eight new pieces of art hanging from it, completely changing what the stadium looks like. And also changing what the North London skyline looks like. And the reason we've done it is all in response to fan feedback. They wanted us to make this change.
