      "sentences": "Well, Poppy, White House aides have been preparing for the release of this report for quite some time now. And Biden allies fully anticipate that Republicans will try to use this as political ammunition against the president in this election year. The existence of these classified documents from President Biden's time as vice president first came to light a little over a year ago. That is when Robert Hur was appointed as special counsel to look in to whether the Biden team had mishandled these secret government documents that were found at a private office here in Washington, D.C., and at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. That review - the year-long review is now complete.Attorney General Merrick Garland notified lawmakers of that just yesterday. He said that eventually they will be providing that report to lawmakers. And he also said in a statement, quote, \"as I have made clear regarding each special counsel who has served since I have taken office, I am committed to making as much of the special counsel's report public as possible.\" The White House Counsel's Office is currently reviewing the report to see if there are any executive privilege issues, and they anticipate that review will be concluded by the end of the week. President Biden himself sat down for two days of interviews with special counsel Robert Hur's team exactly four months ago today. And one thing that our reporting has indicated is that the - Hur's team is not planning to include any criminal charges in this report. [08:35:08] But it is expected to have a very detailed and critical look at how Biden and his advisors handled the secret government documents when he had left office. Biden's allies anticipate that Republicans will try to use this against President Biden and also try to conflate this incident with former President Donald Trump's mis - or handling of classified documents, even as the cases are incredibly different. That is something that White House advisers have tried to stress throughout this whole process, that Biden complied, cooperated with this investigation as soon as they found these documents. They called the National Archives. That is something President Biden himself would likely also try to argue once this report comes out. We anticipate it will be out in the coming days.",

Look, we are a 50/50 nation and not really surprisingly here we see a same, similar split, right? Forty-nine percent actually support that decision. So, that actually goes a little bit against Trump's quote, right? Where, in fact, the plurality do support the decision to keep Trump off the ballot. Of course we have 46 percent here who are opposed. If you look at it by party lines, not surprisingly, Republicans oppose the idea of keeping him off the ballot. While Democrats, of course, support it. Independents, right down there in the middle.Of course, we'll also be dealing with a Supreme Court, right? I think there are going to potentially be a lot of important decisions coming from the Supreme Court about the 2024 election or things that could impact it. So, trust the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on legal cases related to the 2024 election. This, on the other hand, is not a 50/50 split. We see just 42 percent of Americans have a great deal or moderate amount of confidence in this court to make the right decision. The clear majority, 58 percent, have just some or not at all, Phil. And I will note, this is something we've seen across the polling data whereby support for the court, confidence in the court, has been going down, down, down over the last few years based upon some of their decisions.",

Look at this, Phil, the vast majority of Americans, two-thirds, say no.But I think -- I want to take another step back and just note that the decisions that could be coming, the ideas of Trump in court could have a massive impact on the election overall because take a look here, this is the Biden versus Trump margin. Currently we have Trump plus two. But look, if Trump is convicted, in polling out this week, look at that, Biden goes up four.

And some of the evidence that was presented in that trial came from the January 6th committee and all sorts of evidence from that situation.So, in this particular case, where they're talking about actually a constitutional amendment that bars someone from holding future office who has engaged in an insurrection, the terms are quite different.
