I know it's 4:00, 4:30 there in California. So, really appreciate the time. In a recent opinion piece on cnn.com, Van, you wrote, the police who killed Tyre Nichols were black, but they might still have been driven by racism. And I was struck by the part of the piece where you wrote this. One of the sad facts about anti-black racism is that black people ourselves are not immune to its pernicious effects. Society's message that black people are inferior, unworthy and dangerous is pervasive. Over many decades, numerous experiments have shown these ideas can infiltrate black minds as well as white. Self-hatred is a real thing. So, you believe this racial bias played a role in the officers' behaviors?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I do, because, first of all, black people are at risk from police no matter what color, black, white, brown. You talk to African Americans, they will tell you it doesn't matter. There is this pervasive view from law enforcement that if you are black, you're dangerous.And I think some people think, oh, well, so a white police officer going after a black person, you understand the racial implications. The problem is there are whole neighborhoods that, in many cities, are just considered by police departments kind of war zones and anything goes there. And so, I think we have to have a more nuanced view of what's going on to root out racism. It's not just about having black cops or white cops or brown cops. It's about having cops that are trained to respect everyone and who are disciplined and punished when they don't. And we don't have that in place. Black people are at risk no matter the color of the police officer.",

You are just going to scream racism even if it's all black, you are going to scream racism. And I understand, it does seem weird when we are saying there is a racial dimension here even though the police are African American. But I think what's important for us to be able to do is this is about power. It's not about black. It's about blue. It's about power.And when you have police officers who know in certain neighborhoods, they better not act that way, but in other neighborhoods they can act that way, that's about power. That's about domination. And so, I think it's important that we use this as an opportunity to get more nuanced and more clear about the dangers that African Americans face from police officers, period, when there is not accountability. WALKER:  Yes, and you also make the point, Van, that at the end of the day, it is the race of the victim who is brutalized, I'm quoting your article, not the race of the violent cop that is most relevant in determining whether racial bias is a factor in police violence. How do we, as a society, you know, all the way from the federal government and down to individual police departments in our communities, prevent this from happening again, from adding to this long list of black deaths, unfortunately, tragically, in this country?",

And I know you dedicated much of your career, you know, to helping reform the system.I am just curious to know what impact this Tyre Nichols case has had on you as a human. You know, because I've have seen reactions from the black community, from friends of mine who told me that they refuse to watch the video.

You know, this is -- it's hard because, you know, I have black sons and they are not, unlike Tyre. you know, Tyre is a skateboard kid. He's a Starbucks aficionado. He is an Instagram photographer. He is a good kid. He was a good kid. And I got a kid that loves, you know, RipStik and Starbucks and all this.And it's every black parent's nightmare that your kid, who was never been in trouble before, gets somehow in a situation where his humanity cannot be seen and his humanity cannot be honored. And you saw him -- he was saying, you know, sir. And he -- hey, calm down. The only calm voice in that entire thing was Tyre trying to calm the police down. And then finally the brutality got so bad. The pepper spray, which is a horrifically caustic chemical, got to him, he jumped up and ran and it cost him his life. You know, that should not happen for a traffic stop. And so, again, it rips back the scars. It rips off the scabs. My sister said she could not watch it. A lot of people just couldn't watch it. And I, frankly, wouldn't have watched it except it was my job. But to see him pummeled and beaten and stood up and punched in the face over and over again, it was horrifying. And you know, I hope this galvanizes some action. I am proud that the City of Memphis, after George Floyd, changed some of their rules and regulations and policies so they could take swift action. And you saw that swift action. But the swift action shouldn't just come in this one case with -- by black cops. People are being beaten right now, conceivably, in similar situations. They may not have the video camera, but bad things are happening and we need to change the laws and do something about it.",
