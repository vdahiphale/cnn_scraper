Ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin deliver dueling speeches just days before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We are live in Poland with the latest.Plus, we'll discuss why the earthquake in Turkey and Syria puts women at risk of period poverty and how aid workers can better meet their needs. And more than 65 million people -- look at that map -- are under winter alerts right across the United States. We will have a live report from the Weather Center. So, in the hours ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden will wrap his final day in Poland meeting with NATO secretary general and leaders of the group known as the Bucharest Nine for the eastern part of that NATO alliance. And this comes one day after Mr. Biden delivered a rallying cry declaring Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. He repeatedly called out Vladimir Putin by name and just as he did a day earlier in Kyiv, he again vowed unwavering support for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think President Biden will really want to emphasize that this conflict is not over. And you heard him say yesterday that there could be bitter days ahead, really trying to steal his partners in eastern Europe, in Ukraine, and in the United States for what will be an uncertain phase of this war. That's according to American officials at least, who say that we are now entering a more complex part of this conflict as Russia prepares for an offensive, as Ukraine seeks to regain some of the territory that it's lost over the last year. President Biden really wants to show that the United States remains in this fight, at least in terms of the support in the months and potentially years ahead. And I do think that that is sort of the looming undercurrent of this trip as President Biden prepares to return to Washington after what really has been quite a momentous three days on the ground here. That is the question, how will this war end? We don't really have a picture of what the endgame will be. Nothing President Biden said in his speech yesterday offered any more clarity on that front, and so that will be a question as we move ahead, Paula.",

But in that vein, to U.S. officials speaking to our colleagues in Washington, believe that around the time that President Biden visited Ukraine or just before, Russia did test an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. It's capable of delivering nuclear warheads. They believe that that test failed, otherwise, we may have heard more about it in Putin's speech.

Mahsa Amini had been arrested for not wearing her head scarf correctly. In December, a CNN investigation found evidence of a push by Iranian authorities to condemn an execute protesters using sham trials and forced confessions.Now, Iranian human rights organizations tell CNN at least 60 protesters were executed in January alone. Now, in a special report, CNN has found more than three dozen so-called black sites or illegal detention centers that Iran has used to dole out the worst, most barbaric torture. CNN spoke with more than two dozen survivors, whose stories corroborate a clear methodology of unprecedented torture. Our chief international investigative correspondent, Nima Elbagir, has the exclusive report. And we must warn you, it contains graphic descriptions of torture and sexual violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the last six weeks, Kayvan Samadi has been on the run. Each night he moves to a different safehouse. Brutally tortured for 21 days at the hands of the Iranian regime, he is terrified they will find him. His crime, organizing medics to help wounded protesters. But even with this fear of being tracked down, Samadi still wants to identify himself. He wants to show the regime they didn't break him. KAYVAN SAMADI, MEDICAL STUDENT (through translation):  I set up a group of underground medics. We treated around 700 people. The regime was committing war crimes, forbidding treatment to the injured. I promised my friends to fight for them. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  His friends, like so many Iranians, have been on the streets protesting against the clerical regime that has for so long dictated their lives. For his defiance, Samadi, a medical student, was picked up by Iranian Security Forces and brought to a black site. A clandestine interrogation facility outside the rule of law where many survivors tell CNN, forced confessions are extracted through the most brutal of torture methods. These forced confessions have at times been used in court to execute protesters for crimes against the state. Samadi refused to sign what he believed would be his death warrant. SAMADI (through translation):  Why should I have signed something that I haven't done? I'm not a terrorist, not a murder or a saboteur. I only saved lives. That's it. My team and I did nothing more. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Unlike so many other victims of torture that CNN interviewed, Samadi was not blindfolded during his detention. Based on his testimony, CNN commissioned the following images to take you inside the ordeal that he and so many other Iranian protesters have been subjected to. SAMADI (voice-over):  I was forced into a building hidden by trees next to a girl's school. On the first day, the two guards kicked me, I vomited blood. Each day the torture got worse. There was a closet in the corner of the room filled with torture tools, electric cattle prods, different cutters, some syringes. They drugged me. They wanted me to stay alive longer to torture me more. The guards started kissing me and licking my neck. They touched my genitals and my buttocks. On day 16 of my arrest, I descended into hell. SAMADI (through translation):  They tied my hands and shackled my legs. They wanted to break me, to destroy me. They pulled my trousers down. I thought we were going to give me an electric shock again. I couldn't believe they were going to do this. He took the baton and went behind me. I was waiting to be beaten up. He kissed my neck and shoved the baton into my anus. And he said this is what us soldiers of the revolution do to gay boys like you. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I couldn't even scream. I was dumbstruck and just cried in silence. ELBAGIR (on camera):  I can see the dark circles around your eyes. Do you sleep?",

These are photos of just some of the protesters that state hospital physician. Dr. Mohsen Sohrabi, and his colleagues treated in the city of Sanandaj, a major flash point in the crackdown of the uprising. It was an illegal act according to the Iranian regime. For that, he too was brought to a black site and tortured. MOHSEN SOHRABI, MEDICAL DOCTOR (through translation):  They are a power in and of themselves. They don't follow any kind of human rights. There is no supervision. What kind of supervision do you have to have when people are being raped? They don't have any more boundaries. They just want you to confess so they can prosecute you. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Dr. Sohrabi is also now in hiding. (On camera):  You've had to risk so much just to do your job. SOHRABI (through translation):  If I cry, it's not because I feared the Islamic Republic. It's not because of what I have lost. It's for the cruelty that people in Iran are facing. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Even as evidence of torture on an industrial scale point to the desperation of the regime, Iran's young protesters are equally defiant, even in the face of the unimaginable, torture and death.

What that means is, for example, we heard directly from our contacts who are working in the field that women are afraid to list sanitary pads as an item in the needs list.

They are expected to discuss efforts to strengthen the alliance and how to best support Ukraine. Now, Friday will mark exactly one year since Russia's invasion. Britain's prime minister wants Vladimir Putin to reconsider his decision to suspend Russia's participation in the New START Nuclear Treaty. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says this is another example of Putin jeopardizing global security for political gain. Russian president made the announcement during his address to the Russian people in which he railed against the west over the war in Ukraine. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNKNOWN:  (SPOKEN IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT9 (voice- over):  A determined Russian leader entering center stage. Vladimir Putin showing he will not back down from the war in Ukraine, calling Kyiv's leadership illegitimate. The Kyiv regime is essentially alien to the people of Ukraine, he said. They are not protecting their own interests but those of their minder countries. Putin squarely blamed the west for the conflict even though it was Russian forces that invaded Ukraine almost a year ago. The Kremlin claims Russia is under assault from the west, even more so after President Joe Biden went to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, showing the U.S.'s resolve to help Ukraine stand up to Moscow. The elite of the west does not conceal their ambitions, which is to strategically defeat Russia, he says. What does that mean? It means to finish us off once and for all. While Putin praise his army, he acknowledged they need better gear as progress has been hard to come by and losses mount in the face of stiff Ukrainian resistance. Still, support among Russians, both for what Putin called the special military operation and the Russian leader himself remain rock solid, Russia's top independent pollster tells CNN.",
