It is AntonyBlinken's fourth trip to the region since the start of the Israel Hamas war post October the 7th. He'll be walking into an atmosphere, frankly, of heightened concern that this conflict could expand, could escalate. That in addition to the very real grave concern for the welfare of civilians in Gaza. Nic Robertson joins us with the view from Tel Aviv. And Alex Marquardt is in Washington.

We see these flare ups all across the region and concerns there that more fronts could be opened up. But Becky, you know, Secretary Blinken, he left last night. He's about to touch down in Turkey. I think it's very telling that the State Department hasn't laid out clearly what he hopes to accomplish, the concrete goals that he hopes to come back to Washington having accomplished what diplomats called deliverables. And I think that is a reflection of the fact that when going into these conversations in Israel with Israeli officials, they're going to be very difficult. It is unclear what he might actually be able to accomplish in terms of breakthroughs. He knows that there will be some resistance, that it's going to be a fierce negotiation, but it is clear that the major pressure points that the U.S. wants to apply when it comes to Israel is their concern over civilian casualties. The U.S. has expressed time and time again the -- how horrifying the growing number of deaths and injuries to Gazan civilians, the lack of humanitarian aid that is getting to where it needs to be in Gaza. And then, the overall fighting, Becky. There has been this growing U.S. pressure for Israel to switch from what has been called the high intensity operations that we've seen over the course of the past few months to a lower intensity phase that would be much more targeted Israeli forces going after top Hamas leaders, for example, and of course that would result the U.S. and others would hope in fewer civilian casualties. So, that -- those are really the biggest topics of conversation when it comes to Israel.",

What happens in a post conflict Gaza? And frankly, I'm not going to call it thumbing their noses to Blinken because perhaps that's slightly too strong. But pretty much those conversations were closed down. This region wants to see a ceasefire. Nic, let me bring you in at this point. I want to talk about two things. Firstly, are we seeing evidence of a lower intensity fight by Israel as the Americans want to see?

Therehas been very little, as you say, sort of, detail from the Israeli political elite, as it were, on what happens next in Gaza. We've heard a lot of talk about the intention by the right-wing of the Israeli political establishment to push out, to displace Gazans -- Palestinians out of Gaza. Yoav Gallant has sort of -- he's presented his perspective on the day after to fellow cabinet ministers.

      "sentences": "Yes. The finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a hardliner within Netanyahu's governing coalition, has said that he thinks the day afterlooks just like the day before. He said he thinks that there should be more imaginative, out of the box thinking such as the migration of people from Gaza to other places. This is something, of course, that has caused considerable pushback and has been put down very clearly by the U.S. State Department. It's not something that has wide acceptance and support publicly or politically in the region at all. It's not saying that this doesn't -- these conversations don't exist. However, that is a clear rift when you have a cabinet member saying the defense ministers got this all wrong. But I think what's in Prime Minister Netanyahu's favor at the moment is Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, another sort of right-wing outlier there, who in the broader cabinet and not in the war cabinet. Benny Gantz is part of that war cabinet. The defense minister is part of that war cabinet, and the prime minister makes up the third member of that war cabinet. So, as long as that war cabinet is together, you're not sort of teetering towards the -- you know, the breakdown of government and the need to call for elections. We're not near that. But we are getting, again signs, of it. And another point to that came again some disagreement over the forming by the military of the beginnings, the groundwork, framework of an investigation into why October 7th attack happened, principally from an IDF view so that lessons can be learned for immediate operational effect right now. Now, Benny Gantz came out to support that, and again, Smotrich, Ben-Gvir had criticized the IDF's move to form this body, but Benny Gantz coming out and saying in support of what the defense ministry is doing sort of shows the strength of the cabinet. But it also shows the time -- limited time frame of that war cabinet too, because he said it's up to Prime Minister Netanyahu now to figure out, does he want unity and security or does he want to play politics? So, even the unity member of that war cabinet is indicating, look, Prime Minister, this is -- you've got to settle this, you've got to straighten the ship here.",

We're looking for it. But the fact is, ISIS has claimed responsibility, and they did this saying that it was two suicide bombers that they had used, brothers. There are discrepancies, though, in what we've heard from ISIS and what we heard from the interior minister in Iran yesterday, saying that they believe the first blast, for example, was a suitcase bomb in a car detonated remotely. They also have not offered any concrete evidence or proof that they are responsible. But we had heard from the U.S., we had heard from other analysts. that it did bear the hallmarks of ISIS, despite the fact that Iran's president had suggested that it was Israel to blame at that point. So, what this means is it was a very deadly twin blast, 89 people having lost their lives in just that one event. But it also means that it is slightly detached from what we are seeing elsewhere in the region when you look at the U.S. and its allies against Iran and its proxies. This does, at this point, if it is ISIS in fact, appears to be more of an internal issue for Iran itself, that this is something Iran has to deal with.",

Very much this tit for tat relationship. Why this is happening now Perhaps is because North Korea is responding to a series of military drills that took place just this week by South Korea, drills that took place on the water, took place on the sea. Now, we should point out that in this most recent exchange, the one that happened today, Friday morning here in Asia, there's no damage. There is no injuries. But it, again, is just raising the level of tension in this area. Now, over the last few days, we have seen some pretty stunning statements from North Korea. For example, on Sunday, we reported that North Korea expressed interest in launching more spy satellites. Why is that significant? These spy satellites are crucial in the North Korean military plan, especially when it comes to those long-range ICBM missiles. Also, this weekend, a statement, again, from North Korea saying that it does not want to reunify with South Korea, not necessarily a surprise, but yet again, it was articulated. And then a statement saying to the effect that it views the relationship between South Korea as hostile. So, clearly Kim Jong Un is trying to flex his muscle. And now, we have some actual occurrence today, this shooting of the shells by North Korea, South Korea responds. So, the question is, Becky, is this going to be calm for the moment, or is this going to prompt North Korea to do something more now that South Korea has responded? It's so much a back and forth, as you well know.",

I mean, this broadcast around the country and indeed around the world. And I wonder whether who came off best in Iowa is the same in the eyes of the wider electorate at this point. Is that clear? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  It's always a question, but there's no doubt that both candidates, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, they both had very strong nights. In fact, some of the strongest performances we've seen them have, but that is what you would expect toward the end of the campaigning is the voting is just around the corner here. The question though, of course, is it enough to sort of eat away or erode some of the support for Donald Trump? But Becky, one thing we heard more than we have in recent weeks is really sharpening that argument about the electability of Donald Trump. You heard DeSantis say directly, look, all of these legal cases, all of the courtroom drama that really has built up Trump's support, in the short-term, that might be good for his Republican base. In the long-term, that is not good in a general election. Nikki Haley making the argument that Donald Trump has contributed to the record high U.S. debt through his tax programs that were never paid for. So, we're starting to hear some of the arguments about, you know how, Trump may not be the best nominee for the party the question is, is it too little too late or his supporters just locked in or not?

If you look at that chart with the unemployment rate remaining at a very low level, below 4 percent still, what's interesting is the reaction over on Wall Street. The initial reaction was actually slightly negative. We saw stock futures dip. Bond yields go up. There was maybe a little bit of concern that this will delay when the fed can start cutting interest rates, but not even Wall Street could turn this into bad news because, as you mentioned, seeing the U.S. Stock Market open a basically unchanged better than where things were indicating before the jobs numbers came out. So, this feels like good news for Main Street for sure.

I mean, we pay so close attention to the jobs numbers because consumer spending is the biggest driver of the economy. And so, for as long as people are able to keep getting jobs, as long as this jobs market can stay on track here, well that means people are going to have money to spend. And, you know, we actually have holiday shopping numbers that also came out yesterday showing that Americans spent $222 billion online shopping this holiday season, up by 4 percent from the previous holiday season.

Well, the NFL regular season will wrap up on Sunday, and there's still much to be decided when it comes to the playoffs.And take a look at the AFC standings right now. The Ravens, they've locked up the one seed in a buy in the first round. The Dolphins Bills, meanwhile, are playing for the two seed on Sunday, but that game is super important for the Bills a win and they get the two seed. If they lose, they can actually miss the playoffs if the Steelers beat the Ravens on Saturday. Now, the game between the Colts and Texans, it's a virtual playoff game with the winner getting in and potentially winning their division if the Jaguars were to lose to the Titans. And the NFC, the 49ers, they've locked up the one seed in a bye in the first round. The Eagles free fall has given the Cowboys the opportunity to win their division and get the two seed with a win against the Commanders on Sunday. For the Bucks and Packers, a win and they will be in the playoffs. And for more on the NFL as the season wraps up, earlier I was able to speak with senior NFL writer for \"The Athletic,\" Kalyn Kahler. And I began by asking her if rookie sensation quarterback CJ Stroud, does he have what it takes to lead the Texans into Indianapolis and get a win? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, the first-time head coach, DeMeco Ryans, they selected a quarterback that none of us thought was really the top quarterback in that draft class and he has proved us all wrong. So, this is all going to be a really exciting game and I think he's absolutely capable of doing it. He's a great passer and he's shown that he's grown almost every week.",

Bradley Chubb just tore his ACL last week, which is really disappointing because it came in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss.
