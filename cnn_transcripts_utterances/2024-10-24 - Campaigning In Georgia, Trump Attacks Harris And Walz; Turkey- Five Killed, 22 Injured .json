When pressed as to why the administration hasn't done more to slow the record number of illegal border crossings, she stressed the need for a bipartisan bill to provide a long-term fix.Harris will begin her closing argument to voters on Tuesday with a speech at The Ellipse, a park near the White House and the same place Donald Trump spoke on January 6th, 2021. Falsely telling supporters he had won the election and urging them to march to the Capitol to pressure lawmakers not to certify the results. Harris campaign sources say the address will be a warning about the chaos Trump would bring to the Oval Office and the nation if he should win reelection. Well, Donald Trump spent his day campaigning in the swing state of Georgia at a massive rally in suburban Atlanta, Trump launched more personal attacks at Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz.

Remember, he called J.D. Vance and I weird? We're not -- we're very solid people. He's a weird dude, that guy. He's always pumping his heart, ha, ha, ha, you know, like he's got great heart.

She framed this, really taking a page out of Joe Biden's playbook as a decision about democracy. You know, she referenced January 6, the certification of the election when Donald Trump was leaving office, as an example of the kind of leadership Donald Trump will bring.And, you know, she spared no punches. She called him a fascist on record. She uses her traditional terms of calling him unfit and a dictator and these sorts of things. So, she's, you know, had this incredible wave of a campaign in the last few months but she's really coming home to this core argument here that democracy is on the line. And that seems to be one of the issues that undecided voters really care about, is Trump's character and whether another January 6-type event might happen.",

You know, and like I said, I mean, this is an issue that is important to undecided voters. It does sway some of them.However, you know, it's, it's so hard to parse out what is going to be the tipping point for folks, because Trump's own running mate at one point called him America's Hitler, and now he is running for vice president with him, J.D. Vance. So, you know, people have said so many things over the years about Trump. It's hard to keep track but it's clear that this is the message Harris wants to leave undecided voters with. And, you know, a lot of the rest of her speech during the town hall and a lot of the questions that voters posed to her were about sort of traditional campaigns, dumb speech type stuff like the economy, you know, caring for the elderly, immigration, things like this that she's used to.

And, you know, she immediately started the question with that, you know, pointing this back to Trump because she knows that people are really fed up with immigrate --the immigration system right now.She was tasked with, sort of developing the root cause solutions to immigration from certain countries in Central America. That was sort of her task as vice president. And people have been, you know, fairly disappointed with how she's delivered. So, she immediately takes this and turns it around on Trump. And there was a question in there, I believe, Anderson Cooper sort of pressed her on, you know, would she support more funding for a border bill? And she got sort of squirrely about answering this, even though funding for the border bill was in that bipartisan bill that she supports. But the border bill is so closely aligned and tied to Donald Trump because that was his big campaign issue in 2016 that I think you could tell she was trying to keep it at an arm's length.",
