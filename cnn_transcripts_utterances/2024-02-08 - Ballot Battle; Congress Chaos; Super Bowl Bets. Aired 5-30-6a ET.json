Always wonderful to have you.Look, if you were going to make these arguments, where would your focus be?

      "sentences": "So true. Kasie, good morning to you. You know, little did we know that when President Trump was president and he appointed three Supreme Court justices, right? Who was it, Barrett, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, that he himself could be the personal beneficiary of that, right, to all these legal issues that are around him. And so, there's a lot to look for in this case. And so, you could argue that basically based upon the notion, right, that you have this majority, which is really solid, right? It's a six to three majority, that there's nothing to see here. But there are some serious, concrete legal questions. Like what? Like the issue of what does this 14th Amendment section 3 mean really and who does it cover. There's this argument about, well, it doesn't cover the president, but it says any federal office.How's the Supreme Court going to deal with that issue? Will the Supreme Court weight into the issue of whether there was an insurrection? And if they don't, who ultimately makes that determination? Is it left to the states like Colorado, who had a five day hearing? But if we do that, Kasie, and another state has a hearing, and they conclude that it wasn't an insurrection, then what do we do? And then, if another state has a hearing and they conclude it was, what do we do? So part of the Supreme Court is uniformity, right? You need uniform laws. So are they going touch the insurrection question? The other issue to me is it's interesting that Trump people are arguing that, hey, I said that I'm going to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. I didn't say I would support it, what? So there's so many questions with respect to what this provision means. Ultimately, does it disqualify him from the ballot? And so, I want to know what their hypothetical questions are going to be to the litigants in the court today, and that will give us a sense of what they're leaning. Will they uphold this? In which case the president could be, former president, could be kicked off the ballot, or will they say, nothing to see here? And as a result, Congress should impose laws, and we're not the Congress and so, therefore, we're not going touch it. A lot going on, huge implications, I cannot wait for the arguments to begin at 10:00 am Eastern.",

They put all kinds of pressure on Republicans in the House and Senate, and they respond to it.

He's been endorsed by Donald Trump several times throughout his campaigns. He's been a reliable ally of Donald Trump in basically everything he's done as it relates to Congress. And to hear him go point by point to rebut his Republican colleagues this way, it really was quite stunning, especially when he talked about the idea of holding press conferences, right? Because he was talking about the fact that there are so many Republicans who go to the border, these partisan trips where they like to talk about how bad the situation is. And Lankford said, look, you were given a chance to address the crisis, what you say is a crisis, and you walked away from the table. I think it's an indictment of our politics.

The irony here is that Republicans are about to move forward here with a package that includes no border money, not even border management funds that President Biden asked for in his initial supplemental funding request. And now they're holding up the entire package, the foreign aid package, right now, unless they get votes on border related amendments.Now, that was just hours after they killed the bipartisan border security supplemental, right? So if you're calling for votes on border related issues and it's a Senate where 60 votes is required, and you just killed the only bipartisan path to an actual solution here, what, in effect, are you doing? And I think the answer is, it's Republican senators who are against Ukraine aid looking to kill this package altogether. I think that's, really, the big factor about this that hasn't been considered as much, is the fact that Ukraine really is this big inflection point, this flashpoint right now within today's Republican Party. It is the root of the conflict between Mitch McConnell and those newer senators who have sort of ridden the coattails of Donald Trump into the United States Senate. And as a result, right now, the Senate Republican conference is really rudderless. They are in real utter chaos, and their conference meetings regularly devolve into these snipe fests over this exact issue. And what senators were saying yesterday at their caucus lunch was that we just have to get this chapter behind us. We have to get this over with. It's time to finally vote on Ukraine aid because it's been this issue that's been hanging out there for so long for Republicans, ever since Republicans took back control of the House. And suddenly Ukraine aid, future Ukraine aid, was an open question for them. So there's a lot of uncertainty right now about what's going to happen coming up on Capitol Hill later today. I think Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is going to have to agree to some sort of amendment votes related to the border. Those will obviously fail, and then they can get on with the rest of the foreign aid package. But, of course, it's the Senate, none of that is guaranteed.",
