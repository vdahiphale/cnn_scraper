She's calling him a liar and slamming him for avoiding the CNN Iowa debate, as her campaign tries to cast the GOP nomination as a two-person race with the former president.Plus, down by the border. Speaker Mike Johnson and dozens of House Republicans are taking their immigration fight directly to the spot where thousands of migrants have been arriving every day and they're blaming President Biden for the surge. Now they're also opening impeachment proceedings against his homeland security secretary. And hitting the trail. President Biden will use the insurrection anniversary this weekend to kick off his 2024 campaign push, leaning in on his argument that the former president is a danger to democracy. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. First up, the 2024 race. You are looking at live pictures of Kingston, New Hampshire where Nikki Haley is about to speak. Just 12 days to go before votes are cast in Iowa, GOP candidates are in early contests states pushing for every last vote. They can find CNN is all over the trail with those candidates. Eva McKend is following Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. Jeff Zeleny is with Ron DeSantis in Iowa. I want to start with Eva. Eva, Nikki Haley's campaign announced a pretty big fundraising haul.",

And this seems to be an illustration of that. Something that we noticed on the campaign trail is she does seem to be confronting former President Donald Trump more directly, more forcefully. That's because a Super PAC associated with Trump is hitting Haley on her position on the gas tax back from when she was governor of South Carolina. Where she says she supports no such thing and it's sounding off on this. Take a listen? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I see the commercials that you see. And I've noticed that President Trump has given me some attention. And I appreciate that because that means he sees what we're seeing. But in his commercials and in his temper tantrums, every single thing that he said has been a lie. Every single one. I looked for some grain of truth, every single one.

So, these final 12 days are very critical in terms of people finally tuning into this race in the new year. But Eva was talking about the $24 million that Nikki Haley raised. Dana, you can see the fruits of that labor on television ads here. So, she is ending something in a remarkable way, really with more money than Ron DeSantis.

And I keep wondering to myself, well, what do you get in the nomination race if you come in second? You get nothing, right -- I mean, at the end of the day.So, it's just an odd configuration given what we believe is Donald Trump's ultimate dominance here. And to A, I think we are eager to get voters to weigh in here to sort of confirm whether he is that dominant or not. But B, I do think what Jeff was just talking about the diminished money for DeSantis. And the increase in advertising for Haley and the momentum that we've been seeing. I do wonder how much margins will matter here at the end of the day. Because if Ron DeSantis ends up coming a lot closer to Donald Trump in Iowa than people expect right now, you could imagine that being fuel for some donors to get back in the game for him and keep him alive a little bit longer. And so, I think we're now in a waiting game to see what these margins are more than anything else. JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I think that's right, David. And but usually, I mean, I feel like in years past there, you've seen been able to see the rise, right? If someone particularly -- in Iowa you're starting to -- you start to feel momentum even you're there, just not seeing that in the same way that we've seen in years past. Now, Donald Trump kind of broke the mold with how these contests go.

And what these lawmakers are going to find is just the extent to which the infrastructure here along the river has been built up over the last year. Several miles of razor wire, steel shipping containers trying to block access to the Texas side of the border here. But despite all of that in the thousands of federal, state and local law officers that are also in the area. This area has still seen some of the largest numbers of illegal crossings over the last year. And in the last month in December, record levels of illegal crossings all along the U.S. southern border more than 225,000 illegal crossings. That is a number we have not seen in 20 years. But the situation has also changed rather dramatically in the last few days, especially after Christmas with several high-level members of the Biden administration traveled to Mexico and met with the Mexican president. We have seen a kind of a downturn in the number of people crossing here in the Eagle Pass area. Anecdotally, we spoke with the head of a migrant shelter on the other side of the river, Dana, who said that in the last few days, checkpoints that Mexican immigration officials used to control the movement of migrants on the Mexican side has become much more robust in recent days. And they thought that perhaps that had something to do with the number of migrants being able to reach the Texas side of the border. But everybody here in Eagle Pass that we've spoken with say, you're also expecting that migration flows ebb and flow and that they expect in the coming weeks, the number of people crossing here illegally could change dramatically as well.

That's a new dynamic in the equation. And you see, the Biden administration hasn't been able to dig out of this. Part of that is because the Democratic Party is really split on these issues in many ways. So, you have sort of a activist base inside the party that is adamant, not wanting to see what they would consider harmful changes to this process.
