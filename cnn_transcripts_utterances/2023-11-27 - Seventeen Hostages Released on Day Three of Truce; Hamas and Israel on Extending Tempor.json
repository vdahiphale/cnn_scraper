It is 9Monday is set to be the final day of this agreement. But Hamas says it wants to extend the pause in the fighting beyond the four-day deal. A source tells CNN Israel's war cabinet also discussed that possibility Sunday night. Day three of the truce saw the release of 17 hostages, including Israelis and foreign nationals. The group included mothers and children and range in age from 84 to four years old. The youngest being Israeli-American Abigail Edan, marking the first successful release of an American hostage since the start of the truce. As part of the deal, an additional 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released from Israeli jails on Sunday. All were males, 18 years old and younger. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments for us. She joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, as we head into the fourth and possibly final day of this truce agreement, how likely is it that the Israeli government will extend the truce to allow for the release of more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and of course humanitarian aid for Gaza?",

That list is now under discussion, is being reviewed, and they will put out more information when they get it so as we wait to see what unfolds today. In terms of whether the truce could be extended, you know, it'scomplicated. Israel, we know, according to a source, the war cabinet discussed the possibility of this. It was already, by the way, written into the deal that if Hamas released for every additional 10 live Israeli hostages that they released, the truce could be extended for another 24 hours. So that certainly is what's being talked about. Prime Minister Netanyahu, in discussions with Biden, said that he would welcome that, certainly, if more hostages were released. And we've separately heard from Hamas that they are also keen to extend the truce, they say, through serious efforts to increase the number of those released from imprisonment as stipulated in the humanitarian ceasefire agreement. So again, a reference to that clause in the agreement that would allow for that extension. Now, there's pressure, of course, from outside Qatar, which is the main mediator in the talks, has made it very clear that they want to build momentum towards something more lasting, perhaps even a ceasefire. And we also heard from President Biden on Sunday that he would like to see this continue further as well. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

According to information from the Israeli Prison Service and the Palestinian Prisoner Society, some of them were detained without knowing the charges they faced. And as CNN's Nada Bashir reports, many of those released say they were abused while in custody. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Carried through the crowds, celebrated by thousands of Palestinians. These boys are among 33 teenagers released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. This is, for many here in the occupied West Bank, a moment of hope. And for those now freed, a moment of utter relief. I'm so happy. I can't believe this is real, Ibrahim (ph) says. I don't even know what to say. This scene, a product of a delicate four-day truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, set to see 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released, and at least 50 Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. There are many Palestinian families who will still be waiting anxiously to hear if their loved ones will too be freed. The Tamimi family, seen here on Saturday, has rallied for months calling for the release of 17-year-old Wissam. He was seriously injured by Israeli forces and later arrested in June. Accused by Israel of offenses including possessing a weapon, but he was never charged. Now, he and his family are finally together again. I can't describe to you how I'm feeling right now. I honestly can't believe it. I feel like I'm in a dream, Wissam's mother, Huneida (ph), says. My son is finally with me. I thank God and pray that every mother will be able to feel this joy. I pray God grants the Palestinian people this happiness. We just want to be able to smile and laugh together. Many of those now released are among the over 3,000 Palestinians held under administrative detention, meaning no charges have been laid against them and no ongoing legal process. Israel says some of those released were being held on terror or weapons charges, but in a list published by Israeli authorities of 300 women and children eligible for release, throwing stones and harming regional security were among the most common charges.",

But of course, as we know, many of those detained are held under administrative detention, meaning no charges laid against them, no clear legal process. Many are hopeful, of course, still that they will see their loved ones, their children, their relatives released on that final day of the truce agreement as it currently stands.

According to police in Burlington, the three Palestinian students were walking on a street on their way to visit a relative on Saturday when they were confronted by a man armed with a gun. All three students were shot.Now at the time of the shooting, we're told two of the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh, that's a traditional Palestinian scarf. We're told the photo of the three students was taken earlier in the day on Saturday. All three victims are being treated at Vermont Medical Center. Two of them were told are in stable condition. The third suffered more serious injuries. Now according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding, that's an organization that is in contact with the victim's family, the students were identified as 20-year-old Tahseen Ali Ahmed, Kinnan Abdalhamid, and Hisham Awartani. We're told all three graduated from a private school in the West Bank before coming to the U.S. to attend different colleges. Awartani's great uncle, a former Palestinian Minister of Education, said Awartani was visiting his grandmother. Here now is an attorney representing one of the victim's family on why they're certain this was a hate-motivated crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABED AYOUB, LAWYER OF VICTIM'S FAMILY:  The suspect walked up to them and shot them. They weren't robbed, they weren't mugged. It was a targeted shooting and a targeted crime, and they were wearing the keffiyeh. They are known in the area, you know, for being Palestinian. You know, that's a very well-known symbol. It's a very well-known cloth that's very symbolic of the Palestinian cause, the Palestinian culture and history. So, the fact that they were wearing this and then fell victim to a shooter leads us to believe that played a role, their identity played a role in them being targeted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We actually were standing right at this intersection as a convoy with 12 of those hostages, newly freed hostages, actually came right down this road on their way to the Hatzerim Airbase.One of those newly freed hostages was actually medically evacuated by helicopter directly from the Gaza Strip to a hospital in southern Israel. Her name is Elma Avraham. She is 84 years old and the hospital where she is being treated reports that she is in serious condition saying, quote, \"her life is in danger.\" Now, this evacuation, the release of these hostages actually happened differently than these last two nights. It's coming directly from the Gaza Strip into Israel rather than going through the Rafah crossing into Egypt first, and we're told that it is because of that serious medical issue with Elma Avraham. Now the process other than that went relatively smoothly. We saw the fairly quick release of these hostages and their entry back into Israel. That was a big contrast with what we saw on Saturday on the second day of hostage release where the release of those hostages was delayed by hours by Hamas over disputes about the number -- the amount of aid that Israel was providing to the Gaza Strip. And also, I'm learning that there was another serious dispute over one of the hostages being released without her mother. We've typically seen children and mothers who were taken hostage together being released together, but that was not the case with one of those hostages on Saturday. The question now is whether or not this pause in fighting can be extended, whether or not we will see more hostages released. In order to extend that pause in fighting, Hamas will need to release 10 more Israeli hostages per day for an additional day's pause in the fighting. Israeli officials have already indicated that they want to see that pause extended, they want to see more hostages released. And Hamas on Sunday now saying in a statement that they are also seeking to extend this truce. The fate of more than 180 hostages, as well as hundreds more aid trucks entering into Gaza, hang in the balance. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Urim Israel.",
