New details are just coming into CNN about the gunman in the deadly shooting at an outlet mall outside of Dallas. Eight people were killed, seven others wounded when a gunman started shooting Saturday afternoon.Also developing this evening, at least seven people are dead after a car plowed into a group of people outside a homeless shelter in Brownsville, Texas earlier this morning. That shelter has been housing migrants. First, we want to play you the moments leading up to the incident and we should warn you, what you are about to watch is very disturbing. (VIDEO PLAYING) Now, we have frozen that video right before the most graphic moment of that footage. The video comes from Congressman Henry Cuellar's office and I'll be speaking with him later on this evening. Let's go now to CNN's Rosa Flores. Rosa, what more do we know about what happened?",

      "sentences": "Well, according to police, seven people are dead and at least six -- excuse me, 10 individuals are in the hospital. Now, police are still going to hospitals to see if there are any other individuals who are injured. Now, from talking to the director of the shelter, he says that at about 8They were either going to downtown Brownsville or they were going to their destination in the United States. He says that his video surveillance camera captured the entire incident. This director describes a 2007 Range Rover vehicle driving at a very high rate of speed, running a red light and then hitting the curb about 30 feet from where the migrants were sitting. He says tha at that point this time, the vehicle completely lost control. Now, the director says that from talking to some of the witnesses -- that he talked to some of the witnesses, he said that those witness said that this was an intentional act. So, I asked the director based on what he witnessed in his surveillance video if he believed that this was an intentional act. And he said, no. He reiterated that what you see in that surveillance video is a vehicle at a very high rate of speed taking a red light and then hitting a curb and that vehicle going out of control. About the driver, according to Brownsville police, the driver is being uncooperative, giving police multiple names and so police are having to fingerprint this individual for his identifying details. Police have taken a blood sample. They are planning to get toxicology reports on him to figure out if he was on something while he was driving. Now, the individual has not been identified by police at this time other than this is a Hispanic male. Now, I'm in El Paso, Texas. Right now, I'm here because we're covering a surge of migrants on the U.S. southern border. And if you look around me, you'll see that here in this city -- the city is under a state of emergency, just like Brownsville is. Here, there are hundreds of migrants on the streets. And just overnight, you will see barricades in front of me because the city of El Paso blocked off the street and they specifically mentioned public safety because as you can see, there's a lot of migrants on the street and a lot of the services are delivered in front of this church. And so, they were making sure that at least this one street is blocked off for that reason. And Jim, they specifically mentioned, city officials specifically mentioned, that they are asking residents of El Paso and motorists to be very careful as they are driving around this area because they know, and as you can see all around me, there are hundreds of migrants here on the street and it could be very, very dangerous.

His district includes Uvalde, Texas where a year ago, this month, a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School. Senator, thanks again for being with us. We appreciate it. You played a major role in highlighting the botched police response to the shooting in Uvalde. I'm curious of what you make of the response of Allen.Police are not having a press conference today. They are not telling the public the latest. We're having to get through our sources what the latest we believe to be in this investigation. And part of which being what Josh Campbell reported just a short time ago, that this gunman may have been motivated by extremist ideology. What's your view on all this? ROLAND GUTIERREZ, TEXAS STATE SENATE: Yeah, Jim. I mean, I'm at a loss for words quite frankly. You know, we have seen this rodeo before. We saw it in Uvalde. Of course, the lack of transparency there was there to hide all of the failure that happened over the course of that 77- minute response. My fear is that we don't - we don't know exactly how long it took that police officer to get there. I'm glad he was able to do the work and take down this suspect. But, you know, I also fear that maybe that there's this other more possibly gross motivation by people that are in charge of this thing to change this news story. The fact is, this was a person that was mentally ill that shouldn't have had these guns. Absolutely, you could have laws that change this from happening, to keep this from happening. I heard several people. I heard Greg Abbott today. I heard Paxton say, oh, there's nothing that we can do. That's ludicrous. I'm just at a loss for words a little bit, Jim, today. I mean, I just don't understand these Republicans that want to just pray and do absolutely nothing. Our country and our state are burning down because we have these guns in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. It's a chaos that is wholly created by the Republican Party and the NRA.

I have done plenty of that over last year in the terrific and horrific failures that we saw a year ago in Uvalde.I'm here to figure out why in the world we're not getting any information. The fact is, this was a security guard as what I heard from your network earlier. You know, this guy had a license to be a security guard. We heard Ken Paxton say we need more good guys with guns. He said specifically on Fox News. He said, we need more police and we need more trained security guards. Wow. I mean, here you have a trained security guard, trained at multiple levels of carrying a weapon and using a weapon, but he was mentally ill, you know, to Abbott's point. We have a mental health crisis. Well, do something about that and do something about having guns in the hands of mentally ill people.",

We put all these guns down there.We've got a lot do here and we've got real solutions to problems. Raising an age limit for instance on access to AR-15s. Closing the gun show loophole. You can go to a gun show in Texas, buy an AR-15 without so much to showing your driver's license. So, I heard a congressman say earlier, there's nothing we can do. That's just ludicrous. And certainly, we've got to do extreme risk protective orders. Florida did this. Twenty-one days after Parkland, they initiated a massive set of gun bills. You've got Bill Lee in Tennessee telling his congress, hey, we need to do something about extreme risk protective orders. The fact is, this guy was clearly mentally ill. Clearly had a cache of weapons. You know, don't know who called or could have called the police exactly, but we don't have a law in place in Texas to stop this. This chaos that has ensued is a wholly made and created chaotic situation by the Republicans. More guns does not equal less crime.

For far too many years, we have listened to people like Ken Paxton who have said, more guns solve problems. It was a lie. They conned America. It's not true.

Twenty years ago, we had 200 million weapons in America. We now have over 400 million plus ghost guns. So, we have more than doubled. And, 20 years ago, AR-15 sales were less than 2 percent of all guns sold. They are now 25 percent.

We've been a country that is recognized the right to gun ownership, but also the need for laws to protect public safety.That changed in '77 when the NRA was taken over by this Harlan Carter guy, and really hit its peak in the late '90s and early 2000s and we've now seen the consequences of it. But we are a country that has respected the rights of gun owners, firearms owners, but also acknowledge the need for safety. And so, the first myth that really drives me crazy is the idea that if you want to reduce gun violence, your anti-gun, okay, because it's not true. And so that's number one. I'm not anti-gun. I respect gun owners. I have gun owners in my family. I want to reduce gun violence. I hate gun violence. The other one that drives me crazy because it is personal when it comes to schools. After Sandy Hook, the NRA said for the very first time -- this is not like it's been a part of our history for a long time. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. They said that after Sandy Hook, about four or five days after. They turned Sandy Hook into a gun sales bonanza. That's what they did. And so, it -- because my daughter was killed five years later in a school from an AR-15, again, it really upsets me. But we put all the facts there, everything is well researched and resourced.

      "sentences": "Jim, in the ongoing macabre soap opera that is the Russian saga in the battle for Bakhmut, the latest part of this drama is that Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Private Military Company, as he likes to call himself, the mercenary organization, has gone back on his threat to withdraw his troops from the city on May 10th and hand over to Chechens under the command of Kadyrov, and that is because he is saying he (inaudible) now being promised the ammunition that up until now he was claiming that the Russian Ministry of Defense had been denying him.Now, all of this is part of a mysterious ongoing spat that he has with the Ministry of Defense inside Russia. He is frequently complaining and very publicly critical of the leadership of the Russian generals. He has recently recruited former Russian generals. But I think that really this is something of a distraction because as far as the Ukrainians are concerned, they have been delighted if the Wagner Group had left and had to be replaced because it would have left a period of vulnerability in that very bloody fight for a town that the Ukrainians say they are happy to kill Russians in. But as far as they are concerned, doesn't really have any strategic interest or advantage. Unlike their preparations for what they say is a planned summer offensive. All eyes are on the Ukrainians to see where and how this offensive may begin. There's a lot of speculation that it might get underway in the south, perhaps with the attempt at liberating the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant there. There have been reports from the Russian side or the Russian-held areas of Ukraine of mass evacuations, of looted goods, of civilians and indeed, of some military elements particularly from the city of Melitopol appearing on social media and being claimed by elements within the Ukrainian administration. Now, that would be a sign that the Russians are expecting something, Jim.",
