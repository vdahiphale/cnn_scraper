This hour, the National Football League is weighing how to handle a brutal and illegal late hit that forced Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence out of Sunday's game with a concussion. Today the linebacker from the Texans, the man responsible, is apologizing and Lawrence is updating fans on his condition while we wait for news from the NFL.Plus, California is preparing for battle with the new Trump administration with the governor asking lawmakers for $25 million for expected legal fights before Trump has even taken office. They're back at work for a special session over this today and the state's attorney general is here live to explain why. And leading this hour, put on your Sunday best and step into the spotlight. Two of Trump's most high profile cabinet picks are on Capitol Hill today meeting with some of the senators who will decide whether or not to confirm them for their jobs. It comes as Trump is weighing in on everything from foreign policy to President Biden's pardon of his son, Hunter, while Trump meets with allies down at Mar- a-Lago. Let's go straight now to CNN's Kaitlan Collins, who's live for us from West Palm Beach, Florida. And Kaitlan, we know that Trump's pick for U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi, as well as Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth, both of them are on Capitol Hill today. How confident is Trump that they'll succeed and get confirmed?",

I should note that we are expecting other members that he has picked to be in his cabinet should they get confirmed by those senators that they are meeting with are expected to be on Capitol Hill all week as they are moving ahead to what this is going to look like and how soon those confirmation hearings are going to start once Trump is sworn in. You just saw Chuck Grassley putting out a statement saying that Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, will get a very quick confirmation process, at least a hearing underway. We'll see what the Republican senators say on her. Of course, she's been a much less controversial pick than Trump's last one that he had picked to run the Justice Department.But Pete Hegseth is also up there as well, Jake. And that one's more of a question mark, even for people back at Mar-a-Lago, who just in recent days, two days ago, were dealing with an e-mail that was published by \"The New York Times.\" It was written by Pete Hegseth's mom to him while he was in the middle of a divorce from his second wife where she was calling him an abuser of women and criticized -- (TECHNICAL DIFICULTY) -- demeaning women. That was an e-mail that was published in full by \"The New York Times\" and Hegseth's team, I should note, pushed back on that. But it was a fresh headache for the Trump team that has been dealing with what they are facing for to potentially be a dicey confirmation process for him. And so that's why these meetings are happening so they can have these one-on-one conversations with senators. But I still think it's an open question for Hegseth. Though I will say the people that have spoken to Trump's orbit feel really good about how Pam Bondi's meetings have been going.",

That will be the first committee that will actually take up his nomination early next year. One of the meetings he's gonna have in just a matter of moments is with Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska who also sits on that committee and I asked him whether or not he would bring up those allegations and talked to him about that in this meeting that's coming up.

But to my mind, that is precisely the situation in which a president of the United States needs to exercise restraint and caution in exercising the pardon power.The Constitution gives presidents broad authority to pardon individuals. But that power needs to be exercised with restraint and what Biden did here was that we're worst sort of just in unfair, non- neutral, partial application of the law. He's gone on a lot and gone after Trump about, you know, two-tiered justice system and going after people and exercising favoritism and then he did it himself. He sacrificed the moral high ground in the process. I think it was disrespectful to the American people given his promises over the years and it was also disrespectful to the rule of law frankly.",

WALSH (voice-over): Confident they can hold out in Kursk, less confident of how long the west expects them to. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera): Well, Jake, today we've seen the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz come to Kyiv promising more air defense. But it's his first visit in quite a while. And certainly on the heels of criticism over his phone call to the Kremlin head, Vladimir Putin, essentially ending many years of isolation for Moscow. You heard about North Korean troops in that report. Well, we heard from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the weekend that some had indeed been killed. And there have been suggestions they've been integrated into Russian units. But hearing there they've not been seen in full force on the front lines. Jake?",

Several candidates have already thrown their hats into the DNC chair race, including Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party Chair, Ken Martin, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, New York State Senator James Skoufis, and my next guest, the former governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley. He recently resigned as head of the Social Security Administration to run for the DNC chair position. And you were just telling me during the commercial break about how rewarding that was, how much work you did.Which do you think was a more -- is a more beleaguered organization, the Social Security Administration when you took over, or the Democratic Party, which is more beleaguered? MARTIN O'MALLEY, CANDIDATE FOR DNC CHAIR: Wow, that's a tough call. You know, when -- when the President asked me to go pull Social Security out of a customer service nosedive, they listed themselves the most demoralized place to work in the federal government three years in a row. And yet they rose. And I'd never worked with a finer group of Americans. And I do believe that this is a moment in our party where -- where we can actually pick ourselves up off the mat. You know, darkness makes a great canvas. And we have to ask ourselves a lot of questions about how it is that we have a brand that people run away from instead of a brand that people want to run on. And so, you know, it's a time for rebuilding and it's a time for reconnecting. And I believe I have the right set of skills to lead my party out of this darkness.",

In fact, some Obama people I talked to said that in 2012, they -- they made a point of not, you know, showing people charts to, you know, look how good everything is, but just talking about, like, we -- we've still got -- we're making progress, we still got a lot of work to do. But somebody had this idea of touring the country, Bidenomics, et cetera. How much of the blame do you put on the White House?O'MALLEY: Yes, you know, I'm -- I'm not running for DNC chair to fix blame. I'm running to fix the problem. And we will have to do a dispassionate deep dive on what -- where we failed to connect and why and how. I know from my own experience running. I ran in 2010 for reelection, and it was after the recession, and a lot of my consultants, both of my consultants told me, don't talk about the truth, that we're starting to get better because people don't want to hear it. They're not feeling it. It -- the charts and the graphs don't do it. But being able to connect the personal stories to real people in real places, that's how you connect. I traveled when I was running for reelection on the back of the green Winnebago. We carried a kitchen table, literally with us strapped to the back of the Winnebago. And were bringing out almost like a presidential seal before talks. And I'd say this is the most important place in Maryland. So what the President and the White House needed to do was to connect those dots in very plain language back to those kitchen tables about jobs, about the high costs of prescription drugs. I mean, the truth is the President did enormously impactful work to bring down the price of prescription drugs. But we didn't hear that too much nationally, did we, Jake?",

In fact, they described their client's actions as heroic, saying that he decided to step in to protect his fellow passengers in a moment where everyone was scared and nobody else would step in. They also specifically focused on the fact that they do not believe it was the chokehold that Daniel Penny placed Jordan Neely in that killed him, but rather a combination of factors, including his sickle cell trait, the fact that he was high on K2, and the fact that he was experiencing mental illness.Now, the prosecution began to lay out their closing statements this afternoon, and they went very methodically, step by step through a lot of the evidence that's been presented in this case. Now, we are expecting them to finish tomorrow, but so far they have split up their closing arguments into three important parts, justification, recklessness and cause of death. And Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran spent most of the afternoon explaining the definition of recklessness. And that's key here because of the manslaughter charge that Penny is facing. Now, even though we have not heard from Daniel Penny directly during this trial, he chose not to take the stand. We do hear from him in that interview video when he sat down with detectives following the incident. And it's that video that Yoran used today over and over to point to what she calls his recklessness and his disregard for Jordan Neely's life. She talks about how he appears not concerned about what happened. He is somewhat nonchalant, she said, when describing the interaction. And at one point she said, as she was describing the amount of time that Neely was held in that chokehold, she referenced the last portion of it and said the last 51 seconds, Mr. Neely was already unconscious. There was no conceivable justification under the law and human decency to hold an unconscious man in a chokehold. We cannot as a society tolerate an unjust and untimely death of a fellow citizen. That's the question here, whether or not Penny had enough justification to do exactly that, take the life of another. She pointed to the recklessness, the fact that he multiple times referred to Mr. Neely as a crackhead. She said it was evidence of the fact that he disregarded his life. Tomorrow she will get at the cause of death, another key part of the prosecution's case. And we are expecting the jury to get instructions and the case and likely begin deliberating tomorrow. Jake?",
