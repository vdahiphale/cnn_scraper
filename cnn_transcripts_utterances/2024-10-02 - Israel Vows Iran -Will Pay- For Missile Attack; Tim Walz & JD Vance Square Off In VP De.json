Iran launching its largest attack ever on Israel Tuesday, firing about 180 ballistic missiles. At least one person was killed, several are injured, even though Israel and its allies were able to intercept most of the missiles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance in the political space for the last few months and you think of him as the guy who hates childless cat ladies, and is willing to kind of make scapegoats or caricatures out of legal status immigrants in Ohio, you would have seen a very different candidate last night. You would have seen someone who was gentle, poised who listened, who found ways to agree, even on what problems are, even when you disagree on the solutions.So I think that was in terms of sort of image rehab, we've seen in polling J.D. Vance since being just underwater in terms of favorability, and I think we saw really different side of him last night and that probably helps him with some voters. But, you know, fundamentally, there were also a lot of missed mistruths and on accuracies that reveal themselves in last night's discussion and some weak points on the part of both candidates. So I'm not -- the fact that civility was one of the takeaway headlines that we keep saying is in theory for American democracy.

This is the system working, by the way, both the civility and the move toward the center are really is what you want to see in the closing weeks of a debate. You want people to try and kind of claim the broad middle. That's how we get a stable democracy.So, J.D. Vance had the harder assignment when it came to that because he's defending something that we know from the polls is pretty much out of sync with a lot of where for the rest of the country is. He tried to make it seem reasonable. He tried to make it seem that he was both 100 percent pro-life, but also not in favor of a national abortion ban. That just is not, you know, a coherent position. And Tim Walz, I think it took advantage of it. He had three different anecdotes of the kind of horror stories that have already started to pop up as a result of some of the restrictions that are in place with the ending of Roe versus Wade, but J.D. Vance didn't really have an answer. He had his own anecdote, but it was for an anonymous person, a very sort of suspects story, frankly. Matt Gorman, I want to ask you what -- about what J.D. Vance had to say or didn't have to say about the 2020 election results as January 6 became a topic of conversation, I -- Walz, Tim Walz took the question and kind of turned it on J.D. Vance.

I think that's where the civility in name only kind of came from. But it's really kind of focusing on the person.And look, I will say this: Vance was clearly prepared for that sort of question. And that pivot talking about kind of the misinformation, talking about the Kamala Harris and Facebook and misinformation on the 2020 election I think spoke to the fact that he was ready for it. Number one, he had and pivoted out of it. And number two, I think the story of it with Vance was, you saw all the interviews in the prep he had done over the last, you know, what, three, four months that he's been on the ticket, if not more, really show up. And when you saw with Walz who hasn't done really many interviews, only really want outside of it with Dana Bash, obviously, not having that interview prep, that having the tough questions and the ability to refine your arguments made him a little tougher to kind of pivot out of those trickier subjects.

I'm big fan of local media, so should probably get out there more to do local media.But I just think, look, I think that there was a good debate. There's a good policy conversation whether or not you, who are you agree with on the side, they laid out policy initiatives here and it gives the American people some more meat to hang onto when they're starting to look now at who they're going to vote for. But I do think he met the do-no-harm threshold. I think he surpass that. I think he did a good job.

The cost of striking could include nuclear pollution around -- around Iran. So really bad precedent does that, let's find some other ways to restrain the program, especially since Iranians don't seem to be right on top of building a weapon. But now, who's going to go say that? Certainly not Donald Trump who pulled out of the Iranian nuclear accord and has threatened the Iranians at various moments and who the Iranians have sent out people to try to assassinate him and broken into his campaign. So no love lost there. And I think for Vice President Harris, it's a really tricky time. If she said after a missile attack like this, really the Israeli should -- should pare back on this, you can imagine how the Republicans would leap on her.
