Blindsided is how many have described learning the news that Saudi back to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour. Until now fears foes are getting into partnership together. We'll take a closer look at the Gulf Kingdoms, increasing influence in global sports and the people leading that charge show also in your headlines this hour. Hundreds flee Ukraine's Kherson region after the collapse of a critical dam, raising fears of an environmental catastrophe. Questions aren't answered over what caused the collapse as the scope of the disaster gets clearer. Pope Francis has been admitted to a hospital in Rome where he will undergo surgery in the coming hours we'll have to he'll have to stay there for the next several days as he recuperates from abdominal surgery. More on that is coming up. Prince Harry is back at the High Court in London today being cross examined in his second and final day on the witness stand. He showed some emotion and choked up when asked about how the past day and a half had been for him. Well, welcome to our second hour of Connect the World, its 11 am in New York, 7 pm in Abu Dhabi, and its 6 pm in Riyadh, where the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is charting an ambitious new course in global politics and sports literally, through the golf course. Right now, the top American diplomat is in Riyadh that is for a second day of meetings as the U.S. tries to re- engage rehabilitates its relations with the Saudis. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arriving in the capital a day after his nearly two hour meeting after midnight in Jeddah with the Kingdom's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and they have touched we are told on sensitive issues including human rights. The conflict in Yemen and the potential normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations for Blinken's visit coming as the PGA Golf Tour. The U.S. tour unveiled a new partnership with Saudi Arabia's public investment fund the sovereign wealth fund, the financier of its sworn rival, LIV Golf. Well, CNN's Nic Robertson covering this from London. Alex Marquardt is standing by in Washington. I start with you, Nic. Antony Blinken's trip coinciding perhaps, coincidentally, perhaps not with a huge announcement from the Kingdom, about a massive investment and coming together with the PGA Tour and where Saudis LIV Golf organization. This has been a real bone of contention for golf for golfers, and it's really hit the headlines over the past year. Group litigation, between the two tours, which we are told is now over. We don't have much more detail on this deal of yet, but it sort of speaks to and I'd like you to just discuss this, if you will, with us. It speaks to, you know, a wider sort of relationship with the U.S. through the prism of goals, at a time when Washington and the Biden administration, quite frankly, is trying to rehabilitate what has been a pretty fractured relationship with the Kingdom. There's a lot going on here. And Alex will, you know, get involved in this conversation as well. What are your thoughts about what we are seeing at this point?",

I mean, I don't know whether we've actually specifically stood that up on CNN or not, perhaps you can tell me but the wider story here is one that I really want you to provide some analysis and thought on, if you will. Nic, talking to the fact that the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to be seen as a regional, a global power broker. He certainly is a regional power broker. I'm sitting here in the UAE and neighboring UAE. I mean, there is no doubt about it. I mean, this is a Mohammed bin Salman is a force to be reckoned with in this region. He's a man with a vision and in a rush to totally transform his country. And he wants respect and support for that from Washington. And to be frank, it is clear, he is not convinced that he is getting that certainly not of late by this Biden administration enter Antony Blinken in Jeddah, and in Riyadh today. But in Jeddah last night, on a tour as it were, on a visit to continue to and this isn't his first visit by any stretch of the imagination of like, he's continuing to try and rehabilitate relations with the Kingdom. How do you assess what you are seeing happening here?",

And I cover this region, sort of on a minute byminute basis and speak to people locally and work the sources here. We know that the Kingdom certainly believes at this point that it has the upper hand in this relationship. It certainly feels like it's got a lot of levers to pull when it comes to its relationship with the Biden administration. It knows that the Biden administration has put normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel at the heart of its Middle East policy as it tries to sort of remove itself from the sort of machinations of sort of erstwhile military conflict in this region. And Saudis have a list of wants at this point. And they are sort of going through them systematically. They also know that they can look east. Their biggest customer these days, of course, is China. And incidentally, I think it's important to point out Blinken is in Riyadh and Jeddah today and yesterday. The Saudis are holding an enormous China-Saudi business event next week. And again, I'm not sure that that's necessarily, you know, a coincidence. I mean, there is a lot of noise out of Saudi Arabia in this region about how important the Chinese are, the Russians are, and various others? They've been very vocal about being interested in joining the BRICS grouping, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which sees itself as sort of competing with the G7.

They, they their focus is vision 2030, the totaltransformation of their economy and society and everything. The Saudis diplomacy, its business transactions is geopolitics is squarely focused on their economic interests at the moment. And much of what we've been discussing tonight, very much plays to that file to both of you. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. So Saudi Arabia, set to become a preeminent force in global professional golf, this partnership between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour. The old European tour comes after LIV poured millions of dollars into signing away some of the PGA Tour's top players last year and started running events in September. It sparked a mixture of surprise and anger, both in and outside the PGA Tour. Rory Mcllroy, one of golf's top stars and big voice on the PGA Tour says today he still hates LIV but ultimately, it is going to be good for the sport. Have a listen. OK, I haven't got that sound for you for the time being. But you get my drift. One of the key players in this deal is the Head of the Saudi Public Investment Fund or PIF. And of course, the man who runs that is Yasir Al- Rumayyan in recent profile piece about him for the athletic. My next guest writes, and \"Some within PIF have expressed fears that the wealth fund is finding it difficult to fulfill Bin Salman's briefs. Al- Rumayyan has previously explained his philosophy in Saudi interviews, it is better to have 100 goals and succeed in 70 than to have 10 targets and complete them perfectly\". And Jacob Whitehead who wrote that piece and it's a jolly good piece, so joins me from Newcastle in England. And how timely this piece you couldn't have made this up. Jacob, I have to ask you, first and foremost, because it's not just golf, I want to talk about the kind of plethora of Saudi sports investment, which is really sort of, you know, providing, you know, a real sort of thought, as it were in many people's eyes in the world of sports. But it's certainly a disrupter. Let me put it that way. But were you as blindsided as everybody else was yesterday when this partnership was announced?",

I suppose it's interesting, because you can see both of them as massive steps in vision 2030, and each one building on each other. And I guess you can see both of them in terms of a form of legitimacy for golf for getting Saudi a seat at the table and in football at signing some of the world's biggest stars in of the world's biggest game. And I suppose by doing that, it gets more eyes on Saudi sports Hill moves towards a potential World Cup beds in 2030, 2034, which, I guess is the end goal of this quest for legitimacy.",

And I know back in Saudi, you know, there was no more important story, let's be quite frank, doesn't matter where you're from, you know, your national football team can really unite. So you're right to point out that, you know, we talk a lot about Saudis vision 2030 and how it's transforming the country and what that means outside of Saudi. We also have to remember there's a really, really important story of societal change inside of Saudi. I do want to talk about Yasir, who the man is behind PIF. Before I do that, I just want to bring up a tweet from the athletics sports writer, Adam Crafton you know, Adam, of course, he writes that, the thing was Saudi is there is a balanced story to tell, there are societal changes, there is opening up, there is diversification of investment, but there is also Khashoggi, the 9/11 families, the continued repression of women's rights, LGBT rights. He goes on to say those who benefit from Saudi cash only want to celebrate the good and ignore the bad. Before we talk about Yasir Al-Rumayyan, let me just bring up as I promised our viewers that we would hear from Rory Mcllroy, who has been very much against the LIV Golf organization to date.

And if we were to sort of make global shipping a country right in the list of global top emitters, it would take up the sixth position. So that shows you how significant it is. GIOKOS (voice over): That's why the International Maritime Organization or IMO set new rules for the shipping industry to lower its carbon footprints and reduce air pollution. While volcanoes can release some of the chemicals that cause acid rain, most come from human activity and burning fossil fuels, which release nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide into the air. So in 2020, the IMO introduced a rule that cuts the acceptable level of sulfur in marine oil from three and a half percent to 0.5 percent. GIOKOS (on camera): To help meet these green goals, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology has come up with a solution and it's all about creating clean and sustainable fuel for shipping.

It's a partnership with Saudi Aramco base oil company Luberef. For Professor Robert and his team, it is about finding a sustainable solution to using scrubbers and also making it cost friendly.
