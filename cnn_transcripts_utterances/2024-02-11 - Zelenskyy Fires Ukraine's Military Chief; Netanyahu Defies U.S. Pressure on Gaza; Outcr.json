But I think the biggest reason is the fear of Russia's response, of Russia's so-called red lines.And I think even though these nuclear threats have failed to completely deter American resistance to Ukraine, Putin's nuclear brinksmanship has succeeded in throttling that assistance. So I think there's sort of self-imposed self-deterrence if you will, self-imposed red lines were a major factor in why so many capabilities came to Ukraine too late. And things that were considered to be provocative, unacceptable, like Western tanks, like the F-16s, were only deemed to be OK a year or so later.",

All of that added up, to a tremendous amount of uncertainty about where the direction of the economy is going. It's really only over the last 45 days or so that those questions have begun to ease. And now, people are looking towards sustained lower levels of inflation, higher stock markets, lower interest rates and so on. Given that, they can hope for things to get better from here.

One theory is that the economy just hasn't been that strong for most of the period since the end of the financial crisis, that Obama's ratings were sort of appropriately low, given the tepid rate of economic growth. And that Donald Trump is really the only exception here. That, yes, in 2019, the economy started to get strong, but by then, you know, Donald Trump was sort of this uniquely polarizing figure who was probably not going to be especially popular, given his penchant to offend large segments of the electorate. Then, Joe Biden becomes president, inflation takes hold. So, that's theory number one is that for most of the last, you know, 15 years since the financial crisis the economy has been bad, and there isn't as much of a disconnect as it looks.Theory number two, is that this is about partisan polarization. That we no longer live in a country where 65 percent of Americans will have a favorable view of the president as they did during the 1990s when Bill Clinton was really the last president to ride a sustained economic boom to board levels of popularity. I think that next year is really going to put to the test because Joe Biden, while he may not be popular, he's not Donald Trump. The country doesn't hate him. He has not offended huge swaths of the electorate. This is the kind of president that, in theory, might be able to ride broad economic prosperity to broad support in the polls.",

And also know that even though the electorate as a whole, looks really stable, that we consistently have close elections. We often see a lot of movement under the surface. We've seen White working-class voters in the Midwest swing decisively one way. We've seen college-educated voters in the suburbs swing the other.
