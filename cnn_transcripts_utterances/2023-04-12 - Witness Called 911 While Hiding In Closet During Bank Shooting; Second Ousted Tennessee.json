Louisville police released 911 calls from Monday's deadly shooting, including one from the shooter's mom who insisted that her son was nonviolent and said she did not know where he would get a gun. And a massive inferno. Flames engulfing an Indiana recycling plant. The large smoke plume stretches for miles. The toxic risk as the fire is expected to burn for days. Plus, the judge hearing the billion dollar Dominion versus Fox lawsuit today sanctioned Fox's lawyers, accusing the lawyers of withholding evidence and not telling the court the truth in a case about Fox lying to its audience. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start today with our national lead. This afternoon, Louisville police released the frantic 911 calls from the moments after that horrific mass shooting began at a bank on Monday, and you can hear the panic in the voices of the employees who were inside the building when the senseless attacks started, including this woman who saw some of her coworkers gunned down. She survived by hiding in a closet. I want to warn our viewers -- some of this audio is rather disturbing. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) 911 OPERATOR:  Has anybody been shot?",

RYAN YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Massive celebrations today as a Shelby County Board of Commissioners voted to confirm the reappointment of Justin J. Pearson to the Tennessee state house, a city lost last week after he and two other Democrats call for gun reform on the chamber floor. Two of the so-called Tennessee Three, Representative Justin Jones and Representative Justin Pearson, both Black, were expelled from their seats. Representative Johnson, who was white, was nearly spared. Justin Jones was reinstated to the statehouse Monday after Nashville officials voted to reappoint him. Today, the three of them gathered with hundreds of protesters here in Memphis, supporting their expelled colleague as he waited on his vote.

BYRON DONALDS (R-FL):  Well, Jake, it's good to be with you. This has been a question that's been coming up in various state legislatures. When I was in the Florida legislature, similar question came up. The default position became red flag laws , risk protection orders or whatever you want to call them. The issue with red flag laws is that the U.S. citizen who somebody thinks might have mental health issues, their property is taken from them, and then they have to go to court to get their property back if it's found out that the mental health claims are actually invalid. So, in short, you're actually violating the constitutional rights of an American citizen. And then they have to prove to the court that their rights should be in state be reinstated. That's the issue with red flag laws as they exist today. If you're going to talk about a different situation where you're saying if somebody in the family said or in the community said it's talking about the mental health issues that exists, and then there is a procedure that goes through to attest to that to figure that out, you go through a legal procedure around that, and then something is talked about firearms, that might be palatable. But the way red flag laws operate today violate the rights of American citizens. And at the end of the day, we are a nation of laws. We are a nation by the U.S. Constitution. Constitutional rights have to be protected at all times.",

But that's not what risk protection orders do. Risk protection orders take away your property. And then you have to go to court to get your property back.That is a fundamental taking under the United States Constitution. That's why I believe that the actual taking of property is unconstitutional, but that's something we're even conservatives disagree. That's no disrespect to Grady Judd. That's my position, and that's my way of looking at the U.S. Constitution and the property of people who are citizens in our country who until a tragedy occurs, they actually have not run afoul of the law.

But you can't take somebody's property from them, and then they have to petition the court to get their stuff back. That's the wrong way to go. That's always been my disagreement with red flag laws. It's my disagreement today. And look for the children who lost their lives in that church that is horrific. But what you're dealing with there is somebody who knowingly went about breaking the law.

Two separate video surfaced online that appear to show Russians beheading Ukrainian soldiers.And now, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging world leaders to do something about this as pro-Russian bloggers celebrate the atrocious videos. One posting, quote: You'd be surprised how many of such videos will gradually emerge, followed by a smiley face. CNN's Ben Wedeman is an eastern Ukraine for us where it's believed some of these barbaric acts took place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In a war not short of images of brutality and horror, two videos purporting to show acts of unimaginable barbarism, too gruesome to air. In this series of still frames, a man wearing military fatigues is seen using a knife to cut off the head of another man in army uniform. The victim is seen wearing a yellow armband typically worn by Ukrainian soldiers. From the voices on the recording, it seems the victim was still alive as the beheading began. The perpetrator's identity is also hidden, but he's seen wearing a white tie on his leg, a means of identification often worn by Russian fighters. Ukrainian authorities say they're working to uncover where and when the incident might have taken place, as well as trying to establish the victim's identity and that of the other men in the video. This is something that no one in the world can ignore, says President Zelenskyy. How easily these beasts kill this video of the execution of a Ukrainian POW. The world must see it. Ask about the video during the daily call with journalists, the Kremlin spokesman acknowledged the footage was terrible, but added a caveat. First of all, said spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in the world of fakes that we inhabit. We need to check the veracity of this footage. At about the same time, another video also emerged on social media, this one believed to have been filmed in the last few days purporting to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying next to the destroyed military vehicle. Voices speaking in Russian claimed the soldiers had had their heads cut off. Images on the video appeared to show the soldiers hands and also been cut off. Pro-Russian social media posters said the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, scene of the war's fiercest fighting, but CNN is unable to confirm the location. The United Nations said it was appalled by the videos, but 14 months into Russia's full scale invasion, reiterated these are not isolated incidents. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And these are just a few of the videos that have emerged from this war. Recently, there was video of Russian soldiers killing an unarmed Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered. Last summer, there was another video that showed what was clearly a Russian soldier castrating live a Ukrainian soldier -- Jake.",

Quote: The chaos that accompanied the hasty retreat with scenes of desperation so eerily similar to the fall of Saigon in '75 conveyed a global message of American weakness. A message Vladimir Putin undoubtedly read as a green light to invade Ukraine six months later. That's from Jeff Jacoby, a conservative columnist for \"The Globe\". The withdrawal itself undoubtedly is going to be a stain on Biden's legacy.

Take a look at the joint statement, right, between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin before the Beijing Olympics. You know what the message there was? Hey, you're over, United States. You're over, Western democratic world. It's our turn to establish this new -- you know, this new era of international relations.
