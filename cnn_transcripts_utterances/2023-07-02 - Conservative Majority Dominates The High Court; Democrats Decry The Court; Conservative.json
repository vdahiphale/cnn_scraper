One year after the federal ending a federal ban to on abortion, the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority has now flexed its muscle once again over key aspects of American life. In a blockbuster ruling, a finale to its term, the six Republican appointed justices struck down President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan. It limited protections for the nation's LGBTQ community and most notably, it ended race based affirmative action in college admissions. And just like the Dobbs decision, it is another example of this conservative supermajority, reversing decades of established precedent. The ruling guts programs which have helped open doors for qualified black and Latino students in higher education in the post- civil rights era, but affirmative action's opponents who have argued for decades that it effectively reverse discrimination, they rejoice this week. And hours after the momentous ruling, President Biden issued his own verdict on the court itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And another that is seeking to find common ground where possible, and seemingly sensitive to the sustained attack on its legitimacy.\"At the same time, maybe they're sensitive to the attack on its legitimacy. But these rulings, when these big, kind of, societal rulings come down, the American public -- they're pretty easily forgets about the common ground ones, and focuses on things like the affirmative action one, the LGBTQ rights one, and perhaps rightfully so. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, PBS NEWSHOUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Right. And the public is still dealing with the ramifications of the Dobbs decision last term. And very much so that the Biden White House thinks that's going to be a big deal in the 2024 election campaign, and something that they can rally around and run on and that Democrats will be motivated by. Now you add these on top of it, the decisions this term on affirmative action on weakening LGBTQ anti-discrimination, and the student loan forgiveness.
