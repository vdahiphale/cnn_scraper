Tonight, we're going to facilitate a much needed conversation, between a community demanding accountability, and the leaders charged with keeping them safe. In studio, with me here, are some of the residents, of East Palestine, Ohio, and they're joined by their neighbors, from their hometown, which sits alongside the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. These men and women have spent the last 19 days, frightened and frustrated, after a train derailment sent hazardous chemicals, into their air, into their soil, into their water. They've been told that it's safe to breathe the air, and drink the water. But they have seen thousands of dead fish, in local creeks. And many of them have felt and continue to feel ill. Tonight, for the first time, since that disaster, residents are going to have the chance, to directly question the CEO of Norfolk Southern, the train company, at the center of all this; and the EPA Administrator, Michael Regan; and their Governor, Mike DeWine. Some of the questions we've been hearing, since we've been covering this story. \"How could this happen? Is the air safe to breathe? Is the water safe to drink? Can the testing be trusted?\" Now, we're going to let members of the community ask their questions in a moment. But first, let's bring in CNN's Jason Carroll, also in East Palestine, Ohio, to bring us up to speed. Jason?",

So it is true that if we were to test blood, for these, they're called volatile organic compounds, if we were to test a person's blood, now, after a potential exposure, days ago, you almost certainly would not find those chemicals, in the blood. However, every case is unique, in terms of the symptoms, people are having, the situation they might be encountering. And there may be a reason, to test, for other substances, or to establish a baseline, of certain values from bloodwork. In other circumstances, bloodwork might not be the best option. And there might be other testing or even careful observation.

I have some orders for the company.And the orders are that the company will comply with our order, which compels them to take full responsibility, full accountability for the trauma they have inflicted on this community and the damage that they've caused. And the EPA will use all of its authority to do so. So I'm hopeful that the company will comply with our order in a very orderly fashion, timely fashion, be efficient for the information we're looking for because we want to clean this mess up as quickly as possible. The people of East Palestine deserve better. They deserve immediate action. And the EPA is going to do its part to ensure that we stand by and stand with this community.",
