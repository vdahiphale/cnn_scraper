      "sentences": "That's right, John. And we're just moments away from another round of poll closings. Voting is about to end in three states, including the key battleground of Nevada. A total of 16 electoral votes are on the line right now.And CNN can project that Donald Trump will win the state of Montana. As expected, Trump gets Montana with its four electoral votes. CNN can also project that Donald Trump will win the state of Utah, as expected, Utah with its six electoral votes. Nevada is too early to call, a battleground state that Donald Trump has narrowly lost in the last two elections, but it's making a big play for this election. Let's look at the electoral math right now. Donald Trump has 172 electoral votes, Kamala Harris with 81 electoral votes. 270 electoral votes needed to win. Neither of them is there yet. Let's look at the key races now, Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris, 49. 9 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has narrowed her 20,000-plus vote lead. He's at 49.2 percent of the vote. More votes have come in from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 43 percent of the estimated vote from Pennsylvania's in and Kamala Harris right now is an 18,000-plus vote lead there. Kamala Harris in the lead in Michigan, 51.6 percent of the vote, Donald Trump has 46.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 46,000-plus vote lead, still only 16 percent of the estimated vote in Michigan has been counted. In battleground Wisconsin, Harris is at 49.8 percent of the vote. Donald Trump is at 48.4 percent of the vote. She has a 15,000-plus vote lead. That's with more than a third, 35 percent of the vote counted in Wisconsin. In battleground North Carolina, Donald Trump maintaining his lead. He has 52 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris is 46.8 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 196,000-plus vote lead, that is with two thirds, 66 percent of the estimated vote in North Carolina counted. In battleground Georgia, Donald Trump maintaining his lead, 51.9 percent of the vote, Kamala Harris, 47.1 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 208,000-plus vote lead. That's with 79 percent of the estimated vote in from the battleground state of Georgia. We're now getting an update on the vote in North Carolina. Let's go to John King, actually, right now. John King, what can you tell us?",

And, again, as we get later in the night, this is where you start to see things change, especially if a candidate pulls out ahead in a state that not normally is in their lane, if you will. And by that, I'm going to refer you for Iowa. Just a moment ago, I was showing you Iowa with the vice president ahead, still competitive, but you see Iowa is now red. There was that late Iowa poll that showed the possibility of the vice president maybe being a little bit ahead of Donald Trump. No clear leader, it was a competitive poll and this is a competitive race at the moment, 36 percent.This would be a surprise, right? We said Virginia's a surprise at how close it is. We'll see if it ends close, but it's a surprise at the moment. This is a surprise as well. Donald Trump just 3,800 votes ahead in battleground Iowa, a state he carried quite comfortably by nine points, eight points four years ago. So, you keep an eye on it and you watch and you see what happens there. But it's interesting on this night. Now, let's move over to the battlegrounds that matter at the moment. The blue wall states still being held by the vice president, the Sun Belt states, as we start to move west, North Carolina and Georgia, the two battlegrounds we care most about, they are at the moment held by the former president of the United States. Again, this was his closest battleground win in terms of Biden was the closest to him back in 2020. It was 74,000 votes. He's just under 200,000 votes right now, 66 percent reporting, the former president at 52 percent of the vote. And, again, Jake, as you come over and join me here, just let's remind our viewers still votes to be counted. We know that. So, then we want to use our technology to say, where are they? All right, where are they? And you see the bigger the circle means the more live outstanding votes. And the color tells you what's happening there. And at the moment, doesn't mean it will continue to be that way, you see Mecklenburg County, that's Charlotte in the suburbs. You see over here in the Raleigh-Durham area, Winston-Salem area, a little bit out of Ashville. So, more votes to be counted out there, but Donald Trump at the moment with a pretty healthy lead.",

This official says, look, first and foremost, it's going to take some more time to get results from across North Carolina, a hundred counties. He said that this is going to be close. It's going to take some time. There are counties that haven't reported yet that are red and there are counties that haven't reported yet that are blue.So, let's dive a little bit more into the numbers. We have Wake County. This is the most populous county in North Carolina. It's right here. I am told, so far, more than 510,000 votes have been reported. That's according to the state's dashboard. So, for context on that, there's 830,099 registered voters, so that's the most. It's likely going to be a lower number in the end. So, they're actually making some headway there. But over here in Mecklenburg, the home to Charlotte, they're having a log jam uploading the numbers to their site, I'm told so far, and things are moving quickly, so this could change. But just a second ago before I came on air, there were more than 84,000 votes reported so far. And for perspective, there's 857,354 registered voters in Mecklenburg. So, that's a very small fraction at last check that that we're seeing bear out and the results there, and, again, because they're having issues uploading on their site, which is bound to happen. And, again, that state official there in the Tar Heel state telling me that, again, be patient, it's going to take some time.",

The people who count our votes, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, agnostic, they do a good job in all the states, and North Carolina is one of the best. So, where are we, is the question, 213,000 vote lead. And it's what Pam just laid out and Bri just laid out. Bri is here, Brianna is here, Mecklenburg County, 10 percent of the population, the largest of the 100 counties in North Carolina, so we have a long way to go, right? So, you can the Democrat come back is the question, right? You see that healthy Donald Trump lead. So, your question is, can the Democrat come back? Well, the Vice President's at 65,000 votes there and a little bit of change. Okay. Mecklenburg County, the winner of Mecklenburg County is going to be over 300,000, close to 400,000 votes.

In 2020, Donald Trump got more votes than he did in 2016, almost everywhere, right? His base came out. Where he suffered was in the suburbs because there was higher Democratic turnout. So, if you're Donald Trump, yes, you want to pick up as many black votes and Latino votes as you can, and you want to improve your standing in the suburbs, and that includes women. It includes women.Donald Trump spent -- Republicans are ripping their hair out the last week of the campaign every day watching Donald Trump insult women. You know, pick your day. It was Nancy Pelosi one day. It was the vice president of the United States every day. It was women writ large some of those days. Republican strategists were ripping their hair out, because they know if Donald Trump improves his standing in the suburbs, you know, literally, by half a point, then he's the next president of the United States. And they're ripping their hair out. But as you watch through this, as we go through it, we'll see how it performs out. I just want to keep checking here. 213,000 votes, but we're still here.

But we have a ways to go in county.And that's just North Carolina. Let's go down to the biggest surprise. That was a tight -- that was very tight. The Democrats have -- every election cycle, they say, why can't we get North Carolina? But this was the big surprise when it flipped.

Donald Trump in the lead, 178 electoral votes, Kamala Harris has 91 electoral votes. 270 electoral votes, as always, needed to win. Let's take a look at the outstanding races right now. Arizona joins the map of key race alerts. Kamala Harris has 50 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 49.2 percent of the vote. That is a 15,478 vote lead for Kamala Harris with 49 percent of the estimated vote counted. Kamala Harris in Wisconsin, 49.9 percent of the vote, Donald Trump bringing up the rear, 48.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 19,910 vote lead. That's with 43 percent of the estimated vote counted in Wisconsin. In Pennsylvania, Donald Trump in the lead there now, 50.3 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris has 48.7 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 58,648 lead right now with an estimated 51 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania. In Georgia, Donald Trump in the lead there, 51.-8 percent of the vote, Kamala Harris, 47.2 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 204,640 vote lead, that's with 81 percent of the estimated vote in Georgia.

This margin's going to change. I mean, you know, there's some Republican votes down here, but there's plenty of opportunity for that tie, slight Harris lead, to turn into something else. It's the surprise of the night so far in terms of how close it is, but it just flipped blue. So, let's come back in 20 minutes ago and see how we're doing. This is the most interesting one. Mr. Tapper's home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, just flipped red. Remember earlier, I was saying the three blue wall states had stayed blue throughout the night.

I spoke to them a little bit ago. They said they don't have a number of what their overall Election Day count was and they're not sure how long it's going to take for them to get through it. They're just chugging through it little by little. Now in Cobb County, another large county here in Georgia, they said they still had less than a thousand absentee mail-in ballots that they had to get through and they also had about 85, 000 votes. That was their day of votes that they were turning to. They too are hoping to be done by 11:00 P.M. The last county I talked to is Clayton County. They were also working through their day of voting. They had hoped to have it done by 10:00 P.M. It looks like they're missing that deadline a little bit, but they were definitely saying they only had a handful of precincts left, about 13 precincts when I talked to them about a half an hour ago, that they were still trying to upload the day of voting for. So, things seem to be going pretty smoothly. And behind me, you get a little bit of a sense of the process. This is where the memory cards came through. They just brought them through. They check them in here with a police officer, they get scanned in. And then over in this glass room we're showing you, this is where these memory cards are removed. We start to see them uploaded.

And you wonder if it did actually score with social conservatives and in winning votes for him and turning them away from Kamala Harris. Whatever the reason, you can see tremendous gains.
