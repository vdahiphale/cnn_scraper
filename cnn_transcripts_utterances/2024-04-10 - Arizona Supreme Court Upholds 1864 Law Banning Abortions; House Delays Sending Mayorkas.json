(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R), U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE (via phone): I'm incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books. I believe its ARS 13-3603.

DOUG JONES (D), FORMER ALABAMA SENATOR: And you're asking seeing me if that makes sense? No. It absolutely does not make sense, except in the context, as David was saying, of folks that are now realizing that the dog has caught the car, and they don't know what to do. They don't know what to say. They did not think through what they were saying. And in the moment, because they were simply pandering to a base of voters in the Republican Party. A very extreme pro-life movement. And now they're caught. And all of a sudden, the same thing we saw happen with the IVF ruling in Alabama. State legislators were running around with their hair on fire saying, Oh me, oh, my, we didn't anticipate this. We didn't see this coming. Well, they're right. They didn't, because they don't think it through. They didn't think it through. And that's exactly where we are, as David described a minute ago.

Yet, I'm not certain that that will really make much of a difference. Donald Trump's path to the White House in November will be through a handful of battleground states. He has to maintain North Carolina, regain Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin. He cannot afford to lose one of those four states, either Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and expect to win. So this idea that abortion is back at the forefront, again, is -- is insanity to me. And I understand the former president wanted to say return it back to the states. And I would have argued just hit return it back to the states and allow voters in those states to vote on it. Because what we're seeing is when people vote on the issue, they say, Look, we want to protect this right. And it's not just Democrats, Kasie. It's Republicans, as well.",
