POPPY HARLOW, HOST, \"CNN THIS MORNING\": And here is where we start. FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Straight ahead, Israel unveils a plan for the future of Gaza after the war and without Hamas. This as a delegation of Israeli officials is on its way to France to discuss the release of the hostages and a possible ceasefire. We will be live in Paris and Tel Aviv. And then, the U.S. targets Russia with fresh sanctions over the death of Alexei Navalny. We will have the details. Plus, in the U.S., Nikki Haley and Donald Trump face off in South Carolina, as voters there prepared to cast their ballots in the Republican primary tomorrow. Israel's Prime Minister is unveiling a \"day after\" plan for Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu presented the plan to members of Israel's security cabinet Thursday night. Under the proposal, Israel would maintain security control over the entire area west of Jordan, which includes Gaza as well as the West Bank. Meanwhile, negotiators are expected to meet today in Paris for the next round of discussions on a hostage deal and a potential ceasefire. There is a growing sense of urgency to find agreement after Israel threatened to expand its assault in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah if hostages are not released by the start of Ramadan in two weeks. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Paris with more on the negotiations. But, let's begin with the plan for postwar Gaza. Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what do you now?",

In fact, they came about really very much at the last minute, because Fredricka, they depended on so many different factors coming into play and falling into place that they might even go ahead. So, as you mentioned, Bill Burns, the CIA Director, is here. We're expecting over the coming hours once the Israeli delegation arrives for the director of Mossad, but also the heads of intelligence of Egypt, of Qatar, to begin these series of meetings as to the fate of the 132 hostages that remain inside Gaza.Now, why Paris, because the French had been instrumental working with the main group that represents the families of the hostages in getting some of the much needed medication to 45 of the chronically ill hostages, and it was on Wednesday, late Wednesday, that Israelis received the confirmation that that medication had been received by the hostages who so desperately needed it. Meanwhile, we know that the political head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, had been in Cairo for talks there. It took positive word coming from Cairo. It took messages that the medication had arrived coming from inside Gaza for the Israeli government, and specifically the Israeli cabinet to be able to decide overnight that it would send this delegation to Paris. I think what is encouraging about this latest, newest round of talks between all of those many parties, Fredricka, is that this time the Israeli delegation have been empowered with the ability to negotiate. So, they're not just there, as they have been in the past in Cairo, for instance, last week to listen to what proposals are made. They've been empowered by the Israeli cabinet overnight to come here to Paris with negotiating powers. So, that does lead to some hope that there may be a positive outcome at last. Certainly, we expect that these talks could last for the next few days. And for now, as I say, the French been very tight lipped about what may come out to them. There is already a great deal of thankfulness that they're going ahead at all. Fredricka.",

The Biden administration is set to impose a major new round of sanctions against Russia today. It's in response to two years of war in Ukraine and the mysterious death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. U.S. officials say the sanctions are aimed at 500 people and entities. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the U.S. President met with Navalny's widow and daughter in California and expressed his heartfelt condolences. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining me right now live from the White House, Priscilla.

The other side of that is that Western governments say that sanctions take time to take effect, and also that this actually has hampered Russia's economy. So, this latest slate of sanctions, again, a pretty massive package on over 500 targets, is intended to slow things down even more for Russia, or in other words, choke them off from certain goods, therefore making it more difficult for them to access certain goods but also to build weapons, which is the key here.But, again, it comes back down to, this is just one tool in the toolbox. They're confident about it, U.S. officials that is, but they are still maintain that they need to get more funding to Ukraine because Russia, while they have been facing a number of sanctions since the war in Ukraine, is still undeterred and moving forward there. So, it's an entire package of things that the White House says is necessary here. This is just one they have direct control on.",

And today in the south, Kyiv says three people were killed in Odessa after drone debris fell on a building and caused a fire. At least eight others were injured in a separate drone strike in Ukraine.

Essentially, we're hearing from the Ukrainians is they shot down most of the drones that the Russians launched towards the Ukrainian territory. However, there were also some missile strikes as well. And it really goes to show some of the issues that the Ukrainians are having not just on the front lines, but also trying to keep their towns and their critical infrastructure safe as well.Some of the missiles that were used are called the X-22. Now, that's a missile with an extremely large warhead that's usually used to destroy aircraft carriers. And the Ukrainians simply so far have found no way to shoot that down, except possibly with those Patriot missile systems. And that's, of course, where we get back to the fact that the Ukrainians are still waiting for the U.S. to OK that further military aid to Ukraine, and that still is very much in the balance. You can see how that's hurting them on the battlefield already, especially in those areas in the frontlines that the Russians have now managed to capture back. And the Ukrainians believe that if they don't get further military aid, they're going to have a very difficult time on the battlefield going forward, Fredricka.",

And what investigators are looking at is both the conditions of that day. It was extremely windy, just like it was today, and that probably helped the fire to spread. But also, the fact that there was this aluminum cladding on the side of the building that may have had some sort of flammable material beneath it to keep it sticking to the brick.And in fact, all around here and you can probably hear sometimes when the wind blows, the sound of tinkling, that's this. This is the aluminum cladding that burnt right off that building. It's all over here, spread around as debris. You can still smell the sort of (inaudible) smell of the smoke as well. Investigators will be looking at that. In the meantime, well, firefighters are still -- have only just recently been able to get access to the building and actually look for more victims. What they were able to tell earlier today is that there were four bodies they identified only with -- through a drone that would came over through the military emergency service was used.

So, it's kind of funny to see how much has changed over these past 14 years since she first got into the governor's office, because now she is painted as a moderate, some even say a Democrat if you talk to Trump supporters. But, that can be further from the truth. I mean, you just heard her come out and support this IVF ruling in Alabama. So, kind of reiterating who Nikki Haley is when it comes to her Republican chops. But, yeah, when she was governor, she didn't really take much fromanybody, Democrats or Republicans. She would go hard against Republicans just as hard as Democrats until she got her way on certain things. She used that bully pulpit to her advantage. But, at the same time, she also united the state through tragedies, through hurricanes, the mother manual shooting. It was a very difficult time in our state in 2015. And she navigated that very, very handily. So, there is some give and take there. But again, of course, as we've seen with the political establishment here in South Carolina, they are all backing Donald Trump. They support Donald Trump, from our governor, lieutenant governor, Senator Tim Scott, Senator Lindsey Graham and the like. So, she is using that to her advantage, saying I'm not part of that system. I broke that system when I first became governor, and I don't need it now.",

And should Joe Biden win the White House again, like Democrats have won all these races in the past big election cycles, then is this an I told you so moment, or you should have gone with me moment? She just felt that immediately, saying this is not about the future. This is about right now.But, again, at the same time, it does really set her up for a future run. I don't see her being a part of this administration. She has made it pretty clear. She doesn't want to be VP. We hear Tim Scott is running for the beefsteaks at this point.
