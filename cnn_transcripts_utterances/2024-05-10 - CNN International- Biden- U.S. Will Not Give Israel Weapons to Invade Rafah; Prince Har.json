It happened after two officers from Ukraine's state guard service were detained for reportedly working to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Ukraine has reportedly raised the bar in its drone strikes on Russia. A Ukrainian defense source tells CNN that one drone struck a refinery in southwestern Russia, about 1,500 kilometers away. That's reportedly the longest distance for Ukraine's UAVs. The refinery is one of Russia's largest, but regional officials say it's still operating despite that attack. And back in Ukraine, Western intelligence believes Russia sees a window of opportunity and will ramp up its attacks ahead of the arrival of more U.S. military aid. Officials say Russian troops will likely try to make more progress and consolidate recent gains on the front lines. The U.S. aid was approved last month, but it'll take time before enough of it is delivered there. Russia's marked the most important day of its political calendar, the anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany. Thursday's Victory Day celebrations ended with fireworks, even though the events were scaled back this year. But as Clare Sebastian reports, President Vladimir Putin did not dial down his verbal assault against Ukraine's allies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amid unseasonal snow flurries, Russian President Vladimir Putin using this moment to turn up the heat in his war of words with the West, accusing it of distorting history. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Revanchism, mockery of history and the desire to justify the current followers of the Nazis are part of the general policy of Western elites to foment new regional conflicts. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Putin's third Victory Day since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, another opportunity for his own brand of factual distortion. Painting the war in Ukraine as the sequel to Russia's role in defeating Nazi Germany, portraying the West as the aggressor, justifying unimaginable losses under the banner of patriotism. PUTIN (through translator): Russia is going through a difficult period. The fate of our motherland depends on every one of us. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Soldiers fresh from the front lines in Russia's so-called special military operation, also treading the damp cobbles of Red Square. And yet this year, victory seems more attainable. Russia now has the advantage on Ukraine's front lines. Gains on the Eastern Front in recent months, their biggest in more than a year and a half. Moscow confident enough to show off a selection of battlefield trophies. European and American tanks and armored vehicles, part of a month-long exhibition at Moscow's Victory Park. At home, Putin now two days into his fifth term, is more powerful than ever. And he wants the world to know it. PUTIN (through translator): Russia will do everything to avoid a global confrontation. But at the same time, we will not let anyone threaten us. Our strategic forces are always combat ready. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): It was a measured nuclear threat. As ballistic missiles rolled across Red Square, Putin casually coordinated plans for upcoming non-strategic nuclear exercises with close allied Belarus. Both leaders emphasizing this is just routine training. While Western leaders no longer join Russia in marking this shared victory, Putin knows they are watching. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.
