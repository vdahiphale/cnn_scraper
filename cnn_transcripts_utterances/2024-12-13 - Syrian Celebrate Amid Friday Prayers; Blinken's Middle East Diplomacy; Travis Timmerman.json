Secretary of State Antony Blinken embarking on a new diplomatic push in the Middle East as Iraq stresses the need for regional and international efforts. And bitter backlash. A healthcare CEO's murder prompts anger over the nine insurance claims. Plus, keeping calm and carrying on. The CEO of the meditation and mindfulness app Calm talks to us about how to destress during one of the most stressful times of the year. That conversation is ahead. But first, we begin in Syria, where the country is now set to plan its future. Today, saw an important first for this war-ravaged country for the very first time since the Assad government was overthrown last weekend, thousands gathered for Friday prayers. Now, there is, of course, much work to be done during this political transition, and rebel leader Mohammed al-Jolani is urging people to use caution and to avoid celebrating with gunfire.

He started the day in Turkey to underline again, the need for a transition to an inclusive Syrian-led government. He underlines four key aspects that the U.S. expects from that government, including ensuring that Syria did not become a safe haven for terrorism. He carried that message on with him as we traveled to Baghdad later that day as he sat down in that critical meeting with Prime Minister Sudani. He urged Sudani to crack down on those Iranian-backed militias and to work together with the United States to ensure that they continue to fight in that effort against ISIS. And then, he continued back to Aqaba, Jordan, where he started his trip just 24 hours or so ago. And tomorrow, we expect to see leaders from across the Arab world convening on how to coordinate best for the next step in Syria, how to approach a transition to a Syrian government. That includes those key principles. Now, Erica, Blinken has said there is consensus in all of the meetings he's had in all of the phone calls you've had since that sudden collapse of the Assad regime that there needs to be a coordinated approach here to ensure that no one is taking advantage of a vacuum, a lack of an established power structure in Syria. They also want to ensure that people, minorities, women are protected and that the chemical weapons that Assad was known for using on his own people are responsibly destroyed. So, there is a lot on the table here for these conversations that we have seen thus far in Blinken's trips and as these key leaders will be meeting in Jordan tomorrow, Erica.",

Now, we used some human intelligence and sorted that Celsius to Fahrenheit and kind of figured some things out and knew it was going to be a 55-degree low. But then supercomputers took over and everything changed. It wasn't just digits. It wasn't just numbers. Now, we could make graphics. Now, we could take all of this data and push it forward, five, seven days, make it so much better. But this was still human intelligence. Now, we have artificial intelligence. This is what our model looks like right now. This is how good we've come from just numbers to this. But can artificial intelligence make this even better, make it more accurate? And the answer so far is yes. The Google GenCast looks like out to 15 days, it will help our old models do even better. In fact, outforecast them in many locations. Now, the problem here with this artificial intelligence model is that we're only looking back 40 years and saying, OK, if this happened today, what's going to happen tomorrow? But is the last 40 years really going to be indicative of what the next 40 years really is going to look like? Maybe not.

It's a popular mental health app. You may knowtheir commercials urging you to take a moment and relax. He can now also add author to his credits. His new book, \"Recharge: Boosting Your Mental Battery, One Conversation at a Time,\" is coming out. It's centered on mental health and the importance of better managing stress and anxiety. All proceeds from the book go to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. David Ko joining me now. David, it's great to have you here. I loved that one of the ways you're encouraging us in this book to really check in on those around us, whether it's in the workplace or at home, is not to ask, how are you, but to ask, how's your battery level? This is something we can all relate to. DAVID KO, CEO, CALM AND AUTHOR, \"RECHARGE\": That's right. That's right. And we were just trying to take a really heavy topic and just trying to make it simple for everyone out there. When I've had these conversations with friends and family, when I talk about how are you or how you're doing, you typically get that standard response of, I'm fine, or I'm good. But when you ask people, how's your battery, because they -- people have -- everyone has a phone, they can tell you I'm at 50 percent, 75 percent, 25 percent. So, it's a much easier way to check on yourself and your friends and your family.",

And it didn't take -- it really took until I was in healthcare and much later in life and here at Calm that I understood it was really a stress induced panic attack. And so, I wanted to create something that would just make it a lot more easy and approachable to have a conversation. And so, yes, this book was personal for me. But what I also found it was personal for so many other leaders that are out there today. I went out there and spoke to many leaders in the field and others about their own journeys, and they all had similar things to share.
