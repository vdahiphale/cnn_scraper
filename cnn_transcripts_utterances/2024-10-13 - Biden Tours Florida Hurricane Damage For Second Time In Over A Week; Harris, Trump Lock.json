I'm Omar Jimenez in for Fredricka Whitfield.A lot to get to so we're going to start today with President Joe Biden in storm-battered Florida, where he just got a bird's eye view from Marine One at the extensive damage left by Hurricane Milton. It's the second time in a little over a week that the president has traveled to the state. Today, also announcing more than $600 million for electric grid resilience. 1.5 million Floridians are still without power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Americans who need help, an American who would help you if you were in the same situation? We are one United States, one United States.I also came here to talk about all the progress we have made together. This is a whole-of-government effort from state and local to FEMA, to U.S. Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, the Energy Department, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense -- just to name a few. FEMA has delivered 1.2 million meals, over 300,000 liters of water, 2 million gallons of fuel and so far, we've installed 100 satellite terminals to restore communications in impacted areas so families can contact their loved ones to be sure everything's ok and be able to reach out for help as well. Speaking of help, so far we're up in ten disaster recovery centers in Florida with more to come. So people are going to have one stop to meet with officials, get the federal help they're entitled to that's available to them such as direct immediate financial aid and no interest payment loans, mortgage relief, and so much more. You can also go online to disasterassistance.gov -- disaster assistance.gov. Or call 1-800-621-FEMA -- F E M A. Yesterday after I signed the major disaster declaration, more than 250,000 Floridians registered for help during, 250,000. The most in any single day ever in history of this country -- 250,000. I know you're concerned about the debris removal and its obvious why. We're prioritizing debris removal and working with state and local partners to clear roads, to get wreckage in the two hurricanes off properties and so more folks can return home and businesses (ph) can receive much needed deliveries of food, fuel, medicine, other essentials. Thats a priority for me. Power has also been restored to over 2 million people in a matter of days. And thanks to tens of thousands of power workers from 43 states and Canada working nonstop. Even more people will have more power restored soon. Today I'm proud to announce $612 million to six new cutting-edge projects to support communities impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton. That includes $47 million for Gainesville Regional Utilities and another $47 million for Florida Power and Light. This funding will not only restore power, but will make the region's power system stronger and more capable and reduce the frequency and duration of power outages while extreme weather events become more frequent.

Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who's a Republican from Florida and Senator Rick Scott also were traveling around this area with the president touring today. So the president really wanting to kind of strike a bipartisan tone as he visited the damage here. He made the remark that the storm's impact was not as cataclysmic as they predicted, but he said that for some people, it was cataclysmic. He acknowledged that some residents here were heartbroken and exhausted. He relayed a personal story of how one of his homes was damaged in a very major storm and kind of reiterated the personal losses that people are feeling. So he really did want to strike that kind of evenhanded tone, that human tone, connecting with the residents here, but also kind of sending the message that this response is really bipartisan in nature.

And as we enter the homestretch, polls continue to show the presidential race neck and neck. CNN's national poll of polls out today shows no clear leader with 50 percent of likely voters supporting Harris and 47 percent for Trump. But again, no clear leader and that is in trend with what we've seen for a good portion of when it's been these two in the race. Both candidates are hitting battleground states this week. And in the next couple of hours, Trump will hold a rally in the swing state of Arizona. Right now, Harris continues to campaign in storm-battered North Carolina where she just spoke at a church. And she's going to hold a rally in that critical state later this afternoon. Tomorrow Harris her running mate, Tim Walz, will begin a week-long campaign blitz of blue wall states, where voters there could decide the next president. States on your screen there -- Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. And then of course we know her schedule in North Carolina as well. As I mentioned, it has shown these two in a deadlocked race at this point over the course of this, which again has been the trend as we've been polling throughout this race, you see some of the numbers there. We have a team of correspondents that has been covering every aspect of this out on the campaign trail. You hear the roar of the crowd and it seems like Alayna's live shot there.

So even if he's not in a battleground state, the messaging is being broadcast to the states that matter. But I do want to, you know, talk and dive into more of what he was saying at these different events because what I've noticed is, you know, I go to multiple rallies a week, Omar and I've really noticed in recent weeks, Donald Trump has been escalating his anti-immigrant dark rhetoric. We heard him do that in both Aurora on Friday, but also Coachella yesterday. I want you to take a listen to what he said in California.

They're also paying very close attention to the polls. Of course, they recognize just as we are analyzing these, they recognize that this is going to be a very tight election. But they do think again that this rhetoric could help on the margins. So Donald Trump is very much leaning-in to this, leaning-in to the dark anti-immigrant language that we know he's used in the past.

Some of them seriously injured in that -- in that number of 25 along the northern border.But what the United States is doing here is providing a weapons defense system, not for direct confrontation with Hezbollah on the northern border of Israel but a defensive system. We don't know where it'd be positioned, but we do know that Hezbollah has been firing ballistic missiles into Israel. And when Iran fired its attack into Israel. That was about more than 180 ballistic missiles.

The Israelis are basically telling the U.N. peacekeepers, you have to get out of this area.

We will find out after election day. But if you are the vice president and her campaign, you're clearly not going to take any of that for granted. And I just think between now and the next three weeks, we're going to see both Vice President Harris and former President Trump in every battleground state talking to every group. Of course, this weekend, we have seen her in North Carolina, which where she's messaging to group. She's messaging to storm affected people, but she's also messaging to African-American voters and to Black male voters, really in particular. So, she's doing that in North Carolina, which could be a really important swing state. The margin looks very close there. The governors race, there has probably working in her favor. If she could take back North Carolina, that would be huge. But in Michigan, which is part of the three states that make up that blue wall. It is a very close race. And if she does not have enough support compared to historic turnout from black male voters, even if these are not voters who turn out for Donald Trump, they may just be voters who stay home without those votes. She may not get where she needs to be. So we are already seeing and are going to continue to see a really big push in the closing days.",

And so, I think these turnout efforts are message different ways, whether it's Trump or Harris and they are targeting different groups.But if you are Trump and you are trying to reach suburban women whose school policies and maybe social policies lean center right, but they support abortion rights, right, you are trying to get them to care more about inflation or their memories of what their money was like, you know, 5, 6 years ago pre-COVID when more about fear around the border and to try to put your desires for bodily autonomy or reproductive rights in kind of a second tier bucket, right? So I think all of these things are we are going to matter if these races are as close as the polling suggests that they are.",

Now, look, you posted about these threats on social media. I want to bring up one of your tweets. You were responding to a threat you received, claiming meteorologist created the hurricanes and calling for others to, quote, stop the breathing of those that made them and their affiliates. You tweeted back: Murdering meteorologist won't stop hurricanes. I can't believe I just had to type this.
