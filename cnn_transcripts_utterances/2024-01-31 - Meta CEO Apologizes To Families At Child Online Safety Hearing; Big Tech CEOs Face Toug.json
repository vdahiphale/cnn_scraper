Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida and Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. They wrote a bipartisan letter to President Biden demanding that he implement more sanctions on Iran, specifically targeting its oil trade, which the congressman say provides, quote, \"A crucial lifeline to sustain and expand Tehran's sponsorship of terrorist groups,\" unquote.Congressman Lawler, let me start with you. Today, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctions three foreign entities and one individual that provide critical financial support to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, as well as the Hezbollah financial network. You two say you want the administration to deliver a hammer blow to these Iranian backed proxies. Congressman Lawler, does this move go far enough? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, it's certainly a good step, Jake, but Jared and I introduced the SHIP Act last year and passed it through the House in the aftermath of the October 7 terrorist attack. And what it would do is implement secondary sanctions on the purchase of Iranian petroleum. The illicit Iranian petroleum sales. The oil trade is what is fueling the funding of terrorism in the Middle East right now. Iran is the greatest state sponsor of terror. They use the proceeds from this oil trade to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and others, including the terrorist attack that took the lives of three service members this past weekend. We need to act. The Senate needs to pass this legislation. The White House needs to sign it, because if we are to stop and combat the terrorism that is occurring, we need to start with the funding source, and that is the illicit oil trade with Iranian petroleum.",

JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, look, obviously my heart goes out to the families of our brave U.S. soldiers who lost their lives and the families of those that are injured. I mean, there's a score of injured serviced men and women over at that base. Listen, I think diplomacy is important. I think diplomatic actions are important. I think we should be denying the Iranian regime access to the U.N. We should be denying their visas. That's a diplomatic action. And I think sanctions are important. I think what Representative Lawler and I are working on is more economic sanctions and there's a lot more we can do economically, but it's not enough. I do think there needs to be a hammer blow to the proxies. I agree with John Kirby that it should be at a point of our choosing. I also believe it should be sustained. It shouldn't be one sort of target that we take out. It should be a multitude of targets. And we should be eliminating the proxy's capabilities. In fact, it should be such a blow to the proxies that we don't have to deal with them anymore because they have no capabilities. And Iran should see what it looks like to continue to mess with the United States. They've not seen that in a while. We might need to remind people the capabilities of the United States and we should do that with the proxies. We shouldn't strike Iran proper. I don't think we are there. That would be playing into the hands of China and Russia, by the way, who would love for us to get bogged down again in the Middle East and turn our attention away from Ukraine and Taiwan.

Secure the border, stop this massive influx of not only migrants, but human trafficking, drug trafficking. You know, in 2022, 70,000 Americans lost their lives to fentanyl overdose. Much of the fentanyl coming across our southern border. We have to secure the border. What the speaker is saying and the point he is making is, yes, it's never been zero, but we have to enforce our laws. This administration has failed miserably in its responsibility to secure the border. Since Joe Biden took office, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed our southern border, many of them illegally, 90 percent of them are released into our country. Catch and release must stop as the official policy of this administration. Remain in Mexico should be reinstated. So, there is a lot of work ahead. I am curious to see if the Senate can actually pass a deal. House Republicans passed H.R. 2 back in May of last year. We went through a long process. We negotiated that bill in our House. The Senate has yet to actually produce a product. Yes, they are negotiating, yes, they are working through it, but let's see them actually pass a bill and then negotiate with the House. That is how this works. It is not just the House accepts what the Senate does. We have to negotiate, we should negotiate and we should get a final bill to secure our border.",

And that would, I'd assume, include Honolulu and Indo-PACOM.But there's a second, I think, more kind of insidious and more concerning aspect, and that's a more ad hoc, almost opportunistic and random sort of campaign that's targeting U.S infrastructure. I think that's what Director Wray was going after. That's what Director Easterly, my successor at CISA, was going after. And they're basically scouring the Internet for Internet connected devices that have not been patched, that are vulnerable to Chinese hackers who are quite good, and they have compromised those systems, and they are in position and just waiting, effectively, to pull the trigger.

But over the last few days, they now see an opportunity to go on the offensive on border security.And sources I've talked to say that the reason for that is because the messaging here is quite simple. They can pin the blame on Republicans for not wanting to move forward with a tough deal. As one strategist told me, quote, \"They chickened out.\" Now, generally, Democrats have framed immigration on the campaign trail as wanting to move forward with immigration reform but not having the opportunity because Republicans got in the way. This time, though, they can go a step further by saying that they wanted reform and they wanted tough reform and Republicans still got in the way. [17:30:10] Notably, Jake, this deal that we know of so far doesn't include legalization for undocumented immigrants. That has been a top ask for Democrats for years. And by that being excluded and by these new authorities being added, it essentially puts Democrats in a position where they can take advantage of what has historically been a political liability. Now, over the weekend, President Biden cited border security when talking to South Carolina Democrats, saying that if given the opportunity, he would shut down the border and do it quickly.

Nia-Malika Henderson, you have a new column out in Bloomberg today. It says, quote, Biden sounds like Trump on the border. It's good politics, unquote. Explain, what do you mean it's good politics?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, listen, Bloomberg's got a poll out today that looks at this issue and shows that six in 10 voters in swing states blame Biden for this issue. Place some blame with him, fewer, far fewer blame Republicans and Donald Trump. So you have in Joe Biden somebody who is taking up the mantle of really sounding like a hawk on immigration. This is entirely new for Democrats in so many ways, who usually tied border security to some sort of pathway to legalization, but that obviously is not happening. He has really got to get his arms around this. Because what it also shows is that voters who are over 65 and we know how crucial those voters are in a place like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, those swing states, they see immigration, the problem of immigration as tied with the economy as the most important issue heading into November. So, you know, I think he has something of an opportunity here to use the bully pulpit, maybe give some sort of big speech about his vision for immigration, what he wants to do. It sounds like that's something that the White House is going to do, but I think they've got a really hard row to hoe on this because of the influx of migrants and all of these blue states that hadn't seen this in years past.

And so I think what Democrats are going to be doing is saying exactly what Nia-Malika was saying, is that we want to solve it, but the Republicans are preventing us to get to a solution.I also think, though, that these policies are coming to the front doors of cities that have typically not been having larger populations of migrants crossing the border because of the tactics that Abbot and the DeSantis do, busing them to the community. But there's also another component to this, is that we know immigrants are important to our economy. They do pay into Social Security. And so there is a balance that the Biden campaign is going to have to play where the coalition is fragile because you don't want to go too far to the center when isolating your progressive base, but you also want a solution to the issue that everyone in the country knows is a problem right now.",
