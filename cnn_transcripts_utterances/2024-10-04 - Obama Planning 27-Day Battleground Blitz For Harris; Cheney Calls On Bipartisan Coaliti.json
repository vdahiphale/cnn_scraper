It involves swing states, superstar names and burying big grudges.Plus, the world watches anxiously to see how or if Israel will fire back at Iran. As leaders around the world worry that one provocation too many will propel an all-out war. And a last month power drive. A screen door slams on any question over who Bruce Springsteen will back in 2024, as the boss tries to appeal to his fans, especially working- class men to vote for Kamala Harris. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. Up first, the map and the calendar. To borrow from New Jersey's greatest poet, the candidates plan to spend the 32 days out in the streets, looking for every last vote. Today, Donald Trump is in Georgia and North Carolina, while Kamala Harris holds two events in Michigan. Tomorrow it's Harris, who will be in North Carolina, while Trump goes back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated three months ago. And then next week, as the countdown clock to election day ticks to under a month, both candidates call up big names behind their bids for the White House. We start our coverage in Flint, Michigan with CNN's Eva McKend. Eva?",

And we have seen this to great effect in several last election cycles where Obama is sort of called in in the final hour in order to thwart democratic complacency.And we expect to hear from him a similar message that we have heard from the Obamas at the DNC. We heard Michelle Obama notably tell Democrats, essentially, listen, don't get in your feelings here. If you don't hear directly from the campaign between now and election day, this election is too urgent to stay home. You have to get out and vote. But they're not only deploying the Obamas in these battleground states. We are also going to see Republicans deployed as well. Republicans for Harris, a key to the campaign strategy. We're going to see Liz Cheney and then former officials from the Trump administration make the case as well. They're just trying to appeal to every constituency, every part of the electorate, ahead of election day. We know that the vice president is going to meet with Arab American voters today here in Michigan, before this big rally, this evening in Flint. Dana, this line already around the block here. We're seeing a lot of momentum enthusiasm on the ground. I don't know if that necessarily is going to translate to votes. The campaign is certainly hoping as such. Dana?",

I mean, it is noteworthy that a Cheney or Cheney is, are not just endorsing, but out on the stump for a Democrat. But is it really going to move the dial?ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I mean, the thing about -- look, you do have a conservative Republican in Liz Cheney, now coming out for the vice president at a time when the Trump campaign is still trying to portray the vice president as to the far left, right? Cheney also represents a republican party that's not as visible today. You know, the Republican party today is more aligned with MAGA and Trumpism. But at the same time, what this does do is her endorsement also brings January 6 back into the spotlight at a time when the Harris campaign actually hasn't made January 6 a focus of their messaging as much as the Biden campaign did. You know, the Biden campaign was talking about an existential threat to democracy and often trying to remind folks about January 6, and the storming of the Capitol. Harris has more so tailored her messaging to trying to lower costs and sort of kitchen table issues. Now with this endorsement, you don't actually need her to talk about January 6 all the time.",

And quotes, according to Mike Pence, of the involvement of Donald Trump in trying to overturn the election.AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Yeah. The first to the Liz Cheney piece. I think there's this conversation we hear a lot in politics called a permission structure, right, allowing people who feel sort of uneasy voting for one ticket because they never have before, and giving them a way out, you know, to say to conservatives or somebody who voted Republican consistently. Look, it wasn't your fault that you voted for Donald Trump. You thought he was going to do good things, even Liz Cheney is now voting against him. You weren't right. You were duped, rather than you made a poor decision. But I do think this is the sort of challenge for the Harris campaign. They have a dual track here. One is, winning over those people like Liz Cheney would appeal to. But the real swing voters -- and we're seeing this in our polling and we're seeing it in other data out there are the voters who are saying, I feel really pinched economically. I feel really stressed about inflation. So, I need people who are going to be able to address cost of living things. The kitchen table issues are my main issue. January 6, yes, it was terrible, but that is not what I'm voting on. I'm voting on my pocketbook, and so being able to -- and you hear her in her ads, almost all of them are about kitchen tables.",

That is way higher than the forecast, which is 140,000 jobs. So, it's more good news on the ledger, sort of with the data. You mentioned that you guys have done some polling.

I think this is the single most important development that's happening right now, and much more so than the top line because you've seen it in other polling across the country. Trump's advantage on the economy, which largely means inflation is shrinking. And part of that's like the jobs report, part of it is, you know, cutting interest rates and inflation actually sinking.But I think part of it is Trump has been just all over the lot in his message. He has not been able to bring home the message on the economy or on the border and down the ballot, Republican candidates are similarly all over the lot. I mean, they've been outspent to a large extent by Democrats and by the Harris campaign, all scattershot. So, I think he squandered his advantage just as much as he's lost it on the economic data.",

Then let's look at where Donald Trump and his campaign they are focusing. They are focusing on Pennsylvania as well, but then they've got almost as much North Carolina, Georgia. KANNO-YOUNGS: I mean, it's fascinating, right? I mean, it shows the focus that the Harris campaign and really Democrats in general, just have on those three crucial states, right, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. It's also why the White House was panicking about a certain longshoreman strike this week, because of the potential that had to alienate union support in states across the country, including those three pivotal states. For the Trump campaign, you're seeing them invest in the Sunbelt, where housing prices have really been an issue for the past couple years, which is obviously a vulnerability to incumbency. But also, I think North Carolina is fascinating. This has been something that Democrats have sort of had increasing enthusiasm about for --",

Does that surprise you?KANNO-YOUNGS: It does to an extent, especially when you consider the controversy around the lieutenant governor and the potential for maybe. Does that then impact turnout for the former president as well. And just how much Democrats have talked over the past couple years about how they may have a chance in North Carolina.

Now and to be clear, there are concerns in the White House that we may be getting closer to witnessing that with the actions today.

But I think Trump did everybody a favor by saying, hey, why not, they should go after the nukes, because that is what the choice is right now.And I mean, you see the Biden administration calling for strength, probably would be calling for more restraint if it weren't 30 days before the election. And Bibi is one of the world's greatest cynics, and that has a lot to do with why he escalated in Lebanon right now.
