There it is, a little -- little cloudy there this morning, as those jurors start to wake up, had into their second day of deliberations.Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. The jury in the Trump hush money trial back to work this morning after meeting for more than four-and-a-half hours yesterday. The jurors are requesting four pieces of testimony that they want to review. They want Michael Cohen and \"National Enquirer\" chief David Pecker's descriptions of an August 2015 Trump Tower meeting. Pecker's phone call with Trump in June 2016 about former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal and Pecker's testimony about not finalizing Trump's payment to the \"National Enquirer's\" parent company for McDougal's life rights. Jurors also want to re-hear a portion of Judge Merchan's instructions. Yesterday, Trump outside the courthouse trying to set expectations, shall we say, ahead of the looming decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Listening to the charges from the judge who's, as you know, very conflicted and, corrupt because of the confliction, very, very corrupt. Mother Teresa could not beat these discharges. These charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged. It's a disgrace, and I mean that Mother Teresa could not beat these charges, but we'll see. We'll see how we do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're going to cover this, but it's these four things. And as I look at them, the Trump Tower meeting and that's Cohen and Pecker's testimony, Pecker's call with Trump and then Pecker's testimony on not finalizing that deal, the thread that ties all these things together is Donald Trump's involvement and knowledge, right? It seems like trying to figure out, did he know? Was he aware of all of these things is a central question in this case. What do you see as you consider what they're looking at here?",

Maybe that helps the defense, some of these other signals might indicate the jury is looking for a way to pull the strands of a conviction together.So, Julia, lets talk about whether or not this is going to matter in terms of the election in November. Some recent polling from Marquette University did seem to show that there would be potentially a small impact. Now, that may be all that matters in a very close election. If Trump is found guilty in the New York case, likely voters said 46 percent of them would vote for Joe Biden, 41 percent for Donald Trump. Now, let's note that is 11 percent protest vote in there. So that's a big chunk of voters in a situation that's so close. However, if Trump is found not guilty, you see that switch and its suddenly Donald Trump who has 46 percent and Joe Biden who has 43 percent. I think I remain skeptical than anything matters in politics anymore. But what is your reporting around how each side is thinking about it?",

And I think still when you look at voters priorities, it is not this trial. I mean, although were all watching this trial, we're all aware of it, I don't think this is impacting the Americans every day lives, and that's why you've seen the Biden campaign in the administration, be very careful about how they approach this. Yes, they had the press conference with Robert De Niro outside if the courtroom a few days ago, but Biden the other de as he was leaving the White House, did not take questions on this. That's not a coincidence. He wants to be focusing on the economy even though that's a tough issue for him, we still hear him messaging more on that issue than something a court case involving Donald Trump in New York.",

So they're sending their own trash back. But it has caused some concerns. You can see where these things are landing.

The officer involved is being disciplined, but Scheffler says he hopes that both he and the officer can put the incident behind them. All right.

There's a warning there just to the east of Albuquerque this morning or we could find some large hail and damaging winds. Here's a look at that risk for today, stretches all the way up from Iowa and Nebraska, down into Texas. This yellow and orange area here is where we are most concerned about that large hail, damaging winds and then maybe a tornado or two. Now, we have that level three and a five enhanced risk, right over Lubbock, Lubbock because we've got the chance for some hail over two inches in diameter, that would be bigger than the size of golf balls. So we'll have to watch out for super cells that are capable of doing that. Now, Texas under the gun again for severe weather threat while they still have nearly 200,000 people without power from the severe winds that blew through a few days ago. So we can see the storms here as they've fire up, as we go into the afternoon, the super sounds that firearm in Oklahoma could become a damaging wind thread for Dallas as we go later on into the day today. Then additional super cells develop over parts of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. This is where those discrete cells, that's where we can get those golf ball size hailstones, then that becomes a damaging wind threat for Dallas again, looks like you can have two rounds of storms and then the damaging wind throughout makes it to Houston by the morning. So as we go into tomorrow, we have that damaging winds are from Dallas to Austin and Houston, large hail, damaging winds possible again -- Kasie.",

Their focus seems to be a 2015 Trump Tower meeting where both men met with Mr. Trump. In his testimony Pecker said, quote, there was a discussion about that. I was going to be able to be the eyes and ears of the campaign. And there was a discussion that I would be notifying Michael Cohen of any women that were in the process of are going to be selling stories and I would notify Cohen that they would be available and that they would either have to buy them or take them off the market, or kill them in some manner.
