And violent assaults on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam, Dutch authorities are calling it an antisemitic attack. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. The futures are well, they are looking for direction today, perhaps a little lower than they had been in recent days. We've had that Fed decision, the direction for rates going forward a little unclear at this point. So perhaps investors taking a bit of a pause after what was a record session on Wednesday in the wake of the victory of Donald Trump, of course. He is looking at his cabinet. Sources say it does appear that that is starting to take shape, at least with his first key selection. The president-elect, choosing Susie Wiles, who ran his campaign as White House Chief of Staff. Going forward, she will be the first woman to ever hold that position. A source telling CNN, one of her conditions for accepting the job was getting more control over who can reach the president at the Oval Office. Trump praised Wiles during his election night victory speech. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT: Susie and Chris, the job you did. Susie come Susie come here, Susie. Susie likes to stay sort of in the bag.

Our CNN has learned that Trump loyalists have descended on hisMar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where intense discussions are underway over who he should choose? Who is in the running? Well, I'm joined by Bryan Lanza, Senior Adviser on Trump's 2024 campaign. He was also communications director for the 2016 presidential transition team. So just to begin with, Bryan, and it's good to have you. How different are things this time, as compared to eight years ago and the first administration or first transition back in 2016? How would you describe the differences? BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER OF TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: First of all, good afternoon. Thank you for having me. Listen, I think the difference is, is the broad spectrum of resumes, of people applying to work in government, is far different than it was in 2016 we're seeing at least in the Republican side. We're seeing record number of applicants who are African, Americans, who are Latinos. We're seeing a tremendous amount of interest from Silicon Valley, which I suspect that's a direct result of Elon Musk's involvement in the campaign. Listen, it was a broad coalition of certainly much broader than what we had in 2016. And so, the resumes, the people who want to work in this government, the people who want to restore America shine, that is much broader itself. It's truly amazing. I mean, the number of women who have applied in the last 24 hours after President Trump has announced Susie Wiles as the Chief of Staff, is breathtaking. I think people are seeing that this is going to be very diverse cabinet, a very diverse administration, and they're eager they engage, and we're eager to bring the best and brightest forward.",

This country is very hungry for change, and they feel President Trump brings that change. As for the loyalty test. The loyalty test is always America First. And I think that's what president -- that's what's always gotten lost in these things. President Trump wants the priorities of the American people first, not the priorities of corporations, not the core priorities of special interests, and certainly not the priorities of Washington D.C. It's going to be the priorities of the American people that are going to be implemented. And so, for his loyalty and his loyalty test, I always think it gets lost, but his loyalty test is to the American people.

Now the reality is Israel and Hamas are at war. It's a war that Israel didn't want, but it's a war that Hamas is engaged in. You know, Hamas knows what they need to do to end this conflict. We will support President Netanyahu, and we will support Israel in ending this conflict, but we will have maximum support to bringing those hostages' home. We cannot have American hostages taken abroad, everywhere and nothing be done, because that's going to result in more hostages being taken. So, it's pretty clear what our priorities are.

And you could see, reallyovernight, once again, with that massive Russian attack also taking place using drones and missiles that obviously, this war is still very much going on. Of course, the Ukrainians right now on the backfoot, on their Eastern Front in the Donbas region as well. But I think what Vladimir Putin was saying yesterday is that he doesn't necessarily take Donald Trump's comments at face value, thinking that this war really can be ended very quickly. In fact, Vladimir Putin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that he doesn't believe a fast end to the war is something that's realistic, but I think that he sees the fact that Donald Trump is thinking about this, is telegraphing all this to the world as well, that he wants this war to end as sort of something like a starting point. It was quite interesting because I watched Vladimir Putin's entire speech and the question that he had afterwards, and this was really only a small part of it, where he also, as you mentioned, talked about what he believed was a New World Order. But when he spoke about Donald Trump, he called him a courageous man. He congratulated him on winning the presidency. Dmitry Peskov later saying his spokesman saying that that was an official congratulation. But he also said that he believed, at the very least, that he could speak to Donald Trump. I think one of the interesting things, though, about all that is that Vladimir Putin said that if Donald Trump calls him and says, hey, Vladimir, let's have a chat, that he would be willing to do that. But the Russians also seem to be saying that they are not going to initiate that themselves. So, they are saying they're open to countries coming to them to try and normalize relations, speak about the situation in Ukraine, but it's not something that they are seeking out themselves and making the first move that seemed to be very clear from Vladimir Putin's comments. At the same time, of course, you do have a lot of concern on the part of the Ukrainians. You did have Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, yesterday at a summit in Budapest in Hungary, where he warned European leaders not to get too close to Vladimir Putin. He said there's already been 20 years of some leaders hugging Vladimir Putin, and that has led to nowhere, and that the situation was a lot worse now than it had been in the past. So, I think on the whole, we can sense a good deal of anxiety on the part of the Ukrainians, but also the Russians definitely believing that there could be an in road to not necessarily normalizing relations with the United States, but certainly trying to at least get on better footing than they have been over the past almost three years, Becky.",

Well, at the top of the hour, we saw the futures indicating a mixed open. The bell is just rung on Wall Street just after half past 9 in New York. So, let's see where these markets are opening as we speak. And as indicated, a mix and relatively, quite open, I say relatively given the action we saw in the wake of Donald Trump's victory on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, of course, on Thursday, for what was the second time in two months, the latest cut by a quarter of one point, or 25 basis points comes as the Fed gets ready for that new Trump Administration to pursue its economic agenda. It was Donald Trump who appointed the Fed's current Chair Jerome Powell. They did, though later clash over rate policy. Well Powell said on Thursday that he wouldn't step down, even if Donald Trump were to ask him to. Well, a senior adviser to Trump says the president-elect is likely to allow Powell to finish his term, which runs to May 2026. And more on this, I'm joined by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz, and he joins me now from Cambridge in England. Now it is good to have you, and I would normally start with you know how you would read this, 25 basis point cut and what happens next? But let's not start with that. Let's start with the politics, which politics -- which Jerome Powell has been absolutely indignant. He would say out, of course, you know his position is being politicized to a certain extent. We know certainly how Donald Trump has felt about him over the past couple of years. He said he wouldn't step down, even if Donald Trump were to ask him to. What sort of position does this put the head of the Fed in at this point? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER AT ALLIANZ: He answered as a lawyer, and he is trained as a lawyer. So, he was asked two questions, would he step down? And the answer -- if asked, and the answer was no. And then he was asked, well, what if could the president demote people at the Fed? And his answer was no. And then he said, it's the law. The problem with being such a lawyer on a question like that is that you could provoke the other side. I suspect, looking back, it would have much better for him to do what he did on other questions that had a political angle. How will trump measures impact the economy?

How will the Fed be accommodating as it looks like -- at policy? What it understands to be Donald Trump's economic policy going forward? EL-ERIAN: So first, a fine-tuning point, and that's a really important point, Becky. Economists learned a very important lesson in the 80s and the 90s is you cannot use monetary and fiscal policy to fine tune the economy. You can use it at extremes, when the economy is too hot, when the economy is going to recession, but when you get closer to the middle of the distribution of outcomes, you should not try to fine tune. You should step back and have a consistent steady course. That's not what this Fed is doing. And the reason why they are falling into this trap, a trap that unfortunately, we've learned a lot from in the past, is that they are overly data dependent. So, it is like a pilot in a plane reacting to the turbulence that they just had, not the turbulence that's ahead. So, you tend to amplify volatility, rather than to provide an anchor to the economy and to market. And that matters just to finish the point on --",
