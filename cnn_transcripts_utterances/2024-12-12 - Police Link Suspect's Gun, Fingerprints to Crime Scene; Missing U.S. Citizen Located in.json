The evidence that they could find to tie Mangione, they say, directly to the crime scene here in Manhattan. And it appears, according to them, that they did. So the police commissioner saying that they now know the ballistics ofthe gun that was found on Mangione in Pennsylvania matches the shell casings that were found at the crime scene last week when the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was killed. They also say the fingerprints match of Mangione to the water bottle and the kind bar that was left behind, if you remember from the getaway route of their suspected killer. And this is a big deal. If you also remember about those fingerprints, what we were reporting, they had partial fingerprints, but they didn't -- they ran them in through all the systems and they couldn't find a match. Well, now they say that is a match. They were able to sort of cross-reference that. So that was something they were certainly waiting for. Of course, there's more evidence that investigators have been collecting as they continue to fight this, as the defense continues to fight the extradition of Mangione back to New York. They have all the surveillance video. They have the fake I.D. that Mangione was carrying that police say he used to check into a hostel on the Upper West Side. And then more of his writings in a spiral notebook about, you know, referencing sort of the killing. As far as his defense is concerned, he says he hasn't seen the evidence to make that connection. And he talked about that to Erin Burnett last night. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think it's relevant to -- to what drives him in terms of his ideology, because it could be that this was an act of domestic terrorism. They're trying to affect social change through violence.So they'll be searching through all his social media, all his writings, all his -- you know, they will interview everyone that he's ever known since his childhood to get a good picture, particularly in the last year or so. What, you know, what kind of drove him to this just as more of a case study than as an element of the offense itself. So, you know, all -- the FBI in particular, because they're interstate, you know, they can they've got agents everywhere are digging up all this information and it'll -- it'll become very clear what his motivation was. But I think -- I think we have a general sense of it right now. He was a he was a true believer. He sort of self-radicalized himself during a period in his life where he had been laid off from his job. He was in great pain and he just latched on to this ideology like the Olympic bomber, Eric Rudolph, like the Unabomber. And he felt like this was an act of nobility to go out and kill somebody.",

It is important to us to try to figure it out. It is still a question mark of who they are. We know who they were. They're still on our terrorist list. So we've got to figure out who they are and whether or not it is a good thing for them being in charge. We do know it's a good thing for Assad to be gone, and I think that that's what we can all agree upon in hoping and looking for a better day.But, you know, we've got to take, and I think we're trying to find, if there are any chemical weapons or other kind of weapons there because we do not want them to fall in the hands of anyone at this stage of the game.

And I think it's going to be the United States will be a part of that, but there's other countries, our allies, Turkey is going to be interested in what's taking place in that region. Israel is going to be interested. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the Gulf countries, everybody's interested and hoping and trying to make sure that we have a different type of regime that's there, as well as make sure there's a transition that is peaceful and that can keep the peace and have some structure and create some institutions that will be safe for the individual --from the Syrians. Because the Syrians have been crying to be free from the Assad regime for years, for decades already.
