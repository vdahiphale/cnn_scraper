Those city workers that are upset that they have to be out in the heat of the day. You know, authorities are saying to the tourists, to the locals, get inside during the heat of the day. But yet garbage collectors, bus drivers, which, you know, not all Roman buses are air conditioned by any means. Those people are now starting to complain. And so, we've an emergency meeting by the labor ministry today, to try to figure out a protocol for those people who have to work outside. So these problems, you know, generally kind of pile up on top of each other. We're not expecting it to cool down anytime soon, but, you know, the record-breaking heat seems to be over during this particular heatwave.
