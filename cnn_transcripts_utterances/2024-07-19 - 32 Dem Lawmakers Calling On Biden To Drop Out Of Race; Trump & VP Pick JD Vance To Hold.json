There are now 32 Democratic lawmakers publicly calling for President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. The growing list today includes a few high-profile figures on Capitol Hill, including Senator Martin Heinrich and former January 6 Committee member Zoe Lofgren, and who wrote a letter to Biden saying, quote, pretty directly, As I'm aware, that you have been provided data indicating that you and all likelihood will lose the race for president. I will not go through it again. Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot. Well, today, a source tells CNN that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is not discouraging members from speaking out against Biden's candidacy. The president Biden for his part, is publicly remaining defiant, saying in the statement that was released today, he looks forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week, once he's done recovering from COVID. But behind closed doors, many senior White House and campaign officials say they believe Biden must drop out of the race the and soon with one Democratic governor telling CNN, quote, this can't go on much longer. I want to go straight to CNN's MJ Lee, who is in the studio with us. And, MJ, you have really been on the forefront reporting on everything unfolding around Biden. You've been talking to your sources. What is happening behind the scenes today, all kinds of different signals are coming out.",

We saw the campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, going on the airwaves to say he is absolutely staying in the race. They put out a memo today saying there is no plan for an alternative candidate. We also so -- I've got a statement from the president himself saying he's looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail.Obviously, once he's done recovering from COVID, but that defiance that we are seeing in public from the campaign is in such stark contrast from really the panic that is setting in all across the Democratic Party. The members that are continuing to come out to publicly they, the president needs to go, donors obviously have said, we're not going to be writing these checks anymore until the party figures out who the nominee is going to be. The campaign is though, saying that they are emboldened by what they saw at the RNC. They watch the president, the former president's speech, and they feel like, well, this is exactly what we expected. This is the Trump from 2016, the Trump from 2020.

They really missed Latino voters. And let me just tell you something I heard this morning, again, anecdotal, but really important. I worked very closely with a group called Somos Votantes. They have gone door to door in Latino communities and all of these swing states, they have knocked on 4,000 doors. You know how many voters brought up concern about the debate? Two, two of them. Every single one talked about the issues that are at hand. The contrast that is this election and last night at the RNC, Donald Trump showed very clearly what communities of color, like Latino voters, Black voters, especially women voters, are up against, and those are the voters that this campaign is hearing from the president is hearing from, which includes the 14 million voters who voted for him during the nomination process.",

No, that is not the case. We did this because of a technicality having to do with the Ohio Republican legislature, who was trying to keep Joe Biden and Kamala Harris off of their ballot. And so, we did this just simply as a timing thing. Today's meeting was simply going through the rules of what we're going -- what is going to govern the Democratic National Convention. There was a lot that we didn't get to. And so we will be meeting again next week. But as we move closer to the virtual roll call, which we will be having at some point after August 1st and at some point finishing before August 7, we will absolutely get to all of those issues in terms of, you know, at that point, President Biden continues to be the nominee, which I suspect he will.

It's also now going to be the vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, who is going to be here. Now what were told that they're doing, we actually just got an alert that they're closing some of the streets around the building, that is not usual. Sometimes when they are outdoor rallies, you see some of the side streets that are main -- not main roads closed down, but never in a downtown area, at least of late since he's been a former president, have you seen that. We also know they're doing a lot of constant assessments to see what went wrong, to see how to enhance security, and that they are really enlisting heavily on local law enforcement, asking for more and more officers. Now, people telling me that around the president, his detail has dramatically changed, that he is already added agents, that they are already looking at a different security apparatus. One example of that is that last night after he left his convention speech, he landed in New Jersey, something that often happens. But for roughly an hour, a New Jersey state police helicopter was circling over the airport in Newark, creating an aerial security zone that is not usually, again common for a former president or at least was common for former President Donald Trump. So, clearly, they are trying to ramp up security. Make sure nothing happens again, the other thing they are rethinking is those big outdoor rallies. We know that tomorrow is going to be inside.",
