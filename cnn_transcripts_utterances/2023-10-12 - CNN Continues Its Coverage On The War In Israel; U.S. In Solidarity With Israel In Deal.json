He was only prepared to say that this will be a quote, \"long and drawn-out campaign against Hamas\".

The United Nations deploring what it describes as the collective punishment reprisal strikes against Gaza. The President addressing questions about the possibility of international support waning the longer this goes on and the higher the death toll in Gaza. He was clearly frustrated, very agitated today. President Herzog said that Israel is working to adhere to the rules of war, but he said we are at war. He said, quote, \"The plan is to ensure that Hamas will never be able to commit these atrocities again.\" And he posed a rhetorical question to those who were in the room. He said, are we accommodating terror or are we fighting terror? He also said this should be a region of peace. These were the words of the Israeli President. He said, we must not let this train of inclusion and peace be derailed. So, what is at this point being done to try and de-escalate things by players around the region? There certainly is some activity. This is my report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They looked like interceptions -- the ones we could see according to the official Lebanese news agency, they were interceptions by the Patriot missile system that has been supplied by the United States to Israel. Throughout this week, so far, what we've seen is there have been flare-ups along the border between not only Hezbollah but also Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants here in Lebanon and Israeli forces. So far, Hezbollah has conceded that three of its fighters were killed and Israel has conceded that three of its soldiers have been killed. Yesterday, there was an incident, or at least Hezbollah put out a video of an Israeli position being targeted by a guided missile. It appeared that it was a direct hit on a position where there were several Israeli soldiers, but until now we haven't heard any comment from the Israeli military. But certainly, this border, if it really flares up, if we see something along the lines of what happened in July 2006 when there was a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah, it could be of a far greater order of what we're seeing going on between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

With regard to the second front, as I mentioned earlier, it's our determination and that of Israel, as well, that there not be a second front or a third front. And we are working as hard as we can, working with other partners in the region to try to ensure that that's the case. The president has also been very clear -- President Biden. He's been very clear that no one, state or non-state actor, should try to take advantage of this moment.

That's how big and how devastating this attack has been. And of course, each of these situations is very different. And it's important to keep that in mind. Of course, we're always trying to draw the lessons from past experience, as they may or may not be applicable to what we or our partners are doing now. And of course, we are in very close conversation with Israel about the work it's undertaking, as I said, to make sure it can defend itself, defend its citizens, and to the best of its ability ensure that this doesn't happen again. Those are the objectives. And again, I'll leave the operational details to Israel and simply say again that as we have these discussions, we're looking at past experiences, including many past experiences more immediate to this challenge, including in Gaza and including in the region. With regard to the goals of Hamas, I think that is a question mostly on which I could speculate but not give you any kind of clear definitive answer. There are a number of possible explanations. We have not heard from them what their goals are. And I have to tell you that in many ways, the simplest explanation may be the most compelling. This is pure evil. There may be second or third order interests. For example, I've noted this before, we've been engaged, as you know, in trying to support and advance the possibility of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other countries that do not yet have normalized relations with Israel. Something that is very challenging, very difficult, but also very possible. And something that would have a profound effect on the region, on the countries in question, and on the region -- a region that's been in turmoil for so many decades that through normalization, through greater integration, then has a path to much greater stability, much greater peace, much greater opportunity for everyone in the region.

And the shelters are already overcrowded. We've been supporting 220,000 people inside the shelter, so far, since the crisis began. We've been supporting around 300,000 people. And our -- basically -- resources are depleting, as well. So, I think earlier, you had the report on the fuel and the fuel is having a major catastrophic implication on the bakeries, on the mills, on the shops. So, the whole market systems are not functioning anymore. So, it's really a very, very sad situation that is ongoing and we're doing everything we can to make sure that people are basically, we're able to meet their needs and we're working with everyone trying to secure access to be able to get food in. That's our priority for now.",

People have been going to the marketswhen it was functioning and emptied everything. And of course, with the people losing their houses, seeking shelter, all those food items that they sourced were left behind. So, they're going to shelters, we're able to source them with bread. The bakeries that we've been working with are stopping, either because of lack of wheat flour or because of lacking fuel basically that is needed. As you know, electricity is down at the moment in Gaza. Of course, there is water issues, there is water shortage, clean water shortage. And so, we -- systems that are not functioning, so that's getting to water wells and other systems.",
