      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, move fast and break things with 54 days until inauguration. That seems to be the Trump transition's unofficial motto. The president-elect has already filled out his cabinet. Now he's preparing an agenda to quickly push through a narrowly divided Congress.Plus, what went wrong? Harris campaign brain trust is defending the decisions they made in the final weeks of the campaign. So why do they think Trump won? And citizen Musk. He's worth more than $350 billion has the ear of the president-elect. What Elon Musk wants to do with all that money and influence? We'll talk to the author of a new Time magazine cover story on him, coming up soon. I' Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. It's been three weeks since Donald Trump won the election. Since then, he's barely been seen in public. But behind the scenes, he and his team are racing to name loyalists at top positions and plotting their first moves when he takes office on January 20. At this point in 2016 he had just four cabinet picks, and today, he's already chosen them all. We're told the president-elect is well aware that lame duck presidents, which of course, he'll be on day one, do not have a lot of time to waste. CNN's Steve Contorno joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. So, Steve, you've been talking to your sources inside the transition team. What are they telling you? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Yeah. Aides and advisers to Donald Trump are saying that they have noticed, he is much more emboldened this time around by his electoral college victory and the size of it, as well as the confidence in his own understanding of executive power from his first four years in office. But there's another element at play here, and that is the tight window for him to act, and not just because he is a one term president from the moment he gets into office, as you mentioned, but also because of the tight window with a majority in both the House and the Senate for him to act. And that is driving the speed at which Trump is putting together his cabinet and will also be driving the speed at which they operate from the moment he has sworn in on January 20. I talked to one close Trump adviser, Brian Ballard. He is a lobbyist who is not only has the president's ear, but also many of his cabinet picks. He said, quote, everyone understands we have a two-year window with the majority in the House and Senate. Who knows what happens after that? And if you are not running at breakneck speed, you shouldn't be part of this administration. And Trump continuing to call out names and announce names for his incoming administration, up until this Thanksgiving holiday. In the last 24 hours, he named five more people to his administration, including Jamieson Greer, who was Trump's choice to be the U.S. trade Representative, obviously a very key role, given how much emphasis Trump has already put on trade and tariffs, even before his presidency has taken place. And then Jay Bhattacharya, he is a doctor and professor at Stanford University. He actually holds degrees in both economics and medicine. He was a leading COVID skeptic of lockdowns, the lockdowns that Trump put in place. Well now he is Trump's choice to be the director of the National Institutes of Health, just showing how this unconventional, unorthodox cabinet continuing to be put together in very, very quick fashion.

They were recommended to him from people within the so-called establishment wing of the Republican Party.This time is a little bit different. Just looking at the screen, the Rex Tillerson. He really didn't have much of a relationship with Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State. Now, Marco Rubio, they've developed a bond despite their friction, of course, in the 2016 campaign. Jeff Sessions, he was a loyalist of -- he was the first one to endorse Trump back in 2016. Pam Bondi, someone who has defended Trump through all of these criminal indictments. Differences, though, you know, Tom Price, he was a health and human services secretary, RFK Jr., a major difference. Someone like Jim Mattis -- General Jim Mattis coming in as defense secretary.

But the ideological diversity in the Trump cabinet is not something I think we have fully reckoned with and fully processed.Now, we'll see how it actually plays out. Generally, ideologically diverse cabinets. They sound nice. In theory, everyone likes to cheer ideological diversity for reporters' perspective. What does that mean? That means in fighting. That means stories and that means scoops. And that's going to mean when the process plays out, there's going to be a lot of black backbiting, and there's going to be a lot of shoulda woulda coulda. And that's how I see the first few months -- if not the first couple years, the Trump administration playing out with this great this -- this very diverse group of cabinet members.

But last night, Jay Bhattacharya, who is a -- who was a COVID skeptic, skeptic of some of the lockdown policies, skeptic of some of the vaccines as they were being rolled out He is -- would lead the NIH assuming National Institutes of Health, the $48 billion budget. Such a massive agency, that would be a sea change from the Biden administration.

But one thing that he will have to deal with is an incredibly tight margin in the United States House. This will be complication for his agenda, no question about it.Right now, if the current map margins hold, there are a couple of races that are still -- three races that have not been called yet. There's one the Republicans are leading in Iowa. There are two that the Democrats are leading in California. If 220 to 215 margin that is so tight -- that is less than what they have now. And because, given the fact that Trump has chosen three people from the House GOP conference to serve in his administration, this is how tight he would get to 217 to 215. That means a single Republican defection on any bill until they fill out those seats, which could take a few months, could stymie the legislation.

So, lawmakers who want to push back on that agenda should try and see what happens in 2026.Now, whether or not that actually ends up happening. We've seen time and time again, Republicans are not afraid to voice their concerns and push back. And so, I do think that there's going to be situations, whether it's getting some of these people actually appointed or passing certain agendas that Donald Trump wants passed in his first 100 days, it's going to be difficult for them, and they're aware of that.",

We have also reached out to the campaign for more details, as well as law enforcement officials and the FBI now telling us that they are, quote, aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees. And they're working with their law enforcement partners, and they're taking all of these threats seriously. So, this is something that has been happening more and more recently with public officials and politicians where these swatting threats and bomb threats are being called in, and we are learning that this is now targeting the Trump administration.
