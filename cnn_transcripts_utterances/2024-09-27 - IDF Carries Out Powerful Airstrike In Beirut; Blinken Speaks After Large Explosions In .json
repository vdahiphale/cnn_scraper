We have an enormous amount of breaking news to bring to your close attention. Beirut tonight where searchers and rescuers are looking for survivors after a series of massive Israeli airstrikes. Israeli officials say the strikes were targeted at the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Lebanese officials say at least two people have been killed, dozens of people injured, and they say that the number, obviously of casualties is likely to rise given the extent of the damage. A senior Israeli official says it is too early to say whether the Hezbollah leader is amongst the casualties. The Israeli prime minister's office released this photograph. Here is Anthony Blinken.",

That after a year they felt that they had to get people back in their homes; that they went after Nasrallah, and in today's strike were targeting him; clearly, they don't know what they have achieved. They still feel that when in the military you have momentum, that you have to keep going; that they will be a lot farther along in their operation if it turns out that this was successful, in their terms, today; but that they still, he said -- the official said, still have to keep going, and they are not ready to pause. From your conversations, what is your perspective about whether Israel continuing with this operation and not going in on the ground -- which they said is not preferable -- but if doing this in what they consider a targeted way is a legitimate response to what they see as an existential threat, or if there is another alternative, a diplomatic alternative?",

So my question: Now you repeated, how it does that matter. Can you clarify whether this Israeli approach to targeting Hezbollah's leadership falls under self-defense? And what's the US administration clear position on the policy of targeted assassination? And if I may, please, one second question. You've emphasized for calm along the northern borders, and you have been working towards this goal for the past 11 months. Now, as we edge closer to a broader conflict, could you specify what do you mean by calm? Are you referring to a return to the pre-October 7 status quo, implying a cessation of hostilities, or the full implementation of Resolution 1701? Because it does matter for the Lebanese and for the Israeli to understand what are you proposing? And just one final question. We are two weeks away from October 7, Mr. Secretary.

Will they wait until they can regroup a little bit and figure out who and where their leadership is? And what military equipment is available and how big an onslaught do they want to do? We know that the Iranians has reported that the Supreme Leader is having a meeting with his Security Cabinet. It is likely that if not Nasrallah, then somebody filling in and taking over from him is going to want to hear on such an important issue from the Iranians who are their sponsors. Look, Hezbollah on the ground in Lebanon has a high degree of autonomy, but what has happened is a huge deal and the moves they make next are hugely consequential. So there may be a pause in time before they respond, but the longer they wait in responding, perhaps the more complex, sophisticated, and deadly their punch will be when they throw it. And I think that's what the prime minister will be coming back to, to that environment, to see what that punch is going to be like, and to see what Israel needs to do to continue to try to destabilize, to minimize the punches as they have been over the past week.",

According to the IDF, the attack was a precision strike on Hezbollah's headquarters. Now, the unknown, of course, is whether firstly, Hassan Nasrallah was there. And if he was, did he survive? Officials in US and Israel say Washington was kept in the dark until the operation was underway. The White House officials were furious that Benjamin Netanyahu had dismissed the ceasefire proposal on Thursday, and then proceeding as they have. Kevin Liptak is at the White House. Netanyahu goes.

One is that they didn't have any involvement in the strike itself. And you heard that from President Biden a little bit earlier saying that the US wasn't involved and had no knowledge. The other thing that were trying to emphasize is that they didn't know ahead of time that this was going to be a strike targeting Hassan Nasrallah and what we did learn is that essentially, the US Defense Secretary learned about this strike as it was underway in a phone call with his Israeli counterpart. The planes were already in the air, and so the US is trying very much to distance itself from the actual events on the ground. And so I think the question now for American officials is, of course, whether Nasrallah is alive or dead, but also what this means for the proposed 21-day ceasefire they were so proud to come out and announce on Wednesday evening, and that the next morning, Netanyahu rejected out of hand. As you mentioned, American officials were furious at that. There was a number of intense meetings in New York on the sidelines of the UN between American officials and Ron Dermer, the very close Netanyahu confidant. Essentially what Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, told Dermer in their meeting was that Israel would need to come out with a statement saying it was supportive of a ceasefire broadly. Of course, that was all before this event in Beirut. Now the open question is, what happens next? And certainly American officials very urgently trying to de-escalate the situation.",

President Biden is looking particularly, how does that say impotent in the center to be able to force Israel to do anything? And you couldn't make it up. You've got Ukraine worsening.

And it's such a complicated dynamic in particular for the Vice President, obviously, Kamala Harris, who has said nothing specificabout how she would handle this situation any differently than President Biden. President Biden, of course, has tried and tried again to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza to no effect whatsoever. Harris, whenever she's asked about the conflict in the Middle East, simply says that it would be resolved if Hamas would agree to a hostage deal. But she hasn't said how she would do it and certainly President Biden hasn't been able to do it either. When it comes to President Trump, there's no question that he is on the side of Israel, that essentially, he would continue the American perspective of allowing Israel the arms and weapons to carry out the strikes that it's carrying out in both Lebanon and Gaza. And so, I think when you talk to voters, and when you think about this from a voter perspective, they see a world that is essentially on fire. They don't necessarily see a plan to take it under control. And I think when you're both of these candidates, the struggle is to try and convince American voters that you have the capacity to do something.

That number is likely to rise, as you can see from the sheer level of devastation. Six buildings were destroyed with explosives and munitions designed to bury deep, to attack bunkers way underground. And tonight, the searching continues through the rubble. You have a child being carried from the scene after being pulled from the site. Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv. So, we have much ground to cover, Jim, and you're the man that we need to talk to.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Listen, it's the latest in a series of major Israeli strikes on Hezbollah. A number of Hezbollah leaders prior to this one, though, this clearly the most significant given that he is the actual leader. But you had these pager attacks, right? That injured thousands of Hezbollah fighters and dismantled their communication network. And you've had a series of airstrikes in the last several days attempting to destroy missile positions and ammunition depots and missile storage sites, rocket and missile storage sites, all of which must be taken together as a major Israeli escalation in its war against Hezbollah. The only remaining question is, does Israel go in on the ground in significant numbers? And they have issued call up orders to reservists, they have positioned some troops on Israel's northern border that at least lays the groundwork for such an order, and that is Richard, a major escalation in this conflict.

This comes from a former senior Israeli official who tells me the following, and this speaks to Israel's confidence that Hassan Nasrallah was at least there where this strike occurred.
