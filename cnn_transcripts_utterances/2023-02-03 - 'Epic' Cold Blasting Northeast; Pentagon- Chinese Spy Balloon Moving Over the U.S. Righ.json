Really all told, we're talking about 15 million people across a wide portion of the Northeast, basically everything from Northeastern Pennsylvania, New York state, and everything North, under wind chill warnings or alerts of some sort. Because this wind, this temperature is going to steadily drop over the course of the day into tomorrow. As you mentioned, you can see wind chills as low as 21 degrees here in Boston tonight; 27 on Saturday. And so that is why officials are taking all sorts of precautions. Boston public schools are closed. So are public schools in surrounding areas, as well. There are going to be warming centers open for people who may lose power. One National Weather Service source we spoke to said that it's not just the wind chill. There's extremely high winds, dropping the temperature to dangerously low levels, where you can get frostbite in a matter of minutes. It's also the wind itself. In some places, the gusts could be so strong that they end up knocking out power, to knocking power lines. That can lead to power outages. Very, very dangerous, those temperatures.
