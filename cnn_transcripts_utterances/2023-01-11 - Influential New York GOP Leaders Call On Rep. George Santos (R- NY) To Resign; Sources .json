I'm Laura Coates and this is CNN TONIGHT.So, the real question is, and if you are a Sound of Music fan out there, it's how do you solve a problem like George Santos. He was only sworn in a few days ago, but the Republican Congressman who lied about, well, where he worked, where he went to school, about being Jewish, remember when he said what he meant was Jew-ish? Well, now he's in hot water with members of his own party back in New York State. I'll talk to two New York Republicans who are now calling for him to resign. But as the chorus for calls for him to step down get much, much louder, well, the congressman is trying to shut it down by saying this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's after the initial discovery of those classified documents in his one-time office in Washington back in November. So, where were these new documents found and what's in them? And, frankly, how long have they known about this set of documents as well? Plus, a Republican strategist alleges powerful conservative Matt Schlapp sexually assaulted him while he was driving him back to an Atlanta hotel several weeks before the November midterm election. Now, Schlapp, through his attorney, denies this claim. We'll have the very latest on this developing story this evening. A lot to talk about tonight, so I want to bring in and begin with the calls for George Santos to resign his seat in Congress. And those calls are coming from inside the proverbial House, including from my next two guests who are both New York state Republican lawmakers, State Senator Jack Martins and State Assemblyman Ed Ra. Gentlemen, welcome to the program this evening. Listen, everyone has been talking about Congressman, now, George Santos. He, of course, has been sworn in. He is a member of the House of Representatives. But both of you have been calling for him to resign. And so far, he says he will not. State Senator Jack Martins, I wonder, from your perspective, initially, and I want to hear from both of you, what if he continues to defy the calls to resign? What do you have to force him to do anything? STATE SEN. JACK MARTINS (R-NY):  Well, look, we have the will of the people. I know that there are investigations, not only criminal investigations here in New York, there are federal investigations, and I understand that there was an ethics complaint filed against him today. So, there are multiple avenues where Santos will be called to task, and I do believe at least one of those will be successful.",

And yet, you do not have a full-throated response from, say, Speaker McCarthy who is saying, look, this person should not be in Congress, cannot be in on any committees, not being on the top committees has been his comment.

So, I appreciate the Republicans in Nassau County saying -- and in New York saying we don't care about the politics of it, our constituents deserve real, truthful representation.

But it does give Democrats, I think, an opening here to essentially characterize, like use Santos as long as he lasts as emblematic of the Republican conference. So, that is one thing that they get.

It included things like the burial arrangement documents for Beau Biden's funeral, boxes of condolence letters that had been sent to him as vice president.And that's why his personal lawyer was going through it, because they thought it was all personal and confidential and then that lawyer gets to a box. He opens it up. There's a folder marked V.P. personal, not unimportant. He opens that up, it says classified. He closes it again and he calls the White House Counsel. He says, Houston, we have a problem. They say call the National Archives.

Here are a couple of them that were asked of the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, that she declined to answer. Who brought the documents to the office? Did Biden himself bring them? Why did it take so long to disclose the discovery to the public? Was the timing related to the midterm elections? Were there any other things found? Is there an audit under way? Was he briefed? When was he briefed? Why were the private lawyers doing this? A number of questions that she declined to answer because she cited an ongoing investigation.But that election part, the when the people are finding out, that is going to be something that already has legs and might continue to run as he intends to run for the re-election campaign.

That said, maybe their reasoning is that they were cooperating with an investigation. I don't know. But the political fallout is what it is.I will say I don't think there's much of a chance that Joe Biden carried these 40 boxes here. I have a source who's very familiar with the documents. For the record, he is a lifelong registered Republican and knows a lot about how these things are handled over the years. He thinks it was very likely an honest mistake.

More than 10,000 U.S. flights have been delayed. Over 1,300 have been cancelled. The Biden administration says there is no evidence of a cyberattack at this time. Let's talk about it now with Juliette Kayyem, former Department of Homeland Security official and Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director.

Look, this is serious in the sense we have not had a nationwide grounding since 9/11, so this does not happen often. You do not close down the airport system.And this wasn't just any system that broke down. It's called the NOTAM system. It's essentially a notice to the pilots of what's going on on the ground. Is there something on the runway? Is there a disruption on an airport? And it's communicating with the pilots. So, without it, you have no communication with the pilots. And so, to call it a system didn't work, it's actually a very relevant system. It's a safety and security system. So, none of it is good. The FAA I will say took too long to tell us what was going on. They knew from yesterday midday there were glitches in the system. To their credit, they are trying to get the system to fix itself. They're rebooting it, there's backup systems. None of them are working. So, too many passengers are arriving at airports. I think they could have communicated faster. The good news is, is that even a system this complicated was able to get back up and running within 90 minutes and airplanes, I mean, I got delayed -- in the end, just about an hour and 10 minutes and I had a flight sort of at the key time.",
