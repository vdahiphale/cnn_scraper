      "sentences": "Today is the day. The Iowa Republican caucuses are finally here. Donald Trump once again dominatingthe latest polling, but will his lead hold? Meanwhile, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are hoping for a surprise in the nation's first contest. Can they pull off a better-than-expected finish in the Hawkeye State? And America observes Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. President Biden will mark the day, volunteering in Philadelphia. We'll have a look at King's words and legacy ahead. Good day, everyone. I'm John Avalon, in for Kasie Hunt, to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in New York, Monday, January 15, 2024. Today is the day of the Iowa caucuses. There are eight days until the New Hampshire primaries and only 294 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. We are now just hours away from the first votes of the 2024 election. It's a sprint to the finish for the three top Republican candidates ahead of the caucuses in the great state of Iowa. So, what to look out for? Well, Shane Goldmacher, National Political Correspondent for The New York Times, laid it out really well, writing that there are \"Seven numbers that tell the tale of the GOP primary.\" Those numbers, well, is number one. 28 percentage points. It refers Mr. Trump's lead in the Iowa poll. \"The bar has been set.\" Now, Trump has consistently held a commanding lead in Iowa, but will it hold at that threshold? Next, three million. That's \"The number of doors a pro-DeSantis super PAC has knocked on nationwide.\" DeSantis has gone all in on Iowa, but the latest polling has him slipping into third place behind Nikki Haley. Now, three, negative 33 Fahrenheit. You heard that right. That's \"The projected minimum windshield forecast in Des Moines on Monday evening.\" It is dangerously cold across Iowa and that could have real world impact on the caucus process. Next, three percent. That's \"Nikki Haley's share of the vote among Republicans who didn't graduate from college in the most recent New York Times/Siena College Poll.\" And that is at odds with the Republican Party's base which overwhelmingly supports Trump. At five, $46,499,124.63. That's \"The amount of spending from super PACs opposing Ron DeSantis.\" Now, that's more than the spending against Trump and Haley combined, the sign of the strength of these attempts to knock DeSantis out number. Six, $5,865. That's \"The DeSantis campaign's TV ad spending this week in Iowa in the conservative Sioux City market\" which is in the northwest quadrant, the sign perhaps that the DeSantis campaign is under financial strain and having to spend its dollars quite carefully. And finally, zero, goose egg. That's \"The former President's total debate appearances.\" A reminder that Donald Trump has been a no-show at debates and essentially ghosted Iowa for the most part while holding on to his commanding lead. Another reminder that he plays by his own rules. Democratic norms be damned. All right. Let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene joining us from Des Moines. Alayna, what is the state of the race on the ground today?",

You worked on those campaigns. Those upset the conventional wisdom polls at the time, albeit much closer polls than we're seeing today. What's the key to pulling off an upset or beating expectations in Iowa? What kind of districts are you looking for turnout tonight? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, organization is the key. And look, here is the thing is to identify where your key base of support is. And for, as we just saw on that graph, Ted Cruz, Santorum and also my boss, Huckabee in 2008, the evangelicals were a tremendous part of the campaign. And here is what we did is, you -- a couple of things, first and foremost, fundraising. Some of his campaigns had tremendous funds. But, what you're also doing is you are recruiting county chairs in each county, all of the 99 counties. You want to identify a person or people that can organize for caucus turnout that commit to caucus operation. And then you also work to shore up evangelical support, because people that go to church will tell their friends and they'll tell two friends and they'll tell two friends and they will come out and commit to caucus, and then you message to them saying, look, we need to coalesce early behind our candidate, be it Ted Cruz, be it DeSantis, be it Donald Trump, coalesce early behind the non-establishment candidate. So, that's the messaging going forward. And look, there are key pockets of the state, much in northwest corner of the state where Ted Cruz did very well. You reach out to those people that you really know will come out and commit to caucus. And if you notice, we see so much with Donald Trump with some of the bombastic things he says. But, the white cap that he has been wearing, it says \"Trump caucus captain.\" This is a thing that the campaign is doing to get people involved, to get them signed up, to be a caucus captain. And that right there, they are using that as kind of a novelty kind of way to encourage people. Well, we get distracted by what some of what Donald Trump is doing. His team is doing all of those checking off all the boxes and what to do to commit to caucus. DeSantis is doing it as well too. But, some of the team that put that train on the tracks have left. So, the goal right now is DeSantis, who has really put his flag in Iowa. How he will be able to move forward with a lot of those people that put this in place no longer there? So, he is the one really to watch, potentially, with the most at stake here.",

Ramaswamy drains away at least some votes for him. He is now in the high-single digits. That's not nobody.

At the end of the day, whether or not an endorsement from Marco Rubio is going to sway any farmers to come out in the Tundras of Iowa, I seriously doubt it. But, it's more of an optics for down the road and having a relationship with Donald Trump than to move voters. Look, I think all three candidates have a good base of support. Look at Ron DeSantis. He has a very popular Governor Kim Reynolds in Iowa. Bob Vander Plaats is a key faith leader. That is helping him to some degree, but he is still very far behind. Nikki Haley, I think one of her best aces in the hole, she says she doesn't like or care about endorsements, but her endorsement of Governor Sununu in New Hampshire is going to benefit her greatly. He has been a tremendous surrogate for her and has really helped move the vote. So, I think that endorsement will be one to watch for her in New Hampshire.",

DeSantis battling Nikki Haley for second place, both trailing Donald Trump in the polls. As you can see, his support has actually been slipping in Iowa since December. DeSantis talked to our Dana Bash a short time ago about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Some people have underestimated the extent where there is fluidity with this. Someone is like, yeah, you know, I like Trump, but -- so give them a reason to support me, and that could be the difference.

He has strong loyalty among those who say they're going to caucus for him in that Des Moines Register poll. So, I think 62 percent of his supporters said they were definitely going to show up tonight. Nikki Haley does not have that kind of organization. She does not have that kind of loyalty among -- an enthusiasm among her supporters.

And yet, Donald Trump, who I don't think many folks would say exemplifies many of the principles in the New Testament, seems to have a really strong hold on evangelical leaders. Here is the Des Moines Register polls, and 51 percent of evangelicals support him. A couple of pastors blanched when he put out a ad on his Truth Social, calling \"God made Trump\" which was sort of idolatrous to many eyes.

But, I was shocked, John, the other day when I saw Donald Trump roll out his faith leaders. These were from every county. I printed it up. It was 14 pages of evangelical leaders from across the state, and he has really galvanized them, and those people will commit to caucus. And look, here is the reason why these evangelicals support Trump. Look, Donald Trump doesn't talk and act very much like your typical Christian. But, evangelicals stand behind him for a couple of reasons. One, his Supreme Court nominees that helped lead to overturning Roe v. Wade, and his unwavering support for Israel. They also see him as someone who makes a promise and delivers. So, you're not going to get these evangelicals that have -- are on board with Trump.

And when you really look at what Dr. King stood for, we'll have so many people talking about Dr. King today. And yet, their policies won't be supportive of ending poverty and having peace in our world. And so, I think Democrats have a real story to tell, that is a story that is rooted in faith and in inclusivity. But, it's interesting, because for so long, Republicans have touted that they are the party of faith because of the conversation around -- of abortion. But, what we're actually seeing is that as an issue that people, whether you are a Christian or not, I am a Christian, and I am also pro-choice, and you can have those two things be true and not have to question your faith. And I think that story is actually starting to change. And I hope, I started my organizing as a Democrat in the church. The black church is so, so important to the Democratic Party, and is where so many civil rights organizers came out of.

So, despite the fact that they are saying they don't like this deal, the reality is their votes aren't typically needed to get these across the finish line. In fact, even if some of those members blocked the rule, even if some of those members blocked the rule from coming out of the Committee, what Johnson could do is a move that he has done before, which is pass these bills under a suspension of the rules with a two thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Now, that does mean you need more democratic votes. But, because we're talking about a simple spending bill that is just short term, that is the levels that we have been funding government at for the last several months, the reality is that can get across the finish line pretty quickly.

Susan, look, the foreign policy of Ronald Reagan, the foreign policy of Bush 41, Bush 43, you just heard Lauren Fox there, there has been an entire repudiation, a resurgence of a neo- isolationist tradition that's happening as Russia is continuing its invasion of Ukraine with an eye towards the outcome of this election. Are you surprised that on such a basic article of faith is standing up to Russian aggression, which animated ideologies throughout the Cold War, could be discarded in the face of an actual invasion in real time so completely within the Republican Party?",

You remember, Ronald Reagan talked about the three stools of the Republican Party, and one of those was kind ofmuscular leadership around the globe on behalf of democracy. But, this is not exactly a Republican Party anymore. This is a populist party with the fate -- shaped by Donald Trump. And that is something very different. It's an America First sort of foreign policy. It's not seeing the U.S. role as aggressively around the world. And Donald Trump's attitude toward Russia, and Putin in particular, have been surprising and sometimes hard to understand. But, clearly, he has a different attitude toward Russia than American foreign policy, really not just in the Republican Party, among Democrats as well, for a generation.",

One of the canaries in that coal mine, you had a front seat too, which is, when in 2016 when Ted Cruz surprised the polls and beat Donald Trump, Donald Trump's first impulse was to a series of tweets saying that Ted Cruz had stolen the Iowa caucuses, that they were rigged, that there ought to be a redo.

If he doesn't win, then there is widespread voter fraud. And if he wins, then there is nothing to see here. And that's a problem. And the problem also is that that has permeated through the ranks of his support in the Republican base. But, I do want to say this on the issue of this aid to Ukraine. One of the cornerstones of the Republicans' foreign policy position is peace through strength. And when we have two proxy wars going on, that we can help to try and avert, we need to flex our muscles with regard to that. And I'm really frustrated with those in the Freedom Caucus. Look, they say that they want to see more transparency in this funding that goes to the Ukraine, and I think they have done -- Ukraine has done a good job of doing that. I think it's important to make sure that we maybe just provide arsenal and weaponry as opposed to just writing a blank check. But, the answer to that is not to just turn our backs and walk away. We need to make sure we continue to find Ukraine as well as Israel, because that is an investment in democracy, and I think that's important. And the Freedom Caucus doesn't seem to be able to take yes for an answer. The suggestion is, let's \"kick the can down the road for a little bit and have more conversations.\" That's much better than leaving the field and shutting the government down. And shame on the Freedom Caucus for obviously always averting to let's shut the government down instead of having meaningful bipartisan conversations.",

I spoke to Adam Kinzinger on this program a few weeks ago, and he said that he hadn't gotten outreach from the Biden campaign, and not just him, other leading Republicans who have been strong about standing up against Trump because they feel he represents a threat to democracy. I want to show you two things. There is a poll The New York Times did over the summer, I found very interesting, because it shows a breakdown of the Republican Party, saying that 37 percent is the MAGA base. They love Donald Trump, not going anywhere. 37 percent, persuadable, 25 percent, not open to Trump, presumably pick up opportunities for Democrats if they played their cards right. In Iowa, Nikki Haley supporters, interestingly, 43 percent say that they would vote for Biden if Nikki Haley were not the nominee. Do you think the Biden campaign has a strategy to actually actively reach out to these voters who are Republicans, what's left or moderate Republicans? Or - - because to date it looks like they're defaulting to kind of an insularity which isn't probably going to be sufficient to the task they've got ahead of them.",

But, in addition, we also had folks who worked on reaching out to independents, reaching out to people who were Never Trumpers. It was a part of us getting Cindy McCain's endorsement to help us win the state of Arizona. So, I think that the Biden campaign is going to start this outreach. There has been news stories that they're staffing up in battleground states. The general election is -- has yet to really get started because we're still waiting to see who the Republican nominee is, even though most likely it will probably be Donald Trump. But, they are going to have to push this -- put this patch stitch quilt together that is very, very delicate right now and will be throughout the year because there are competing interests within the Biden coalition. And so, I think that there is an opportunity here to talk to Never Trumpers, to talk to independents, but not do it at the risk of isolating your base.

But, reporters, myself and my colleagues who have been on the ground, have seen that at recent Haley events, she'll often ask, are you here seeing me for the first time, and a lot of these people raised their hands.

But, one of the X factors is that independent voters, undeclared voters, can go in and register Republican that night. And there is some talk about independents supporting Nikki Haley. Now, this year, Des Moines Register poll, I should say, shows that independent voters -- actually, Trump has a narrow lead within -- just outside the margin of error, followed by Haley, then DeSantis.

I will say, this is another area where weather could be a factor, right? If you're a little hesitant, maybe you usually vote Democrat, or maybe you're an independent who is not super bought into any of these candidates. If you're not all the way in, maybe the weather is just the thing that is the straw that breaks the camel's back, and you end up staying home.
