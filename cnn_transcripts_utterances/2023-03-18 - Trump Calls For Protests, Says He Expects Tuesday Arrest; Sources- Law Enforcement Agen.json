Trump said he expects to be arrested on Tuesday. Now, this comes amid the Manhattan District Attorney's investigation into hush money payments made to former adult film star, Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, but a Trump attorney tells me the former President based his claim on press reports, stemming from what the lawyer says are leaks to the media from the District Attorney's office.

However, we do know that this ongoing investigation into possible financial crimes may be falsification of business records at the Trump Organization all connecting back to that $130,000 payment that Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to Stormy Daniels to cover up things that she wanted to allege in his 2016 campaign. All of that investigation is nearing the end because Trump was invited to testify, which he had the right to do. He declined to do that. That is the sort of thing that happens at the very end of a grand jury investigation like this. But we do know that there is another witness coming into the grand jury on Monday, at least scheduled to be testifying, and so at this point in time, we don't know exactly when or exactly what charges may be approved or maybe asked to be approved by the grand jury sitting in Manhattan in this unprecedented investigation that could lead to a criminal charge against the former President of the United States -- Paula.",

But you know, if I was handicapping these cases, there is no question that if I was looking at all of them, I would be most concerned if I was on the Trump team, about the Mar-a-Lago documents case. It is very straightforward. That really looks like sort of an easy kind of a put-put sort of case for a prosecutor where, you know, he has classified documents, it sure looks like he was willfully retaining those. There appears to be obstruction of justice. His own attorneys were caught up in that, so very problematic for the former President. One thing I will say, Paula is, whenever a defendant faces multiple criminal charges in different jurisdictions, that really ups the level of difficulty and I'd say the danger that he faces and his legal team is going to have difficulty of sort of balancing all of those competing cases at the same time.",

So a lot of the 30,000 might very well come from those are just turning 18. So it's going to be interesting to see how he actually competes with the Russian Army, the regular Russian Army for recruitment of these individuals, so that could, you know, put a bit of a damper on his efforts. He may also try to go in and get other elements of the Russian Security Forces to provide him with some people that they pull off the streets.

So when you put all that together, it's a dangerous place for airplanes of whatever type to be in the sky.

Otherwise, if you're using other products, like I showed you earlier, you're completely fine.

But the problem that I emphasize is, even if it might be a mild infection, if you have these symptoms that I mentioned, it could be conjunctivitis, just pinkeye, but you've got to see your doctor.And with this particular infection, Paula, it actually seeps through the tear ducts from the eye into the nasal cavity and can actually infect the body. The - this bacteria has been found in urine, in blood and in lungs. And that one death most likely was from sepsis, which is a total infection of the body, so this specific bacteria can be very dangerous.",
