There's none of that on the agenda here.There was a very modest climate agreement reached by John Kerry and his counterpart in the days ahead of this, but it doesn't actually require the Chinese to back off on their burning of coal.

There are a lot of American official who think this buys a little bit of time on Tiawan. A country that is growing that slowly probably would not take the risk of the economic sanctions that would follow if they actually moved against Taiwan. And so you just keep hearing President Biden, time and again, refer to this. I don't know if he's trying to rattle the Chinese. I don't know if he's just making an observation that the power dynamics have changed. But it's the first time the U.S. has dealt with a slow growing China.

So, when all of a sudden you say that, you know, this racketeering, you know, investigation into an attempt to overthrow our election won't be done until after the next presidential election, that has all sorts of assumptions baked in. One of which is that he's not the nominees and he doesn't win. Because otherwise, even though it's a state case, a lot of this stuff gets complicated in (INAUDIBLE).",
