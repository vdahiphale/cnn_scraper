It reaches up to 50 meters underground, and it's equipped with everything from electricity to ventilation and communication systems. The Israeli military says that it is part of a broader network of tunnels that spans two and a half miles or about four kilometers. This tunnel didn't actually cross into Israel, but it appears to have been used by Hamas within the Gaza Strip. And it comes out very close to one of the key crossing points between Israel and Gaza. And that is the Erez crossing, which was also a key site that Hamas militants attacked on October 7 and then cross into Israel from there. There's no evidence at this point that this tunnel was used as part of that October 7, attack but the size and the scale of this tunnel just shows the capacity that Hamas had to build these large networks of tunnels, of which Hamas says that there are hundreds of miles beneath Gaza.

What do you make of the extent, the complexity of the Hamas tunnel system we've seen so far, and the sheer size of this most recently revealed tunnel? DAPHNE RICHEMOND-BARAK, REICHMAN UNIVERSITY'S LAUDER SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT: Sure, Hamas definitely has perfected the art of tunnel warfare. It has one of the most sophisticated, vast and impressive tunnel network ever seen in the history of warfare. Even if you compare it to the network that was discovered by the U.S. forces shortly after 9/11 in Afghanistan, this is by all means an enemy that has entrenched into the subterranean environment for almost two decades. So definitely, it has figured out and it has overcome a lot of the disadvantages of this terrain. It has turned them into its advantage.

And so the methods to destroy a tunnel network are very few and far between, and most of them are very destructive. If you look back at the history of warfare, the way that states have generally dealt or contended with subterranean threat is by deploying their most powerful weapons, and for the most part, aerial weapons.

They call for a re-assumption, a rethinking, sorry, of all the assumptions that usually prevail on the battlefield. How do you secure the ground? How do you rescue soldiers? What kind of combat can you expect? You are looking at a combat -- at you know, soldiers very much alone underground. The traditional means of communication do not work. What kind of equipment do send your soldiers in? But I think looking back more, you know, more specifically what's going on in Gaza right now, the head of the Israeli security agency called this a war of tunnel pits, of tunnel shafts because the IDF has been really surprised to find hundreds upon hundreds of tunnel holes in the ground. And these holes, they allow the Hamas fighters to pop in and out, to surprise the forces, to fire at them, and then kind of hide again underground. So they present a major risk to the forces and they, of course, first and foremost I want to say, actually, they threatened the civilian population that is above ground. They weakened the civilian infrastructure. There are risks of collapses and explosions. And so these tunnels, they are the copycat military operation.

PHILIPPE JOST, PRESIDENT, REBUILDING NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS (through translator): The rooster now means it's the very end of the rebuilding of the spire. It stands 96 meters tall. And once the roofers will have covered the spire, we will be able to take the scaffolding off and that's when Parisians, and everyone who walks past will be able to see this flamboyant rooster.",
