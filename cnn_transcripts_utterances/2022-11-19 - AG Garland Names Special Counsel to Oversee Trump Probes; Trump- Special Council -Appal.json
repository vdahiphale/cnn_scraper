It would be a potential conflict of interest to have Donald Trump being investigated by Joe Biden's attorney general. Let's be real here. They ran against each other in 2020. There already was that history. It's no surprise to anybody that Donald Trump is running now as of this past week. And so I think if there was a concern about a conflict of interest it was there from day one.

Now in that email that was sent from the education secretary, he wrote, quote: \"Lawsuits are preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing its onetime student loan debt relief program. We are holding your approved application.\" And the Biden administration is hoping that the courts will ultimately rule in their favor. Now they have asked the Supreme Court to allow their program to be implemented while court challenges continue to be heard. This is certainly leaving millions of Americans in limbo. About 26 million people overall had applied for this program when it was first announced, and then those applications were put on hold. The Department of Education no longer accepting them once these court rulings blocked the program from being implemented.

This is President Trump's Twitter page here until tonight, it had said account suspended.Earlier tonight, Musk posted a poll on Twitter asking if people thought Donald Trump should be allowed back on the service. Musk says the results showed that people wanted Trump to return. He tweeted this. The people have spoken, Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei, which is Latin, it means the voice of God -- or sorry, the voice of the people, the voice of God. Twitter's previous management suspended Trump indefinitely just days after the January 6 Capitol insurrection. I want to bring in CNN media analyst and media reporter for Axios, Sara Fischer, with us now on the phone.

He -- he's seen this. Do you think that there will be any boundaries placed on him as he shows this propensity to use language that is questionable when it comes to violence?Honestly, not really for two reasons. One, Elon Musk has said that he doesn't plan to take down a lot of content, but limit the reach of things that he considers to be violence or hate speech. But when it comes to misinformation, I mean, Elon Musk himself has shown a propensity to lean into conspiracies. You'll recall he tweeted a link to a false article about Paul Pelosi a few weeks ago and then quickly deleted it under advertiser pressure. So I can't see him going after Donald Trump's account for things that might be false or misleading. Now, if there's something that his team considers to be or he considers to be hate speech, that could be something where he says he would limit the reach of it, meaning algorithmically, he wouldn't boost it in people's timelines, but he says he won't remove the actual content.",

He doesn't really use Twitter like that. Twitter is more of a public town square for him where he would blocked out messages, so that they would go viral. And so I think Facebook knows that they bring Trump back. They're giving him a vehicle to do campaigning through ads more so than they're giving him a major platform for his speech.",

And one of the things that they were saying is that they're issuing guidance to advertisers right now, but that many of their clients are skeptical about remaining on the platform is Donald Trump is reinstated. They don't want to have anything to do with January 6 or questions about democracy or the validity of the elections in 2020.

[20Now, there's also a weird clause in the Truth Social documents that basically says, you know, the app thing doesn't have to, you know, continue to move forward and in the same way if Donald Trump sort of decides to run for president. So, Brianna, I think broadly speaking, if Donald Trump doesn't get that December 8 merger vote approved. And in addition to that, if he's allowed back on Twitter and other social platforms, I think it's highly unlikely that Truth Social continues with much momentum.
