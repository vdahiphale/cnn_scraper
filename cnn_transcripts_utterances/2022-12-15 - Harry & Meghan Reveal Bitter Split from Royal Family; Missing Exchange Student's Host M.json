Kenny DeLand spent just over $8 before vanishing altogether, according to his family. Leaving behind only Facebook pictures of his life in France from Paris to the University of Grenobles, Alps. (on camera): The last time Kenny DeLand turned up for lessons here at the university he was studying at was November 28th. By the 29th, when he failed to turn up, a missing-persons report was filed.

Now, of course, we have not yet heard that final decision. We likely won't until after the holidays. But Jill Biden, two things are true about her. She is the most influential person in Joe Biden's life. And she is the one who knows him the best. She is the one who can assess how he feels, his schedule, his stamina.

Just 38 percent of all registered voters say yes, 61 percent say no. Obviously, that 38 percent not exactly that high. Though I have even seen polls that were worse for Biden and this is perhaps up a little bit. But perhaps even more interesting than that, take a look at the primary electorate. Take a look among Democratic voters. Should Joe Biden, in fact, be the nominee for the Democratic Party or should it be a different candidate? Look at that. Only 40 percent, only 40 percent say yes, 59 percent of Democrats, Democrats say it should be a different candidate. I should note, though, again, this 40 percent is slightly higher than we had earlier this year when it was about 25 percent of Democrats.

So it's better to compare Biden -- where Biden is against another candidate.Perhaps at this point, look at how he's doing against Donald Trump. Right? I think this gives you a pretty good indication that Joe Biden is far from dead, politically speaking. Choice for president among the general electorate, Joe Biden at 45 percent, Donald Trump at 39 percent. And this is just such a different thing than we saw when we looked at sort of Joe Biden when we weren't including other candidates. And I think it gives you a better understanding of why Biden thinks he can run and he can win, because he's leading against the most likely Republican nominee at this point. And that's something that has been pretty consistent. And you know, we just looked at the midterm elections, right, where we saw that, amongst the voters who voted in that midterm, yes, they didn't like Joe Biden but they didn't like Donald Trump either. And that played a major role. So we can't just look at he, Joe Biden, in a vacuum.",

So you see that his margin over his nearest competitor in the national primary polls is plus 18 points. That's not exactly great. But it's certainly much better than it was earlier this year. And more than that, it's better than even Barack Obama was doing in 2012. And Barack Obama sailed to that nomination. And it's certainly significantly better than Jimmy Carter, who was down by 10 points at this point.
