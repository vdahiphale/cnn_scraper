CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now from London. So, Clare, what is -- what is the reality, and what is the reception here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Whitney, this is calculated rhetoric. If you look closely at what Putin is saying, he says we are ready to negotiate with, quote, \"everyone involved\" in this process -- a clear reference to the fact that Ukraine -- that Russia, rather, continues to suggest that it is fighting not just Ukraine but the West and NATO as a whole.He continued and said he wants to talk about acceptable solutions. Obviously, that means acceptable to Russia, and we know that Russia's solutions are not acceptable to Ukraine. And he says it isn't us that's refusing to negotiate, it's the other side. And that Russia has, in his words, tried to find a peaceful solution to everything since 2014. Now, of course, if that were true, this war would not have started in the process. And this comes, of course, as we had an ultimatum from the Russian foreign minister in an interview this week, saying that if Ukraine doesn't comply with Russia's proposals when it comes to the annexed regions in Ukraine, then the Russian army would take it into their own hands. So, in a sense, nothing has changed. Russia does not want to give any ground when it comes to the territories that it has taken over. Ukraine wants to return to its 1991 borders which, of course, includes Crimea. Those are red lines for both sides. So, of course, the question why say it now? Why say you're willing to negotiate when you're not? I think perhaps you can't rule out that Putin is trying to say that he wants talks to try to nudge Ukraine's Western allies, perhaps, into pushing Ukraine to give up some ground to make a compromise to try to end this war. But it doesn't look like that is happening at the moment -- Whitney.",

It is fraught with political landmines because Ukraine is saying that Russia would not be able to attend and that Russia also needs to be expelled from the U.N. Security Council -- something that, according to the U.N. charter -- really, there's no method for doing that that I am aware of.And so, again -- look, they're engaged in a tough fight where both sides are going through their ammunition literally faster than they can make it. Faster than some of the people trying to supply both sides can make it. And they've got a tough fight that's stretching on. It will likely stretch on well into next year with neither side showing signs of backing down. The Ukrainian people are furious over the attacks on their energy grid meant to make civilians suffer, from their perspective. And so, with will not lessening on either side and -- well, peace talks become something that they pay lip service to. But I don't think we're going to see any progress on that anytime soon.",

It's Russian officials who say they shot down the Ukrainian drone and that the debris killed at least three Russian soldiers.But we could be seeing the fallout of the meeting between Zelenskyy and Biden in the capital here before Christmas, in that the White House had been leery of these kind of strikes inside Russia, worried that Ukraine might want to go too far. But Ukraine may have been able to convince -- Zelenskyy to Biden -- look, we know what we're doing. We're doing to do surgical strikes. And the only way to stop the bombing on our infrastructure grid is to stop the planes where they're taking off from places like the Engels Air Base inside Russia.",

Now, travelers still must take a COVID test before arriving in China, but no longer need to submit their results to a Chinese consulate or a Chinese embassy to get a code. But a lot remains unclear. We don't know how many flights will be allowed to enter the country. We don't know how easily Chinese nationals will be able to travel abroad. But still, the excitement is there. In fact, according to trip.com -- this is a popular Chinese online travel booking website -- within half an hour of the release of this new policy, searches for popular overseas travel destinations jumped to a 3-year high. Let's bring up the graphic for you. The top 10 search destinations include Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and the United Kingdom. But look, the outbreak inside China remains very, very serious. The country is seeing a surge of infection. Medical workers struggling to cope. And as China reopens to the world, already you have countries like Japan and India announcing today that they will require travelers from China to have proof of a negative COVID test on arrival. Also, in Italy, officials in the Lombardy region have requested a PCR test for all arrivals from China, effective immediately. Whitney, back to you.",

I'm going to develop my own. And the independent often just doesn't have the deep pockets to do that -- to have that front-end expense or a fleet or cars to do the delivery.

In the restaurant sphere, menu prices have only gone up 8.5 percent.So what that really means is that restauranteurs, in order to stay competitive, have eaten some of that increased cost. They've focused on menu items that are the most profitable, that require the least labor because they've also had real increases in labor prices in restaurants, or that have longer shelf life. And as we all know, at the beginning of the pandemic, most menus got really short in order to kind of move their high-volume items. They lopped off things left and right. And so, we still see much shorter menus than we did pre-pandemic and you have to cover the basics, right? You know, chicken, salmon, et cetera. So some of the more esoteric or exotic, or kind of special ingredients or proteins even are not on the menu as often.",

Elsewhere, another scary moment in last night's Colts-Chargers game. L.A. defensive back Derwin James was ejected after lowering his head and launching into Indy wide receiver Ashton Dulin in the second quarter. Both players got up pretty quickly. James clearly woozy from the impact. Dulin went immediately to the sideline and did not return to the game. The league has worked to eliminate hits like this in recent years. Both James and Dulin are in concussion protocol right now. And even without their 3-time Pro Bowler, L.A.'s defense was dominant, intercepting Nick Foles three times -- getting to him seven times in a 20-3 win. So the Chargers clinching their first playoff berth since 2018.
