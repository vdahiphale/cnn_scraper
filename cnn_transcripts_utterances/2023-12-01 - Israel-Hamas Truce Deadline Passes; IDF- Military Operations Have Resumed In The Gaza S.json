But there are urgent questions that are continuing to swirl tonight in the second hour of Laura Coates Live.It's midnight, without a truce in place, what is going to happen? We've already had the news tonight that the IDF aerial defense system intercepted one rocket that was launched from the Gaza Strip in the last hour. That was just before the truce was set to expire. Rocket sirens were heard in the Sderot area over the past few hours. I want to go right now to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Ashkelon, Israel, and CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt, who is in Washington. Jeremy, it is now the end of the deadline. We haven't heard anything about an extension of a truce from either side. What do you know?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Laura. For all intents and purposes, we believe that this truce has now expired. It was slated to expire at this very time, midnight eastern time, 7We're also now getting the reports of rocket sirens going off in the town of Holit, which is in the south of Sderot, very much closer to the Kerem Shalom crossing, where of course we've seen over 100 hostages released over the past week, many of those going through that Kerem Shalom crossing. In fact, this fragile truce that has lasted seven days and appears to not be extended into an eighth day has allowed for the release of 86 Israelis, 24 foreign nationals over the course of those seven days. But now it appears that there will not be additional hostages released today, at least as far as right now, Laura. We could always see some developments, some late breaking developments that happen after this truce was slated to end. But as of now, if there are no more developments of that sort, we will not see additional hostages be released. And what we will see instead is a return to the fighting in the Gaza Strip. Both sides, Israel and Hamas have made very clear that if the truce is not extended, they are both prepared to return to the fighting. Now we did just get an IDF spokesman on the phone, who said that he was waiting for a government directive but that the military stands prepared for any development. That was just a couple of minutes before that truce was slated to expire. I did already hear the noise of jets overhead, which sometimes is an indication of impending bombing in Gaza. We have not heard any explosions yet. But we'll certainly keep you posted, Laura.",

I would just point to last night as well, I mean, this is a deal that has been extended day by day. And there was a moment last night around this same time, though, before midnight, when we thought that this might fall apart as well.And what we then learned was that there were several lists that were put forward by Hamas that were deemed unacceptable by Israel. The deal was that women and children alive would be handed over to Israel. And what Hamas had initially proposed was seven women and children, and then three bodies that was rejected by Israel, because they all had to be alive. And then there was a second list, seven women and children and three elderly individuals who we believe to be men. That too, was rejected. They finally settled on eight women and children who we saw released earlier today on Thursday, so yesterday. And the belief in going into the seventh and eighth days was that Hamas did know where there were more women and children, whether they're being held by Hamas by other groups or gangs or families across the Gaza Strip, but that they would probably be able to come up with another group of 10. So that's what we're waiting to see if that would happen today. And there was a reason to think that that could happen. But at the same time, Laura, that Hamas was getting very close to the end of what we believe they had in terms of women and children. And then they were going to start probably negotiating for men and Israeli soldiers, at which point it was going to get a lot more complicated. And there was a belief that Hamas might start asking for a higher price. Laura?",

And most likely, we will see, in the next few hours, the IDF resuming its ground operation in northern Gaza in one or two neighborhoods that it still as it operated in, and in the next few days, maybe to southern Gaza.

Therefore, we're back into a combat mode in order to eliminate Hamas, which it just shows even after days of truce, days where we were able to get these hostages, some of them back home, 140 of them are still stuck in those godforsaken tunnels in Gaza.

What happens now with respect to the remaining hostages?[00:25:03] SPIELMAN: Listen, the Israeli people are deeply concerned about our hostages. I mean it's -- imagine instead of dropping your kids off at your, you know, your parent's house, you drop them off at Hamas's house. And Hamas is holding a 10-month-old baby, a four-year-old child, men and women, we don't know if they're alive or dead. I mean, these are the people that are holding the children. We have a lot more information that we have today than we have in October 7th. We've been hearing these reports coming out of Gaza, horrific reports from the people have come home. Children, they say, as Hamas put these, each of the children on a motorcycle to bring them to Gaza, they press their legs against the exhaust pipe of the motorcycle, to sear their legs with a burn mark so that if they tried to run away in Gaza, they could quickly identify them. This is the monstrosity of what Hamas is doing is exactly what we've been saying like ISIS, we're deeply concerned. However, what I can tell you is we never would have reached the hostage deal that we reached, most recently, if we had not operationally pressed them militarily on the battlefield. Like President Biden said, Hamas could give a damn about these people. They will only respond to pressure.

Everybody reports to them, they are the governing body of the Gaza Strip.Let's not forget, all of those billions of dollars of international aid money that came in to the Gaza Strip, the small amount that was not stolen by the heads of Hamas, were distributed by Hamas, everybody looks to them for responsibility. If they decide that they want to have a truce, as we've seen, they decide all of a sudden there's a truce. If they want to break a truce, it's their call. The attack on October 7th was taken thousands of people took part. But all the calls were Hamas. And so this differentiation of the terror groups does not affect the bottom line.

Hamas right now are going underneath schools, underneath mosques, inside of hospitals and get into rocket launchers ready.

But the Israelis have an obligation to defend their population and to make sure that Hamas can't conduct this type of attack again.Now, as the Colonel just mentioned, they're going to start in the north and try to finish up the clearance operations inside Gaza City and then move towards Central Gaza in finding the South. Where it's going to complicate it here is that of a population of 2.2 million, you know, 1.1 million north of Wadi Gaza were sent south where they were told that that was where they needed to be to, you know, remove themselves in the battlefield. They're not going to be allowed to go back north according to the IDF. So they're still going to be in the battlefield, it swelled to twice the normal number of folks. And the IDF has said that they have declared, you know, certain areas in the South will be humanitarian zones where there won't be military action. But people are going to have to try to get there. There's a lot of people that have to move around. So I think it's going to limit the ability to use airpower to a certain extent, and it's definitely going to raise the, you know, the risk to the idea of troops on the ground. So we may see some difficult fighting yet, you know, possibly more difficult than we've seen so far in the north.",
