Before Donald Trump is even sworn in Republicans find themselves up against the clock when it comes to passing the president-elect's ambitious agenda. No American president since Jimmy Carter has maintained control of both houses of Congress through a midterm election. If that trend continues the window of opportunity for Republicans shrinks to less than two years. That's something that President Barack Obama was keenly aware of back in 2010. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Of course, we all remember the Tea Party wave that overtook the country in 2010.Our next guest, CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, says the tight timeframe Republicans face feed the widening divide between the two parties, and he writes this. \"The shorter shelf life of unified government in modern time has almost without notice shaped behavior in both the White House and Congress -- subtly discouraging bipartisan compromise and pushing the majority party to stuff the top priorities of each incoming president into one massive legislative package, as Republicans are poised to attempt again this year.\" And Ron Brownstein joins us now. Ron, good morning to you. A fascinating piece as always. You know, you're underscoring -- I mean, this was a reality for me covering Congress in recent decades. It was these big packages where anything was actually going to happen at all basically. And it seems like the Trump team knows that. RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, SENIOR EDITOR, THE ATLANTIC (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. You know, this is one of those trends, Kasie -- and there are many -- in which our modern politics is really different from what has been the case for most of American history. But it's so much a part of experience -- our experience we don't even really notice it or comment on it. But the fact is that every president who has gone into a midterm with unified control of government since Jimmy Carter has lost it. Biden in '22, Trump in '18, Obama in '10, George W. Bush in '06, Bill Clinton in 1994. That is the longest streak in American history of presidents who had -- who had unified control going into a midterm and then saw voters revoke it. We've had streaks of four before in the 19th century, but we're at five. And with Republicans clinging to a 220-seat majority in the House it would not surprise anyone I think if we get to six in 2026. And what that means is, as you noted, there is a very tight timeframe for Republicans to pass their legislative agenda, which centers on extending the Trump tax cut at a cost of at least $4 trillion, plus his new additions over the next decade. And when you have that kind of tight timeframe, and you are looking at using the reconciliation tool as kind of an omnibus attempt to pass as much of your agenda as you can you don't have a lot of incentive to work with the other party. And the other party doesn't have as much incentive to work with you as they used to because they are fairly confident, rightly or not, that in two years the wheel is going to spin and they're going to be back in control. So it's a very different world even though it has kind of happened without us really taking notice of it.",

He was someone who bridged a lot of the social divides that had opened during the 1960s -- you know, a military veteran, a part of the Vietnam draft resisters, evangelical Christian who welcomed and celebrated rock and rollers.And so that was all kind of a unifying theme. But as president he presided over and really accelerated the dissolution of the traditional new deal Democratic coalition. I mean, he was kind of the last hope of Democrats of holding white southerners -- conservative white southerners, blue-collar northern ethnics, along with their evolving constituency. And it all kind of -- he could not manage it in office and the fissures in the Democratic coalition widened under him to the point where he was routed in 1980. After he left office though he really invented, I think, the modern role of the post-presidency. I mean, Dwight Eisenhower, and Harry Truman, and Lyndon Johnson -- they weren't citizens of the world. They kind of went home to the ranch. I think Carter created the mold that most presidents who followed him have tried to meet of looking for ways to leverage the extraordinary convening power that still adheres to an American president after he leaves office to do good following their term. And he is sort of the inventor. He was present at the creation in many ways of that kind of vision of what the post-presidency could be.",

Special counsel Jack Smith's final report on the federal investigations into Donald Trump expected to be released in the coming days, but not unless the president -- but not if the president-elect gets his way. Trump and his attorneys now threatening legal action if Smith makes the report public.The latest court filings include a letter from Trump's former co- defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira asking Judge Aileen Cannon -- remember, she's the one in the federal documents case -- to block the release of the report because she previously ruled that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unlawful. CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson joins us now. Joey, good morning. Is there any hope for the Trump team to actually have this be blocked -- is that possible -- or do you think the public is going to get to see this? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  So everything's possible, Kasie. Good morning to you. But certainly, a report that Jack Smith worked on for a significant amount of time -- a prosecution that he worked on -- there's a public imperative to release it, at least to Congress. I think you may see its release with significant redactions, meaning things that are taken out of the report really pertaining to the co- defendants in the case, right, because Trump is not going to face prosecution. And, of course, Aileen Cannon, the judge overseeing the case, right, said hey, special counsel doesn't have authority. All the cases are dismissed. But we know that as it relates to the other co-defendants, even though Trump is not involved, right, there's an appeal to that. So if it's revived and the case moves forward and you release this information -- boy, would they be prejudice. How would they get a fair trail with all this information out there? So like everything, it will be subject to controversy and there's a major race against the clock because who controls the Justice Department now, right? Biden and Garland does. Who will control it mere weeks from now? Trump will. So it's a race against time but it's likely that we'll see it with significant redactions removed from it.",

There's a distinction between winning a monetary judgment and collecting the judgment.And so here, in order to collect the judgment, right, the plaintiffs' attorneys -- that is Ms. Freeman and her daughter -- have really looked to try to get this money. Guiliani has not been cooperative with respect to giving forward what he owes, with respect to sharing information. And so he's in contempt. He's trying to protect briefly his Florida home. If he can establish that home is a home he lives in it gets protected. If it's just another asset it doesn't.
