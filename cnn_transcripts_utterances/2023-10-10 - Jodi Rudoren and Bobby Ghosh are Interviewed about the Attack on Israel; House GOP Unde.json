Jodi, I want to start with you because we're all trying to figure out the what comes next, but it's important to also watch that and recognize what this is and why this was so different from anything I think we've seen, at least at this scale. And that drives the, what is the response going to be, and when will it happen. What's your sense? JODI RUDOREN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE FORWARD\": Well, your right, and, I mean, Nic has shown us so powerfully the brutality and the extent. And it's like nothing we've never ever seen before. I mean this was a brutal, horrific terrorist attack on mostly innocent civilians. And the scale of it is something Israel is totally unprepared for, has not seen in its history. So, we thought we understood the cycle of violence between Israel and Gaza. We've seen many rounds of things. And they were very predictable. And you would see air strikes in response to rocket fire. The scale of this attack is so beyond anything we were prepared for that it's hard to predict the response. And the hostages complicate that situation. I mean, Israel takes hostages incredibly seriously. We have seen the entire country and government mobilize to rescue one hostage and give up massive numbers of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one hostage. Now there seem to be something like 130 or 150 people inside Gaza, soldiers, women, children, families, also dead bodies that were taken back, which is very high stakes for Israel as well. So, the idea of exactly how Israel will respond is really something that is almost impossible to predict, but it will be severe and fierce.",

Resistance movements don't take children and elderly women hostage. Resistance movements don't do what we just saw in those videos.This is a terrorist group. This is much closer in the spectrum to ISIS than to any resistance movement. And now that mask has fallen. So, Hamas might think at the moment that they've delivered this huge blow to Israel. And of course they have. This is the single -- as we've just heard -- that Israel has not received a blow of this gravity perhaps in its entire history. But at the very moment it was delivering this blow, Hamas was also essentially revealing itself to any remaining people who think that Hamas is a resistance group, that's no longer sustainable.",

Those are two issues that are important to many Republicans and Democrats. But the Ukraine piece of that has been problematic for some hardliners. I was asking members last night, Republicans, if they would agree to tie those things together. And even people who supported Israel funding and Ukraine funding, like Representative Mario Diaz-Balart told me last night, he has concerns about potentially attaching those two things, saying that they should be separate votes.

They said, \"the voluntary interview\" - voluntary - \"was conducted at the White House over two days, Sunday and Monday, and concluded Monday. As we have said from the beginning, the president and White House are cooperating with this investigation.\" And if you recall, back when this started about a year ago, it was against the backdrop of other investigations around the handling of classified records specifically with Donald Trump and Mar-a-Lago, which did result in charges against the former president, Trump. That is a different situation as far as the investigation and as far as the response, what we know of, than what happened with Trump, because the White House appears to have given these documents back willingly and now having Biden sit for an interview quite possibly signals potentially the end of the investigation, or at least a very thorough review that's been done so far.",
