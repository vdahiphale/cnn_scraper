So another terrifying night and this third night also distinguished by the high number of injuries that we're getting. So far two officially reported in Odessa. But we've just seen this video posted by the mayor of Odessa in a nursery, a children's nursery, where he says one person was seriously injured and taken to hospital. They're looking for someone else under the rubble. He says there's also a kindergarten nearby. So he's clearly very upset by what went on there. We're also hearing in Mikhailov to the east of Odessa along the Black Sea coast. So far the injury count there is 19, people of which five were children, two very small children, including one under one.

Definitely one of the terms of that deal was that Russia was actually not supposed to attack port infrastructure so clearly this is sending a very clear message. We know that now supplies are something that we have to worry about and so are prices, wheat and corn prices on the rise again this morning after soaring on Wednesday wheat was up, you can see it's up now about 1.6 percent, corn also over 1 percent but it was up wheat in particular 9 percent on Wednesday.

LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Attorneys for former President Trump have been caught off guard by this target letter indicating that he will likely be indicted. For nearly a year, the former president's attorneys have insisted that their client would not be charged in the investigation into January 6. But, this letter indicates that the special counsel is contemplating a case that's much bigger than even Trump's lawyers could have imagined. So sources tell CNN that they're now going around trying to figure out if the special counsel has additional witnesses or evidence that they are not aware of. Now, Trump's legal team, they are pretty well connected in terms of this investigation. A Trump-linked political action committee underwrites the cause for defense attorneys for several key witnesses. And that's one of the ways that Trump lawyers really stay in the know about what's going on. It's making it all the more significant that they were really caught off guard by this news. If the former president is charged in Washington, D.C., we can expect that the strategy will be to delay. I was in court in Florida Tuesday with the former president's lawyers even referenced the possibility of charges in the January six investigation as they laid out for the judge just how much work they're currently having to do to keep up with all these various legal cases. Now, they were making that argument in an effort to try to delay any trial in Florida until after the 2024 election. It's unclear if they will be successful, but we would expect that they would employ a similar strategy if, if the former president is charged in Washington D.C. in connection with January 6th.

      "sentences": "Absolutely, it's true. Barbie Nadeau, joining us live from Rome, many thanks.A German company is hoping its new technology will help cut down on wildfires. Sensors acting as electronic noses can detect fires while they're still smoldering. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over): Fires are raging across the world. In Greece, Switzerland, Canada and California. Whether they are caused by extreme heat, lightning or human activity, wildfires spread quickly because they're usually detected too late. One company based in Germany is working to close this gap using a sensor that they say can detect wildfires ultra early. JURGEN MULLER, CO-FOUNDER, DRYAD NETWORKS (through translator): This means that we can detect an emerging fire in just a few minutes, 10 or 15 minutes, before there is an open fire. This means we can fight it quickly and thus significantly reduce the damage compared to optical systems. VAN DAM (voice-over): For this 69 year old forestry expert, the forest is his workshop. He makes fires using pine branches and trains the green and black sensor device to distinguish between different types of smoke and gasses. MULLER (through translator): We are here in our laboratory teaching the sensor to use artificial intelligence for different forest fires. This sensor is the electronic nose. They now sniff out the smell of smoke coming from a pine or beach forest, and artificial intelligence maps this pattern, this ecosystem. We also look at how sensitive the detectors are to light smoke and rising smoke so that we can reach our objective of detecting a fire in a few minutes. VAN DAM (voice-over): Brandenburg is the German region most affected by wildfires. The man responsible for fighting them attests to the value of the dryad system. RAIMUND ENGEL, BRANDENBURG FIRE PROTECTION OFFICER (through translator): In recent years we have been able to significantly reduce the size of the average fire area because the system of early detection of forest fires means we can detect many of the fires early enough that major damage can be prevented. VAN DAM (voice-over): The dryad sensors rotate 360 degrees and promise greater fire monitoring than the human eye can achieve. Though A.I. fire detection is not new, Dryad says 10 countries are experimenting with their sensors, including the U.S., Greece and Spain. The company hopes to reduce forest fires by deploying 120 million sensors around the world by 2030, saving lives and property. Derek Van Dam, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, a new batch of budding entrepreneurs have more freedom to go into business for themselves, but no place to learn the ABCs of business.As Patrick Oppmann reports, they're now getting a crash course courtesy of the U.S. government. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A business seminar in a hotel meeting room may not seem that groundbreaking, but not long ago in Cuba where all capitalism used to be outlawed, it would have been impossible to imagine. All the more so since the man teaching this business boot camp organized by the U.S. Embassy in Havana is Cuban-American development expert Gustavo Arnavat, who left the island as a young boy to flee Fidel Castro's revolution. He's been invited by the U.S. government to share his knowledge with Cuba's trailblazing entrepreneurs.",

Every entrepreneur is going to have good days and bad days. Some bad days are going to be extremely challenging. They're probably going to want to give up. I can't know different than any other country, but here it's particularly difficult.OPPMANN (voice-over): Particularly difficult because for decades following the 1959 revolution, all private enterprise was banned in Cuba. Cubans were required to work for the state. Then following the collapse of the Soviet Union, official prohibitions on self-employment slowly began to ease. (on-camera): The first entrepreneurs in a generation here face a unique problem. There are no business schools, scarce knowledge that can be passed down about self-employment. Cuba's budding capitalists have had to learn by doing. (voice-over): Juan Carlos Blaine has turned a side business selling hamburgers into a restaurant franchise, a small supermarket and a logistics company. Altogether, he says, employees more than 60 people. Attending the business boot camp, he says, helped him to identify areas of future growth. We've done courses on e-commerce, marketing, risk capital, private financing, he says. They're very current things, very modern, and things that we can use a lot. Even though the U.S. government says it wants to help Cuban entrepreneurs, U.S. economic sanctions intended to impact the Cuban government also hurt business people here, making it all but impossible for them to access the U.S. banking system or receive financing. The U.S.'s top diplomat in Havana says the Biden administration is studying if sanctions can be eased for Cuban entrepreneurs. BENJAMIN ZIFF, CHARGE D' AFFAIRES, U.S. EMBASSY IN HAVANA: Only there's a shortage of food, there's a shortage of gas, there's a shortage of water. The Cuban state economy is no longer able to provide for its people. And the answer to that is not a necessary evil private sector, it is more better, more empowered private sector. OPPMANN (voice-over): So far the U.S. Embassy in Havana says about 200 entrepreneurs have taken this boot camp. And the hope is that they can move beyond the decades of hostility between the U.S. and Cuba to not only transform their lives, but their country. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
