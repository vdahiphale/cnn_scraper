The Police Department also revealed that a total of seven officers were relieved of duty, the day after the incident. Five, as you know, have also been fired, and charged with second-degree murder. Mr. Nichols' funeral is on Wednesday. We'll talk in a moment about how this latest incident has become a national conversation, and not just a local story, certainly. First though, CNN's Nick Valencia brings us up to date. So, what more are we learning about the three members, of the Fire Department, who were fired?",

They were put on administrative leave. A third was a driver, of the fire engine that showed up, at the scene, but reportedly did not get out of the engine.And according to the Fire Department's investigation, these individuals were initially told that they were responding to an individual, who had been pepper-sprayed. We know after watching the video that it was much, much worse than that. But, according to their investigation, they found that these individuals did not give adequate patient assessment, of Tyre Nichols, and that their actions do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department. So, they were terminated, as a result. Anderson? COOPER: Two other members, of the Police Department had been, relieved of duty, according to the authorities. Is it clear to you what \"Relieved of duty\" actually means? I mean, it's expected they will also be charged? I've talked to the District Attorney, who obviously said, you know, wouldn't say, because it's an ongoing investigation.",

The second officer though, was identified as Officer Preston Hemphill, who has been with the Memphis Police Department, since 2018. And we confirm that one of the videos that we saw last week, released by the City of Memphis, was his body camera. Now, in this video that we're about to show you, which we should warn you, is graphic, you could hear Officer Hemphill deploy his Taser, and then say -- you know, remember, Tyre Nichols ran away from the first incident, with the officers.

We are still seeing some sporadic demonstrations taking place, mostly, in parts of the country that are home to the country's Sunni minority. Even tonight, we're getting reports of some protests, in the Kurdistan region. But, in other parts of the country, the protest movement has really been pushed underground. And people would tell you it's because of several factors, the weather being one. It's snowing. It's freezing. You've also got air pollution that has shut down several cities. But also, the Regime's ruthless response, to these demonstrations that brutal crackdown has had a chilling effect. You've got thousands, who've been arrested, hundreds, who've been killed, including many children. At least four protesters have been executed, many others facing the death penalty, after what rights groups say, are these fast-tracked sham trials. That has had a chilling effect. But protesters, in Iran, we have spoken to, say this is not over. They say it's far from over. They're saying this is a pause. The grievances are still there, they say, the anger has increased, and it's a matter of time before these countrywide protests resume, they say.

It's called \"Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away with It.\" And includes revelations about sleazy figures, like Jeffrey Epstein, and Harvey Weinstein, and how others, like them, have successfully eluded justice, for decades, how is that possible? Elie Honig, CNN Senior Legal Analyst, joins us now. He's also a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, with the Southern District of New York. I don't know if you timed this book release, to this news, about Stormy Daniels. In New York, the District Attorney's office has started presenting evidence to a grand jury on it. You, in the book, have a bizarre -- behind-the-scenes look, at how the Justice Department chose not to charge the former President. ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"UNTOUCHABLE\": Yes, purely coincidental, a happy coincidence. So, we're learning today that the Manhattan D.A., which is a state- level prosecutor, is presenting evidence, to a grand jury, about that hush-money scheme. Turns out, and I have the reporting on this, two years ago, we're learning for the first time, the Feds, right across the street, my former office, the Southern District of New York, considered whether to charge the same conduct, federally. And what's interesting, and I get behind-the-scenes, I get perspectives, from all the different players, here, is they decided not to charge Donald Trump, on the hush-money scheme. But it's important to understand why they chose not to. It was not because of the evidence. Prosecutors actually felt they had sufficient evidence, to charge Donald Trump. Opinions varied a bit. Some felt it was close to the line, But enough. Others felt it was a strong case. But ultimately, the reason they held off was partially political considerations, which I detail in the book. And also because, the Southern District, and this is in 2021, early, when Donald Trump was getting ready to leave office, believed that someone else is going to charge him, for something bigger, whether it's January 6, which had just happened, or the Ukraine scandal, or the Mueller obstruction. And so, as a result we really had this, I believe, unjust result, where the only person, who's ever been charged for this, is Michael Cohen, who essentially was just a pass-through, for these checks. So, we'll see if that changes, now.",

But I actually think that's not quite true. And I say this firsthand. There are special provisions that apply to powerful people. For example, the Justice Manual, the guide that applies to all federal prosecutors, in the country, says that if you have a powerful politician, or somebody, who's likely to get media coverage, the case has to go up for higher and higher levels of review. And I give some examples in this book, where if it was an ordinary person, a line prosecutor, like I was, could have signed off. But because they involve powerful people, I had to go higher, higher up the chain, get more and more rigorous review. So, the fact of the matter is that favors more powerful people.",
