President Biden announced today that an unknown number of Americans are missing, tonight, and it is likely that they are among those hostages, who have been taken, into Gaza. At least 11 Americans are among the more than 900 people killed, so far, in Israel. And we should note, we will hear from President Biden, tomorrow, on these attacks. Israel has pummeled at least 130 targets in Gaza, with what Prime Minister, Netanyahu, says is a force, and I'm quoting him now, \"Like never before.\" He also warned that this is just the beginning.

Once dawn here, 6:30 AM, it'll be 72 hours, since this terror attack, along multiple fronts began. And it is still a very chaotic situation. I just spoke to a spokesperson, for the Israeli Defense Forces, who said there are still Hamas militants, attempting to breach the border, attempting to make suicide attacks, that there are still firefights, kinetic activity, between -- from Hamas gunmen, on the ground, in Israel territory, with Israeli forces. He believes many of them were just sort of left behind, either intentionally or just separated, weren't able to get back into Gaza, and are now making sort of last stands, trying to kill as many people as they can. So, it is still a very kinetic situation. And it is not all along the border with Gaza. And I'm just hearing more explosions off in the distance, now. There's a lot of unknowns. And there's, you know, the big question, of course, is what happens next? We've obviously seen large movements of troops of supplies. They're trying to shore up much of the border, which was breached, in multiple locations. But there's certainly a lot of work to be done, just in terms of getting forces, to the places that Israeli authorities want them, and then making the decision about what how to proceed from here.",

They surround their weapons, with children, with the civilian population. They store the weapons underneath hospitals, or schools. So, we have no other choice.

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, we're still learning the extent of this horror, trying to understand how many Americans are amongst those being held hostage. I mean, this is absolutely unconscionable, the idea that Hamas is using these hostages, threatening to execute them, should Israel go about the work, of trying to hold those responsible, for these killings, accountable. But we have the best in the business, in the United States, at locating hostages, and trying to extricate them, from captivity. And so, to the extent the job can be done, the United States and Israel working together, we'll have the top people on the job. But this is a massive undertaking, because we're just trying to get a handle on how many have been taken captive, where they are. And then, once you do that, you can assess whether there is any attempt to extricate them.",

They were going to save their son, Amir, their daughter-in- law, Miri, and their two young granddaughters. All of this was happening, as they were making their way, to this small village, where they lived, not far from the Gaza Strip. As Amir and his family were hiding, silently, in their safe room, under instruction, from his father that went on for nearly 10 hours. They had no food, no electricity, no cell service. Outside, the terrifying sound of Hamas gunfire drew closer. Amir, initially said, when they woke up that morning, after the Jewish holiday that they thought, when they heard those rockets, it was something that happens, unfortunately, regularly in Israel, just rocket fire. They went into the safe room. And that is where they were hiding, with their two young children, when they realized, it was something else, when they heard the gunfire, and realized that a terror attack was happening in their neighborhood. He said that this is what his father did, after those nine and a half hours, where they sat silently in that room. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMIR TIBON, HAARETZ'S DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: They joined the group of soldiers, who were planning to begin the process, of going from house to house. In this community, we are a community of about 500 to 600 people. From house to house, look for the terrorists, kill them and free the people. And they did this methodically. They went through dozens of houses. We were not aware that this was happening, because by that one we had lost all cellphone reception. But we heard the gunfire. We realized that they were exchanges of fire between two sides. And that's when I told my two young daughters, who were beginning to lose patience. They were real heroes. But they were beginning to patience, after nine-and-a-half hours. I told them, \"Grandfather is coming. Stay silent. Stay quiet. And Grandfather is coming.\" And that's sort of another hour of these battles, from home to home that the soldiers engaged in. We heard a large bang, on the window, of the safe room, and the voice of my father. And my older daughter, she's three-and-a-half-years-old, she said Saba Hagia (ph), \"Grandfather is here.\" And that's when we started crying, for the first time, after 10 hours, in this situation.
