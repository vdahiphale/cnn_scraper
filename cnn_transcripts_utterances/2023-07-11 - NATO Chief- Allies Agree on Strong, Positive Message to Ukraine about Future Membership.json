      "sentences": "As a full member of the alliance based on the agreement reached last night with President Erdogan and thePrime Minister. We also addressed Ukraine. Since we last met an Erdogan at our Madrid Summit, NATO allies have delivered unprecedented support to Ukraine with more ammunition, more modern equipment and more training to the Ukrainian forces. Today, allies have agreed the package of three elements to bring Ukraine closer to NATO. First, a new multiyear assistance program for Ukraine to enable the transition from Soviet era to NATO standard training and doctrines to help rebuild the Ukraine security and defense sector and to cover critical needs like fuel the mining equipment and medical supplies. Second a new NATO Ukraine Council a forum for crisis consultations and decision making where we will meet as equals. And I look forward to having the inaugural meeting of the Council tomorrow with President Zelenskyy. Third, we reaffirmed that Ukraine will become a member of NATO and agreed to remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan. This will change Ukraine's membership path from a two-step process to a one step process. We also made clear that we will issue an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO when allies agree and conditions are met. This is a strong package for Ukraine, and a clear path towards its membership in NATO. Allies have also proved the most comprehensive defense plan since the end of the Cold War. These are designed to counter the two main threats we face, Russia and terrorism. Under our new plans, NATO aims to have 300,000 troops at high readiness, including substantial air and naval power. Robust deterrence and defense requires a robust industrial base, so leaders endorsed the new defense production action plan. This will accelerate joint procurement, boost interoperability, and generate investment and production capacity. To do all this, we need to invest more in defense. Our latest estimate shows that the defense expenditure by European allies and Canada will increase by 8.3 percent in 2023; this is the biggest increase in decades. Since 2014, they will have invested an extra $450 billion in defense. 11 allies now reach or exceed the 2 percent benchmark. And we expect this number will rise substantially next year. Today allies made an enduring commitment to invest at least 2 percent of gross domestic product annually in defense and to do more urgently to meet their commitments. NATO Leaders also addressed China, China is not our adversary and we should continue to engage. But Beijing's increasing assertiveness affects our security. China is increasingly challenging the rules based international order, refusing to condemn Russia's war against Ukraine, threatening Taiwan and carrying out substantial military buildup. China's nuclear modernization is unprecedented in speed and scale and being carried out with no transparency. Allies agreed to continue working together to protect against China's coercive behavior. And tomorrow we will meet the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea as well as the European Union because we are stronger and safer when we stand together and with that I'm ready to take a few questions?",

And this includes this package of practical support to enable full interoperability between Ukrainian armed forces and NATO forces. The establishment on the NATO Ukraine Council, and then the decision to remove the requirement for Membership Action Plan, which actually means that instead of two steps to become a member, there will be one step. And we also made it clear that the invitation will be issued when conditions are met. Then I would like to add that on top of that, of course, allies are also providing substantial military support, because the most urgent task now is to ensure that Ukraine prevails, because unless Ukraine prevails there is no membership issue to be discussed at all. And therefore I welcome the military support our allies have provided now for months, actually starting back in 2014 and then, since the full-fledged nation in February last year, substantially stepping up the support. And just over the last few days, allies have made substantial new announcements. France has announced that they will deliver long range cruise missiles. Germany just announced a new package with air defense and armored vehicles. And the U.S. made yet another big announcement of more military support. And many other allies have made different types of support, including the establishment or coalition to provide training for F-16 fighter jets. So put together this is a strong message, which sends a positive and united message to Kyiv.",

So that's a practical way of moving them and moving Ukraine closer to NATO. Then we also send a strong political message with the language on a membership, including the language, which is now in the communique on invitation. So there has never been a stronger message from NATO at any time, both when it comes to the political message on the path forward for membership, and the concrete support from NATO allies military support, but also the practical support on how to ensure full interoperability.

This is historic, it's important for the whole alliance. It's important for Finland is important for Sweden, but this also in particular important for the Baltic region. Because when you look at the map, you realize that for instance, this the ability to reinforce the Baltic region is very much improved by the fact that you now Finland and soon Sweden also as full members, and that will be reflected in our defense plans and our exercises in our KPT targets and everything else, we do ask the alliance. So it makes the whole alliance stronger. And it makes especially the Baltic region safer. It sends the message that NATO store is open, it sends the message that is for NATO allies to decide on the lodgment not for Moscow, to deny sovereign nations the sovereign right to choose their own path.

We know that Ukraine wants timelines and a lot more, but Jen Stoltenberg saying, this is the plan.

And I think it was interesting to see our NATO allies got together to think about this plan. I mean, the key message here is that Ukraine will join NATO, but conditions have to be made. Salma, the other big piece of news coming through from Jens Stoltenberg and perhaps it was something that we could have anticipated that defense spending needs to be ramped up. And significantly, so for the year 2023, he says it'll increase by 8.3 percent. And that means more contributions by allies in terms of what they contribute per percentage of GDP that is going to be significant to ramp up production.

Right now, I want to bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand, CNN's International Diplomatic Editor as well, Nic Robertson, who is in London for us. It is quite a show of force; I have to say in terms of what we've seen from President Zelenskyy. He did say he doesn't want to go to NATO summit just to have fun.

Ukraine, NATO#33, meaning Ukraine should be the 33rd member of NATO. There's nothing subtle about that messaging, and nothing really particularly subtle in what President Zelenskyy has been saying. For him it's desperately important. I think Zelenskyy's message is one that's always been way ahead of NATO's comfort zone, whether it's on tanks, fighter aircraft surface to air missiles, air defense systems, even sort of bullets and anti-tank weapons at the beginning, which sort of flooded in at the last minute when the war was sort of just almost underway. And it's been that way since then. I think Zelenskyy seems ahead of the NATO curve again here. Yet he likes to drive the narrative. And he wants to drive that narrative, not just to discussion about a path, discussion about an initiative, discussion about an invitation to join, he wants that concrete, you're going to join. This is precisely how, and this is what the timeline looks like one door closes the war. Another one opens NATO membership and this emotional, emotional, sort of reach out to the crowd here to remind them. And this is where the strength of support and the level of understanding for Ukraine and Zelenskyy is strongest in the Baltic States, who were Soviet satellites who did have to suffer Soviet aggression. Who did understand what it was like to have an underground battle fought in the woods to try to hold off the Soviets have to succumb to their Crushing Blows? And to be live in fear because they're small nations close to Russia, live in fear of what may come over that border. And that was the emotional outreach of Zelenskyy's speech there. The Ukrainians will be at your side, will never let Russians come into, into Vilnius. We will fight the war in Bakhmut. Look at this hold a bullet written flag from Bakhmut, the epicenter of our war is sort of what he's saying. That's a symbol that's testimony to how we'll fight for you the Lithuanians very, very emotional. And that's really characteristic of Zelenskyy's what you could call in basketball terms, a full court press to try to get what he wants and really seeming from what we could hear there taking the crowd with him. They buy into this, but it's those other NATO nations that haven't lived so close and with that recent historic memory of Russia and the Soviet Union that are harder to persuade. But this is Zelenskyy's method, just battle on from the front and make a strong message.",
