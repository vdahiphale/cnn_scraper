This notion that she may be the best one to confront President Biden in a general election.But context is really key here. She still lags far behind Trump in support among Republican voters, well behind DeSantis as well in many polls. But her messaging has been consistent. She has long argued that there is a need for a new generation of leadership. That it is time for folks to pass the baton here. And she's been out for months sounding this alarm. She was the first person, of course, to announce her candidacy after Trump. She maintains a majority of Americans don't want to see this rematch between Trump and Biden. And, Poppy, something that I've heard in recent days that has caught my ear, she's doubled down on her hawkish foreign policy position. She's called China the enemy in that interview with our colleague, Jake Tapper. I'm curious to see if that resonates with primary voters since we've seen a growing number of conservative voters really favor a more isolationist view.",

Kenny, thank you for joining us. I want to start with, you know, the suspension yesterday came in the wake of your reporting. What's your sense of why nothing happened to Mel Tucker, the head coach, before this became public, because of your work? KENNY JACOBY, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"USA TODAY\": Yes, these are very complicated situations. This case has been going on for about nine months now. And the university did face a lot of criticism yesterday for its decision to suspend Mel Tucker only after the allegations became public. However, you know, it is complicated. If the school were to have suspended him at the onset of the investigation, they do risk potentially drawing attention to the case, which is not always what victims in these sorts of cases want.",

John, as we watch all this play out and you think of what a poignant and formative moment, not just this today, but also 22 years ago, in so many people's lives, despite the fact it's more than two decades ago, it was also extraordinarily -- it changed the face of counterterrorism.

He predicted a black day for America after which the states would no longer be united. He said we would understand the meaning of this when we were bringing the bodies in boxes and coffins in our shameful defeat. So, that was the thing that led up to what we call the intelligence failure of 9/11. We needed to see that coming.Since then you've seen the formulation, as the secretary told you earlier today, of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the change in the culture of the FBI to not just figure out who did it, but make sure it didn't happen in the first place. A tremendous challenge. So, it's changed markedly. Our big risk is to not fall back to where we were before because that failure would be bureaucratic in form, but human in nature, when people just start to compete, collaborate less, you know, seed credit, allow the dots not to get connected because they're keeping them from each other.
