They were previously successful blocking a similar action that was issued by former President Trump.Our panel's here: Molly Ball, senior political correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal\"; CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams, former federal prosecutor; and Patti Solis Doyle. She's former presidential campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. And Matt Gorman, former senior adviser to Tim Scott's presidential campaign. Welcome all. Thank you so much for being here this morning. Molly Ball, big picture, the president is doing this precisely because he wants these headlines for political reasons. The border is shut. It is closed, but obviously, this is something that Republicans still feel like they have high -- higher ground on. How does this ultimately work for the president or not? MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": You know, the Democratic sources I talked to don't expect the president to actually win on this issue. But the idea is that something is better than nothing. They'd rather have something to point to to say he's doing something. Then to have to sort of continue to ignore it or blame it on Republicans. In our own \"Wall Street Journal\" polling, we've asked people what do you believe is a better explanation for what's going on in the border, is it, you know, that -- that the president, you know, undid a bunch of Trump's executive actions and has allowed it to get out of control? Or is it that Republicans, you know, refuse to go along with these negotiated bipartisan border bill? And the majority of people said the former. The majority of people blame the president for what's happening. Don't blame Republicans for not having come to the table or from having walked away from the table on the border. And that had been the argument before up to now. I think you do hear some Democrats and some on the left saying, how does the president draw a distinction between him and Trump if he's doing essentially the same things? And some of the progressives who are criticizing him, not just on the policy that they don't like, but politically, are saying this now makes it harder for him to make that case. Since, you know, Trump's platform on immigration is such a central part of his campaign and was so contentious while he was president.",

And Congress can't seem to get their act together with passing legislation. What ends up happening then is that presidents -- Trump did it. Biden did it. Trump did it for different reasons. Biden did it. Used these executive actions to try to patch the holes. And that's why the ACLU was suing.

Trump said too bad, you're going to have to wait until after the election. So I -- I really honestly don't think Biden had the choice. As Elliot said, this is really complicated and really difficult to wrangle. Presidents on both sides of the aisle for decades have tried to put together a comprehensive immigration reform and have failed miserably. And -- because it's complicated. It's got security implications, got economic implications, and myself included, really high emotional implications as a daughter of Mexican immigrants. I don't think Biden had a choice.

And look, I think the Biden administration sees that they need to do something on this. They needed to answer these charges. Right? And it shows also the politics have shifted, right? Day one, you saw Biden reverse the emergency declaration that Trump had in office. Also, Title 42. Now he's -- you're starting to see a veering in the other direction, because look, we talk about abortion, I think rightly so. It's one of those animating issues of single issue voters.

She accused him, after a night of interrogation by the Italian police, of the murder of Meredith Kercher. And it turns out that, basically, she said today, very emotional in court, speaking in fluent Italian, which she learned during four years in an Italian prison, that she was young. She was stressed. She'd lost her accommodations because that's where the murder took place, and that she basically made two statements to the Italian police in the absence of a lawyer or a proper translator that Patrick Lumumba had killed Meredith Kercher. The court today upheld that conviction. However, she's already served four years in prison waiting for the trial and the verdict, going back to 2009.
