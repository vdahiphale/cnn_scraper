Well, one day in and it's been a rapturous reception for VP candidate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz or Coach Walz as running mate Kamala Harris is now referring to him. Today, they're stomping out in Michigan after an enthusiastic -- in Wisconsin after an enthusiastic debut in Philadelphia. Kamala Harris using the packed house to rafters rally really to introduce Tim Walz to a nation that doesn't really know him that well. And speaking to the crowd, Walz tried to hammer home his Minnesota values. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Minnesota strengths comes from our values, our commitment to working together. To seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capitol. And now, Vice President Harris and I are running for president to take those very values to the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, let's just get -- started by taking a minute to discuss what we saw last night, and that was really the branding of Governor Walz, somebody most Americans didn't know much of until last night, and we got a sense of his background. Grew up on a farm, as he said, went to school with most of his relatives. The town was so small. He was a high school teacher. He was a football coach. He served in the National Guard. And then, I'd like to have you listen to what Kamala Harris said about this and how she views the man she's now appointed to be her VP pick.

And as he was trying to decipher who this Trump voter is and what Trump's appeal is there is concern that some of his policies, especially as governor, are more progressive than some of those undecided voters, some of those never Trump voters that Kamala Harris is desperately trying to get to vote for her, that they're just not comfortable with that. And let me just pull up some of his policies so our viewers can get a sense of what he's been focused on as governor. The issue of abortion. He signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act in January of 2023 in terms of gender affirming care. He signed an executive order that protected health care services, universal school meals. He signed a bill into law last year on that front. For tuition, he made college tuition free for students from families earning less than $80,000. On the issue of immigration, which, as you know, is a crucial issue, one that Republicans are making their top issue this election cycle, he made undocumented immigrants eligible for Minnesota's driver's licenses. And in terms of voting rights, he restored voting rights to more than 55,000 formerly incarcerated people. As you know, Republicans are already latching onto this record.

So,obviously his voters in Minnesota, which has sometimes been referred to as the reddest blue state in America, it is a state where Republicans compete and do well statewide. In fact, before Tim, there was a Republican governor, Tim Pawlenty, who was able to run for president. And yet, with that record, Tim Walz won re-election. You mentioned on one of those issues, abortion. I think, frankly, one of the most significant issues of this campaign is going to be the abortion issue. Specifically, the fact that Donald Trump, as he brags himself, he is responsible for overturning Roe versus Wade. He is responsible for the fact that a woman's right to choose is now denied in close to half of the states in the United States of America. And if he gets in through something called the Comstock Act, he will be able to effectively end abortion or end the right to choose for a woman in the United States, whether you're in a red state or a blue state. So, I expect that actually that record will contrast quite nicely to what Donald Trump first did in office and what he's proposing to do if he were to get back there.",

The where and the how of the strike are unclear, but U.S. intelligence reports preparations are already underway. The Iranian president has said that if the west wants to prevent a war, it should force Israel to accept a ceasefire. Whether a hostage deal and avoiding a regional war are possible will also depend on hardliner Yahya Sinwar, chosen to replace the recently assassinated Ismail Haniyeh as the political head of Hamas. Let's turn to Jeremy Diamond, who joins us now from Northern Israel. Jeremy, let me first just get you to respond. What are you hearing from Israelis following this announcement that Yahya Sinwar will be replacing Haniyeh as the political chief of Hamas? What does that even mean?",

But just consider the fact that we are now more than a week removed from the assassination of Haniyeh, morethan a week removed from Iran's initial threats of carrying out some kind of retaliatory strike. And the fact that it has not happened yet could indicate a few different things. It could, first of all, indicate that Iran is having trouble getting all of its proxies in line to carry out some kind of a coordinated attack, that it is perhaps preparing for the possibility of a larger, more significant regional war, or it could also suggest that the diplomatic maneuvering that has been happening over the course of the last week maybe making some headway or that at least it is making Iran reconsider, recalculate, rethink the extent to which it wants to carry out a retaliatory strike or even just simply how significant of a strike it actually will carry out. And today, we got a couple of indications in both directions, the first of which being that the Iranian president spoke with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and told him today that if America and the west really want to prevent a regional war, that they should get Israel to stop its war in Gaza and accept a ceasefire. That suggests that a potential, I say, off ramp here for Iran to somehow claim itself as responsible for engineering a ceasefire in Gaza and perhaps then backing off of its vows to retaliate against Israel. But that's far from being a sure thing. That's purely speculative at this point. What we've also seen, though, is that Egypt has now instructed its airlines to avoid overflying the Iranian capital for several hours tomorrow morning. That's fairly unusual. We don't know exactly what is behind that. But again, it suggests that there is still a lot of tension in the air, a lot of uncertainty, and a few different paths that this region could take going forward.",

After October 7th, no gates were open to move trucks through to get food in. President Biden has gotten the Israelis to open multiple crossings. He's gotten the Israelis to accept the need for pauses, humanitarian pauses, so food can move around. He's gotten the Israelis to change their policies for accepting food into the port of Israel so that it can get down to Gaza. And if you look at the amount of aid that is getting in now compared to what was getting in some months ago, it has gone up considerably. Is it enough? It's never enough. Do all the types of aid that need to get in, medical, humanitarian, and so forth, get in? They don't. Every day we're working this problem. Every day I'm working this problem.

I made that call. We had a good, constructive conversation. And then my counterpart said, you know, this ultimately lies with the prime minister.

I've seen her incrises, including when Israel's been under attack, when U.S. service members in the Middle East have been under attack, when Russia invaded Ukraine. I've seen her counsel the president. I've seen her ask incredibly penetrating questions of our military and Intelligence Community, and I've seen her proposed strategic initiatives, especially when it comes to where we are on the diplomatic offense in the Indo-Pacific region. This has been an area she's been particularly focused on. She's traveled to the region repeatedly. She's built relationships with those leaders. And even in the case of the hostage negotiations, Vice President Harris had a critical meeting with Chancellor Scholz in Munich, Germany earlier this year to help move the ball forward. So, much like Vice President Biden was a central national security player for President Obama, Vice President Harris has been a central national security player for President Biden, and is the kind of person who now, after four years, has the experience, the depth of knowledge, the engagement, and frankly, just the good judgment to be able to handle these hard issues extremely well.",

The humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan is going from bad toworse, and there are reports of famine and bombing in the Zamzam displacement camp in North Darfur. While aid groups accuse one of the warring factions, known as the Rapid Support Forces, of withholding aid. It's just the latest tragedy as two rival generals battle for control of the country, leaving 26 million people at crisis levels of hunger. The International Criminal Court says that it's seeking arrest warrants for those perpetrating crimes in Sudan. But what is needed now the most? Joining me now on this is Will Carter, the country director there for the Norwegian Refugee Council. Will, thank you so much for joining us. You are back there in Sudan now. As we noted, the world's largest displacement crisis unfolding before our very eyes. 7 million are believed to be internally displaced. More than 2 million have fled to neighboring countries. Now, the real concern is about starvation. More than 16,000 have reportedly been killed. Talk to us about what you're seeing on the ground right now.",

And for me, each of those cities, hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing. And when I was there just a few days ago with our teams, you know, I saw people screaming out, you know, women who have had to leave cities under gunfire. Some of this wasn't even the first time that they had to be completely uprooted. Some didn't even have shoes, elderly people, pregnant woman who've been walking for days through the mud to seek safety. You know we're trying to respond in areas where it's very overcrowded at this point. It's very scarce resources to respond. So, it's really important to scale up in earlier in the years in Darfur. And you know, even then we could see the makings of this famine. You know, (INAUDIBLE) war widow, and she was trying to take care of her children. She attempted to sell everything in her house and was down to the last window pane, which she was about to sell off just to buy a few more bits of bread.

Yusra, her sister, and two others jumped out and swam, pushing the boat to safety over several hours. Well, in 2016, she was part of the inaugural Refugee Team at Rio and competed in Tokyo 2020. It's an extraordinary story that reached the big screen in the film, \"The Swimmers.\" Well, now she's back reporting on the games for Eurosport, which is owned by CNN parent company Warner Brothers Discovery. Yusra Mardini joins me now. Yusra, welcome to the program. It's so great to see you there in Paris as a reporter analyzing these games. And look how far things have come. As we noted, the inaugural Refugee Team there debuting in 2016. At the time there were 10 athletes, three different sports, including yourself. Now, there are 37 athletes, 12 different sports. Talk about what this means for you. YUSRA MARDINI, FORMER SWIMMER, REFUGEE OLYMPIC TEAM AND TWO-TIME OLYMPIAN:  This is really incredible. Thank you for having me today. I think the Refugee Olympic Team is a team that represents hope. It represents millions of refugees around the world. The numbers, unfortunately, are rising. It went -- in 2016, it was 65 million displaced people around the world. And now, today, it's 120 million displaced people around the world. 40 percent of them are children. So, it is really, really important to acknowledge that this team is so important excited to so many people around the world. And to cheer them on as our second home crowd, I mean, watching them compete is just really pure joy for me because I know and I shared a lot of their stories on Eurosport, and it's just incredible to see how resilience there.",

And some of them still don't feel home and they struggle a lot and sports can be their escape, whether that's helping with their mental health, with their trauma, with building self-esteem again. So, I think this is the simplest right, is to have access to education and sports.
