But you have to do that. The Secret Service has to determine what they did wrong, what they did right, what the local police did wrong, and what they did right.The biggest challenge in all of this is going to be, will the Secret Service and the FBI play nice together? And I'm sincerely hoping that they go with this hand in hand, because you're going to have to look at everything right down to individual agents. Mainly, I would say, the planning operation for this, and then the delegation of tasks at the site, because it seems like we have, number one, lack of communication, lack of understanding as to who was responsible for what, and then no means of how to address a threat that came up right in the middle of the whole thing.",

That prompted some widespread boos from the audience.You heard it from others talking about it, not really any, during Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, notably two critics who were quite praiseworthy of Donald Trump on stage last night. But when that mom, whose son was a veteran, brought up the district attorney in Manhattan, there were a lot of boos that you heard in the audience here. And yes, you're hearing a lot of people also, people like Vivek Ramaswamy tying Donald Trump's legal troubles to what happened to him on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, that attempted assassination. They keep using the word they without really specifying who they are talking about, but saying they're after him legally. And then they also tried to kill him. Obviously, those are unrelated circumstances. We don't know the motive of the shooter on Saturday night. He was actually a registered Republican. But it does speak to the moment that we're in, and also how all of Donald Trump's legal troubles have kind of loomed over this entire campaign, but even this convention, with that decision from Judge Cannon coming on Monday. I'll tell you in a few hours, we do plan to speak with Todd Blanche, one of Donald Trump's lead attorneys, and we'll get his reaction to Jack Smith's move here to appeal this decision by Judge Cannon and try to get it reversed.",

You see him there in the dark, his right ear still bandaged after the attempted assassination on Saturday.He's actually doing a walkthrough of the stage as we speak. We're joined now by CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins. And Kaitlan, this is obviously customary for folks that are going to be speaking during the convention to get a view of the stage, to figure out exactly where cameras are, how the podium looks, how the microphones sound.

He has a much higher level of security than anyone else who's been on that stage.We did see Senator Vance, though, yesterday, after he had been announced as the vice presidential pick, doing his walkthrough. And they left all the lights on, and the press was also allowed on the floor. Right now, that lower area, the delegation floor where you've seen everyone and all the action, they have been standing back. And so, you are seeing a different kind of walkthrough that Donald Trump is doing than any of the other speakers that we've seen, where they've turned off all the lights. He hasn't yet made it up to the lectern. We'll see if he ultimately does come out and test out the mic. And this could be part of his enhanced security that we're seeing. I'll also note, on that stage, when we take the wider shot to the right of him, that's Walt Nauta, who was his co-defendant in the classified documents case that we were just talking about that got tossed out and is no longer a threat to them right now. We'll see all the circuit court rules. But this is Donald Trump coming through, as he typically does, to really test everything and to make sure he knows where his angles are, what he's looking at, where the prompters are. But there's so much more gravity to this, Boris, because this is the first time that we are seeing Donald Trump on stage since what happened at that rally Saturday night in Butler, Pennsylvania. We have not seen him yet in this kind of a setting. He came out in public for the first time at this convention. He sat in the box that is actually right here to my right. That is the VIP box where he and other surrogates and members of his family have been sitting. But we haven't seen him on stage since that assassination attempt. And so I think just seeing that bandage on his right ear also speaks to, you know, how different things are in light of what happened on Saturday. And clearly the security measures that we are seeing being taken here as he is preparing to address this convention, not tonight. He'll be speaking tomorrow night. It'll be Senator Vance, his VP pick. That'll be the headliner this evening.",

I'm wondering what is running through your mind as you're watching someone who you opposed stand up at the podium, ready to receive the nomination of the Republican Party for presidency? ASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER REPUBLICAN 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, my first thoughts are, thank goodness he's safe and that the assassin's bullet missed him. And he's had an incredible convention. The unity, the excitement of having a hero come back after escaping that attempt on his life. And so there's a great deal of enthusiasm. My thoughts are that his tone that he wants to change will be manifested in his speech tomorrow night. The big question in J.D. Vance's introduction to the nation is, what will he be saying? And will he be an attack dog, as some VP nominees are? Or will he follow the leadership of Donald Trump in terms of toning down harsh rhetoric?",

And then a point of interest to me is, is he going to address Ukraine?You know, thus far, it's not that much been talked about. Twice that I've heard it mentioned, it's all been about withdrawing support from Ukraine. This is disconcerting to our allies, but that's a signature issue for J.D. Vance and for Donald Trump. So how is he going to address that tonight? A lot of things I'm watching, but I hope that he accentuates the opportunity. This is the first time the nation has to know J.D. Vance. He needs to make it positive. He needs to make it human. And hopefully he will.",

I think the conventional wisdom is that after something like that, we see huge support for a president or a political candidate, but there didn't seem to be a huge shift in the numbers. And in speaking to our analysts, they essentially say, well, look, the country's very divided.

She did it in a soft way, but effective in saying, we can disagree and we're going to fight those battles, but, you know, he's the nominee.

Vance later tonight. Obviously, they're both proponents of a more isolationist, less interventionist worldview for the United States, not only necessarily in Ukraine, but given recent comments from Donald Trump on Taiwan, I wanted to get your perspective on them. He essentially said that the United States' assurances of protection for Taiwan, should there be a Chinese invasion, amount to an insurance policy. And he sort of saw it as a transactional thing. I'm curious what you make of this disagreement among Republicans on the United States' place in the world and its commitments to Taiwan.",

But this is the beautiful thing about it. The Republican Party needs to have debates within itself.We can have disagreements. And that's one of the reasons that I'm engaged, is because I want America to continue to support Ukraine. I want us to value our allies and not push them out in the global arena and say, we don't want to be a partner with you anymore. America certainly is the priority, but we have to have those alliances. That's been the history of our country. And I want our goodness to be reflected. Donald Trump has a little bit different approach to that. But you've also, and I remind our European friends that, you know, we've got Congress, we've got a Senate that's very supportive of Ukraine.
