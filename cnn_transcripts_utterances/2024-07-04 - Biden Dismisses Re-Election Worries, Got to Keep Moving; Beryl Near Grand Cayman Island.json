And part of the president's focus going forward will be in taking his message directly to the American voters, sitting down for a major interview with ABC News tomorrow, as well as traveling to battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days.The president started some of that outreach to voters taping a pair of interviews with two black radio hosts that started airing this morning. And in one of those interviews that aired this morning in the Philadelphia area, the president argued that voters should look at his entire record and not just the 90 minutes on that debate stage. He also tried to speak in very stark terms about what a second Trump presidency could mean, especially when it relates to the Supreme Court.

He's had very limited media appearances. There's been not a lot of nuggets being dropped about his potential V.P. announcements, which we thought could come as soon as this week. Obviously, that's not the case anymore. And he gave his staff off for the 4th of July holiday.Look, they're happy to keep the spotlight on Joe Biden and the Democratic handwringing for as long as possible up until their convention in a week from now. And what's interesting is that this is a scenario they have somewhat predicted, if not anticipated for quite some time, for more than a year, that Donald Trump and other Republicans have been suggesting that Biden wouldn't last through this presidential cycle. Now, whether that was just rhetoric or something that they thought could actually happen, now we're nearing this moment where that is more of a possibility than perhaps ever before. And yet they're also sort of scrambling to figure out what comes next. I talked to one Republican pollster who said you'd rather go with the devil you know than the devil you don't know. But they did put out a statement yesterday for the first time, starting to attack some of the other candidates that are in consideration. They wrote, quote, Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest and not fit for the White House. Every one of them, them being the potential other considerations, has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.

I don't know how the Democratic Party can go out and say we want to grab a governor from Pennsylvania or Michigan or even California, where she's from, Gavin Newsom, and say we're going to have them jump over Kamala Harris, somebody who has run for president already, somebody who has been in the White House, and has been in situations. For all the criticisms she has taken, she clearly understands the job. I just don't understand how the Democratic Party could leapfrog her.But Jim Clyburn did something very interesting there. He's the one basically that planted the flag because there had been so much pushback about Kamala Harris from the get-go saying, could she really defeat Donald Trump? When people started to come out, there was some concern over the weekend, this past weekend, we saw Jim Clyburn come out, plant the flag, basically say, hey, we should have a primary, but I'm backing Kamala Harris, and that means the party should.",
