      "sentences": "Good to see you, Omar. Yes, we're just two hours away. And I think the Supreme Court is going to be, as you say, a little bit more split in terms of the issues than the lower courts had been. The lower courts had both looked at the arguments from former President Donald Trump, where he was asserting absolute, categorical immunity from criminal prosecution in this entire case, the four counts of election subversion brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the Department of Justice, the United States people, actually, and those lower courts just basically shut the door and said, Donald Trump cannot be shielded here.But, when the justices themselves heard oral arguments back on April 25th, Omar, they went deeper and tried to look at the kinds of actions that were at issue here and divide them between actions that might have been taken in former President Donald Trump's official capacity perhaps, and if they were taking it in his official capacity, could then he be shielded, but private acts, for example, acts that were taking more as candidate Trump would not be shielded from criminal prosecution. But, originally, Donald Trump had said that anything he did in the wake of the 2020 election results, which validly went to Joe Biden, anything he did to protest or to look at issues of fraud or the kinds of things that Jack Smith is saying amounted to conspiracy, former President Trump was saying those were all part of his official work. So, everything should be off the table. But then, during oral arguments, Omar, his lawyer conceded that maybe there were some actions that could be considered private. So, the key here, and it's going to be a tricky one, is to see, first of all, how do they rule on the basic question of whether he has immunity. And then, if there are enough unanswered questions surrounding the act, the core actions that he took in late 2020 and early 2021, does this case then have to go back for further proceedings in lower courts, and a trial, a potential trial be so far on the horizon that there is absolutely no way that Donald Trump can be put to trial for actions he took after the 2020 election before the 2024 election?",

Now, Sunday's first round dealt a major blow to President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance, which slumped to a dismal third in the polls, with just over 20 percent of the vote. The far-right party of Marine Le Pen is leading after the first round. It got more than 33 percent of the vote. The left-wing coalition, known as the New Popular Front, came second. Now, thousands of protesters gathered in Paris to show their opposition to the far-right, and the second round of voting takes place Sunday.So, I want to bring in CNN's Melissa Bell, who joins us now live from Paris. So, Melissa, a tough night for French President Emmanuel Macron. But, there is still a second round of voting to come next week. How does the strategy potentially change? What will Macron's strategy this week be?",

There are 577 seats up, and the way France's political system works is it essentially is 577 different races that are now taking place, some will take place between just two candidates, some will take place between three. It's very hard to call what the final figure will be, again, because of the nature of the political system itself. But, the projections are that whether the far-right gains the absolute majority or not, it is likely to be the dominant party in parliament, and that is a substantial political shift here in France, Omar.",

She was hoping then in 2017 that the changes in the United States meant that anything was possible here in Europe. In fact, what happened here in France was Emmanuel Macron creating eight years ago that moderate centrist party, taking power, sweeping aside the traditional left, the traditional right, and taking power, then over the course of the eight years in a presidency that has been remarkably controversial here in France.This is a President that is not well liked, the polls suggest, and a great deal of popular anger that's felt towards his policies and I think also towards his image, that, that's been portrayed by so many of the right and left parties as the President of the rich, that over the course of last few years has made its progress. I think what you're seeing now is in a country like so many others where there is inflation cost, cost of living issues, lots of popular anger that's really coalescing against the figure of the President, and therefore in favor of his most credible in terms of popular support rivals, and they are the far-right, Omar.",

      "sentences": "Well, these are the most crucial people in President Biden's orbit. They have always been quite influential in the President's decision-making when it comes to whether or not he runs for office and his reelection, and it is those same people who are encouraging him to stay in the race, offering their support, and according to Biden advisors, also keeping the conversation focused on how they can help the President and not whether he should reconsider his candidacy.But, there is no doubt that this was a weekend that was spent by top Democratic officials as well as top White House officials trying to calm nerves across the party after a lot of anxiety and concerns following the President's debate performance, including among donors who have also worried about what this means for the trajectory of the race. Now, we should also note that we're still in the early stages of this immediate fallout. President Biden himself is collecting data like through anecdotes as well as public polling. You saw the First Lady in her Vogue interview also saying that the President will continue to fight. But, there are still a lot of questions here in terms of what this does look like in the polls. It's still a little too early to tell how voters are reading the President's debate performance and how it will affect, again, the trajectory of the race, but his allies are certainly taking to the airwaves to try to calm those nerves and keep the focus on the record of the President, and drawing a stark contrast between President Biden and former President Donald Trump on that exact point. We also heard from Senator Chris Coons this morning on CNN. He is a longtime ally of President Biden. His advice to the campaign was for the President to have more unscripted moments for him to have more opportunities to meet with voters one-on-one, which is what he often sort of feeds off of and is -- in more energetic in those moments. I myself have gone to multiple rallies where you do see the President really energized and feeding off crowds when he is sort of in that space. So, that is the -- some of the advice that the campaign has been receiving. But, there is no doubt, Omar, that there -- this is a campaign that is under great scrutiny to the point in a quite remarkable moment when they shared a fundraising email polling of what alternatives would look like to President Biden against former President Donald Trump. So, that gives you a great sense of just how concerned people are and how they're trying to tamp down all of what the -- all of what they're fielding in terms of that criticism.",

Look at the intense winds, that heavy rain. Showers have already been lashing parts of Barbados this morning. We've already had gusts up to 60 miles per hour there. Winds right now are sustained, near 43 miles per hour. When you get the kind of winds the way that this cuts across with such an intense hurricane, that's where you get storm surge. We're looking at up to six to nine feet of storm surge, and three to six inches of rain. Here is that track. It maintains that Category 4 strength as it kind of skirts just south of a lot of these islands. A tropical storm watch is in effect for the Dominican Republic in Haiti, the south side there, and then it cuts across the Caribbean Sea and eventually makes it towards Mexico by the end of the week. The Yucatan Peninsula can see some wind and rain out of this. And we're talking about rapid intensification because these ocean temperatures are wildly warm. We're talking middle and upper 80s. This is more characteristic for late August and early September which is why the season so early is acting like it's at peak because its fuel ingredients is at peak and that's why it was able to intensify so quickly over the weekend. We find that that's a trend, as our oceans continue to get warmer. Omar.",

OF EUROPEAN LANG. &amp; TRANSCULTURAL STUDIES: Well, it goes all the way back to the early 1970s. This is really a kind of family business where Marine Le Pen's father founded the party back in 1972, and over the past decades, have essentially fastened on the question of national identity opposition to the European Union, and really amplified the question of immigration in French society. And I think that over the last 10 years, their effort to try and clean up their image and make themselves more electorally kind of palatable, I think, has coincided with other such developments in Europe, in the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, and so on, I think especially across the Atlantic, with what was the election of President Donald Trump. So, I think people are less concerned, less fearful of her. And what's also happened just simply in the last 10 years, really going back to when Emmanuel Macron was first elected in 2017, is that the mainstream political parties on the far-right -- sorry, on the right and the left have kind of disappeared. And you've had a range of kinds of movements in groups such as Emmanuel Macron's, the alliance on the left, then Marine Le Pen coming forward, and it's made the electoral landscape a bit more volatile. And this move away from the mainstream political parties have afforded people greater kind of chances in legislative presidential elections and so on, and she is building on that, along with her new Lieutenant Jordan Bardella.",
