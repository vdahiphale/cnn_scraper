Tonight, the 2024 ParisOlympics now officially open, an amazing ceremony happening at this hour along the River Seine. But the big event is happening against the backdrop of travel, chaos as France's high-speed rail network is paralyzed by a coordinated attack. And Israel's Prime Minister has made his way to Mar-a-Lago, meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who just attacked Kamala Harris for comments she made after their meeting with Netanyahu yesterday. Now, we do want to take you, in fact, straight to Florida where Donald Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Israel's Prime Minister at Mar-a-Lago. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu is looking to rekindle his relationship with the Republican presidential nominee as the U.S. election quickly approaches in the war in Gaza reaches a critical point. The two spoke to reporters after this war meeting. You see them beforehand along with Netanyahu's wife, Sara. The next video you'll see is dark, but their words are quite clear. Both taking a dig at Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting her remarks Thursday could hurt chances for a ceasefire deal. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, and I think that's rather remarkable. I mean, we should just say it, Paula, that, you know, visiting the opposition in a country isnot unique to Netanyahu. We just saw Viktor Orban come through the U.S., he went down to Mar-a-Lago as well. And we know that President Zelenskyy has spoken with Donald Trump as well. So, this is what other countries do. This is what the United States does. They speak with the opposition. But of course, this is extremely high- profile and it comes at a very important moment both in Israel and here in the United States because of this election. But I completely agree with you, when you -- when you look at the anticipation for this Netanyahu trip to the United States, there was a lot of concern in the Biden administration that he would take shots at the White House and be critical of them as he was back in 2015 when he spoke to Congress. That didn't really happen. It was -- he praised the Biden administration during that speech, during his meeting yesterday with President Biden, they were all smiles and complementary of each other. The only thing that you could really point to is Netanyahu saying to Congress that he wishes that the U.S. would fast-track the weapons so that they can -- you know, they can finish the job faster. But you're absolutely right that these are the most pointed comments towards the administration, and that's really because Harris decided to ratchet it up, and she -- her team will say that these are things that she's said in the past, but she's saying -- in this context, right after a meeting with Netanyahu at this moment in time when they want to get the ceasefire deal done, these were very forceful remarks. I would argue they are the most forceful remarks out of this administration since the war began. Now, we know what Netanyahu was like, he's certainly not going to take this lying down. So, he is what we're seeing here is pushing back. And I would just note finally, you know, the U.S. really wants to see this ceasefire deal accomplished, at the same time, Netanyahu in his speech, he didn't mention the words ceasefire deal. So, they're really not necessarily on the same page. And we've heard that criticism from the Israeli population and Israeli opposition leaders that Netanyahu doesn't actually want a deal. So, we'll see what happens at that meeting in the coming days, whether this actually come to fruition, whether, you know, a pause in the fighting can actually happen, those hostages get home to their families.

So much of that opening ceremony involves dancers on rooftops. So, it's going to have to be slightly amended. In terms of the security of the games, what authorities tell us is that they've heightened security along the railways to try and ensure that they keep a closer eye on what's happening along those railway tracks that were so damaged overnight here in France with all of that chaos. And into now, here at the Gare Montparnasse in Paris, some trains are beginning to come in and beginning to leave again. What we've been hearing throughout the day is that in the east where the sabotage attempts east of France, that is where the sabotage attempts were foiled, things got back on track much quicker in the rest of France, particularly in the west and the northern part of France, it's been a bit slower, but they're working. They say round the clock and trying to get the lines up and running again, clearly, very much. The question is now, who could have been responsible for this? It's not so much what the organizers of the Paris games might have done to prevent it. Because frankly, there wasn't much they could have done in terms of foreseeing this particular series of attacks. But the question of who acted the way they did and why? Clearly, these were coordinated attacks in several, different, very strategic points by people who had very good knowledge in France's railway system, who might be behind them is what we await from the investigation that's now underway, Paula.",

Venezuela is holding a presidential election this Sunday afteryears of chronic shortages and one of the worst economic crashes in modern history. Voters will choose whether to keep the current strongman leader Nicolas Maduro or one of his rivals including former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez. Now, despite the opposition building, a strong voter mobilization, questions remain about the fairness of the elections. Argentinean and Brazilian observers have canceled their travel plans to be there. Nicolas Maduro said last week that Venezuela might face a bloodbath, in his words, if he were not re-elected. The suspected Mexican drug lord known as El Mayo has pled not guilty in a U.S. federal court in El Paso, Texas. This after his stunning arrest on Thursday. El Mayo's real name is Ismael Zambada, and a U.S. official says he thought he was flying to inspect some property, instead, he landed near El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by the FBI. Now, the video of a small plane guarded by law enforcement was shot near El Paso in New Mexico. El Mayo is the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel. He's less flashy than his former colleague Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. But he's been evading authorities for decades, allegedly funneling huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to U.S. streets. He's also accused of multiple murders, also arrested on Thursday, was walking with Guzman Lopez; the son of El Capo(ph) -- El Chapo, pardon me. The operation conducted without involvement from the Mexican government, apparently, and it exploited what we know to be a rift within the Sinaloa cartel with El Chapo's son reportedly helping U.S. authorities capture El Mayo. This case will be felt on both sides of the border. Mexico's President says the arrests are, in his words, progress, but he also wants answers as to why he was kept in the dark. We want to bring in our correspondent, Polo Sandoval. We're just beginning to learn details of this, but can you give us some perspective, how significant are these arrests? And how disruptive could they be in these drug cartels?",

It's certainly would not be surprising, but it is not. And I need to be clear, not something that the Department of Justice has confirmed yet, but it certainly wouldn't be surprising given what we have seen and in other criminal proceedings in the past with many of these cartel members choosing to actually work with authorities instead of getting chased by them.",

Georgia, which seemed like it was moving beyond the reach of President Biden, could be in play. North Carolina, again, because of the minority population of each of those states.

And the sea change of where we are today in comparison to one week ago today, one week ago today, Trump had survived the assassination attempt. I thought they had a near flawless convention. The Republicans, he spoke too long. But otherwise, I thought the convention was well, he was leading in every battleground state and he was winning handily in the national surveys, which are important, but they aren't outcome determinative because of the way we select our presidents. And now the enthusiasm has completely shifted in the direction of the Democrats, but there's still so many things that are about to transpire, not the least of which a debate. If there is one, I think there will be. Donald Trump is going to get sentenced before this election runs its course in the New York case for which he's been convicted.

At one point, 80 artists from the Moulin Rouge performing the iconic dance that dates back to the 1820s. The bells of Notre Dame ringing for the first time since the cathedral was gutted by fire. Angel-winged accordion players rocking berets on a bridge. It may seem over the top, but not for Paris.
