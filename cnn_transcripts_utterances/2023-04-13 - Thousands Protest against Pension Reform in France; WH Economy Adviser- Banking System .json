We'll see him here shake hands with his Irish counterpart there, the Prime Minister looks to be a sunny day, as they both greet, shake hands at some point pose for a photo up. This is of course, part of the U.S. President's three-day trip in the region. Now after meeting with the country's President, as we have seen, he has just arrived to have talks there with the Prime minister. In terms of topics the war in Ukraine, well, that's high on the agenda. And then later he is scheduled to address the Irish parliament. You can also see him wearing a fitting green tie there.

He got to meet Misneach one of two President Higgins two Bernese Mountain dogs. Perhaps it wasn't an expected greeting, the dog barked at the President and the Irish President invited the dog to come out so the President Biden meeting Misneach. He is going to have a speech, a rare speech for U.S. Presidents so forth only U.S. President will speak to a joint upper and lower house of the Irish parliament. The Church here just on the street behind me in a couple of hours. And I think there will get to hear the President, you know, again, formulate his ties his family's ties the country but really go deeper and broader to explain how he feels that Ireland and the United States are so connected and the importance of that and how it benefits both countries and where they have a shared vision, a shared vision of democracy, a shared vision of how to help Ukraine in the war. They're over Russia's invasion. So I think these are the things we'll hear the President speak about. And of course, he'll probably also speak again about the importance of the Good Friday Peace Agreement that he was in Northern Ireland just yesterday celebrating the 25th anniversary of it.",

In fact, at the front of the march, we did see several standoffs already between the police and some of the protesters, especially when the protesters were set to march past the Constitutional Council. Now, of course, as Nada already said, that Constitutional Council is set to announce its decision tomorrow, whether or not this proposed pension reform that's been put forward by the government to over Emmanuel Macron, whether or not that is completely in line with the Constitution, or at least in parts, or maybe totally against the Constitution. And the protesters tried to break through a police line there. And we did see a standoff between the police officers and protesters; there were some bottles that were thrown. So you do see it is quite a charged atmosphere. I have seen some protesters also spray painting some walls. So you can see that there are a lot of people who are extremely angry. I think one of the things that are really interesting, though, if you look around you see some of the folks that are marching past out. There are also a lot of younger people who have joined this protest. And I think one of the things that Nada was saying, which is completely correct. It's a lot of folks here to them; of course, it is about the pension reform. But it's also a large part about the way that Emmanuel Macron is trying to do all this, the fact that he used executive powers to try and push all of this through a lot of people believes that that's just not right. And of course that's causing serious damage to Emmanuel Macron. Politically as well, were some people are already saying that he is essentially a lame duck President, despite the fact that he still has several years left in his second term. So what we've seen so far is also a lot of peaceful protesting a giant turnout.

I mean, one of them is the focus from U.S. officials on the Russian Mercenary Group, Wagner.Wagner Group say, a group that is sort of paramilitary supporting the Kremlin's aims but not directly under the direction of the government. These documents reveal the anxieties that the U.S. side has on this group in terms of their propaganda in Africa trying to win over public opinion and spread what seemed deemed as anti-U.S. messaging. And also I'd say some other anxieties in the documents reflect somewhat -- what's been going on with China in Latin America? There's a section in there about concern that, you know, Nicaragua in, you know, in Central America may be moving closer to China as a result of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. So the Ukraine war sort of permeates all of these documents that we've seen, but reveals a lot of, you know geopolitical struggle, and questions about whether Russia and China are undermining U.S. interests around the world.",

What are very important for the EV experience are the charging facility and the charging experience. And that's going to be really what's going to allow an accelerated development of the EV adoption.

We're seeing a lot of demand, as you know, through the pandemic, and then semiconductor crisis and otherlogistic issues that the industry has been facing. The market has basically been smaller than what the demand natural demand would have been in the past two or three years. And at the moment, we're in catch up mode, I would say through the pent up demand. So what we're seeing is demand actually still exceeding the production capacity of the industry. But there is a shift towards lower price payments in terms of monthly payments, lower trims, or more entropy segments. Quite frankly, something that Nissan can take advantage of, because we've got extremely strong and competitive offerings in those areas of growing interest for the customer. So I think again, there is an answer to what the customer needs. And we are seeing the shift in terms of the lower price points.",

DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey Rahel, yes, very much. So we were on the very wet and windy streets in Dundalk County Louth last night where thousands of people lined the streets for hours just to get a glimpse of President Biden. As you say, a bit of diplomacy here a bit of work happening a bit of political work happening he gave a speech yesterday in Northern Ireland about the Good Friday Agreement, but now he's very much in I guess almost vacation mode. He has another speech to do later today at the joint session of the Irish Parliament in Dublin. But then after that tonight, he's been going to a state banquet dinner in the city as well. And then tomorrow, he comes here to County Mayo where his great grate great grandfather immigrated from to the United States in the 19th century. When he gets here he is going to go to Knock which is a Christian pilgrimage site in County Mayo not too far from here. And then tomorrow night is the main event here in Ballina outside the church behind me. He will be delivering a speech. There will be musical performances and expecting a huge turnout here tomorrow. He has very close links with as he has plenty of cousins in this town. He's visited this town twice before once as Vice President and once as a private citizen. So as he said to reporters yesterday, it's feels like coming home. And certainly when he comes here to Ballina tomorrow, it will feel like coming home.",
