      "sentences": "All right, welcome, everyone. Another hour in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington.Big bucks and big stars at President Biden's campaign fundraiser tonight. The Los Angeles event has already broken a fundraising record for the Democratic Party just two weeks before for the first debate between Biden and Trump. That debate will be right here on CNN. Tickets for the Hollywood fundraiser event went from $250 to half a million dollars with a contest for small-dollar donors to win tickets which would let them meet President Biden, former president Obama, Julia Roberts, George Clooney. Jimmy Kimmel will also moderate a Q and A with Biden and Obama tonight. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz joins us now. Arlette, big haul for the campaign even before the event starts. What else are we learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Omar, the Biden campaign says that this is the biggest Democratic fundraiser in history. President Biden already raking in $28 million heading into tonight's events. The president is leaning out a bit of help from some of his celebrity friends with George Clooney and Julia Roberts among the A-list celebrities who will be part of the program tonight.Now President Biden will be on stage with former president Barack Obama, his former boss. Jimmy Kimmel will moderate that conversation. There's other celebrities like Jason Bateman, Jack Black and Sheryl Lee Ralph who will also be part of this program. What the Biden campaign is trying to do is tap into some of that celebrity star power to try to engage voters in this campaign, whether it's to actually mobilize them to the polls or simply to donate some money in what is expected to be a very expensive race. Now this fundraiser tonight right behind me is modeled after a fundraiser that Biden did back in March with two other presidents, Obama and former president Bill Clinton. That event brought in $26 million. So this event tonight has already eclipsed that figure and it comes at a time when President Biden is really hoping to maintain his cash advantage that he's had through most of this race over former president Donald Trump. But in recent months, Trump has seen a significant gain in his fundraising especially since he secured the Republican nomination. So for the Biden campaign, they are hoping events like this will really try to drive up enthusiasm when it comes to donations, not just people who paid a lot of money to be inside this theater tonight, but also those grassroots donors. As you mentioned, they ran a contest for people to come out here and meet the two presidents, as well as a few celebrities. There's also an opportunity for people to tune in virtually if they donated about $20 so the Biden campaign stressing that this is an event really trying to appeal to donors and supporters across the board as they are hoping to rake in even more money boost this campaign war chest heading into November's election.",

He said that if elected again, he will address inflation, stand up to China and other nations around the globe, as well as promote MAGA-nomics. That of course is a direct blow to Bidenomics.And then perhaps most consequentially, Omar, he hasn't said it yet but he is expected to tell these Michigan voters that it's important that they make a plan to vote whether that's voting early or by mail, to make a plan to vote. That of course is in opposition to the cold water that he threw on early voting and mail-in voting in 2020, an indication of a little bit more discipline this time around and a recognition that he can't leave any votes on the table.",

JIMENEZsay it is very difficult to do that. I've been in some of those rooms. So really appreciate you making it look easy. Thank you so much. All right. In just 12 days, June 27th, at CNN's Atlanta Studios, President Biden and former president Trump will go head-to-head for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. We've got new details about the rules that both of them have agreed to. I'm going to take you through them. All right. The 90-minute debate will have two commercial breaks. During those breaks, the candidates and their staff are not allowed to interact with each other. Both presidents will appear at uniformed podiums and their position will be determined by a coin flip. The microphones will be muted during the debate except when it's a candidate's turn to speak, obviously. No props or pre-written notes are allowed on stage. Each candidate, though, will get a pen, a pad and a bottle of water. No studio audience and the moderators will be Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, who will enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion. You of course, will be able to watch the debate right here on CNN on June 27th or stream it on Max. All right. Let's have the debate before the debate. Joining me now, former Republican congressman Charlie Dent and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategists, Maria Cardona. All right, Charlie, we just went through the rules. Do they seem fair? Do they favor either candidate based on what you've heard so far?",

I think Chris Wallace moderated that debate and that debate was just completely chaotic and really not of any value to the voter, frankly. It probably hurt Donald Trump.The question is, you know, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash are very skilled moderators, what will they do if one of the candidates completely disrupts the debate? You know, how will they manage that situation? And the other issue I think that we have to be concerned about, it's not the rules. Again, they're fine. The issue is RFK Junior has not been included in this debate and he is polling somewhere around 15 percent of the vote. And that's going to be another subject of debate about the debates.",

That's not every event, of course, but it is out there. Other times you see him like at the State of the Union, much more energetic and really, really, really into it.

And so I want to ask you, how do you expect him to answer those questions?

I think Donald Trump better bring his A game and he better be able to respond to policy questions. That's not what he typically does. So I don't think that belittling his opponent is really going to help them that much. I expect that he will.And let's face it, when it comes to debate prep, you know, Donald Trump is not particularly traditional. You know, he is -- he just likes, he just seems to wing it. He goes in there. He is not -- he deals with attention deficit disorder. He's not particularly focused and he really has very little interest in public policy. So I suspect you're going to hear much of the same things he's been spouting from the campaign trail. He's going to -- he's just going to go off on the border. He's going to go off on inflation. He's going to go off on just Joe Biden generally. I think there won't be a lot of personal ad hominem attacks coming from Trump, but don't expect this to be any type of more staid debate that we're used to with more traditional candidate. It's just simply not going to happen. You know, I just expect chaos.",

And the Biden campaign just broke another record for its fundraiser tonight in L.A. I mean, Trump has also raised a lot of money, but Biden has broken this record for the Democratic side.

Because all of those stories are based on polls, Omar, and why not let space the stories about what's truly going on out there on things that are tangible, like money like fundraising, like record money coming from grassroots voters. If there wasn't that kind of enthusiasm, Omar, they wouldn't be giving $30, $50, their hard-earned money.They are literally putting their money where Joe Biden's mouth has been. They are buying what he is selling because they understand exactly just like President Biden does what is at stake in this election. And it is nothing less than our democracy. And it is nothing less than their future and the futures of their families. And the other thing I will say is that the other tangible piece that we can put on excitement on the Democratic side are special elections, right? Democrats have trounced Republicans in every single special election and also in the midterms in 2022, where everyone was, you know, saying there's going to be this big red tsunami, right? The Democrats are going to be blown out of water. It didn't happen because the reality is, is that the mass numbers of Americans have roundly rejected the MAGA agenda and they're going to do so again in November.",

He's basically inviting violence with that type of rhetoric, you know, victory or death. I mean, this is an election, you know. This isn't some foreign banana republic where their political violence is expected. This is United States of America, and I'm deeply shocked by this. And that's why I'm leading this group called Our Republican Legacy, where we're trying to bring the party back, you know, talking about traditional principles that have sustained a party for generations and we can't have this type of MAGA extremism basically, as evidenced by Steve Bannon, you know, dragging this party into a ditch. I think this is a very dangerous place when Bannon makes those kinds of outrageous comments that will I fear lead to violence particularly if Trump loses on election day.

It wasn't about the city itself. He didn't say it. I keep hearing all of these things, it is like they were twisting themselves in a pretzel, reminded me of the Milwaukee pretzel company here. The fact of the matter though is that the RNC, the Republican National Committee, which by the way has been great to work with, they've been in Milwaukee a number of times.

Joining us now is retired US Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. All right, Colonel, I mean, just for starters, what do you make of this move by Moscow? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this is a very interesting thing, Omar, because of course, as you can see, we are only 90 miles away from the Florida Coast right here. So Key West is right here, and you've got Havana right there where it is. And this is where the Admiral Gorshkov and the Kazan actually have docked and doing their port visit. So what this means is that this is actually a way for the Russians to, in essence declare that they have a presence in the western hemisphere and they are doing this in response to our moves with Ukraine where we have given the Ukrainians the right to use our weapons systems, the weapons systems that we've built that we've given them to hit targets in Russia on Russian soil that are directly affecting the war in Ukraine.",

This is the ship, this is a frigate and it has actually stealth technology.It was commissioned in 2018 and it is designed to carry a variety of different missiles. Among these are the Kalibr missile, which is basically a land-attack cruise missile. Although there are submarine and surface ship variants. It has a range of a little over 1,200 miles and a warhead that is about 1,100 or so pounds. And then the other possibility is the zircon missile. This is a hypersonic missile.

This picture was taken in 2022, but this is the Admiral Gorshkov showing firing this particular missile, the zircon missile, because they did that not only in this picture, but they also did two years before that in a test run.So this is a hypersonic missile. It can travel at nine times the speed of sound so that is what the Admiral Gorshkov can do. Very similar things can happen with the Kazan. This is a submarine, it is capable of launching Kalibr missiles, as well as zircon missiles and several other types of missiles. It is designed, of course, to provide the Russians with naval stealth capabilities and like all submarines, it is designed to be undetected until the very last moment that it is used in combat.",
