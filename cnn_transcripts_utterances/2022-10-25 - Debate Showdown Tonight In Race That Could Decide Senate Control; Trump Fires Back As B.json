We're setting the stage for tonight's high-stakes debate in Pennsylvania between John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz.Also this hour, what is next for Brittney Griner now that a Russian court has upheld her nine-year sentence? The WNBA star's lawyer joins us from Moscow as President Biden says he's in constant contact with Russia to try to secure Griner's release. And Donald Trump is firing back, as Author Bob Woodward is sharing his revealing recorded phone calls with the former president. Woodward joins us to break down the Trump tapes and take us behind the scenes of their truly, extraordinary conversations. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. This hour, we're counting down to the pivotal U.S. Senate debate in Pennsylvania, as well as the bigger midterm battle playing out across the country over the next 14 days. CNN correspondents are out in force in critical swing states and here in Washington covering the fight for control of Congress. First, let's go to CNN's Jeff Zeleny. He's in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff, the Senate debate begins, what, two hours or so from now. What do we expect?",

That is because this race has been a narrowing and closing throughout the summer and early fall months. Now, more than a half million Pennsylvania voters have already cast their ballots, but certainly many more are expected to do so. The top Senate super PAC announced today they are investing $6 million more into ads here largely focused on crime. Here is a sample of what has been driving the race on that issue alone.

So, look for extensive conversation about that record.Now, at the same time, John Fetterman is trying to point out the transformation that Mehmet Oz has undergone since winning the primary. Of course, he likely would not have won this primary without the endorsement of Trump. Since May, he has barely mentioned Trump. In fact, he's trying to campaign in the middle. So, Fetterman will also be trying to portray Dr. Oz as an extremist well. But, Wolf, one thing that will be unique and different about this debate tonight, closed captioning will be visible to both candidates on giant television monitors right behind the moderators. I'm told 70- inch monitors. This is necessary because Mr. Fetterman is still recovering from that stroke he had in May. He has what is called auditory processing issues. So, yes, he can understand what is being asked but he doesn't always match what he's seeing with what he is hearing. So, his doctors say he is fit to serve, no question. So, it's been hanging over this debate, the closed captioning, but I am told by advisers to the Oz campaign, they're not going to mention this very much, if at all. They're going to try to focus on those issues. So, Wolf, there is no doubt, this race is a key piece to the puzzle for Democrats trying to hold their control of the Senate and Republicans trying to win it back two weeks from tonight.",

And the early votes cast today and the early voting period will contribute to now to the now more than 9 million early ballots cast nationwide up to this point, according to election officials. And as of now, that is on pace with 2018, which, as we know, had the highest midterm voter turnout in recent history, Wolf.",

So, Democrats from very early on decided that this was one of the places they could pick up a seat. But, boy, so much has changed as the seasons have transpired throughout this midterm election year.Now, Democrats are very much on defense, defending some of their own seats as well, in Nevada, in Arizona, in Georgia. So, that makes this race all that much more important. But Republicans believe if they can hold this seat and win this seat, that is, in fact, the key to their majority. That is one of the reasons that the top Senate Republican PAC decided today to invest $6 million more into ads in the closing stretch here. Now, that is just a speck of all of the money that has been spent, more than $100 million in ads overall. But what that money is coming from is from New Hampshire. They no longer believe the New Hampshire race is as competitive. So, really, all of the eggs are in the Pennsylvania basket, at least on this side of the country. So, tonight is certainly so important for both men to show they could serve in the Senate, of course, John Fetterman, to show that he's healthy enough to serve after his stroke and heart condition and for Mehmet Oz to show that he's serious enough to serve in the Senate. Of course, he made his name as a television doctor and a television host and performer. So, the question here is how Pennsylvania voters who are exhausted by the barrage of ads they've been seeing, how they react to both men tonight.",

And while he will increase his travel, he is going to hold a number of rallies in the week before the midterms, he and his inner circle are really focused already on 2024.And part of what that looks like is establishing a political operation. We are told that this is going to look a lot like what we saw in 2016 when Trump won the White House. That means a slimmer operation, that means a smaller staff. They've already started talking to some campaign leadership and we are told that there is an expectation that there is going to be an emphasis on those who have been loyal to Trump, particularly in his post-presidency, helping him set up his post-presidential life and business. And so there are some caveats here. We're talking about, first of all, timing. We have heard from a number of aides who have said that Trump is eager to run despite his number of legal battles that he's currently embroiled in. Some saying he could announce as early as before Thanksgiving, others saying before the end of the year. But two things have to happen. One, his candidates have to do well. Republicans have to do well. And on the other side, as his aides, even his closest aides will tell you what is true in Trump world today might not be true in another week. So, it's one of those things that we're going to have to wait and see what happens, Wolf.",

And if they don't come through, he's going to claim credit for it anyway, because Republicans are going to win seats in the House, they may win the Senate.And, Wolf, just remember, this is a midterm election and it is always at question of what the in incumbent has done.

And so I think Donald Trump, with all his legal battles, will want to claim that he's the victim here against the FBI and deep state, et cetera.
