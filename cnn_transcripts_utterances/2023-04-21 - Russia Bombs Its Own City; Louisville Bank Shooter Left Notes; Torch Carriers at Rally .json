Each has been indicted on a single felony charge of burning an object with the intent to intimidate. The 2017 rally ultimately led to violent clashes with counter protesters and a 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, lost her life.CNN's Brian Todd is in Charlottesville outside court. So, Brian, what's next here and also why did it take more than five years to get here? BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Rahel, to answer your first question first, what's coming next. In just a couple of hours is a hearing where two of these defendants will be making court appearances. Will Zachary Smith from Texas and Tyler Bradley Dykes from South Carolina will be making court appearances. This is going to be a bond hearing for Will Smith and an initial court appearance for Tyler Bradley Dykes. There's a third defendant named Dallas Medina, who has been charged in this case as well. He's from Ohio. It's been unclear as to whether he was going to make a court appearance, but at this moment we believe he is not going to be appearing in court this morning. These three people are charged with burning an object with the intent to intimidate. Also, Will Smith is charged with violating a statute that makes it illegal to maliciously release a chemical irritant, like tear gas. Now, that charge for Will Smith relates to what he allegedly did at the Unite the Right Rally, which was on that Saturday, August 12th of 2017 when all the violence broke out. But the burning of an object charge for all three of these men pertains to that torch rally that took place in Charlottesville the night before the Unite the Right Rally. That was on that Friday evening, August 11, 2017, when a group of white supremacists and white nationalists marched through the streets of Charlottesville. They marched onto the campus of the University of Virginia chanting things like \"Jews will not replace us,\" and, \"blood and soil\" was a phrase they used. That's a Nazi reference. These are charges being brought on this. Now, Rahel, to get to your second question, why did it take so long to charge these individuals. Well, the previous commonwealth attorney for Albemarle County, his name is Robert Tracci, he declined to press charges. But the current commonwealth's attorney, James Hingeley, he ran on a platform of bringing justice to these people. So, he has brought these charges. A key question is, are there going to be other charges against other possible defendants going all the way back to this really monumental event, this horrible event in Charlottesville in 2017?",

All are charged with reckless murder for the attack Saturday night that killed four people and injured 32 others. The district attorney says that the charges are just the tip of the iceberg, but they still haven't released a motive. Washington Governor Jay Inslee just signed a bill formally eliminating the death penalty from state law. It's been banned there since 2018 after the state Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional. And in Florida, you no longer need a unanimous jury decision to sentence someone to death. Governor Ron DeSantis just signed the law that allows for a capital sentence when just eight of 12 jurors agree. That is the lowest threshold in the country. A total of 27 states still have the death penalty, but Alabama is the only other state that does not require a unanimous jury. There it has to be 10 of 12 jurors. A Texas man who faces misdemeanor charges for his alleged role in the Capitol riot is in more trouble now after a police standoff. Court documents show that when law enforcement arrived at Nathan Pelham's home last week for a welfare check, he opened fire on them. Nobody was hurt, and Pelham was later arrested. Sara --",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Sara.It would be -- it could be almost immediate. I just want to make sure everyone knows that whatever happens today at the Supreme Court, it's not going to remove the drug from the market outright. It would -- it could change the availability of it in terms of when women could access the drug, for example, at 10 weeks of pregnancy, as they can now, or back to seven weeks of pregnancy, and whether they would be able to get it by mail, for example, or have to pick it up in person. So, those are the kinds of restrictions at this point of the game that are at stake. As we speak, Sara, the justices, right now, are about to gather in their private conference room to handle a lot of the week's business that they have to decide relative to cases. And this no doubt will be part of what they're looking at, trying to finalize what their orders should be. This is a court that just 10 months ago rolled back all constitutional protection for abortion rights, but said it was leaving the matter to the states. It decidedly was not outlawing abortion nationwide. And a key part of abortion nationwide is access to medication abortion, which is the way most women end pregnancies, if they need to end them, at early stages. So, you know, this is -- medication abortion, Sara, is the new chapter of the abortion wars in America. What could they do today? All right, basically there are two clear cut options. One is to grant the Biden administrations request for a pause in the lower court orders that actually restricted access to the drug. So, I think, you know, if they did it in a clean way at this point, very early stage of this controversy, the merits of the case have not been heard about FDA authorization for the drug. If they were to just put everything on hold, let the litigation play out, nothing would change for women and physicians for access to the drug. But if they denied the Biden administration's request, immediately certain restrictions would go into place, and that would be in terms of the timing of when a woman could obtain it in a pregnancy and other rules for availability, but it would remain on the shelves, Sara, and the case would continue to play out. The next stage will be a hearing in a lower court in May. But this first, crucial step by the nine justices, who last waded in on abortion, to cut back abortion rights, is quite anticipated, Sara.",

This case is going through the New York courts, so it's going a lot slower than the Dominion case, which was in Delaware. And so this won't theoretically occur until next year where they would start taking those depositions. So Fox has some time, but will they move to settle this and make sure that this doesn't end up being a further embarrassment to the company going forward? I should also note, John, that Fox, in the past two weeks, has been settling or ending a lot of these defamation cases against it. A couple weeks ago they settled a -- with the Venezuelan businessman who had sued over election lies that he was basically swept up in. They, of course, settled that Dominion lawsuit just days ago. And last night, Lachlan Murdoch, who had filed a lawsuit against a small Australian publisher, he dropped his defamation lawsuit against that company. And so you're seeing the Murdochs really try to end a lot of these legal entanglements that they're in. Will this mean that they also move to settle in the next few weeks with Smartmatic? We don't know. But as you pointed out, they're seeking more money than Dominion, and they also want that full retraction, which we know was a big sticking point when it came to settling that Dominion lawsuit.",

And it appears the plans to do so are finally taking shape. His team is working towards announcing that re-election bid as soon as next week, with an eye on Tuesday as a possibility for releasing a campaign-style video. Of course, Tuesday has very personal significance to President Biden as it was the day four years ago when he launched his first -- or his last bid for the White House, which he had billed as a battle for the soul of the nation.Advisors behind the scenes have been working for quite some time trying to sketch out what a campaign apparatus would look like. And so we will see how exactly that will come to fruition when the president eventually announcing. But it is -- there still is going to be a very long road ahead for President Biden as he seeks a second term in office. His approval ratings are hovering in the low forties and the overall American public, there's a recent poll that shows only 26 percent of the overall American public want him to seek re-election. If you take a look at those numbers from the Democrats, there are also some skepticism within the Democratic Party. That poll showing that only 47 percent of Democrats think he should run again, slightly up from January. But it speaks to some of the concerns that we've heard Democrats voice about the president, including questions about his age. Now, if you take a look at some of the other polling, Democrats have said -- about 81 percent say that they would at least -- they would at least support him if he were to run. But you do see some hesitation in those numbers when it comes for Democrats, about the fact that he would even seek re-election. So, certainly there are - are a few challenges facing the president as he heads towards a re-election bid, which could also be a possible rematch against his former rival, former President Donald Trump.",
