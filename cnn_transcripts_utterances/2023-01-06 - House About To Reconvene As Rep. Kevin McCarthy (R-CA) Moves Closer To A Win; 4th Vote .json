He and both of his deputies, Elise Stefanik and Steve Scalise, and a 100-plus more of the House Republicans in that chamber, who tonight apparently are going to make him speaker, were fighting to overturn the election even after the insurrection.

He is a voice for the people. And, Madam Clerk, this is the people's House.Two years ago today, duly elected members of this body gathered here to certify the results of a free and fair election. And in doing so, we participated in a tradition that makes our democracy a marvel and the envy of the world, a peaceful transfer of power. But this body is more than a ceremonial chamber, Madam Clerk. This is a workplace where hundreds of men and women endure long, difficult hours before they punch out and go home to their families, where good people come to work each day and maybe steal a quiet moment to themselves to look up at the ceiling or to look at the paintings, the statue of Abraham Lincoln and to thank God for the blessings of liberty because this place is so much more than a chamber or even a workplace. It is in Lincoln's words a sign we intend the union shall go on. And I'm not just talking about the members either, Madam Clerk. I'm talking about you and your staff, the custodial staff, the floor staff, the institutional staff, our congressional staff, the sergeant at arms, our beloved chaplain, and the Capitol police. I'm talking about the people who make this House work, the people who Hakeem Jeffries will never take for granted. Two years ago, Madam Clerk, we witnessed this place under siege by a violent mob who desecrated this building and the other chamber, but this feels a little familiar. Today, we adjourned amidst utter confusion. Only this time we're returning in the dark of night not to cast a vote to bring this country together and to do our jobs but one that will set the path toward division and default. So, if we are forced to be here this evening because of the chaos and crisis on the other side, it's only fair to point out, Madam Clerk, that the same individuals who fanned the flames of January 6th, who told their followers and their followers' followers that they needed to fight back and who challenged the swearing in of members based on a bogus claim of fake electors may well be in charge of the people's House if they can ever agree on who can lead them.",

Why did Paul Ryan decide to throw in the towel? Both of them thought that letting this group of people hold them hostage, hold the U.S. government hostage in critical important situations was too much. They didn't want to deal with it anymore. Some of that was personal. They just didn't want to put up with it. They didn't like it. But some of it was also about what is the responsible thing to do when you have been given the power to govern the country in critical moments like raising the debt ceiling or dealing with a national security crisis among other things. And McCarthy in his stubbornness has essentially said I will give them what they want so that I can stay in power.
