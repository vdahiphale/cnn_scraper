Netanyahu later took that down and apologized.Families of the hostages want the prime minister to trade all of Israel's Palestinian prisoners for all of Hamas' hostages. Netanyahu vowed to exhaust all options to secure the release of their loved ones. President Biden spoke with Netanyahu yesterday and talked about the ongoing efforts, especially these hostages held by Hamas and Americans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, according to information obtained by CNN and some of our colleagues still on the ground right now is in mid-September that law enforcement was responding to what was essentially a wellness check on this shooter because a National Guardsman had reported that the shooter, an Army Reservist, that the guardsman was concerned he would snap and commit a mass shooting.Plus, that law enforcement officer, according to information obtained, was told by the shooter's family that this - that he, at the time, had been answering the door with a handgun out of view. That said, there was an attempt to check on him, but then a missing persons report appears to have been filed, and then the case was closed on October 1st. So, there's still a lot of questions as to what made them close that, if that was indeed the case. And all of that, for context wise, was happening just weeks before this -- these mass shootings actually happened. MATTINGLY: Blatant red flag there.

And you can see that, of course. Their competition has been rising. We saw that on the last debate stage. We'll see it on the next one, which is just next week. But it is that strong, commanding lead from the former president that really defines this race. So, yes, the race has changed over the weekend with Mike Pence dropping out. That has barely made a blip into the state of the race here. So, it's a three-person race at this point. One interesting point, though, Poppy. About half of caucus goers say they have not made up their minds. They may still be open to changing their mind. So that gives hope, perhaps, to some of the lower candidates. But, for Donald Trump,  his supporters are locked in. There's no doubt. He made that clear yesterday right here in Sioux City.

This is hardly news. Hardly a surprise to. He's remade his party. And as we talk to voters, some are attending these Iowa caucuses, these events for the first time. Donald Trump has reshaped this Republican Party into his own image. The question is, will any of the outside factors, like the legal challenges that we're going to see unfold even more over the next couple months, will that change any minds? And it's almost like there is a tale of two campaigns. Sitting through a Trump rally yesterday for an hour and a half of him speaking, we could have been several years ago, made no reference to that, except they're coming after me through the indictment.

I mean there was a very interesting number that was out there where the vast majority of likely caucus goers, Republican likely caucus goers in Iowa said, that the legal matters make no difference whatsoever. And so the traditional strategy, which is really what Mike Pence was following, was the idea of being as conservative as you can in the traditional areas, social conservatism, strong on defense, economic conservatism. It made no impression whatsoever. And he dropped out with 2 percent of the vote. This is Donald Trump's party. And Donald Trump's party is about Donald Trump, period.
