He is calling for Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to close the department on -- quote -- \"day one.\" And in the wake of Trump's win, he announced the creation of a new Department of Religious Freedom and Patriotism in the state. Here's some of that announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a mandate that several districts have already said they are disregarding.And that pushback comes as Walters is already facing two lawsuits stemming from his earlier mandate that schools incorporate the Bible into lesson plans in grades five through 12. Last week, he also announced the purchase of 500 Bibles, which appear to be the Trump- endorsed God Bless the USA version, for use in classrooms across the state. Ryan Walters is joining us now. I really appreciate you coming on to have this important discussion. As you know, your state's attorney general's office says you don't have the authority for this mandate to play that prayer video. So, what authority do you have to mandate schools to show your prayer video, where you also pray for president-elect Trump?",

We're enacting upon that agenda here in Oklahoma. That's what our parents want. Every county in Oklahoma voted for President Trump.

How do you explain Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail,\" where he goes through biblical examples if the left continues to censor the Bible from our history classes? Listen, the left doesn't have to like it. They can be offended by it, but we have got to teach history to our young people to make this country great again. President Trump has a clear mandate.

And there are really two things that the Kremlin has been saying. And one of them, you already mentioned, which is pouring oil into the fire, as the Kremlin put it, essentially saying that the outgoing Biden administration continues, as the Kremlin put it, to fan the flames of the Ukraine war, which obviously the Russians believe could end fairly soon once the Trump administration takes office, which the Russians believe could be better for them or get -- come to a better outcome for them. The other thing is that the Russians are warning that all of this could pit the United States and Russia directly against one another. In fact, Vladimir Putin has been saying over the past couple of weeks, as the Biden administration has been pondering this decision, that he believes that only -- that Ukraine is not able to conduct strikes with weapons like the surface-to-surface attack ATACMS missiles from the United States without the help of specialists from the country where these missiles come from, in this case, of course, the United States. Therefore, the Russians are saying that strikes deep into Russian territory conducted with these kinds of weapons would be considered by the Russians as a direct act of war by the U.S. or NATO countries against Russia. Pamela, the Russians have even changed the nuclear doctrine of this country to specifically call for one of these scenarios where if Russia is attacked with long-distance weapons by a non-nuclear country, like Ukraine, with the help of a nuclear country like the United States, that that could trigger a nuclear response for the Russians. Of course, we have in the past heard the Russians pull out red lines many times that new weapons have been provided to the Ukrainians. The Russians, however, are now saying that, for them, all options are on the table as they weigh their response. Of course, still waiting to see if, when and how the Ukrainians will really use these weapons to strike deep into Russia, Pamela.",
