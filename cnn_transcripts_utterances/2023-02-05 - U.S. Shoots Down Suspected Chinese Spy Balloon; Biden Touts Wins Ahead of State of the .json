It is superpower versus superpower, is what is China's response?I was reading \"The Global Times\" this morning. That is effectively a Chinese government mouthpiece. Notable, to have this language in the mouthpiece. If the U.S. does not differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, then it has made a very bad precedent in treating China-U.S. relations. This piece mentions what is a fact. U.S. has many surveillance aircraft to fly around Chinese airspace, both drones, but also spy planes. I've been on one of them. China claims that the U.S. uses civilian aircrafts, or similar surveillance purposes. It is telegraphing there, at least, the possibility that if you are able to shoot down what we claim to be a civilian aircraft, claiming it's surveillance, we reserve the right to do the same. Whether China makes a decision to do that is another question. But some of these aircraft are unmanned, like this balloon. Is it possible that China, under certain circumstances, might do the same? It's possible. They seem to be telegraphing that, and that shows you that an incident like this is not necessarily over. The danger now is escalation and response.",

We've seen it regularly over the last administration and this administration. They've seen the spy blues and more than five continents up to this point.What was different about this was that when it was first spotted on January the 28th, in the Alaska territory area, they actually left the U.S. territory, went into Canada, and then came back into the continental United States on January 31st. That was the moment when it became clear that it was. Different that alarms of people. That was the moment where the process inside the administration between the Pentagon, between the White House national security council really kicked into high gear but how to deal with. As the president was briefed by General Mark Milley, the chairman of the chief joint of staff on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the military presented full options to the president. And the president made clear this needs to be shot down. However, every one of the table, both national security council on the Pentagon, said that it is now over the continental United States knows a significant risk to civilians of this very large, this is not just the balloon, this was three buses, size of three buses, payload underneath that, that could cause real damage both the property and to people. And so, the decision was made, given the bet there is no security, risk in the collection perspective, they would quickly to address that in the U.S. side, that they would let this go, shot it down when it came over water, and then be able, in their, minds to be able to collect a more fulsome intelligence when they picked up the payload from the water, which is the recovery process that they're now engaged in.",

It was supposed to be a significant second order of the summit between President Xi and Biden last year in Asia. And to have that happen, obviously, there is the cancellation of the summit. And then, if you look through what's happening behind the scenes, on Wednesday night, the Chinese embassy top officials were summoned to the State Department to meet with Wendy Sherman, and Tony Blinken, or they express their very real displeasure. Also after, it was shot down, conversations between U.S. officials and Chinese officials basically U.S. officials saying this is what happened, this is what we told you it was probably going to happen, and this is why it happened.

And I think to be frank, that's kind of how Biden operates generally when he meets with people, particularly behind closed doors. What people miss in the kind of Biden-McCarthy dynamic is they're actually very similar politicians in terms of how they operate. They are people of people. They work with individuals. They have relationships. They care about their relationships. And a big part of their success is because they maintain relationships over time and understand the importance of care and feeding of those relationships.
