And right now, Joe Biden's presidential campaign finds itself on a cliff's edge, I mean, one misstep away from a free fall that could end his campaign.President Biden, in private, now appears to recognize at least some of that. Sources say that he's told allies that he knows the next couple days will be so critical for him to prove to voters that he can do the job. But in public, there's none of that. He told staff today on the call that he's running and is in the race to the end. His White House press secretary made it clear when she was asked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier tonight, he faced Democratic governors and top congressional leaders at the White House. And the governors, they asked for this meeting to see and hear from the president directly. Three of them said the conversation was candid and that they left hopeful. Governor Tim Walz said the president was fit for office.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): What we saw in there today was a guy who is the guy that all of us believed in the first time who could beat Donald Trump and did beat Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: But all the public got to see from the president today, well, was this, President Biden at a Medal of Honor ceremony reading from a teleprompter. He also connected to radio interviews. One of the hosts told me last hour it went just fine. He was very lucid and he was answering quickly. Now, the president often says, watch me, when he's asked about his age. The problem tonight seems to be that he's not offering the public that immediate chance to really watch him. And that has everyone from party members to the all important donors to the extraordinarily important voters perhaps worried. New tonight, we're told several Democratic lawmakers told Hakeem Jeffries that he needs to go tell Biden to drop out. So far, two members of Congress have now openly called for Biden to quit the race. And reporting suggests the number who feel that way but haven't actually voiced it yet is much, much higher, which, of course, is nothing short of frustrating for voters who just want a straight answer and opinion from their representatives. How do you feel in public and in front of the camera? And the polls are trending in the wrong direction. In a minute, Harry Enten will walk us through new data on that in just a sec. And then, then there's the money. Donors appear fed up. The co-founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, says Biden has got to go, and perhaps he's not alone. Well, The New York Times reporter who broke that story will be my guest as well. So, to recap tonight, Biden's facing signs that he's losing support from voters and donors and some of the elected leaders in his own country and his own party, arguably three groups that any candidate needs desperately in order to win an election 124 days out. And, really, it begs the question, how does Joe Biden fix this? And can he course-correct in time? For insight tonight, we turn now to Chris Whipple, an award-winning author who covered Joe Biden in the book, The Fight of His Life, Inside Joe Biden's White House. Chris, good to see you again. A lot has taken place over the last week. I mean, the Times reported that Biden, quote, understands that he may not be able to salvage his candidacy, unquote, if he can't convince voters. So, what does that tell you about where his mindset is?",

But I can tell you that contrary to the drumbeat of reporting, suggesting that Joe Biden is about to drop out, he's not going anywhere, at least as of now.You know, on Thursday night, there was consternation within the family. There was finger pointing at the debate prep team, but they are really all-in with Joe Biden on going forward, and I'm not even aware that there's been a discussion of dropping out of the race, much less Joe Biden somehow coming to grips with that fact.",

That's never been Jill's role.Do you really think that she would be sitting on the sideline at a time like this?

Look at this number. 74 percent of the electorate post-debate. I don't know how you escape a number like that. I should note that that is up from where we were pre debate when it was 69 percent but 69 percent is still pretty large. Compare that to four years ago, when it was just 36 percent at this point, this number has more than doubled over a four-year span. This is a big reason why Joe Biden is behind at this point. And I should note only 42 percent of voters say that Donald Trump is too old.And one little last thing for you, Laura, you have these numbers here. We showed you how different from where we were four years ago at this point. I want to put this in a little bit of historical context for you. Who led an early July presidential polls? Right now, it is Donald Trump. You go back 2020, 2016, 2012, 2008, you have to go all the way back to 2000. I have to walk all the way to this side of the screen to find a time in which a Democratic was not ahead in the polls at this particular point. Donald Trump is not just in a good position for a Republican, for himself, he's in a good position for a Republican, the best position since 2004. There are people who are going to vote in this election who weren't alive to see a Republican as in a strong opposition at this point in the cycle as Donald Trump is.",

According to The Wall Street Journal, some donors see Biden as the Yoda, frail yet wise and influential, and Trump as Jabba the Hutt, a gluttonous and powerful gangster. But sources suggest the force is not on Biden's side right now. The New York Times Teddy Schliefer reports big donors are turning on Biden quietly. You know what? He joins me now. Don't worry, I won't ask you any analogies for Star Wars, if you want. I mean, you know what I mean. Ask many questions I could, but I won't.

What's happening now over the last 48 hours, based on my calls and my colleagues calls to major donors, is people are beginning to act on that anxiety. We're seeing things like boycotts. We're seeing things like promises to hold money aside for a replacement candidate. Donors are acting on this anxiety and donors also speaking on the record.You know, Reed Hastings, who must a year ago, gave $100,000 in support, Joe Biden 2024 him and his wife have given, you know, over $20 million Democrats over the last five years, he's coming out and saying that Joe Biden should not be the nominee. He didn't have to say that. People a couple of days ago were scared, you know, when we wrote that donors were quietly feeling this way. That's so 24 hours ago. Now, people feel empowered. And this is just the first of -- we're just getting started here.

She's beating him in some of the polls, the early polls that have come out. She has a financial advantage here. And so, I'm not sure that doing a split primary or having that kind of conversation is really what the party needs. The party needs to focus on beating Donald Trump. And they need to let the president decide, because right now he is not stepping aside.

He stripped women of their bodily autonomy. And because of his decisions, women in 21 states cannot make decisions about their reproductive choice. We know that if he is reinstalled in the White House, he intends to strip us of access to IVF, access to contraception. And this is not hyperbole. It's what he said.
