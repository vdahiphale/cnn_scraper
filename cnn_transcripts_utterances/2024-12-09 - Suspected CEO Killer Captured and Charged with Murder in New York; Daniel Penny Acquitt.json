But now that we know the man behind the mask, the investigation tonight seems to just be beginning. Good evening and welcome to a special edition of \"Laura Coates Live.\"Police say they have their man, captured inside of Central Pennsylvania McDonald's, of all places, on the very same day that his alleged victim, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was laid to rest. Once again, our reporters, law enforcement analysts and profilers are live with me tonight for the next hour tracking every single part of this arrest and what happens next. But first, we're learning a whole lot more about the Ivy Leaguer suspected of the crime. Right now, you're looking at a mugshot taken today. His name? Luigi Mangione. And just moments ago, New York prosecutors officially charged him with murder. He is a 26-year-old whiz kid with an impressive education who had never seen the inside of a jail until tonight when he was arraigned near Altoona, Pennsylvania. That's where he was picked up by police probably after 9:00 this morning at a McDonald's that looks like, frankly, any other McDonald's. It's about 280 miles from the scene of the crime in New York City. And we're told Mangione was just sitting there eating when a customer recognized him. That customer then told an employee who then called police. This is what Mangione showed them when they got there. It's a fake I.D. The same one police believe he used in New York City. And then this happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It appears to reference UnitedHealthcare and suggests that violence is the answer. Among the lines -- quote -- \"These parasites had it coming.\" The allegations, let alone the manifesto, coming as a complete shock to those who knew Mangione's upbringing. He comes from a very prominent Baltimore family, was the high school valedictorian at one of the city's most prestigious private schools, went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, and working as a software engineer. And if you ask his friends, they say they're stunned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's a quote from what Luigi Mangione wrote on that website. Quote -- and he's talking here about Ted Kaczynski. \"He was a violent individual -- rightfully imprisoned -- who maimed innocent people. While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.\" Also, apparently, Laura, on that website, Goodreads, he had expressed interest in wanting to get and read more and more books about having to cope with back pain. Also, we believe that he sought books on mental illness and things like that. So, just kind of a hint on that part of his online persona. We also have seen messages to him on social media from friends and others who were wondering before this shooting took place in Manhattan.

The top part, the slide, which you see pulled back in this photograph, seems to be purchased probably online. And the other piece you see is the magazine, which has six rounds in it. Now, that's a magazine that probably holds 12 or 14 rounds, depending on the particular model. But we also know that in the New York shooting, they recovered six rounds.

Kyle Rittenhouse, who gained notoriety for his acquittal in a high-profile shooting case in the wake of George Floyd, taking to social media to applaud the acquittal.I want to bring in attorney for the Neely family, Donte Mills. Donte, how is the family feeling about the verdict? What are they telling you? DONTE MILLS, ATTORNEY FOR JORDAN NEELY'S FAMILY:  They're devastated. There was a conversation, Laura, that I had with them where you always go in and say, there's a chance here that we get justice. There's a chance that Jordan, who simply wanted to be heard, wanted to be seen during his life, would be seen in his death. And that didn't happen in the courtroom. And it was very hard for the family to take. And, in fact, Andre Zachary, Jordan's father, did have an outbreak in the courtroom because not only two rows behind him, someone was clapping that the person who took his son's life would not be held responsible. And that, to me, shows just a disregard. We have to care about each other. Everyone here is important, whether you're homeless, whether you have mental issues. And one thing that I keep hearing, Laura, that I just want to talk about briefly is, a lot of people say, well, where was his family then? That's not how life works. Sometimes, people go through things and they have demons. Andre's mother was killed when he was a teenager in the house, and her body was put in a suitcase and left on the side of the road. He had demons he couldn't get over. That didn't mean his family didn't love him because he couldn't be around people. It didn't mean that he didn't have people that cared for him because he did. The Neely family is full of love. But we all have family members that go through things. That doesn't make their lives less valuable. And that was the feeling they got when that verdict was announced, especially with that reaction in the room.",

And it's not a realistic statement because when you break it down, there was no way for Daniel Penny to know about Jordan Neely's history. He didn't speak to him at all. And, in fact, the entire incident only took 30 seconds. Within 15 seconds of Jordan being on that train and screaming at people and making people afraid, Daniel Penny came from behind him and took him down. The train arrived at the station 10 seconds later. Thirty seconds later, after Jordan nearly got on that train, everybody was off the train, the threat was over.And Daniel Penny continued to hold him and choke him for five and a half more minutes when people were screaming, let him go, you're going to kill him. I got his hands, you can let his neck go because you're going to kill him. That is what Daniel Penny did wrong. We're not saying he's racist, we're not challenging, and we applaud people that step up when they feel people are in danger, but you can't take it too far. And if you do, you have to be held responsible, and that's all we're saying.",

That's the question they struggled with, but ultimately came back on the lesser charge with a not guilty verdict. And I just don't know how to explain that to the family because if they believe Jordan's life mattered, you would have to say, you would know if you choke someone for six minutes straight, they are going to die, and that's simply taking it too far.",
