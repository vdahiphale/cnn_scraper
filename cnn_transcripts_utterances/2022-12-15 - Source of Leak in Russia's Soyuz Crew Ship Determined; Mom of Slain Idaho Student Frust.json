It's -- they've just released what they believe to be the location of the leak. They say the suspected source is the external radiator cooling loop of the Soyuz.And to kind of put this into perspective about where exactly this is. This Soyuz spacecraft is a Russian spacecraft that is attached to the International Space Station where NASA astronauts, European astronauts and Russian cosmonauts all live and work together. And this Soyuz spacecraft, it's a very old but very reliable spacecraft and it launched a few months ago, carrying two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut on board. It now essentially serves as one of their lifeboats on the space station in case something goes wrong. It can ferry that three-person crew back to earth and it was supposed to do that in March, but now it springs a leak, a coolant leak. And it happened right as two Russian cosmonauts were preparing to do a spacewalk. They cancel that spacewalk and now they're trying to figure out how they can fix it and if that spacecraft will be able to bring those cosmonauts and that one astronaut back to earth in a few months -- Bianna.",

      "sentences": "Victor and Bianna, the White House has not even officially confirmed that Patriot missile defense systems will be arriving here in Ukraine. Although an announcement could really come at any time. CNN was first to report that these highly effective missile defense systems that Ukraine has been pounding its fists on the table for, for not even months, but years. Saying that they're going to be a necessary part of this conflict as it moves into the next phase, that's what the defense minister told me when I interviewed him.The Patriot missile defense systems, the Ukrainians say will be deployed here and they say they are an important and crucial tool really as they continue to try to defend themselves from constant Russian bombardment of the civilian power infrastructure. I'll give you an example of the other day. The air raid sirens went off in Kyiv and it wasn't because there were incoming missiles, but because there were Russian bombers that were in the air space near Ukraine that carry the kind of missiles that Ukraine currently does not have the capacity to shoot down. If Russia were to fire these missiles and they were to successfully hit their target, Ukraine could not defend themselves against them. Patriot would change that, and that's why Ukrainians say they need them. There's also an important new interview out in \"The Economist\" with the head of Ukraine's armed forces where he is saying with certainty -- now whether that is, you know, potentially deliberate misinformation as the Russians have been doing throughout this conflict or whether they actually have verifiable and concrete intelligence that's not mentioned in \"The Economist\" article. He is saying that he believes that the Russians are preparing to move on Kyiv at some point early next year. Now again, the Ukrainians have become very adept at controlling the message and using the message to their advantage strategically. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the Ukrainians are publicly stating they think the Russians are going to try to move once again on the Ukrainian capital as they did when they entered this country on February 24th. Also, the fighting on the front lines to the south and the east has been continuing and it is very intense in the Donetsk region, where Ukrainian rockets have been hitting civilian targets according to Russian-backed officials -- although CNN can't independently verify that. But there have been social media videos of an intersection on fire, of a cathedral that was hit, along with commercial and residential buildings. But also, from the Russian side the constant shelling that has taken lives in Kherson to the south has continued. And it has essentially cut that city off from the power grid entirely. Meaning that there are many people including children who are in that city right new in the dark and the cold -- Victor and Bianna. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "That's right guys, the jury reached this verdict after conferring for about eight hours on Wednesday and more than five hours today. Thigh found former Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean guilty of the lesser of the included offenses of manslaughter after he shot Atatiana Jefferson through a window of her home on October 12, 2019. Dean, who is white, resigned days afterwards. He was arrested andcharged in the killing of Jefferson, who is black. He had pleaded not guilty to murder, a charge which carries a possible sentence of 5 to 99 years. Now Dean did take the stand and testified in his own defense on Monday, telling the jury that he fired at Jefferson because she pointed a gun at him. Now when he was pressed during cross-examination, he admitted many of his actions that night were, quote, bad police work, including firing the weapon without seeing her hands or what was behind her. Failing tell his partner that he saw a gun and rushing into the home without fully ensuring it was safe. Now, in the closing arguments the state had portrayed Dean as a power- hungry former cop whose preconceived notions about the neighborhood where Jefferson lived tainted his conduct the night of the shooting. The defense countered that dean had fired his weapon in self-defense while fearing for his life in what attorneys said was a tragic accident and not a criminal act. Again, today the jury disagreed with what the defense had said, finding him guilty of manslaughter -- of the manslaughter charge, and he faces up to 20 years in prison for the conviction. The jury still has to determine the sentencing details. Victor, Bianna, back to you.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the market is getting hit by a double whammy here. Yesterday the Fed made clear that it's not done slamming the brakes on this economy. Inflation might be cooling but not enough for them to stop raising interest rates just yet.And then today there is a series of reports that were out that suggests that some cracks in the economy. Retail sales unexpectedly tumbled. Manufacturing reports were weaker than expected. Jobless claims were strong but probably too strong if you ask the Fed. And so, I think if you put it all together, Wall Street is growing more worried that the Fed is going to slow this economy right into a recession. So, we see the Dow down almost 800 points, 2.3 percent. Markets are up off their worst points of the day. At one point the Dow was down 950 points but still closing near session lows. Tech stocks have gotten hit particularly hard -- Apple, Netflix, Facebook owner Meta, all of them down sharply. And if you look at how the market has performed overall this year, the S&amp;P 500 is down 18 percent so far this year. That is easily on track for the worst year since 2008. It feels like the market is in kind of a weird place right now where good news is bad and bad news is bad. What I mean by that is good economic news, right, is being interpreted as bad because it means the Fed is going to have to be even more aggressive. Bad economic news is bad for everyone because it suggests a growing risk of a recession. I think that today's sell-off shows that the market is clearly pricing in a growing risk, not a certainty, but a growing risk of a recession.",

He needs to see more proof that inflation really is cooling off.
