Police say the shooters used what is believed to have been a gun conversion device that can be used to override the trigger mechanism on a gun so that it functions as a machine gun. That will explain the reason why police say more than 100 shell casings were collected here at the scene. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin says the city is getting a lot of help from the FBI and the ATF as they continue the manhunt for the people responsible for the shooting.",

This bill would punt the funding fight past Election Day and, of course, right before the holidays. But are they really close to a deal? We have CNN's Manu Raju live for us on Capitol Hill.

We do expect a government shutdown to be avoided, but not until the speaker decided to essentially give Democrats what they had been asking for.Democrats had asked for -- to extend government funding for three months until mid-December. That's pretty much what speaker decided to do. He did it until December 20th. They also, the Democrats wanted it to be free of any extraneous provisions, namely that proposal that Donald Trump himself had been demanding two provide -- to demand proof of citizenship for people who are voting. An effort to try to clamp down on undocumented immigrants from voting in elections, something that's already illegal, but something that Trump and Mike Johnson, the speaker, both said was absolutely necessary. Now, because Johnson has dropped those provisions, he's gotten a lot of backlash from the right flank of his party. And I asked the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee about what some members on the right are calling a capitulation to Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, there's no way, politically, a government shutdown on the eve of an election is good for us, not good for the president, not good for the Republican House majority.

Because their ride was canceled, in effect. They said, look, we're bringing back the Starliner craft with nobody on board because of the issues about helium and about thrusters and about the way it was -- the way it was approaching earth. And they wanted to make sure everything was OK, nobody got hurt. It was a safety call. But the way they assign seats up there is very complicated. There are deals between the U.S. and Russia negotiating on who gets on one of these flights like this from Russia or who gets on flights from the U.S. It's very involved. And you don't really upset that apple cart easily by saying just jump on the next flight. Plus, astronauts are prepared to stay for months and months. That's what makes them astronauts. They don't get mad about not coming home on time. They would rather stay longer. So that's a bonus.",
