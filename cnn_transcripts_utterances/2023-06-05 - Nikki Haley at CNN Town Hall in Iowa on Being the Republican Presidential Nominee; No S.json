Nikki Haley takes center stage at CNN's town hall to explain why she would be the best Republican nominee for president.Escalating U.S. and Chinese tensions. New video shows just how close a Chinese military ship came to a U.S. destroyer. And a British court could witness something not seen in more than 100 years. A senior royal giving evidence. We'll have details of the case involving Prince Harry and a live report from London. We begin this hour with the battle to win over Republican voters in the race for the White House. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is trying to set herself apart from the Republican frontrunners. She took part in a CNN town hall Sunday night in Iowa to try and convince voters why they should pick her over former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and others. For the first time since she's been on the campaign trail, Haley said she is against gun restrictions known as red flag laws. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't trust government to deal with red flag laws. I don't trust that they won't take them away from people who rightfully deserve to have them because you've got someone else judging whether someone should have a gun or not. It is a constitutional right that people can protect and defend themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK:  Haley also answered questions about her stance on Social Security entitlements and abortion policy. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley making a generational appeal to Republican voters in Iowa on Sunday night at a CNN town hall, telling voters she's in it to win it, making clear that she's trying to elevate her candidacy in the growing field of Republican candidates. She did so by taking direct aim at former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, particularly on Social Security and Medicare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he has a big piece of the party. Ultimately, they're going to have to make a strong case to convince Republican voters to move past him. They're not there yet. I mean, that's the short answer.They're beginning to circle around themes. Ron DeSantis saying, you know, you need two terms to finish this. We have a culture of losing. I'm not sure and Nikki Haley is saying we need a new generation of leaders. All of this seems to me still a little oblique and indirect. Seventy-five percent or so of Republican voters were satisfied with the Donald Trump presidency. Over 70 percent of them think that he actually won in 2020 despite all the evidence of the contrary. You're going to need to give them a good reason to move past him. No one is quite there yet.",

Ron DeSantis is in a stronger position as a Trump alternative, I think, than any single individual alternative was in 2016, whether it was Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or John Kasich. I think DeSantis has the capacity to consolidate more of the Republicans hesitant about Trump than any of those did, but he is not kind of an infinite capacity.And there is, in fact, a kind of overlap of the dynamic, a repeat of the dynamic of 2016 in this sense. In 2016, Donald Trump won about half of the Republicans without a college degree. He only won about a third of the Republicans with a degree. But the rest of those white- collar Republicans never consolidated around a single alternative to him. That's the risk, I think, for Republicans. Again, many of these candidates getting into the race, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, Tim Scott, even probably DeSantis, ultimately, they appeal more to the white-collar side of the party than to the blue- collar side of the party that is Trump's strength. And so, there is the risk, but there's too little competition for Trump in effect in his pool and too much competition for the pool of voters who are the most skeptical of him.",

I mean, the ends and the means were so out of whack here that it really gives you the feeling that the main reason for this fight among Republicans was to show their voters that they were having this fight.The resolution that this shows you, Biden's approach to the presidency, I think, very concisely in miniature. You know, he has at times raised very sharp objections to Republicans, to MAGA Republicans, but by and large, his instinct is to make the system work rather than trying to call out Republicans as a threat to it. And here in the end, he abandoned his position, which had really been the position of Obama as well after 2011, of not negotiating over the debt ceiling, not seeming to want to reward hostage taking to in fact negotiate a surprisingly good deal from the point of view of Democrats. Republicans didn't get a heck of a lot of what they wanted, but they got something of what they wanted. And in that sense, he did reward the hostage-taking. And so, this is, you know, this is kind of the tightrope of the Biden presidency, trying to call out the breaking of norms, the threat to small D (ph) democracy represented by the Trump faction within the GOP, but also trying to show that he can work with at least some of the Republicans and make the system work. He has certainly been able to reach more bipartisan deals than many people, myself included, expected. But he is presiding over an era in which you are seeing these kinds of mounting threats to democracy. And you have on the Democratic side, those who wish he would be more aggressive at calling it out and less focused on trying to grease the system and keep it functioning.",

The pilot not responsive as this flight was going from Elizabethton, north -- sorry -- in Tennessee, and then to MacArthur Airport on Long Island.But the plane then turned and overshot its original destination by about 300 miles. That is when NORAD scrambled F-16s in pursuit of this plane.

And that is an issue because there is layer of layer of restricted airspace there.Planes that are unresponsive typically are not allowed through. They must be talking to air traffic control and squawking a discrete transponder code. If they do not have those things, that is what raises alarm bells at the FAA command center in Warrenton, Virginia. That is why these fighter jets were sent in pursuit. NORAD also says that these fighter jets came up to this plane. The Cessna Citation Jet seats between about seven and 11 people and fired off flares to try and to get the attention of the crew. But the pilot was apparently unconscious at the controls and the plane crashed into a rural area not too far from Stanton, Virginia near Charlottesville.

The commander of the armed forces put out another one just over a week ago, trailing the Western weapons that we assume will be used in this counteroffensive.They're keeping the Russians guessing assuming that this sort of -- this ramp up in suspense will stop them from being able to regroup and retool, take some kind of operational pause. So, you see that as well. And I think on the Russian side as well, the ministry of defense has put out this video alongside those claims that they have thwarted what they're calling a large-scale Ukrainian offensive. They say they've destroyed a large amount of Ukrainian weapons and troops. They even said that General Gerasimov, who is the commander of the Russian armed forces and the head of the operation in Ukraine was in a forward command and control position during this period. So, they are making a lot of this. As you said, though, Ukraine has not confirmed this. We have not been able to verify it ourselves. But they are clearly also putting out their own information here. And the Ukrainian side is also warning about this. The Strategic Communications Directorate of the Ukrainian Armed Forces saying that Russia is intensifying its information operations, including around this counteroffensive and will be putting out more false information. But as for the counteroffensive itself, we are, it seems, moving closer. President Zelenskyy in the middle of May said we need more time.

We saw a slow and averaging rate build (ph), but we did see in the last Wednesday report from the labor department certain numbers that, you know, the increase of job openings. So, that obviously puts a wrench into the Fed, which then goes 10 times in a row. We've seen the increase in the rate.
