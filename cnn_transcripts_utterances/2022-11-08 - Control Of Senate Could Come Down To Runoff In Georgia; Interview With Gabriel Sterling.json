We're just kind of getting confirmation and hoping you can help us figure it out. We've learned that a mother and son were removed as poll workers in Fulton County just minutes before the polls opened at a specific poll site. They were removed because of a social media post. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that two poll workers were removed specifically because of posts that showed them attending the January 6th attack on the U.S. capitol. Do you have any information on this and what happened? GABRIEL STERLING, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE: I am aware it occurred but it is a Fulton County internal issue. They have to mitigate the risk the way they see fit given the information. I think it would have been better if they found out earlier potentially and worked with the people. But since it was so last minute and it came to light so late, I leave it to them to make Fulton County to make those decisions. But, yes, that did happen early this morning.",

I'm curious what you're seeing on day of voting. I know the early voting was a record for a midterm election, so high, in fact, that it matched the 2020 early voting turnout, which is highly relevant because it's comparing to a presidential year and also during COVID, right, when people were able to early vote.

And the processing time we've taken for our poll workers, we do know is an average of 48 seconds. So it's been a very efficient process. The system is working great. As you pointed out, we set records for early vote turnout. Between early vote and absentee -- and absentee set a new record as of this morning of 234,000 for a midterm.

But Gabe alluded to it, there was advanced tabulation, which is a result of some of the questions and question marks that were raised in the 2020 election. We went to work in a bipartisan format in Georgia and came up with early ways to tabulate, not count, not release the information, not influence the vote, but allow these counties for weeks to be able to tabulate so they can quicker return those and just remove some doubt. One other interesting point was we're going to require each county by 10:00 tonight, to release the total number of votes outstanding, not what those votes are.

They don't feel like this day or this week or this midterm election is going to be a definitive judgment on the president's record, nor do they believe it will be a definitive judgment on whether he can win in 2024.

So as the system approaches -- and again, the track has been fluctuating somewhat -- we bring it in a category 1 or very close to it, as you mentioned. But look where it crisscrosses.
