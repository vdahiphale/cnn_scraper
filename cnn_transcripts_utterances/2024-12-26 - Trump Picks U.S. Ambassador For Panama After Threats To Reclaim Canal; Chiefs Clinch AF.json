      "sentences": "All right, let's talk all things politics now with Democratic strategist Matt Bennett and former Republican strategist and pollster Lee Carter. Thank you both for being here on this holiday week.Let's talk first about what seems to -- it sounds like a little bit of an obsession here. Trump has picked his ambassador to Panama after demanding that Panama hand over the Panama Canal. The Wall Street Journal editorial board had this to say about Trump's thoughts on Panama. It says, \"Forgive us if we missed it, but we don't recall Donald Trump campaigning to invade Panama and retake its famous canal. But there was the President-elect on the weekend, threatening our Central American ally with punishment if it doesn't meet his demands.\" The board goes on to say, \"It's hard to know how seriously to take Mr. Trump's broadsides. But threatening a takeover that would require an invasion may court more trouble than he imagines.\" So I guess the question is for you, Lee, what is this recent thirst for land grabs suddenly? Where is this coming from? LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER, STRATEGIC OMMUNICATIONS EXPERT (via Webex by Cisco):  I wish I could tell you that I knew where it was coming from. I think with Donald Trump we often don't know where these things come from. But I think he does have this affinity for grand gestures and symbolic moments. I think the Panama Canal, to him, represents a lot of things for America and open trade in winning again, and I think that's what he is after. It does seem -- like The New York Times (sic) said, he didn't campaign on this so I'm not exactly sure where it came from. But it's certainly in line with the kinds of things that he does. He wants America to be winning again so to speak.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Just to be clear, it was The Wall Street Journal and they're not exactly anti-Donald Trump making this statement.For you, Matt, what do you think this signals as to what the next term is going to look like? MATT BENNETT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CO- FOUNDER, THIRD WAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY ASSISTANT, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION (via Webex by Cisco):  I mean, it signals chaos. It's as if Trump took out a world map and started throwing darts and decided to threaten whatever country the darts land. I mean, Greenland, Panama, Canada. No one saw any of this coming because this is what Donald Trump does. He stirs chaos. Sometimes it has strategic value for him because it distracts from other things he doesn't want to be talking about, but sometimes it just seems completely bizarre and made up. Meanwhile, the world is a very dangerous place. He is threatening to abandon our allies in Ukraine. He's threatening to abandon the work that we've done in Syria to stabilize that incredibly dangerous part of the world where ISIS could be resurgent and threaten the United States. He is threatening to abandon our allies in Taiwan, which produces the ships that we desperately need for our most high tech stuff. And now he's obsessed with Panama and Greenland. None of this makes any sense. And I think what it signals is that we're back to the Donald Trump that we knew in his first term, which is he wakes up every day and just stirs chaotic, bizarre things and drives the news with that.",

There is no ambiguity about what we should be doing here. All of our allies agree we should be arming and helping the Ukrainians as the Biden team has done -- probably even more than the Biden team has done. But Trump has threatened the opposite, and you know how close he feels to Vladimir Putin. So I think the prospects for Ukraine are very grim unless -- let's hope this signals some kind of change.",

But I also know that Donald Trump does use the tough rhetoric that he does as ways of negotiating, as we were just talking about.And so when he talks about if he were in office Putin would never have done this, when he talks about saying he's going to walk away, I think a lot of that is signals to Putin on how things are going to be. And I think he's going to -- he's trying to say that it's going to be a very different moment when he comes into office. And I think he does believe that he's going to be able to make change over there through negotiations rather than having to invest all the money that we've had to invest over time.

That was his Christmas message.President-elect Donald Trump says he will direct the Department of Justice also to vigorously pursue the death penalty after that pardon from Joe Biden by almost all -- less than three -- 40 -- 37 of the 40 federal death row inmates.

Kennedy Jr. Number five: Charles filed in the death of Matthew Perry. Two doctors and Perry's assistant are among five people charged in connection with his overdose death. One of the doctors allegedly said, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay for ketamine prescriptions?\" Three people have pleaded guilty. One of the doctors is awaiting trial along with an alleged dealer prosecutors say is known as the \"Ketamine Queen.\" The Perry family relieved that charges were filed nearly a year after the beloved actor died in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home. KEITH MORRISON, MATTHEW PERRY'S STEPFATHER:  People who have put themselves in the business of supplying people with the drugs that'll kill them, they are now on notice that it doesn't matter what your professional credentials are. You're going down, baby.",
