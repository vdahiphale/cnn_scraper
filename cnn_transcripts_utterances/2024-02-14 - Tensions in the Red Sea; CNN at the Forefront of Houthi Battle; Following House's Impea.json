They've been launching missiles and drones into the Red Sea, targeting commercial ships as well as U.S. and coalition forces in the Red Sea for several months now.And it's really hard to overstate the really frenetic pace of operations on board the Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier where we were embedded for several days with fighter jets taking off every hour, 50 plus flights per day. So, these fighters are in the air and ready to respond at a moment's notice if necessary to strike targets inside Yemen to take out these missiles and these drones as needed. Now, we also got the opportunity to go inside the command center of a U.S. warship, the USS Gravely, which is the tip of the spear of this fight against the Houthis as well. That is the ship that most often, as long with other destroyers, shoots down these incoming missiles and drones that the Houthis have been launching. And we really got a sense for just how quickly the crew has to respond when they see an incoming missile coming out of Yemen. Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  No, the result last night is not something, in my view, that Democrats should celebrate too much. Think about what happened there. They spent about $15 million to win a seat that President Biden won by eight points. They won it by less than eight points. Their candidate ran like a Republican. He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration because everybody knows that's the top issue that is on the concern of the hearts and minds of everybody. That incumbent had been a three-term member of Congress and he had a hundred percent name ID and a deep family history in the district. Our candidate was relatively unknown in that comparison and had a very short runway. She ran a remarkable campaign. You know, there was a weather event that affected turnout. There are a lot of factors there. That is in no way a bellwether of what's going to happen this fall. We are absolutely convinced. I've been to 17 states in the last 12 weeks. I'm telling you, whether I'm out west, on Long Island, in the Deep South, midsouth, in Midwest, it doesn't matter. There is a fervor among the American people and it is bipartisan. People know that this country is on the wrong track. 74 percent in the latest poll believe that the country's on the wrong track. Why? Because of the leadership from the White House. They see what is happening. President Biden has the lowest approval rating of any president who has ever run for re-election. I think it's 37 percent in the latest poll. It goes down precipitously. And the reason is because of his -- all the things we've talked about today. It is a total lack of leadership. And now, more and more Americans have made their own opinion about his fitness for office. And so, I think that's going to have a big effect in the fall as well. So, New York 3, was what it was. But that has nothing to do on the efforts going forward. Manu.",

You've all heard us hammer over and over, H.R.2, right, that was our signature piece of legislation that we passed many, many months ago, last year.And the reason that all those components are important, again, is because they have to fit together. That's got to solve the problem. You have to address all of them. The Senate bill didn't do that, and that's why it was rejected over there. We have to do it. It's been mentioned that I've been requesting a meeting with the president for weeks now. A month. I've been asking to sit down with the president to talk about the border and talk about national security. And that meeting has not been granted. And I'm going to continue to insist on that because they're very serious issues that need to be addressed. And if the Speaker of the House can't meet with the President of the United States, that's a problem. I don't know why they're uncomfortable having the President sit across the table from me, but I will go in good faith because we have to solve this issue and do every single thing we can. And as you know, he has a broad arsenal of executive authority that he could use right now, he could have used yesterday, he could have used months ago to stem the flow. That's not our view. That's what the law says, and we've spelled that out. We also documented 64 specific actions that he took from the day he walked into the Oval Office and his agencies to open that border wide and create this catastrophe.

We're going to continue to demand that before we take care of issues all around the world, we take care of our own first. And I'm telling you, that is not a campaign message. That is the truth. And that is what resonates in the hearts of the American people. We are on their side, and it's the side of common sense. It's the side of security. It's the side of stability.

You, yourself, were part of killing the Senate, compromised it, but you called it dead on arrival from what you knew.

You can't leave giant loopholes and codify some of the things that have gotten us into this situation. So, what we're doing right now is we -- the House is working its will. The House Republican conference, we just met an hour ago with all the members and there are lots of ideas on the table of how to address these issues. We will address the issues. We'll do our duty on that matter, and all that begins in earnest right now. We have to address this seriously.

People aren't as concerned about that.And on the other hand, you have the, you know, concentration of the migrant and crime issue in New York City that is broadcast intensely by the New York City media, and yet Democrats won again. And they won, you know, in a way that was very reminiscent of what we saw in 2022 and the elections of 2023 where, you know, Tom Suozzi himself said that Joe Biden was underwater in the district. And yet, as we saw in those earlier elections, a substantial slice of voters who are dissatisfied with Biden still were unwilling to vote for Republicans. And I do think that Suozzi pointed them toward a message that is going to be about something along the lines of a modernized Truman-esque do nothing Congress.

Republican messaging on the issue of immigration, a bill that they believe that they should pass is essentially going nowhere in the United States Senate.Also, there's been a lot of debate, John, in the halls of Congress in the aftermath of last night.

And every year only about seven cases of the plague in humans are reported here in the United States. In the state of Oregon, this most recent case is the first confirmed case since 2015. So, this is rare. The person was treated with antibiotics pretty quickly. The pet cat was treated. The person's close contacts were given medication to prevent this from spreading. But it does, you know, raise questions around how this does emerge occasionally, and the symptoms can include having swollen, painful lymph nodes, fever, headache, chills. Again, there's no need to panic. The risk of this spreading is very low.
