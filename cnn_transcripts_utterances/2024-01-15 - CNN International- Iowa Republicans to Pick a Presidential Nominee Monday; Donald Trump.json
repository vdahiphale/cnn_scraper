(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump delivered a very lengthy final message to Iowa caucus goers encouraging them to brave the storm, to even brave their own health. Part of the big goal of Donald Trump and his team is to get as many people out there to caucus on Monday night as possible. All of this because they are looking for the widest margin they can possibly win by to set the tone for primary season. Donald Trump was pushing that narrative on Sunday. Here's what he said.",

We know that he has been telling people close to him that he is concerned about the weather, that he is concerned about turnout. And a lot of this isn't just about getting the biggest amount of delegates. It's also about setting momentum and stopping momentum going into New Hampshire from any of his GOP rivals, particularly when it comes to Nikki Haley.His team has been watching her very closely. They have seen her poll numbers ticking up. They are already spending millions of dollars attacking her in ads in New Hampshire. However, they are hoping that a big win, a big showing in Iowa would crush some of that momentum. The other part of this is that Donald Trump has been concerned that because of the fact that he has been leading by so much in the polls, that people will become complacent, that they won't show up because they think that Donald Trump already has enough support. So, again, big part of his message going into the caucuses is show up no matter what happens. The very most important thing you can do is show up in caucus. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Indianola, Iowa.

No, this is 30 degrees colder than we should be in Des Moines. Somewhere around 26 degrees Fahrenheit will be the high for today on a normal day. That's just not going to happen. We're 30 degrees colder than that. Something else that's happened here. This, up to this point, has been the warmest winter on record. So many things are not acclimated for this.

I'm wondering what this election is really about, this caucus, because Trump is so far ahead. It's very difficult to see either of the other two coming close. So is it about coming second?THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Max. It's great to be with you, as always. I think that it is about coming in second. Right now the odds that there's some kind of an upset in Iowa I think are about the same as Trump admitting that he lost the 2020 election. It's just hard to imagine. The last Des Moines Register poll had Trump at 48 percent compared to Haley at 20 percent and DeSantis at 16 percent. That is an enormous lead. And I think in the last 40 or so years, no candidate has gone into a contested primary with that kind of margin and lost. The last time we had a candidate with an even comparable number was George W. Bush, who was polling at about 60 percent in 2000, and he went on to beat John McCain. But ultimately, you're right. This is about second place. It's about who's getting momentum heading into New Hampshire. I think for Nikki Haley, it's less do or die. But for Ron DeSantis, who's really staked his entire campaign on Iowa, he needs to come in second. Otherwise, I think that his campaign is effectively dead.",

It's much more Christian. It's much more smaller towns in the country as a whole. So in some ways, I think it is difficult to extrapolate.The same goes for New Hampshire, where there's just a history of much more independent streak. So, you know, these early primaries, they don't matter, I think, as much because they are a bellwether on how much voters are going to support one or the other candidate. But they matter because of momentum. Momentum is everything. And if Trump, particularly in this context, is able to get out to a strong lead, I think he's going to squash the competition and it's just going to be a coronation from there.",

I think it's difficult, though, to project who it's likely to help and who it's likely to hurt.It will probably depress turnout among retirees and older voters, and that is disproportionately part of Trump's base. But at the same time, Trump's voters are more enthusiastic. So if you think about it, who's more likely to brave the snow and subzero weather? It's the true believers. And if you can say one thing about the MAGA base, it's that there are a lot of true believers. But I think Donald Trump is concerned that his lead has been so great and he's been presenting himself so much as this inevitable candidate that a lot of voters might just say, well, it's a done deal. I'll go home and I won't turn out to the polls. So I think for Trump, he really wants to get at least 50 percent of the vote. I think that that's the threshold, because his whole rationale up until this point for not participating in the debates and for saying that all the other candidates should drop out has been that he has more than half of the electorate. So if he comes in much less than that, I think it's maybe somewhat of a problem. And in that case, Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis probably will spill blood going into New Hampshire.",

This is significant for Taiwan, and it comes at a crucial time that yet another country, that now the 10th country under the past eight years of President Tsai's two-term presidency, has cut ties with Taiwan. So Taiwan learned just a matter of hours ago that the small Pacific island nation of Nauru has cut ties for the second time. They did it back in 2002, and then they resumed ties with Taiwan in 2005. Now, just for context here, Taiwan only has, out of the entire world, just a dozen, 12 remaining diplomatic allies, and mainly small countries in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America. Countries that get a considerable amount of financial concessions from the Taiwanese government in order to maintain that formal diplomatic relationship that provides some semblance of legitimacy, that this government, you know, formal diplomatic legitimacy. They don't have formal diplomatic ties with most countries around the world, including, of course, the United States and China, which has never recognized their country and their government as legitimate. So, you know, just hours, literally hours or days after the election on Saturday for this yet another country to sever diplomatic ties and then, you know, be welcomed into the diplomatic fold by Beijing, this is yet another example from the Taiwanese perspective of this diplomatic isolation, in addition to the sanctions that China has slapped on this self-governing democracy, in addition to the military intimidation, whether it be spy balloons or drones or a satellite launch that traveled over southern Taiwan or military exercises that happened in the Taiwan Strait after Nancy Pelosi's visit and other times subsequently.

And China, of course, has been blasting any country, any government that has congratulated Taiwan on its election success, including to president-elect Lai himself, not just the United States, but also the U.K., Canada and Japan.The Chinese foreign minister who was actually in Cairo on a previously scheduled trip using that location to reinforce his government's claim over Taiwan, pointing to the 1943 Cairo Declaration as yet another proof of Taiwan being part of China has been a decades-long international consensus. Even though that declaration is not without controversies and has been open to different interpretations. But still, with all this perceived added urgency and increasing importance of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a lot of experts say Beijing's hands may be somewhat tight right now because they're facing a lot of domestic challenges. And I will mention some of the practical reasons that we may not see a lot of drastic actions just yet, given the weather in the Taiwan Strait and also what Beijing may not want to give Lai more ammunition to bolster his arguments against the Chinese threats before he formally takes office. But perhaps most importantly, Xi Jinping has been investing a lot of his credibility in recent months to tamp down tensions with the West, especially with the U.S. in a crucial election year.
