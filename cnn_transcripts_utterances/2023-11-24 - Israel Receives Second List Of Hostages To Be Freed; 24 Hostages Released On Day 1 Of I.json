For many, these are disturbing scenes, nine-year-old Ohad Munder being embraced as he's set free, an old woman being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. After 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through the border into Egypt and to freedom. Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. Then the hostages, including 10 Thais, a Filipino and the 13 Israeli women and children, disembarking for checks. Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment, they all finally re-entered the country, a step, says the Israeli prime minister, towards bringing all hostages home.",

At the same time, I also want to raise a voice for the families that did not see their loved ones yesterday, did not get a phone call last night that they should expect them today. And we still have so many people in the hands of these vicious terrorists from my community. We're talking about two young girls, sisters and two fathers that their families want to have them back, and an elderly woman, and grandmother. And so we want all of them back. And I think Hamas is really playing very, very vicious, very cruel psychological game here with this information, right? One of the women that was released yesterday, a few days ago, they announced that she was dead, now she's alive with us. So, what they're doing with disinformation and really a psychological warfare is tormenting to these families.

But you also see the worry. And the worry is about how this pause can somehow translate into something that holds back the IDF from advancing in the Gaza Strip. People want this operation, this war, to achieve its goals. It wants -- people want Hamas to be toppled. They want Hamas leadership to be eliminated or brought to justice, and they're not going to budge. And I think this thing doesn't transcend sometimes, internationally speaking. People think that this pause might be the beginning of a ceasefire. No. And we're polling this. We're seeing this. It's like 95 percent, 90 percent, who are saying, you don't stop this war until you finish off with Hamas. We're not going to allow you to do that unless you take down this threat on our borders.

Earlier today, the United Nations reported 137 trucks of humanitarian aid have made their way into Gaza, marking the largest delivery of aid since Israel's total blockade happened immediately after those October 7th attacks. Of course, the complex hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas has held in its first day, but there are still big questions. What does day two look like? Will it make it through the days ahead? For more on that now, joining me is Axios Foreign Policy Reporter Barak Ravid, who is incredibly well-sourced in the region.

There's no reason to think that the Israeli military will not resume the operation in the south, as my two friends that you spoke to before, Amir and Nadav, said, the Israeli public overwhelmingly supports the continuance of this war.

And while President Biden said today he makes no guarantees, he remains hopeful that at least some U.S. citizens will be in the next group to be freed.

So I, you know, you know, you know, this truth, it's fragile, right, Alex? And the first round seemed to go as planned. Now we're awaiting the second round. Did President Biden give any indication on whether American hostages would be released in this next wave? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: All he said, Pam, is that he hopes that will be the case, that the expectation is that the three American women and children who are believed to be part of this group of 50 will come out in the next few days. He indicated during a press conference earlier today, and he's up on Nantucket in Massachusetts for the Thanksgiving holiday, that was the hope and the expectation, but, and that he expected to get a list from Israel. We know that every night before a release that Hamas gives Israel a list of who they plan to release the next day. Israel has said that they have that list. But the Biden administration right now, we have asked repeatedly, has not told us whether any Americans are on the list for tomorrow. Now, there was a major concern about how today would go. It appears to have gone well, and there were no major issues. So it's a good first step. But, you know, this is an extremely fluid situation. The hope for the Biden administration right now is that two American women and that young will be released, if not tomorrow, then in the next few days. Here's a little bit more of what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We don't know when that will occur, but we're gonna be expected to occur.

Then the second priority is to try to extend that pause for, say, several days.The hope is that Hamas is going to use these pauses to go around and get a better sense of where these different groups of hostages are. Remember, we've reported that they've spread out throughout the Gaza Strip. They're with different factions of Hamas. They're with different groups, even gangs. And so that Hamas will be able to essentially round up more women and children and perhaps more of the foreigners like the ones we saw today and be able to release those. President Biden said today that a major priority right now is also to get in humanitarian aid. And that has been one of the major obstacles has been the fighting. And he said, we're not wasting any minute to try to get more aid in. The deal that was struck was for some 200 trucks of aid per day. But Pam, I think there's a major question of what happens after this pause is over, no matter how long it lasts, whether it's four days a week, 10 days. Israel has made clear they want to get back to the fighting and to dismantle Hamas, while we have known that the Biden administration has been increasingly uncomfortable with the way that Israel is prosecuting this war, with the civilian death toll and this extraordinary destruction that we've seen in Gaza.",

So it makes sense that the first hostages that would be released would present with relatively good health and be able to demonstrate their kind of the wellbeing. What makes this so complicated is we don't have great insight into the additional hostages.In some case, they could be withholding information about loved ones that have already perished or are in critical condition. And that's going to complicate this dynamic. As you know, this has been a hard- fought kind of agreement between parties who are actually currently in hostilities. But the key points of being able to verify and build that trust and be able to really pin down key pieces of information, that is critically difficult in a war zone. And where Hamas specifically has very fractured communication and fractions and sex within itself, that it doesn't have complete control over.",

In the business, we call that proof of life. That's critically important to be able to show that you have loved ones and that they are in good condition and then working toward the safe release of them.So we're still in a very, very fragile place. And each one of these releases will be providing sort of the momentum for the next releases. So critical that these continue to go off without a hitch.",
