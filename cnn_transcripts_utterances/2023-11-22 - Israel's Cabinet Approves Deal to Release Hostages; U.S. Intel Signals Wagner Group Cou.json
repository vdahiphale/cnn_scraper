It's 5It comes after an intense six hour-long meeting in Tel Aviv. Those said to be freed are expected to be women and children. In exchange, Israel says it will pause its fighting in Gaza for four days. Hamas says the deal includes 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, to be released from Israeli jails. More humanitarian aid would also be allowed into Gaza with hundreds of trucks carrying fuel and supplies. President Biden issued a statement saying, quote: Today's deal should bring home additional American hostages and I will not stop until they are all released. Three Americans could be released in this batch, including a three- year-old girl, Abigail Idan. Her great aunt spoke to CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ HIRSH NAFTALI, GREAT AUNT OF 3-YEAR-OLD HOSTAGE ABIGAIL EDAN: The one thing that we all hold on to is that hope that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday, Friday is her fourth birthday. We actually need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to be -- to believe it. (END VIDOE CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kasie.Right now, as part of the legal and political process to get this truly over the finish line, there is a 24 hour window in which appeals can be filed to the Israeli Supreme Court against this deal. As that process plays out, we are awaiting the agreement to begin. That is the pause in fighting, as we understand it, there is still fighting going on and got as we speak, and then the prisoner exchange, the release of hostages from Hamas and Gaza, for the release of Palestinian prisoners, here. So, that, we expect just on that 24 hour window of appeals, to begin sometime tomorrow morning. We'll see if there are additional hurdles, but it is incredible to have gotten to this point after weeks of very sensitive negotiations. Now, it is also interesting to point out, this first tranche has 50 Israeli women and children released from Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons. But the Israeli government put out a list of 300 names and said, in announcing the agreement, that for every ten Israelis released, there would be another day of pause in the fighting and that would lead to another 30 Palestinian prisoners released. So, it seems that Israel is setting up for the possibility that the pause in fighting lasts more than four days.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. We have spoken with a number of the families of the hostages who say they are still anxious. They were nervous up until the agreement was finally formalized and agreed to by the Israeli government. They knew they were close, but until they were over the line and had that agreement in place, they knew it could still fall apart, and that, in and of itself, rate them very nervous.But amongst the families of the 240 hostages, there is, generally speaking, broad support. They know their loved ones may not be on that first list, but it is a process that is beginning and at least one family we spoke with says, look, the first 50 could lead to more, and this process could get going. The important part is to get enough of a relationship in place that these discussions can continue and it is obviously much more easier to continue the discussions on the release of more hostages after the first batch is released, instead of having to start from square zero. Now, it's worth noting that 50 hostages is only about 20 percent of the 240 hostages. It is only women and children, so there are no men included. And crucially, from what we understand, there is nobody who is the age of being a soldier in the Israeli military, or perhaps even a reservist. It is possible Hamas wants to extract a far higher price for that group. So, even if we are at this point, there is still a long way to go until all of the hostages are home.",

I don't know, Hamas may have kept all these people totally isolated but that would be quite a challenge. So, they might be able to get information on the status of -- and the condition of other hostages that are still out there. That would be number one.Number two, I would imagine that the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, would want to know some sense of the Hamas soldiers that are still out there. What kind of condition are they in, mentally, physically, because they have been taking a pounding as well for the last several weeks. And then, I think the third part will be a sense of location. I mean, what -- where were you, what kind of tunnels, what kind of weapons, what did you see? Now, of course, you know, children will have -- may not be as effective and doing this given their trauma, but they still will have seen things. So, I expect the IDF will be skilled and patient in how they try to find out more.",

So, while it might not be ideal from a purely military standpoint, what is most important is accomplished in the political objective. And the government, of course, has been under enormous pressure from their own population as well as from the U.S. to do something to get these hostages -- to start getting the hostages moving and to get them home.So, I think the Israeli Defense Force probably was not real keen on any sort of a pause. I mean, this also tells me that Hamas is really under pressure as well, that they are finally -- to finally make a deal like this and release 50 hostages, if this happens, means they have been getting pounded. Now, the thing that was most -- would have been most annoying to me was the fact that, supposedly, there's going to be a window of time every day when they can not have drones overhead. You don't like to be a genius to figure out that Hamas will use that time to move some things around. But, the Israelis of course have more than just overhead drone capabilities, so, I think they probably calculated what the risk, the cost might be, and I mentioned they will also continue to be able to do things that are non-kinetic, such as continue searching for tunnels, clearing things out, trying to make the best out of the situation.

The word cease-fire is very loaded. But the reality is there are so many different groups in Gaza that sort of act independently. They may be talking a little bit to each other, but they act independently of each other. If one of them violates this so-called truce and there is a rocket that goes off or is fired at Israel, how does that impact what we expect to see over the next couple of days?",

As you say, there are three groups, we understand, holding hostages, in Gaza. That's what a lot of intelligence is suggesting.So, if there is some sort of politics between those two groups, a rocket goes off, the truce will be over. These are all details which we are trying to get confirmation on from Israel. I mean, what is their bar for a break in that truce? They may have a different view. We need to find out from them, but there is, you know, experts are saying it would be over if a rocket came over. It would also, of course, play to the far right in Israel, which wasn't really happy with this truce, anyway, their view, or some of the politicians and that sphere of politics view is that you should never ever negotiate with terrorists. And they will be proved right, arguably, if truce is broken by Hamas, which they view as terrorists breaking the truce.",
