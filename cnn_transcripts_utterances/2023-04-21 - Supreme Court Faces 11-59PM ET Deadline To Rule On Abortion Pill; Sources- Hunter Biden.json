Any moment, the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on the most critical abortion case since it overturned Roe v. Wade last year. The justices have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern this evening to decide the future of the widely used abortion pill mifepristone. The bill is currently available, though a Texas judge moved to block the medication's approval and an appeals court headquartered in Louisiana decided to impose tough restrictions on how that medication can be accessed, at what point during the pregnancy it can be available and who is allowed to prescribe it. The high court now has to decide if any of that will stand. Let's get straight to CNN's Jessica Schneider. And, Jessica, what options does the Supreme Court have here? And when are they going to let us know what they've decided?",

It's possible they could institute another very short stay. But what's likely here is that all these justices, there may be justices, I should say, writing to either concur or dissent from the decision that really could come down at any time.So if they do issue maybe a longer stay or otherwise, there are several options here, including that the Supreme Court could decide to hear this case on the merit before the end of the term, but what's really likely is that the justices will do one of two things. First of all, they could impose that longer term stay, which would put a hold on any restrictions, and it would maintain the status quo until this appeals process plays out. Of course, arguments in the Fifth it has already been scheduled in less than a month on May 17th or as the FDA is fearing, the Supreme Court could allow some or all of these restrictions to take effect. That could mean that women beyond seven weeks of pregnancy would not be able to take the drug, even though they can get it right now up to 10 weeks. It could also impose more in person requirements for seeing a doctor and it could eliminate the mail option to receive this drug. So, Jake, there is a lot at stake here, and it really does seem to be coming down to the wire as we approach midnight.",

They were hoping that when we reported the case was heating up last summer that there would be charges, but that cases continue to linger. So instead, they're taking it to the court of public opinion.But this letter is in no way as significant as a possible whistleblower who could come out and potentially undermined the handling of the Justice Department's investigation.

The justices have until 11:59 eastern this evening to decide the future of a widely used abortion pill, the most crucial abortion case since the court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. At stake, the availability of mifepristone, the first in a two-drug regimen used to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks. That pill is used in about half of the abortions across the U.S. It's also prescribed after miscarriages and for some women experiencing menopause. If the pill is restricted or banned in the U.S., Canadian officials now say they are prepared to provide access to the pill to Americans. Let's get straight to CNN Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic. Joan, when do we expect to hear from the court? And what are the options here?",
