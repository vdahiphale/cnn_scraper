Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both on the campaign trail, with events as we speak in states neither can afford to lose. Donald Trump has three stops planned in North Carolina. He is currently in the western part of the state, holding an event after visiting hurricane ravaged Asheville. We're going to take you back there later this hour.And then, in suburban Philadelphia. The vice president is with Liz Cheney making an aggressive push to independents and moderate Republicans. They've got three events together there today. Let's listen in right now.",

      "sentences": "-- young sons and I thought to myself, you know, in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, are they going to grow up in a country where we don't have to worry about the peaceful transfer of power? Are they going to grow up in a country where that is guaranteed? And I believe that every one of us in this election has a duty and an obligation to do what we know is right for the country, and that's to support Vice President Harris. So, I'm very honored to be here and to do that.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If I can just echo the congresswoman's point, so I've now as vice president, met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings. Many of them multiple times to the point we're on a first name basis. And the last few times I've seen them in the relative eve of this election, they are very concerned our allies. Because, as you know, when we walk in those rooms around the world, representing the United States of America, we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back. With the self- appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracies and rule of law. But as all the role models here know, as a role model, people want what you do to see if it lines up with what you say. People around the world are watching this, and I tell you, sometimes I do fret a bit about whether we as Americans truly understand how important we are to the world. I hope everyone does, really understand that we represent something imperfect, though we certainly are flawed, though we may be. We represent in terms of our ideals, the basis of our constitution. We represent a gold standard. And when we have someone who has been president, who wants to be president again, who is saying he would be dictator on day one, would weaponize our Department of Justice. One of the principles of our democracy is that we say we have a justice system that is blind, that is not punitive against one's enemies. They are watching. So, this is about direct impact on the American people, and it most certainly will impact people around the world. SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER, \"THE BULWARK\": You know, I'm so glad that you brought that up, and I -- as a follow up, I would just ask Congressman Cheney to, we live in a dangerous time. I mean, I think Americans are watching what's happening overseas, in Ukraine, in Israel. Republicans, we used to be the party that would be on the side of our democratic allies like Ukraine. Talk to me a little bit and all of us about why from a foreign policy standpoint, you find yourself able to endorse Democrats who wouldn't -- didn't used to be that way?",

And let's please not overlook how someone who wants to be commander in chief and was, has talked about our service men and women. Has talked about an American hero like John McCain, was a prisoner of war. Said he didn't respect him, didn't like him because he got caught.Has talked about our service members as though they are less than the most courageous of us. Those who put on the uniform who represent the United States of America, who are willing to die for the sake of everything we stand for, and he calls them suckers and losers. These things cannot be overlooked. And I have said many times publicly, and I'll say it again in many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious. There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. These are the things that are at stake.",

You are a part of what we call the sandwich generation, which are those parents and children who are right in the middle. They are taking care of their young children and taking care of their parents as they age. And it's a lot.And so, I actually plan to address this in a substantial way because I actually bring a personal experience to it as well. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And that work is the work of trying to cook something that they feel like eating, right? Trying to figure out which clothes will not irritate their skin and help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out how you can say something that brings a smile to their face or makes them laugh. It's about dignity. Meanwhile, you have a second grader. You try and teach that kid how to read, spending time with them, reminding them they are special and can be anything. And in the middle of all of that, if you are working or just to have a minute to breathe. It's a lot. It's a lot. So, what the way that this plays out for many people is it's one of just a couple of ways. One, if you have the good fortune of having enough extra money, you can hire somebody to come in, and then exactly as you said, you knowing what you just shared with us about yourself would pay them the value of their work.",

The power of the tornado.So, I've seen that, but that was a much narrower thing, but you certainly didn't want to be in the way of it.

I don't know if people are gambling on them. I can't imagine that's a proper thing to do, but perhaps they are.But one of them just came out, I guess the big one. We're 63 to 33 something like that. That's a pretty big margin. I don't know if they know what they're doing. I have no idea who they are, but it's a very big poll. They quote it all the time on television. And we're at 63, and they're in the 30s, meaning they, meaning her. But I don't think she's qualified to be running and I really don't. And I think she is a threat to democracy, our democracy, the way they took it away from Biden. And I'm not a fan of Biden, but remember this, she got 14 million votes. She got no votes, and she was, in fact, the first one to quit out of 22 people. And she's running. So, you know, you would call that probably a threat to democracy.
