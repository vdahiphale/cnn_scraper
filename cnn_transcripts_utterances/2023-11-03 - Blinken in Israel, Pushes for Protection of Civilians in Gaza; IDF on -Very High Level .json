Award winning Ohio Columnist Connie Schultz joins me live. And Nikki Haley rising in polls after strong debate performances that of course mean Donald Trump is attacking her; the next Republican debate less than a week away. Good day everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am here in Washington Friday, November 3rd. Four days until this year's elections five days to the next Republican Presidential Debate and 367 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". Protecting civilians in Gaza while not forgetting the horrors of the Hamas massacre that sparked the war, those pointed messages coming from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his latest visit to Israel; Blinken talked to reporters after meeting with Israeli Leaders and he recounted in vivid detail images that he saw today that were provided by the Israeli government showing the horror that two young Israeli children experienced while a terrorist blew up their family shelter and then shot and killed their wounded father. Blinken stressed what he says is Israel's right and obligation to defend itself. But he also did say how Israel does that is hugely important. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. We've been clear that as Israel conducts its campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters. It matters because it's the right and lawful thing to do. It matters because failure to do so plays into the hands of Hamas and other terror groups. There will be no partners for peace if they're consumed by humanitarian catastrophe, and alienated by any perceived indifference to their plight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Much of what Secretary Blinken spoke about was the efforts to increase humanitarian aid and shipments into Gaza to help civilians who have been so severely impacted by this war. But there's really no clear movement on the Biden Administration's efforts to try to get Israel to be more restrained in its bombardments, and its attacks in Gaza. In fact, after the meeting, President Benjamin Netanyahu saying this afternoon that they do not support any kind of ceasefire until Hamas releases all of the 241 hostages that it has held for almost a month now. So and this kind of goes in line with what Israeli military officials and political officials have been saying over the last several days, that they fully intend to continue increasing military pressure inside of Gaza on those Hamas fighters. In fact, they are reporting that they have completely surrounded Gaza city and the areas mostly in northern Gaza. And this is the area where Hamas fighters have been launching military strikes and using the sophisticated tunnel systems that stretch for dozens of miles under that civilian population in Gaza. And that is what ground forces in the ground operation inside of Gaza are trying to dismantle. So clearly the Israeli government here shows no willingness to change those plans and those efforts until hostages are released. So Secretary Blinken speaking more about the humanitarian efforts that are being done to help civilians inside of Gaza and also trying to get both sides to look toward the future as to what -- any kind of solution to this will be -- what it will look like in the future.",

Should we be calling for a ceasefire? And he said, I think we should. And you know I followed up with him five seconds later in the halls of Congress. And I asked him to clarify and he said you know, the word ceasefire in Washington has become this really powerful and dangerous for Democrats, you know, to call for it. You see what's happening to progressives in the House who have called for ceasefires. They're being attacked by APAC. They're being attacked from all sides from Republicans, and as well, so I think they're, you know, the definition that Dick Durbin gave is a ceasefire, but he is following in line with Biden and the Biden Administration by calling it a humanitarian pause because they know that the ramifications, the political ramifications of what calling for a ceasefire would mean.",

And a lot of them are still talking about immigration, giving the images they see of the humanitarian crisis on the southern border, more so than abortion. Now Governor Youngkin is actually been forward leaning and said, you know what, I want to tell you what my position is on abortion. We are going to have restrictions after the first trimester, but we're not going to do anything in the first trimester. And they believe that as a winning issue and solution for a lot of these suburban voters to say that's a common position amongst these voters on abortion, that there should be restrictions after the first trimester. But ultimately, it's still the pocketbook issues, not to mention the fact that these Democrat Governors as well as Joe Biden have terrible approval ratings in these swing districts. I looked at a poll at South Jersey last week. It's a Democratic leaning district traditionally. Joe Biden is upside down by 16 points. 16 points in that district right now. Trump is only upside down by six points in his favorable rating. It shows you where the political winds are blowing right now.",

We're all watching Ohio where abortionrights remain the number one focus on the ballot on November 7th.

If majority vote yes, it will establish the right to \"Carry out one's own reproductive decisions including on abortion\". The amendment would still permit bans on abortion after fetal viability around 23 or 24 weeks. Since the overturning of Roe Versus Wade, even red states like Kansas and Kentucky have voted against abortion restrictions. This is a critical test though, as voters will have to affirmatively support abortion rights instead of voting against changing the status quo.
