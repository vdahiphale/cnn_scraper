So, if Donald Trump wants to ask Kamala Harris any questions, he should show up instead of being the scaredy cat he is and running away from all sorts of interviews from CBS 60 Minutes to CNN.He could go on and do a town hall himself with CNN and Anderson Cooper, but he doesn't have the guts to do it. So, until he has the guts and puts on his big boy pants and shows up to answer some questions from an outlet that's not Fox News or a friendly to him, he really has no standing in my book to criticize for Kamala Harris for anything, because she is showing up and she is answering the tough questions. Are the answers always perfect? No. But she's showing up and she's showing the strength and the willingness to answer questions from the American public, which he is not.",

But if you look at that poll this morning, his approval rating as president is higher than hers was as vice president. She has a 54 percent disapproval rating as vice president. So, it seems to me that's a message that's not working with the voters. So, if she wants to hang out here in Washington at the vice presidential residence and give talks about being a fascist, if she wants to give speeches on the mall with this message to thousands of adoring fans saying, oh, Donald Trump's bad, then she can go do that.

The last bit of voters here need to see a comparison contrast on what she's betting his character It's who you trust and who you like.Sure, to Lance's point, there's a lot of folks who think quote unquote that Donald Trump is tough and whatever thing he is would be in a bully and they think that maybe she's the only adult in the room. The contrast she's going to do on the mall is saying there's somebody that deserves the respect of that Oval Office and this hallowed ground here in Washington, D.C., and somebody else who's at McDonald's making fries and then talking about some old golfer's genitals.

It does show some negative views of Harris have increased. 53 percent of registered voters have an unfavorable view of her. That's up from 49 percent in August. Trump has become slightly more favorable in that time.I mean, one of the questions I have is whether or not the polling is really going to reflect where the daily news cycle is and what's coming out of that daily news cycle. I mean, this poll does not reflect what John Kelly has been saying and so on. But your thoughts on where the race is shaping up? There's not a whole lot of time left.

Your choice is between the guy who stood at The Ellipse and talked to tens of thousands of adoring fans, as Lance says, but talked to them about an insurrection, talked to them about not accepting the election results, motivated them to then go and charge the Bastille, right, to go and charge the Capitol and do the things that we saw them do.And on the other side, the other binary choice, the other choice in this binary election is Kamala Harris, who will talk about preserving democracy, who will talk about the need of defending democracy and how frail it is, who will talk about the rule of law and that no president, no American, regardless of their position, is above it. So, for me, this idea of her doing it at The Ellipse, which will get a lot of press, right, doing it at The Ellipse doesn't mean that it stays at The Ellipse. It's going to go all over the place. And I'm in Las Vegas right now. I'm in Nevada. I'm talking to voters. People are asking me about what John Kelly said. Some folks don't remember if his name is John Kelly or Jim Kelly or George Kelly, but they know what he said. They know he is a general, they know he served with Trump and they know he is ringing the alarm bells. So I agree with you that some of these things that are happening now that people are actually paying attention to are not being reflected in the polls. And, you know, with ten days to go, Jim, I would -- you know, I would obsess less about the polls and I would be much more about getting folks out to vote.",

But because of the beauty of television, you're further away from me.Look, the votes cast early at this point in 2024 versus 2020, states with more votes, well, it's pretty simple. It's zero. It's zero states with fewer votes, all of them, 38 states have fewer votes that are cast early, either early in-person or by mail. And you might say to yourself, well, wait a minute, Jim. What is going on? What is going on, if you were asking yourself that question. Well, this is actually fairly predictable. Why? Because there was a pandemic in 2020, right? We were all staying inside. We weren't going out talking with each other person to person, which hopefully will do soon. And so there's no real credible baseline, right? The votes cast early by in-person or by mail, 69 percent of them were in 2020. If you look at the polling, what we're seeing in the real raw vote is reflective of it, right, because 53 percent in the polls say that they're going to vote either early or by mail. So, what we're seeing right now is reflective of it. Now, here's the thing, Jim. One thing that I've been seeing a lot of, a lot of on social media is the fact that the GOP is making up a larger share of early voters versus 2020. This is based on party registration, right? We see it in key battleground states. Let's go through them, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, all in red here, all in red. But, again, Jim, this ain't too surprising because it matches up with what we see in the poll. So, back in 2020, right, according to the Monmouth University poll, 66 percent of Democrats said that they would vote early in-person or by mail, just 36 percent of Republicans. Look at it now. 49 percent of Republicans say they'll either vote early by mail or early in-person compared to just 59 percent of Democrats. So, the voting patterns are changing. We see that in the polling. We see it in the real results. The polls show a close race. Nothing in the early votes suggests otherwise, my dear friend. So, the bottom line is what we see in the early vote and mail vote is reflective in the polls and the poll show close race, and that's what's going to be, my dear friend.",
