Everyone I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Amid critical tension in the Middle East, Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has led thousands of settlers marching through the occupied West Bank to an illegal outpost. The Palestinian president's office immediately condemned it as an invasion of settler militias, and there has been violence and injury. And it comes as both Israelis and Palestinians are spending some of their holiest days, mourning and burying their children, this after a sudden surge in violence. And it's a growing human toll as tensions continue to rise after the Israeli military raided the al-Aqsa Mosque last Tuesday. In addition, Iran backed militias have exchanged fire with Israel from Syria to Lebanon to Gaza. And the United States has announced that it's deployed a guided missile submarine to the region. Joining me now on all of this for an exclusive interview is the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh. Welcome, Prime Minister, from Ramallah.",

And you are right. Because of that, we have stopped all acts of security coordination between us, the Israelis, because it has proven to be useless on the side of the Palestinians. And, also, Palestinians cannot continue to be in security terms, and they are not getting anything in political terms. The issue for us is political, and not security. Israeli measures are based only on security measures. This will never bring peace to the Israelis. What brings security is peace. And security does not bring peace. The Palestinians and the Israelis, we are, Palestinians, looking for end of the occupation. We are not looking for living with occupation. Palestinians don't want to see the occupying power. They don't want to see the occupying forces. They don't want to see settlers.

We have seen it. But I think that for him also to say that he wanted to wipe Hawara, this is an expression of expansionist mentality that the main parties, the main coalition of this Israeli government has a special political program designed based on expansionism, because for them to show a map for all of historical Palestine, including Jordan, that is what they call here is Israel. This is a reflection of a colonial expansionist mentality. For Ben-Gvir to -- given the permission to form a militia, I think this is, again, a recipe for disaster, because for whom is this militia? This militia has been designed for men, for more killing against Palestinians, for more killing of Palestinians, whether inside Israel or of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. This is a situation in which every Israeli will be holding arm, every Israeli is a soldier, and the Israelis are now adopting new rules of engagement that will cause a lot of bloodshed for the Palestinians. So we will pay a heavy price. This militia that has been formed by Ben-Gvir is a compromise between Netanyahu and himself. And this compromise, who will pay the price? It is we. But I think this is something that should not be allowed. This is something that is not only designed to kill Palestinians, but, again, it will be additional source of escalation, again, in the hands of the Israelis and by the Israelis themselves.",

Today, there are 750,000 Israeli settlers in the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. This Israeli government is eroding '67 borders. It's very unfortunately that United States, whom we had a lot of hopes for this administration that they will move things forward, until now, we did not see, we did not receive, we did not have a peace initiative from United States. The Quartet that used to have the United States, United Nations, Russia and European Union is not anymore functioning. So, there is a serious political vacuum, and we need to fill this political vacuum with a serious peace initiative. United States did not come up with an initiative yet.

Here's my report from back then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voiceover):  Nationalist politicians celebrate a historic victory in a referendum designed to overcome decades of division, violence, inequity. A referendum designed to put Northern Ireland's affairs in the hands of all its people. GERRY ADAMS, THEN-SINN FEIN LEADER:  The task now is to manage that changes, to get the mechanisms for change to deliver on equality on justice and all of the other matters, which are required if we are to have a peace settlement. AMANPOUR (voiceover):  Protestant unionist politicians celebrate too, those who campaigned so hard for the referendum and saw this fight cause a bitter split within their own ranks. KEN MAGINNIS, THEN-ULSTER UNIONIST PARTY MP:  We will do our best to implementing the letter that which was expressed in spirit today by the voters of Northern Ireland. AMANPOUR (voiceover):  But the vote won't silence the no's who despise this deal. ROBERT MCCARTNEY, THEN-U.K. UNIONIST PARTY LEADER:  It will put the delegates of armed terror in government. It will permit those terrorists who retain all their weaponry. And it will release back onto the streets, some of the most savage and homicidal maniacs that have ever been put in prison. AMANPOUR (voiceover):  They vowed to win seats in the new assembly and use their veto. But Mo Mowlam, the British minister in charge of Northern Ireland, called on the no's to respect the will of the people. MO MOWLAM, THEN-NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY:  All I've heard is them saying they want to replay. I've never heard a replay when it's three to one. And that's what it is. So, I hope that they acknowledge what the majority of people have said and build for the future. AMANPOUR (voiceover):  More people voted in Northern Ireland than at any time in living memory, and as the significance of what they have done sinks in, many say they have waited too long. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (on camera):  Of course, President Joe Biden will visit Northern Ireland tomorrow, along with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.

It is starting to change the growth of my own party, and recent elections have shown that people are no longer so divided between orange and green. There are other views on the situation here, people are drawn to that. But also, whilst it was good in principle, that the kind of principles around the Good Friday Agreement, that they were good foundation on which to build, the institutional structures, if anything, compounded our division and that they handed unionism and nationalism, these exclusive vetoes that they could use against each other. And we have now tested our institutions to destruction. And so, I think 25 years on with the change that we have seen in society, our focus now has to be the next 25 years. We have a much more fluid sense of identity in Northern Ireland. People are much more confident about exploring that, much happier to vote for parties that don't vote along tribal lines. And so, we need to find an accommodation that allows those people's voices to contribute because, you know, 72 percent of assembly members voted to elect a new speaker, and it wasn't enough.

But we now have an opportunity that we didn't have 25 years ago, to do that in spaces which are peaceful, we can engage with each other across the community. We're able to grow a party across the community that has gone from having six seats in 1990 out of 108 to 17 seats out of 90 last year. So, we have seen the growth and the appetite for that change. But there's still much, much more we can do.

Thanks so much for joining us.You know, in the past few weeks, we have seen headlines from the biggest school systems in the country, both in Los Angeles and in New York about strikes, about retirement pensions. It seems that the entire system is going through some big changes. And at the core of a lot of these concerns are whether or not there are enough teachers to do the job. What's happening? ALEXANDRA ROBBINS, AUTHOR, \"THE TEACHERS\":  What's happening is that teachers aren't being treated properly. You know, they say there's a teacher shortage, that that's a popular term, but it's very misleading. There is no teacher shortage. There is no shortage of people who are wonderful, qualified, willing educators. There is a shortage of teaching jobs that adequately treats, compensates and respect skilled professionals such as they would want to be teachers in the first place. That's not a shortage of people, that's a shortage of support.",

Districts tend to change their curriculum pretty often, and then, that starts everything over again. If a teacher is involuntarily transferred to a new grade or subject, then they have a whole lot to catch up on over the summer. And that's just summer. During the year, teachers are working so much more often than people realize, the job is impossible to handle during a school day. Teachers maybe have one 50-minute prep time/planning time if they're lucky, maybe a 20 to 30-minute lunch. That's not enough time to grade, prep, do all the parent calls that administrators are now putting on teachers' shoulders. It's too much. Middle and high school teachers, people don't realize, can have 180 students easily, OK? I talked to a teacher in Utah, a high school English teacher, who had 263 students. Can you imagine grading, refining the writing of and correcting essays for 263 students every single time you give them an assignment? He cannot accomplish that in 50 minutes during the school day.",

So, we follow him to see what happens. However, the phrase teacher burnout, it's such a popular phrase that Miriam Webster Dictionary describes for its featured contextual examples for burnout, both of its two examples are about teachers. However, it's a misleading phrase. And here's why. Experts say that teacher burnout is due to unmanageable workload, high stakes testing, pressure at work, not enough resources at work. But instead of actually fixing these issues, like any normal workplace you'd think would do, schools instead tell teachers to relax, do a better job of self-care, that's a common buzzword among districts, as if it's -- the burden is on the teachers to go pay for a massage or something to alleviate the stress called but -- caused by a job that's impossible to do. So, I think instead of saying teacher burnout, we need to come up with something else, teacher demoralization maybe, because the burnout is not on the teachers. This is not the teacher's fault. Instead of saying teachers have the highest levels of burnout, we need to say no, school systems are the employers worst at providing necessary supports and resources to their employees.",

They were just virtual in some cases. And I do want to say that teachers wanted to be in person too, but only if it was safe. And at that time, before vaccines, before we knew anything about COVID. nobody knew if it was safe or not to be in school. However, teachers ended up working a lot longer days trying to transfer their lessons to virtual materials and online platforms, than they would have had they been in school. With that said, parents who were upset that their children were in their own house instead of an a building started being vocal, and then they started being about vocal about the masks. Glenn Youngkin used parents' rights as the central part of his campaign over in Virginia. And when Republicans saw that his campaign worked, I think they all started jumping on the bandwagon. In the first part of, I believe it was 2022, there were more than 100 bills proposed just in the first six weeks of the year to start meddling in schools and censoring discussions and have more parental control over items that may involve race or LGBTQ identities. So, I think Republicans kind of pounced on this as something that might work in their campaigns. They galvanized parents by weaponizing the term CRT, Critical Race Theory, is not taught in K through 12 schools, but Republicans started using it as a way to refer to any oppression or talk of racism in American history. They used this, this umbrella term to sort of rile up parents, and it worked. Those parents are now fighting for something that actually is not going to help students. However, if you look at the surveys, most parents of school age children do not want the culture wars in their schools. And, in fact, the parent -- the people who are more likely to say that they are upset with their local schools are actually parents who don't even have school aged children.
