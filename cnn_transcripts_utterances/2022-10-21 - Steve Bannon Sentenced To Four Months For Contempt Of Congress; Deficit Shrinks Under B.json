      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. We do begin with breaking news, Donald Trump's longtime adviser, Steve Bannon, he's in a federal courtroom right now about to be sentenced for defying a subpoena from the January 6th Congressional Committee. Earlier this year, a jury convicted Bannon, you'll remember, on two counts of contempt of Congress regarding this insurrection investigation and defying that subpoena. This comes also at a really interesting moment when everyone is also standing by for that Committee, the January 6th Committee, to formally issue a subpoena to Donald Trump himself.Let's get to Washington. CNN's Sara Murray is live outside the federal courthouse where Bannon is listening to his sentencing right now. Sara, what are you hearing from -- is happening inside the courtroom right now?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Kate. The judge just ran through the factors at play here. And it's just handed down the sentencing. Steve Bannon is going to be sentenced to four months in prison. Now it's four months for each count, but it's going to run concurrently. So that means, you know, a total of four months, as well as a $6,500 fine. This is of course for his convictions, refusing to show up for testimony before the January 6th Committee, refusing to hand over any documents to the January 6th Committee.Now, this is a lesser sentence than what the government was hoping for. They said Bannon should spend six months behind bars and pay a $200,000 fine. But of course, it's significantly more than what Steve Bannon was hoping for. He did not want to do any jail time. He was hoping for probation only. The judge made it clear earlier today that he was not going to go for that that there was going to be some minimum jail time. And, you know, one of the things the judge has made clear today, he said Steve Bannon has clearly shown no remorse for his actions. You know, he also pointed out that he never tried to comply with the subpoena at all, never handed over any documents. And he said that, you know, there does need to be a deterrence for other people so that other people don't feel like they can just not comply with subpoenas from Congress. But again, still a lesser sentence than the government is hoping for, and the judge also just said that Bannon is not going to have to serve the prison sentence until his appeal plays out. So it's possible, it could be quite some time before Bannon actually has to serve this, depending on how his appeal of his conviction goes, Kate.",

      "sentences": "That's an interesting element to all of this. Sara, thank you so much for bringing us the breaking news.From inside the federal courtroom, the judge just handing down this sentence after quite a long time, and Steve Bannon has been fighting that subpoena and fighting this court action. Joining me right now to understand a little bit more of what this means, U.S. -- former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman. So first, Harry, what do you think of this sentence, four months for Steve Bannon? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: You know, the time itself, Kate, is on the overall scheme of things not insubstantial. He wanted zero, government said six months, the time you can see it. But there's two other aspects that strike me as very favorable to Bannon. One is he refused as part of his overall sort of content for the whole proceedings to give any financial information to probation, and said, I'll just pay the maximum. And there's no reason not to have given him the maximum, but Nichols didn't. Second and more importantly, he could have been ordered to surrender today and walk into jail for his four month sentence. And Nichols said, well, I will let you take it on appeal and not be in jail and tell them. That means that Nichols found there was a substantial issue for ban and to raise on appeal of his conviction. And that I think is really the number one thing he was hoping for. But, you know, from the start, he's been the most unrepentant, most contemptuous defendant imaginable. And I think it's clear he values his sort of image as an outline, a swashbuckling anti-government guy more than he does actually playing by the rules. And that's why he got more than most people would get in terms of time at four months.",

Talk to me more about this because we all know that Steve Bannon is appealing the conviction this has been playing out at the same time, and it's also been something that Bannon and his legal team have raised in the midst of this court battle happening. How do you think this sentence plays in to that -- to the appeal?",

He has said I relied on a lawyer's advice. The lawyer himself says, I relied on a lawyer's advice. The lawyer himself says I didn't give you that advice. I gave you the opposite. He said, just as it was on the eve of trial, OK, I'll comply now but that's, of course, he'd already committed the crime. That's not very weighty, either. [11So Nichols is I think, giving him something of a break to say, it's enough -- there's enough there for you to try your luck with the Court of Appeals. And I will find that the standard which is to say a substantial issue is presented has been met here. So you get to stay at liberty and doing all the mischief and kind of rabble rousing he has been doing all the way through.",

So he knows, you know, I'm sure he delved into the record, but I would have said he better bring his toothbrush. Yes. And so he's -- I think that is the biggest sort of boon for him of today's sentence.He doesn't care about the money. He expected to do some jail time. But not having to surrender immediately. And obviously, he does not want to go to jail. I think he counts himself a lucky man, as he lunches now with his lawyers.",

If he doesn't, if he doesn't meet the jurisdictional requirement of filing a piece of paper, then he's got a, you know, he's yanked and he goes right back in. So it's just one of the many procedural requirements to filing an appeal and a brief having an argument, et cetera.And as you said, at the top, you know, that could be at a minimum, six months or so until the D.C.

I mean, he really screamed out for the full treatment, which probably would have been six months in order, because he was so unrepentant, so kind of contemptuous, really, all the way through four months as, you know, no picnic. But still, I think all in all, it's not the real sort of knuckle wrapping that the both the Committee and the government would have wanted. I think he can come out and continue to pontificate and do his Steve Bannon thing. And for at least his supporters, he'll still be able to claim something of hero status. So I think it's a mixed message and doesn't really put down the hammer, the way the Committee might have liked. Still, four months is more than a normal sentence would be for contempt. But I think it will play as, you know, balanced and not the kind of real serious sentence. He could have received, especially that he gets to stay out during appeal.",

It was the appropriate move. There are, the standard is whether the case raises substantial issues that reasonable jurists could differ over, meaning is there a solid chance for an appeal to be successful. And there's certainly more than that in this case.I've said before, and I would confirm it. I believe that the appeal in this case is bulletproof. The issue, the constitutional issues involved in this case, a very important. But Mr. Bannon never got to tell the reason for his actions with respect to the subpoena. Never got to tell the story because the government insists, the government assisted from day one, on prohibiting any mention, any evidence or any discussion to go before the jury as to why Mr. Bannon reacted as he did to the subpoena on the advice of counsel.

He's going to be speaking from the White House, but his target audience, far from there. Every voter whose mind isn't yet made up about the midterm elections, that's his target audience today. Later this afternoon, President Biden heads to Delaware to tout his student debt relief plan. Millions of Americans have already applied for loan forgiveness through that program.

He talked about gas prices. Yesterday, he was talking about infrastructure. And today we're going to hear him talk about another pair of issues, deficit reduction any moment now from the White House talking about what's expected to be pretty dramatic top line decrease in the federal deficit numbers this year.And then later today, at Delaware State University, the President will be talking about his student debt relief program, 8 million Americans had already begun the process of applying when those applications formally opened on Monday. And we're expecting the President to share another update today on the status of that program. The President is also going to be going on offense against a Republican lawmakers who have attacked this program. The criticism from Republicans, of course, is that this is a program that is too costly, that's going to affect the deficit. And also they've criticized the question of fundamental fairness in this issue. The President is expected to go after Republican members of Congress who accepted a pandemic relief loans that were forgiven by the federal government trying to point out a hypocrisy there. But what's interesting, Kate, is the timing between the deficit reduction event that we're going to see from the President at the White House, followed by that student loan event later today. That deficit reduction event, you can expect that to be a prebuttal of sorts to some of those criticisms that you're going to hear from Republicans once again, as the President talks about the student debt relief program later in the day. The President yesterday, while he was in Pennsylvania, that key battleground state. He also talks about his plans for midterm campaign travel, he said 16 to 18 campaigns have requested that he go out and travel. We know that he will be traveling. But the White House is also saying that he's going to be doing a lot fewer rallies, a lot more of these official types of events.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the deficit is coming down very sharply. But let's talk about why and put this all into context, starting with the Inflation Reduction Act that President Biden signed into law over the summer. The CBO says it's cutting the deficit by $238 billion. Now, this is a step in the right direction, but it's really just a baby step.Moody's economist, Dan White, he told me that this is just a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Also, it's been offset by the student debt relief, which the CBO says is boosting the deficit by $400 billion completely wiping out the improvement in the deficit from the Inflation Reduction Act. Let's also just put all of this into perspective. Clearly, deficits are coming down sharply. In 2020, this was a record high, $3.1 trillion. It has been cut in half during the most recent fiscal year. That is a big deal. But also, why is that happening? A lot of it is because there's not as much COVID emergency spending, there's no bailout, stimulus checks out, rescues of small businesses, also, because the economy is doing better. But when you really zoom out, clearly, deficits are still very high. They've come down in recent years, but they're way higher than they had been at almost any other point. And we haven't had a fiscal surplus since 2001. Clearly, Kate, I think that we can say that the budget deficit is improving, but it's far too early to declare mission accomplished there.",

So David, the Biden team clearly thinks that this is a winning issue, or they wouldn't be talking about it in terms of deficit reduction, right.

But we've seen a lot of Democrats, Kate, out on the campaign trail, have been somewhat reluctant to tout all the legislative accomplishments that the administration and the Democratic Congress has had because of the price tag, right?So yes, there are some popular things in there. But some expensive legislation and a lot of spending got passed through in this Democratic controlled Congress. And so I think what Joe Biden is trying to show here is, hey, we're doing this in a responsible way. That's from his perspective. So don't be scared off by the price tag. I think he's trying to give Democrats a way to talk about their accomplishments without fear of voter backlash on the price tag. That is the goal here.
