A daunting investigation is underway two miles below the surface of a remote hostile Atlantic Ocean to find out why the Titan sub imploded and killed all five people aboard. Underwater robotic vehicles are mapping debris fields near the Titanic wreckage. And experts say the implosion would have happened in a fraction of a millisecond that it's unlikely any human remains will be recovered in this process.As experts search for clues to what went wrong, the Navy says an underwater sound consistent with an implosion was detected on Sunday, and that they immediately alerted the Coast Guard. But at the time, the sound was \"not definitive.\" CNN's Miguel Marquez is in St. John's Newfoundland. Miguel, what is it like there now that we know this is only a recovery effort?",

Many of them now decamping back to their home ports. Some of them still out there taking part in those mapping exercises that they're doing, trying to figure out exactly why it came apart and why it imploded, and then that debris fell the way it did.But here in St. John's that is -- has a history with the Titanic itself with shipwrecks with the sea, there is a great sense of mourning of loss. That -- this is also the place that if you are interested in going to the Titanic and studying the Titanic, and going down in great lengths -- great depths, this is the place. It is 460 miles from the Titanic site. It is the closest land to that site. This is the place that James Cameron came and comes when he goes to that site and others in that community.
