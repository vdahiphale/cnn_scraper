And, even short of that, did anyone make any dents in Donald Trump's armor as the front-runner, just as we learn how Donald Trump is feeling about attending the next Republican debate?I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Behind me, you can see the first hearing of the official impeachment inquiry into President Biden. House members will spend hours questioning experts. You're looking at professors here, not fact witnesses. House Republicans are trying to argue that President Biden used his office to profit along with his son Hunter Biden. As of now, they have not presented any evidence of that. And, as Kate and Sara have both noted, this hearing you're seeing here is going to go on for hours, and the House of Representatives only has hours to prevent a government shutdown. Let's bring in Sara Murray, who has been watching these hearings. What's come out of it so far, Sara?",

Take a listen to what Congress said this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  At least 10 times, Joe Biden lied to the American people that he never spoke to his family about their business dealings. He lied by telling the American people that there was an absolute wall between his official government duties and his personal life. Let's be clear. There wasn't a wall. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is what Congressman Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on this committee, tried to drive home at the beginning of the hearing. Take a listen to what Raskin said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  We're 62 hours away from shutting down the government of the United States of America, and Republicans are launching an impeachment drive based on a long-debunked and discredited lie. No foreign enemy has ever been able to shut down the government United States, but now MAGA Republicans are about to do just that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This morning, at least one of the candidates on the stage says, despite Donald Trump's commanding lead, it's way too early to give up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. GOV.

So, if Donald Trump sends out an e-mail blast about you, that means that at least the campaign thinks of you in some head-turning fashion. So, by that one metric, she did land some type of blow.

Then, tomorrow, leadership is hoping to bring a short-term spending bill to the floor of the House. And in a closed-door conference meeting this morning, leaders tried to compel their members to unite behind something, anything, arguing that the short-term solution was their best option to averting a shutdown and helping remain in the majority after the 2024 election. Of course, those tensions that you discussed at the top here, those were looming large, as you had Matt Gaetz confronting the House speaker, the speaker firing back, arguing, how is Matt Gaetz spending his time, given the fact that the speaker is focused on keeping the majority? It is just one more example of how the speaker is dealing with a small number of hard-liners, Sara, that are becoming more and more of a problem, because he has a very narrow majority. It only takes a handful of members to disrupt any plan the speaker has. And the plan that the speaker is eying tomorrow is to try and pass a short-term spending bill?

You had Senator John Fetterman tweeting earlier -- quote -- \"Unless Senator Menendez is coming today to resign. I'm not interested in hearing his explanation for gold bars stashed in a mattress.\" So you can expect that, today, there are going to be a lot of questions from Democratic colleagues. There are also some practical questions that senators are going to have to answer, whether or not they think that Senator Menendez should continue serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He's no longer acting as the chairman of that committee. Senator Ben Cardin will do that. But Senator Cardin was pressed earlier by reporters whether or not he thought that Senator Menendez should continue serving on the committee, given the fact that this is a committee that handles potentially classified information, that handles sensitive information and deals with foreign dignitaries, given the seriousness of these charges. Senator Cardin did not answer whether or not he thought Senator Menendez should continue serving on that body -- Sara.",
