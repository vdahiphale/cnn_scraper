It is impossible not to reflect on these images. These images that dominated our screen back in the mid-90s. First, of the slow speed white Ford Bronco chase as the police closed in on O.J.

But another aspect of this case and of O.J. Simpson's life was really how much this case did in America to raise the issue of domestic violence. This idea that it could actually happen to anyone. Domestic violence largely went from being a private matter at the time to really exploding into the public consciousness. Give us your take on that, Christine. CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST (on-camera):  That's absolutely correct. You know, go back to that time. We're talking, of course, 1994. And, you know, this is -- cable T.V. is just beginning. And this story explodes really is our first big reality T.V. story. Tonya Nancy had happened a few months earlier in figure skating in the Olympics. But this was huge. And what it showed is how little we cared when women were talking about being abused. And you're right. The stories came out. The fact that the police seemingly ignored what Nicole Brown Simpson was talking about, this mattered. And the nation listened. And whether it was network T.V. or CNN or other cable outlets, people were riveted. And that's absolutely the case, that from that story, that terrible, terrible story, the allegations, obviously, the murder trial, everything that happened, the civil suit that, of course, was won by the Goldman family. We learned a lot. The nation learned a lot. And we learned to respect and listen to women or men, if they are victims, in a way we never had before.",

And, obviously, there's the tragedy of Ron Goldman, a friend who worked with -- who was a friend of hers, a waiter at Mezzaluna, and came over a restaurant nearby in Brentwood. And that fateful night when both of them were so savagely murdered. And, Christine, I mean, this is a sort of confluence of the height of someone's career, given that he had succeeded so well in sports and then went on to the entertainment world, a household name.

I'm not comparing at all. But Tiger, with his personal life and what happened, we -- we realized we knew nothing about him. Yet everyone thought they knew everything about him, right? That's the culture that O.J. Simpson gave us. That's the how we learned about athletes was, you know, through much more than just sports. And so, I think in many ways, I mean, for me, O.J. was forever the man who was involved in that murder. And even though he wasn't found guilty, you know, we all, of course, have our thoughts. But 1994, 1995, O.J. was the biggest story in this country. He was what we were all talking about. Everyone planned their day around the verdict when we found out that there would be a verdict in 1995. I mean, you cannot overstate how big a deal O.J. Simpson was from the very time he first got into our consciousness with the Heisman Trophy, playing college football at the University of Southern California, all the way through the NFL, the commercials. And then, of course, this tragedy. And you're right. I mean, we should always every time we say O.J. Simpson's name, we should say Nicole Brown Simpson's name and Fred Goldman's name. Absolutely. And I certainly plan to do that every interview I do today and moving forward, because you cannot glorify O.J.

There was a Jekyll and Hyde complex about him publicly. He was known as being very affable, friendly to the media, always had a smile on his face, always cast as that likable, lovable character. And then to hear this side of him, I think, was a big shock and stunning to so many people who had looked up to him, who had watched him, who had been fans of his. And all of that came to light throughout this very memorable trial. And of course, I can only imagine what memories this brings up for Nicole Brown's family today and Ron Goldman's, as well. Christine Brennan, thank you. CNN's Stephanie Elam is in Los Angeles and joins us now. Stephanie, I saw you on our network just a few moments ago, and I think you captured so well the mood of the country in 1995 when that verdict came down, and 1994 in Los Angeles when the trial began, when the murder took place. And you can't erase that moment in time, what a couple of years prior to that had transpired in Los Angeles. And the fact that you had the Rodney King verdict and those officers were acquitted, and then you had the riots subsequently that followed.

Especially if you're a young black man in Los Angeles. You've probably, no doubt, had negative experience with police. And if not, you know people who have. You have family members who have.

People were so invested in watching every single day. They wanted to know the nitty-gritty of what people were saying. And I knew black people who were doing that, too. But I also knew a lot of black people who were watching that and saying, oh, I want to know what's next, or what did they testify. Because you remember two days ago when such-and-such was, like, they were completely absorbed. But they would also say, I know even for me, and they could say as a college graduate, I've been profiled. I know even for me. So, it was an overlapping, an intermeshing of both of these things, of knowing what it's like to be a black person in Los Angeles back then and also being maybe a scholar or someone who just wanted to study how this court case was being played out. And I do think that when you look at how even, and I've talked to several police officers over the years from LAPD, they point to that as a focal moment for the police department, saying that at that point they realized they needed to change how they were policing people because it was not happening equally. Even with the L.A. riots, you know, when you talk to people here, cops were all lined up blocking and protecting the rich white neighborhoods and letting other parts of the city burn. And so, they talk about that as well to the people who lived through that time here in L.A.",

And so, there were a lot of people who would think, and I heard this a lot, like, why is everyone up in arms and caring about O.J. Simpson? He never wanted to be one of us. He left us behind.

Simpson fled down the 405. So, it was an exciting time to be a young journalist. But also it was a wonder to find out who O.J. Simpson actually was behind the scenes. As you point out, when you listen to the tapes, I remember having an argument with someone in the newsroom who said to me, well, you know, why do we think O.J. Simpson did this? I mean, here's a man who's famous and who could get any woman in the world. And his kids were in the house, allegedly, when this happened. And I said, when you listen to those 911 calls and you hear some of the foul things that he is screaming and yelling, and at one point we hear Nicole Brown Simpson say, O.J., please, the kids are asleep. I said to this particular person at the time, I said, you know, there is no way that a man who could yell such profanities and talk to the children -- the mother of his children like that would at all care about committing a crime like this. You know, to me, there was an absolute disconnect between the public O.J. Simpson and the private one. And I also think people forget what a complete circus that trial was. I had a front row seat to what was going on behind the scenes. I interviewed his best friend, Al Collings, who launched a 1- 900 number to make money off of paying stories about his relationship with O.J. and Nicole. I also had the opportunity to interview Johnny Cochran, who we got to see be masterful in that trial. I was covering a press conference for Geronimo Pratt, who at the time was the longest serving Black Panther in jail. And I remember talking to Mr. Cochran. He said, you know, I can't talk to you about the case, but sister, just watch what we're about to do. And he showed us, he absolutely showed us that if you had enough money and enough celebrity that you could go into court. And as Stephanie pointed out, a lot of black people had really ambivalent feelings. But we got to see what for the first time as an African-American felt like the playing field was leveled.",

And I remember when I met Mr. Cochran, I thought to myself, what a dynamic man. So, to see him in person and talk to him in person, I completely understood why he had those jurors wrapped around his finger. He was extremely charming right down to -- he remembered that I was from Baltimore from having met me at another event. And he said, oh, I'm going to be in Baltimore receiving an award from the Bar Association. We should get crabs together. Now, I knew that was never going to happen, but it was just typical Johnny Cochran because he made you feel like he was relating to you as a person. And so, if he made me feel that way as a journalist who was there to do a job, imagine how he was making the courtroom feel, how he was making those jurors feel. He made them feel like you've got to look at this evidence. And like he said, his famous line that, you know, if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit. It just it felt like he really was working magic in that courtroom. And him and along with the rest of the attorneys, they really took on what many people thought was going to be a slam dunk case.

People were walking through the crime scene without gloves, without buoys on their feet. There was even evidence that one of the detectives went to the police department, took a vial of blood from O.J. Simpson and then put that vial in his pocket, then returned to the crime scene with that vial of blood. And, of course, that gave the defense team an opportunity to suggest to the jury that it was that LAPD officer that smeared O.J.'s blood at the crime scene.

This is the way the system should work. The prosecutors made huge errors in this case, and they admitted it. They changed their policies. The LAPD had tremendous changes in the way that it presents cases, and they charged Mark Herman. They charged one of the star police officers involved in this case with perjury. That's a huge deal. We cannot underestimate how significant that is. Police officers should not come into court and lie. That's not the way cases should be made in this country or in any judicial system.",

Carolyn, does that statement from the Heisman Trophy Trust strike you as a bit tone deaf? It just sort of feels strange to me, given what happened in 1994, for any one of us to focus solely on O.J.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame also issued a statement that was a bit more nuanced, that really just detailed Simpson's resume. But in listening to that piece, you're reminded, at least I am, of two things. You're ultimately reminded that what happened to Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman was a complete tragedy. And you're also reminded that the story of O.J. Simpson's life is something of an American tragedy in terms of his fall from grace. When you think about the way that he was revered as a larger-than-life sports icon who came from modest beginnings, you think about the fact that his father was a custodian and a cook. His mother was a nurse's aide. He rose to fame through USC, became a Heisman Trophy winner, was drafted to the Bills. And after a couple of seasons, started to have this phenomenal career as a running back, was a Pro Bowler, was a Hall of Famer, became a sports analyst, became an actor. And so he was, at the time, one of a handful of people who was viewed as larger-than-life. And remember, too, that just like the news landscape was not as diluted at the time back in the mid-'90s and 1994 when all of this started to occur, the sports landscape also was not nearly as diluted. And so you think about Game Five of the NBA Finals between the Knicks and the Rockets. Bob Casas was at the call at Madison Square Garden. And they actually went into picture-in-picture at the time and had O.J.'s car chase overlapping with the NBA Finals. And Casas has said publicly that O.J. actually tried to call him at the time because they had a relationship. He was a sports analyst and that he couldn't pick it up because he was at MSG doing the game. All of that to say, this was something that was so much bigger than anybody had seemingly really experienced at the time. And you remember exactly where you were watching the trial. But when I look at that piece and I think about ultimately his sports career and the way that he was disgraced, all of it is really tragic.",

And first of all, I don'tknow why there was a rush to release any statement. The fact that you don't mention at all in those statements the lives and families of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. And in a way, it's kind of an insult to every other Heisman winner who wasn't accused of murdering their ex-wife and a friend. And he's had 30 years following that trial to make any sort of attempt at redemption. And he did anything but that. So I think I think one could -- could really question even the statement now. And all these years later, obviously, a very gifted athlete. But clearly there was so much more in his in his life and obviously the tragedy that unfolded for his ex-wife and her friend.
