Plus, the latest in a string of CNN exclusives on decades of sexual abuse at the Coast Guard Academy. Tonight, a Coast Guard official breaks her silence and says she was part of what she now calls a cruel cover-up. Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with something the former president has been saying a lot lately and what it says about him. Sunday as President Biden was visiting the American Military Cemetery outside Paris and fresh from marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Normandy, Donald Trump was saying this.

They - they're not warriors.The ones that went into the Capitol most of them if not all of them have been arrested and tried. And interestingly, Anderson, at the beginning when they started to get arrested, they were remorseful. And then this right-wing ecosphere put their arms around them you know singing the national anthem and stuff, and in that process convinced them that they were victims, and have made them martyrs and heroes. This is not something Americans that, you know, aren't completely sold out to the cult should be - should accept and we should have this be a fresh outrage every day when he does stuff like this. COOPER: It's also interesting, Andrew, I mean, I know some actual warriors, they're not people who usually view themselves as victims or just sort of helpless victims very often. How dangerous do you think it is for law enforcement, Andrew, and the public when you have the former president gaslighting his supporters? Because, I mean, back in 2022 there was a guy upset about federal authorities searching Mar-a- Lago for classified documents he was killed after trying to shoot his way into an FBI field office in Ohio. It feels like, to the Congressman's point, the former president just says this stuff and it - people just kind of ignore it, but it - I mean it has repercussions potentially.",

We got 1,265 people who've been charged in - as a part of that January 6 case, 718 of them on that - by that day had already gone into court raised their right- hand, sworn to tell the truth and then said I did it, I'm guilty to it, whether it's trespassing or obstruction of official procedure or assault, you know, on police officers and others.So the idea that these people are somehow being held against their will for political reasons is absolutely absurd. And Donald Trump knows that's absurd, he knows it because he spent four hours that day watching the videotapes from behind the cloistered walls of the White House in the warm embrace of his Secret Service security team. So he knows exactly what happened that day. He knows those people were rioters and insurrectionists and many of them have, to their credit, stepped up and taken responsibility for that. The thing that I cannot get past Anderson is how many people give him a pass for saying absurd and sickeningly false things like this. And you're right, these falsehoods that he's - that he throws out in front of his rallies and supporters it is for political advantage but it comes at the cost of driving up risk to people in the system, law enforcement prosecutors and others. And you made the perfect example Ricky Shiffrin (ph) who was outraged by what he undoubtedly heard the president say after the Mar-a-Lago raid and decided to take it out violently on the FBI Cincinnati field office.

But Wise reminded the jury Hunter's former girlfriend, Hallie Biden, his brother Beau Biden's widow, had testified that when she found the gun in the same car days later, she found it alongside drug paraphernalia. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell countered, warning jurors not to convict his client improperly adding, \"It's time to end this case.\" He compared the trial to a magician's trick trying to dupe the jury saying, \"Watch this hand, pay no attention to the other one.\" He accused prosecutors of cherry-picking evidence to present a more damning timeline of Hunters drug use and said his client was not lying when he marked down that he was not an addict on that federal form. Lowell attacked two of Hunters former girlfriends who both served as prosecution witnesses in this case. He noted Zoe Keston took pictures of Hunter with drugs but not in the key month of October 2018. He also reminded the jury that Hallie Biden could not remember specific details about when she found the gun in Hunters car and noted Hunter was the one who told Hallie to file a police report for the missing gun after she threw it out. Hunter did not take the stand to testify in his own defense in this case, a move that would have come with potential rewards and definite risks. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera): The jury will be back here at court tomorrow at 9 AM to continue their deliberations. It's impossible to say how long it will take them to reach a decision on these three counts.

It was an operation that took weeks to plan after receiving intelligence that the hostages were being held in apartment buildings in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON: On the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages. Israeli forces have been preparing for this rescue mission for weeks. ATWOOD (voice-over): An Israeli Air Force pilot involved in the mission told the Jerusalem Post that as one of the hostages, Noa Argamani, got into his helicopter, his unit's, quote, mantle of composure melted away. The magnitude of the moment struck. Then, he, quote, immediately reported that the diamond is with us and in good health. Some of the Special Forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and members of Hamas's military wing, eyewitnesses told CNN. And there were also reports of large gunfire after the hostages were rescued. At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured. That's according to the Gazan authorities who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. The Israel Defense Forces dispute that number, saying the death toll was under 100. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I want to say thank you, thank God. ATWOOD (voice-over): In Israel, the families of the hostages expressed their overwhelming joy at having their loved ones returned safely after eight months in captivity.",
