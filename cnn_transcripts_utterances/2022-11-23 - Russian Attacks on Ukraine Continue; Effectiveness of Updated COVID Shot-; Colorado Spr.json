My colleague Ana Cabrera has the day off.You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM and we are grateful to have you. We start with brand-new details coming in about the suspect in the latest mass shooting in the United States, this time at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Sources tell CNN that a store manager armed with a pistol stormed into a break room and opened fire, killing six people, before police say he turned the gun on himself. Now, police have not named the gunman, but multiple sources tell CNN the shooter was 31-year-old Andre Bing, an overnight team lead who worked at Walmart for over 10 years. Here's some witnesses describing how the chilling attack played out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right, Boris, and to reiterate again the new reporting from CNN that the shooter has been identified as Andre Bing.We got a statement from Walmart a short time ago. I will read you part of it. Walmart -- this is according to Scott Pope, senior director of global communications for Walmart, who sent CNN a statement saying: \"The alleged shooter has been identified as Andre Bing. We can confirm that he was a Walmart associate. Andre's position with the company was overnight team lead. And he's been employed with us since 2010.\" They go on to say they are thankful for the first responders and continue to work with law enforcement in the case. We have been pressing Walmart all day on whether there were any disciplinary proceedings ever initiated against this employee or whether any other employees had complained about him. But what -- we have not gotten an answer from Walmart on that yet. But what we do have is an account from Briana Tyler. She is an employee who earlier spoke to ABC News, and was telling us that the shooter was a manager who she was told to -- quote -- \"look out for because there was always something going on with him just having an issue with someone\" -- end quote. She said that she had been gathered with her co-workers in a break room just before their shift started. She looked up, and her manager opened the door. That's when they saw the shooter opening fire, she said. She told ABC that he was not aiming at anyone specifically, that he didn't say anything while he was shooting, and that he looked directly at her, but missed her head by an inch or two. But this was an account from an employee who says that she was told to look out for him. And, again, we have pressed Walmart on that to see if anybody had complained about him, if there was anything that was said or enacted, any complaints filed about him to Walmart that maybe had not been acted upon. They have not responded to that yet or any questions about whether any disciplinary proceedings had ever been initiated. But we do have the name of the suspect, Andre Bing, and, according to law enforcement sources, he killed six people inside the store and then turned the gun on himself. Boris, we were told by police that he used a pistol. We have been pressing them on whether other weapons were used. They say that, to their knowledge, they have no knowledge of other weapons -- Boris.",

So this is the first time that we're going to be able to see the suspect since he was beaten and subdued on Saturday night by those heroes who authorities say saved countless lives. Now, this is a first appearance. And all that means is that the suspect will be read his rights. He will also hear the charges that are on the charging documents. Now, those could include five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of hate crimes. Now, I want to be clear this is not an arraignment. Those are not the official formal charges against him. The DA warns that that won't happen until next week or the week after that. They still have to investigate, and that the suspect is being held on no bond. Now, that is procedural here in the state of Colorado. Now, one more thing about his chaotic past. Here's what we're learning about the life of this suspect. And I'm going to start with his parents. The mom has a criminal past. She's been arrested multiple times, including for charges involving DUI and also false reporting a crime. And then the father is -- or was a porn actor and also an MMA fighter. Now, he wasn't -- wasn't in the picture, which left the grandmother to raise the child. Now, the suspect, by the time he was 15, online records show that there was vicious, vicious online bullying of the suspect. Before he turned 16, he changed his name. And now we know also that last year here in Colorado, his mother called police about the suspect having weapons, ammunition, a home bomb. All those charges were dropped. And then, Boris, the last one we heard that also kind of paints a picture was from court documents last night. And those court documents revealed -- and this was the suspect's attorneys asking the court to address him by them and then saying that he identifies as nonbinary. Now, that's new. We don't know if this is some sort of legal defense or not. But we, of course, have tried to reach out to the defendant's attorneys, and they say that, by policy, they do not comment on homicide cases -- Boris.",

Every single week of 2022 has had at least four mass shootings. Those are incidents of gun violence where at least four people have been killed or injured. And that is a per-week figure. It's not an average. It's a concrete tally. from \"The Washington Post.\" Obviously, this has become all too common in the United States. But, if you could, Jennifer, put it into context for us.

Gun deaths are increasing rapidly in the United States. At the same time, we have many states have loosened their gun laws, and we have 400 million guns in circulation. And we also have a background check system that checks criminal history, but it doesn't check for behaviors that may not rise to the level of criminality, like the behaviors that we have heard described in the Colorado and the Virginia shootings. With those gunmen, there are -- there were warning signs. But a background check for gun purchases wouldn't cover that. In other countries, employees, co-workers, loved ones would be interviewed, those behaviors would be flagged, and a gun would not be given to a prospective gun buyer. That level of background checking in the United States is not really a conversation, I think, politically that's been very palatable. But the data does show that gun owner licensing before the point of purchase is really the way to avoid this accelerating gun violence.",

But, as you mentioned, this morning, it was packed, as those first -- as that first wave of flights went out, and things have started to creep up a little since then. Now, Chicago officials say, between here at O'Hare and Midway, Chicago's other airport, they expect about 1.7 million travelers over this Thanksgiving period, which is up almost 7 percent from last year. And, countrywide, when you look at the past two days, TSA has screened already around 4.5 million people over the two previous days, which is up from last year and is slightly down from 2019, but, at the very least, comparable to those pre-pandemic levels. And, overall, AAA is expecting air travel to be up almost 8 percent. It's a dynamic that one passenger we spoke to you earlier this morning experienced firsthand. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Keep that 95 percent number in your head. Take a look at this.What this study showed is that this new Omicron booster, when people got it about eight months after their last COVID shot, it was 43 to 50 percent effective at keeping people from getting sick with COVID. So that's about the effectiveness of flu shots. It's good. You should get a flu shot too. It is not as spectacular as it once was. Now, when are you supposed to get it? Two months after your last COVID shot or three months after your last COVID illness -- Boris.",

Let's take a look at these statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They say that, in 2020, there were nearly 616,000 abortions, and, in, 2019 625,000. So that's about a 2 percent decrease from 2019 to 2020. And as far as when women got these abortions, let's take a look at this; 80 percent or more -- I'm sorry -- 80 percent or more were at or before nine weeks; 93 percent were added before 13 weeks.
