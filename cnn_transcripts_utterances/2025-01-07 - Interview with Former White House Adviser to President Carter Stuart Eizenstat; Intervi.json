I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, this week, the world bids farewell to President Jimmy Carter, who died on December 29th at the age of 100. Today, his casket is flown from his home State of Georgia to Washington, D.C., where he will lie in state until Thursday's National Funeral Service. As a one term president beset by crises, including high inflation and the Iranian hostage crisis, Carter's legacy for a long time seemed mixed at best. But throughout his long post-presidency, he devoted himself to peacemaking, eradicating diseases and public service in a way that gradually framed his earlier accomplishments. Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat knew Carter well having served as his chief domestic policy adviser and argues he was our most accomplished one term president. Stuart Eizenstat, welcome to the program.

And there was real pushback into how he initially dealt with some of the domestic issues, particularly the oil issue and asking the American public to do their part to consume less, to take no unnecessary trips, to use carpools, public transportation, obey the speed limit. And then, the one that's become most infamous, setting thermostats to save fuel. These were very unpopular with American voters, and it ended up costing him in terms of his poll numbers in a way that he wasn't always able to redeem himself from.

One, typical Jimmy Carter took on controversial issues even with a political price. And Rosalynn, who is a terrific politician as well, said to him, Jimmy, why don't you wait to do Panama in a second term? It's so electric, it's so controversial. And he said, what is if there's no second term? The second reason he did it was because there was significant conflict. The military, the defense department, wanted him to do it because we were really at risk of having a real battle over Panama. They had grown restless at having the canal taken away from them, as they felt. And so, it was a way of avoiding conflict but also sending a signal of a new era in Latin American-American relations. That together with human rights and promotion of democracy really transformed our whole relationship with Latin America. So, Panama was a part of it. And every president since has been very satisfied with the Panama Canal Treaty. We have the right in the second Panama Canal Treaty, if anything interferes with our shipping, to use military force.

But, Greg, this is -- kudos to you, by the way, for putting that incredible pressure on Colman for agreeing to take this film on. It's a pressing story indeed. And it's a project that you'd been working on for many years. You've been working on a documentary about maximum security prisons, and you came along this program, RTA, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and there had been an article written about it, an Esquire magazine. Talk to us about what this program is and why you thought that this could be a great inspiration for this film. GREG KWEDAR, DIRECTOR, \"SING SING\":  Well, Rehabilitation Through the Arts was founded in 1996 at Sing Sing Prison, as Colman mentioned, you know, one of our most infamous prisons in America. I mean, the term, the big house came from Sing Sing going up the river to prison as is going up the Hudson to Sing Sing. And so, in a place that's so synonymous with prison, the fact that a theater program could exist inside of it, inside of those walls, inside of that razor wire, it felt like almost sort of an act of rebellion, you know, in a way. And I just remember, you know, we've been working on this now for over eight and a half years. And when I first came across the story, it was in the middle of the night in Kansas, I was working on this short documentary inside of a prison, as you mentioned, which was also my first time ever inside of a prison, was that day. And I was just desperate to find out, was there anyone else out there doing things differently inside prisons? And I typed that into Google. And at the top of the search field was this program in New York. And that night I also discovered this Esquire magazine article, which was about a 2005 production at Sing Sing of a time traveling musical comedy called \"Breakin' the. Mummy's Code,\" which was written by a volunteer there, Brent Buell. And in, you know, cooperation with many of the men inside. And there was just this joy in the process of the piece. I mean, the play is wild, you know -- and you know, and we embellish nothing in the movie. And yet, that playfulness, that joy in the process juxtaposed against the environment it was set within, it was like this beacon that was like calling my name. I was just so drawn. I wanted to feel that joy in my own life. And so, I reached out to the real-life Brent Buell, and we had this wonderful conversation. At the end of the conversation, he was just like, if you want to understand this story you need to come to New York. You need to meet some of the men who really lived it. And so, he set up a breakfast at his apartment in New York and my creative partner, Clint Bentley and I came and sat around that table and the real Divine G. Whitfield, who Colman portrays, was there that morning. The real Clarence Divine Eye Maclin, who plays a version of himself in the film, was there that morning. And there was a special warmth and life and love. Everything that Colman's describing is in the net of the experience, we felt that first breakfast and we were like, we could just translate that into a film. We have something really special here. And we're like, OK, like we'll make it later this year. And, you know, eight and a half years later here we are now.",

You know, we had been working on the script for over six years at that point and tried a lot of roads upthe mountain and, you know, hadn't really clicked on that special needle hole, the way to really tell the story. And I had this light bulb moment where I was sitting with my notebook and I had this vision of the tell the story through a friendship, this real-life friendship between Divine G and Divine Eye who these men that we knew. And in that moment, the story just kind of fell out in about 10 minutes in my notebook. And at the very bottom of the page, I just wrote Colman Domingo is Divine G. And it's something that I can't quite explain. I think it's obvious, you know, that he's one of our greatest actors, but there's something about him where -- I don't know the best way to describe it, I think it's just light. There's a light that sort of always emanates him no matter what role he plays and he can play the phone book, you know, in terms of characters. But there's always this unquenchable light source in him that just draws you to him, and that's spirit.

And then -- but there was this program and this need for another performer and to -- and, you know, apparently, he had been on lists or people thought, oh, he has a quality about him, something that's probably untapped, the fact that he's a reader, he's someone who's very interested in history, he's all the things that have the making of someone who would be a theater practitioner, he just wasn't given the opportunity. And so, my character gives him this opportunity. And, you know, it's an instinct and says, oh, I think there's something that he's using in the world or how he's been navigating all systems, whether good or bad that is theatrical. And so, he invites him into it. And then you see, like, the way our film does, these two people who had no idea that they needed each other, or they would learn from each other, form this bond and this brotherhood and this friendship of need on the inside. And at the center of it, it becomes two guys who would never even imagine that they would ever be tender with one another and have a brotherhood and a friendship and be responsible to each other's feelings and to craft work together. That's a beautiful journey that our film takes and that's something that was taken from their true friendship. You know, which I think is really impactful and really shows a different way, a different view into these human beings behind the walls, to show that, hey, there are people who actually are depending on each other to do this sort of work, this soul work, to do some real rehabilitation and healing.",

You know, we just did it because it felt like it was what was necessary and the right thing to do. I mean, independent film, there's a lot of scorched Earth. There's a lack of transparency. There's not much trust, and we felt like a model that would essentially put us all on the same playing field that we would all work for the same rate from our star here, Colman Domingo, who made a great sacrifice in order to enable this model to happen through us all the way through production, our production assistants, all the way through post, our composers, editors, sound designers, we all worked for that same rate. And what it says is that, you know, that we all have the same intrinsic value. The only variable of someone earning more or less is time. And what starts to happen is you migrate someone from an employee mindset to a partner mindset. And within that it's -- it sort of generates a culture where the best ideas can win and come forward because you act differently when something belongs to you, you know, when you truly own something, you take better care of it. And I think, yes, it enabled this movie to happen, you know, and was able - - we were able to make this for a cost, you know, far less than a lot of independent films so that we could tell a story such as this, that our industry would not normally finance. But within it, it also raised the quality of the work and made it a film that I think, you know, the results, you know, I think are showing, but it's because we cared and took care of the process.",

So, he obviously had been thinking about this for a long time, but no one seemed to notice that there was really anything out of the ordinary that might have suggested a violent intent.",

But then, as you note, we have an incident such as occurred in New Orleans where at least as of this moment, there's no evidence that the perpetrator had any contact with ISIS operatives or commanders.

ISIS's goal was to overthrow the regime of Bashar al-Assad. They failed. Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham succeeded. So, now, for ISIS, they are trying to figure out a way that they could elbow themselves back into the limelight, that they can steal some of that thunder that Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham has acquired from having overthrown the regime. And once again, for ISIS to demonstrate its relevance. And tragically, its violent acts of terrorism that they believe will re-establish its preeminence as the biggest terrorist threat in the globe.",

I mean, the proof is in thefact that they recruited on a global basis, 40,000 foreign fighters from at least 120 different countries that came to the caliphate. And back about a decade ago, they did that -- this by using these kinds of social media platforms that were just becoming in vogue. They were using what was then called Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and so on. And they use these as very effective tools to reach a worldwide audience, very immediately in real-time at very low cost. And they also engaged in what we might call narrowcasting. Broadcasting is when you put something on a platform and you hope someone watches it. Narrowcasting is they sculpted their messages on social media to appeal to specific demographics in particular countries. And that's why they succeeded in creating the first truly global terrorist organization.",

So, it's not at all likely that they may have crossed paths. I mean, one was in a special operations unit, was a highly decorated combat veteran. That's Sergeant Livelsberger from Las Vegas. Shamsud-Din Jabbar was in I.T. and human resources in the Army. So, they may possibly have crossed paths casually. There does not appear to be any connection. The only connection I can perhaps divine is that the Las Vegas attack was probably brought forward. That in other words, that attack was precipitously staged to take advantage of all the attention being showered on the incidents in New Orleans. And it was the assumption of, I believe, Sergeant Livelsberger is that he had to move his attack forward in order to get some of that attention.

In other words, large gatherings of people coming out to celebrate a public or a national holiday, a concert, a sporting event. We saw this in Nice almost a decade ago in 2016, when on Bastille Day, a truck ran down the promenade in Nice. We saw this at the Bataclan in Paris in November 2015, when terrorists attacked, firstly, a concert by a heavy metal band, but then simultaneously attacked a sports stadium where a major soccer match was going on. We saw an attack on the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England in 2017. The Taylor Swift concert this past summer in August had to be canceled in Vienna. And now, we have Bourbon Street, New Orleans, you know, after Times Square, probably one of the most iconic party going sites in the United States. Las Vegas as well, certainly a place that tourists flock to. So, what we can infer from this is that terrorists are deliberately targeting venues with large gatherings of persons to inflict the maximum casualties. And of course, this is going to result in a reconsideration of the security measures at all big events and appropriate measures are going to be taken to ensure those who attend that they will feel safe and not stay at home.",

And if we had to focus on any aspect of terrorism, it was from homegrown, whether it was violent left-wing or violent right-wing extremists in the United States, and we kind of forgot about the threat from overseas. But what we're learning now, especially in the aftermath of the tragedy in New Orleans, is that we have to have security and intelligence establishment that cover the waterfront of threats coming from established nation states, peer competitors like China and Russia, rogue states like Iran and North Korea, but also, against terrorist enemies, both foreign and domestic.",

I mean, don't forget, until September 11, 2001, the single mostlethal terrorist attack in the United States was perpetrated by an American killing fellow Americans, and that was the bombing of the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 persons. Very similar to the New Orleans attack, Timothy McVeigh was an Army veteran as well. Was operating with one or two other confederates who were former Army buddies, but wasn't part of any terrorist organization, wasn't following anyone's orders, but took this upon himself. And I think we have to be vigilant for the 00 to counter the entire range of threats that we face. And also have the physical measures in place to make it much more difficult for terrorists to attack. And as you know, there's been tremendous discussion about the bollards issue, for example, or the wedges that would have made it far more difficult for that vehicle to jump up on the sidewalk and mow down the pedestrians there. I mean, that was clearly a lapse that there were police cars blocking off Bourbon Street because the bollards didn't work, but no one imagined that an assailant would jump up on the curve with a vehicle and then mow people down. But that's exactly what happened in Barcelona on the famed Las Ramblas promenade in 2017. So, we have to learn from previous terrorist tragedies and make sure that the physical measures in place are both state of the art, are in fact working, and indeed are anticipating a variety of kinds of attacks.",

But I still think, and I worry we're behind the curve. And for me, the biggest threat looking into the future, and one that I don't believe we have an effective answer to is what are called UAS, unmanned aerial drones, in essence, unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, which have been used on battlefields, which is we saw on October 7, 2023 in Israel were used to facilitate the attack from Gaza. And which we've seen drones being used for surveillance purposes in the United States now on numerous occasions, including the unexplained deployment of drones in New Jersey just last month. And I'm not entirely sure that our defenses against attacks using that type of weapon are as robust as they need to be. Unfortunately, the history of responding to terrorism is closing the barn door after the horse has already gotten out.

Certainly, in the book that myself and my co-author Jacob Ware wrote, \"God, Guns and Sedition,\" we found that there was a high percentage of former veterans who were becoming increasingly politically alienated, felt disenfranchised from the political system and increasingly saw violence as a solution. And part of addressing that proclivity, I think, was recognized in the creation of this task force at the Pentagon, who worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs to address this problem.",
