They were able to get this right up to the moment, as you were noting before, that it gets hit physically and then goes to bar as it loses transmission.So, in other words, they were looking for the most incontrovertible evidence they could have to share with the public. And that's what we have now to contradict the Russian version of events, which is to say that they did not come into direct contact with this plane. The one open question remains this. Yes, Russian pilots have been harassing U.S. surveillance flights with more frequency and more aggressiveness in recent days, weeks, and months, and that this particular interaction, U.S. officials believe, was ordered by Russian higher ups. The question is, was it ordered just to harass or to actually hit that drone? And that remains an open question. Listen, though, what U.S. officials tell me is whether you were told to hit it physically or not, flying that close, dumping your fuel as we see there on the jet and doing so repeatedly, flying so close repeatedly, that's deliberate, and that creates the danger of just such an interaction as this.

The bigger danger going forward, right, is that you have a lot of uncrewed surveillance aircraft flying around both Russia and China, but you have many crewed ones as well. There is harassment both by Russia and China of crewed missions, not to this degree, but listen, if you are flying that close, it increases the risk of something like that. So you could imagine a more dangerous scenario where you have such harassment, and it puts a crew in danger. Thankfully, we are not there, but we should be conscious you do have a lot of crewed flights flying in similar areas and that there is certainly a risk that the U.S. side is certainly aware of.",

There is an enormous amount of U.S. and Russian and NATO hardware flying in and around the Ukrainian airspace right now with the largest war in Europe since World War II. There has been tremendous effort made over the course of the last 13 months to avoid those assets coming into direct conflict. There are lines open to deconflict, as it's known, so they don't come into direct conflict so that you don't end up shooting at each other or putting each other in danger. And this interaction shows that when you mess with those rules and when you deliberately harass, it increases the risk of exactly that.And why has there been such care taken to keep the forces separate? So this does not become a direct military conflict between the U.S. and NATO and Russia. This interaction right there shows how dangerous and close those assets are.",

You've got to keep the lines open, because the danger is real.And remember, go back 20 years, do you remember that interaction over China, a Chinese jet harassed a crewed U.S. spy flight, this was over Hainan Island in 2001, harassed it, hit it, brought that jet down with great danger to the crew.

It's a part of that investigation into Trump's alleged role in the hush-money payments that Stormy Daniels received.Michael Cohen is in our New York studio. We are going to talk to him about what he said in just a few moments.

Trump basically wanted him to convene the general assembly, to convene the state legislature to stop the result of the election, get involved in the federal election results.We know from what Ralston said about the day after this call, he said that he pushed back against this, told Trump basically this wasn't going to happen. It was going to be an uphill battle. But we haven't heard exactly what was said here, how hard Trump pushed, what exactly he was asking and what Ralston told him in response. [08:10:03] Those exact words would have been lost to history, basically, because Ralston died in November. But this recording did exist. We are learning that it does exist.

It isn't necessarily the judge who would get the case if Donald Trump or others were indicted in the Jack Smith special counsel investigations, but it is the person who manages and makes decisions on what happens in the grand jury proceedings. So prosecutors call people to the grand jury. And if there is a fight over that, if Donald Trump, we know he has been fighting eight to 10 different cases in court. Judge Beryl Howell has been making the decisions on those things. She has given the green light to prosecutors, to House investigators. She has also been trying to be very transparency about what is happening in those proceedings as much as she can.She passes the gavel to a long-time Washingtonian who is very well respected, very well known in Washington, named Jeb Boasberg. He is the judge that takes over as the chief of the D.C. district court. I sat down with them both last week, asked them how they were going to be handling things, what they were expecting going forward. Clearly, the grand jury is going to take up a lot of their time. It took a lot of Howell's time. It's probably going to be taking a lot of Boasberg's time. And one of the things he was able to say is that he would try to be as transparent as Howell was able to be on any sealed proceedings that come before him. So we don't know exactly what he will do. He could be different from her. But it is going to be a very key role going forward.",
