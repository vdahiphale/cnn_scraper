State officials there said the suspect is dead, the situation is contained and tragically there are multiple victims. Police are doing a sweep of the hospital right now. We're going to stay on top of the story and bring you the facts as we get them. Plus, newly reported audio of Donald Trump just two months after the January 6 insurrection discussing what he expected if he got his wish, and had been able to join the mob at the Capitol that day. And leading this hour, antisemitism pushed by right wing media figures with little apparent pushback in their conservative circles. The vile comments viewed by some of the biggest names with major megaphones beginning with the richest man in the world. Now we've heard a lot from the Jewish community since October 7 about how shocking it has been to hear so much antisemitism from traditionally progressive places such as liberal organizations and Ivy League schools. They're not talking about criticism of the Israeli government or the IDF military campaign in Gaza, they're talking about praise for Hamas is savage terrorist attacks on Israeli and Jewish citizens on October 7. The New York branch of the Democratic Socialists of America called those October 7 attacks on civilians, quote, \"resistance,\" they have since apologized. And then there are multiple incidents on college campuses praising those terrorist attacks. On October 8, one Columbia University professor wrote an essay that uses language that sure sounds a lot like praise for Hamas's attacks including for a, quote, \"Innovative Palestinian resistance, which early on Saturday morning launched a surprise attack on Israel by air, land and sea.\" Almost all of the essay launch the attack as a great, quote, \"stunning victory of the Palestinian resistance over the Israeli military\" as a, quote, \"historic event.\" Now remember, this is an attack where 1200 Israelis, Americans and others, most of them civilians, were slaughtered, including babies and children and the elderly, where women and girls were rape, where an estimated 240 individuals, most of them civilians were kidnapped, but this was apparently worthy of praise for innovation by an Ivy League professor. When that Columbia professor was asked about his comment, he argued that we were taking his words out of context, that the words were meant to convey the surprised nature of the attack and that he decried the horrifying toll on all sides. At Cornell, an associate professor said he felt exhilarated with the news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

BEN SHAPRIO, THE DAILY WIRE CO-FOUNDER: The question was about Candace Owens. I think her behavior during this has been disgraceful. Yes. She still works for my company. And I think she's been absolutely disgraceful. I think that her faux sophistication on these particular issues has been ridiculous. DARCY (voice-over): Owens appear to fire back and response drenched in antisemitism, suggesting Shapiro opted for a wealth of a virtue coding a Bible verse saying, \"You cannot serve both God and money.\" CNN reached out to The Daily Wire for comment and has not gotten a reply. The rhetoric comes as antisemitic attacks are surging across the U.S. and around the world. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the ADL spoke out against the commentary coursing through right wing media. Responding to Musk, Greenblatt said, \"At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) DARCY (on camera): And Jake, this is really ugly rhetoric.

Congressman, I just want to first get your reaction to the report we just did, which started with voices on the left, including at Columbia University and Cornell University, the Democratic socialists of America New York branch, spewing praise for Hamas or what sounded like praise for Hamas in many instances. And then, of course, these right wing media figures pushing white replacement theory white genocide, blaming that on Jews, you're a prominent member of Congress, who's Jewish. What's your reaction? REP. DANIEL GOLDMAN (D-NY): Well, we've known that there's been this strain of antisemitism on the right for some time, Charlottesville being the prime example of that. What we have seen over the last six weeks is a latent antisemitism bubbling over into the public sphere that's coming from the far fringe left. It's sort of the horseshoe theory that meets around antisemitism, where you have the extreme left and the extreme right, both of which, for different reasons, seem to hate Jewish people. It is incredibly disheartening, Jake, that in the aftermath of the most brutal, horrific attack, genocidal terrorist attack on Jews in Israel on October 7, that rather than rally around the Jewish community and Israel, what we are seeing on college campuses and elsewhere, all around the country, and certainly in New York City is a rise in antisemitism.

However, Hamas attack from Gaza, and that's where the war is and that's where the ward needs to stay. There can be no vigilante justice by civilians or settlers of the extremist nature, and Ben Gvir and Smotrich, as you mentioned, are their leaders. They cannot be permitted to use their own means and methods to try to take advantage of this situation to kill Palestinians, to expand their settlements, and that there is no room for error here.Israel has to be very strategic, they have to be very targeted, and they have to be very focused on what the job at hand here and that is eliminated Hamas, it is not to start a multi front war in the West Bank. And ultimately, the overarching objective, as we just discussed, is a two state solution. And it is essential that Israel demonstrate that it will be a viable and meaningful partner to any other Palestinian government that is willing to be a good faith partner as well in a two state solution.

Joining us now CNN's Kristen Holmes to explain.Kristen, this is certainly the longest of long shots regardless if it's an initial loss for Trump. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jake. And that's why Donald Trump's team is optimistic in the long run. Now, as you say they are bracing for a loss today. So much so that I'm told by sources that they've already written out in appeal that they plan to file immediately if and when the court rules against them. But they do believe that this could be or will be turned over and appeal. One source telling me they think it could even go all the way up to the Supreme Court, but that will eventually get overturned. Now the reason for that is there's a few, one being that they point to these other cases similar to this that were brought in New Hampshire, Minnesota, Michigan, none of them made it to trial. They were all dismissed before that. They also have an argument with the fact that the cases in Georgia and Washington, those election subversion cases are still ongoing. Trump has not been convicted in either of those cases and he's not been charged with the crime of insurrection. Now, no surprise, Jake, they have accused this judge of being politically biased. They asked her to recuse herself over $100 donation she made to a liberal group that was formed in the aftermath of January 6, she refused to do so saying that she did not know the group's mission and that she believes she could still rule thoroughly.

Donald Trump at the top.Just this past week, he came after \"ABC's\" Jon Karl for his new book, where he made it a point to come after Kim Kardashian but say Kanye West, a noted anti-Semite who had said some of the most deeply offensive things I won't repeat about the Jews, and said that, you know, that's a better person than she is. When you have somebody at the top dabbling in that, not even dabbling, embracing it and meeting with people disgusting human beings like Nick Fuentes, it gives license to these other characters who are all part of this ecosystem of right wing media where they print money off of it. At the end of the day, we've kind of allowed it there's sort of this permission that's been granted. And I think it's incumbent on elected officials to be responsible about who they communicate with what platforms they appear on.
