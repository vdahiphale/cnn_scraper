Trump was at 58 percent, DeSantis at 22 percent.Where do we stand now? Look at this, Trump at 61 and DeSantis at 23. Trump is holding on to a clear advantage in the Republican race, and while this poll is perhaps a little bit more favorable to Trump than the average, the fact is pretty much all the polls at this particular point showed Donald Trump garnering a majority of the Republican vote. Now, let's look at the general electorate, right. Look here. The choice for president, Trump versus Biden. Pre-indictment in the hush money case, Biden was up by just a point. Very close nationally. Look at where we are today. Look at this, we're tied nationally. We're tied nationally.

In private, I haven't really found anybody who does not think that this will help him in the primary process, because of all of the numbers Harry just showed to Sara. Because of what we have seen in recent history. The way that the base rallies around Donald Trump. And in large part, they're rallying around him because he is sending out fundraising notices. He is going on the campaign trail, like he did Saturday. And leaning into this indictment as a reason to re-elect him. I am you. You are me. We are aggrieved.All of the, sort of, broader themes that helped him get the nomination back in 2016, it's a different, more personal variation of it.
