I'm Kim Brunhuber.It's 5:00 a.m. here in Atlanta, noon at Gaza City where a safe passage corridor has been established for Palestinians to evacuate to Southern Gaza as Israel has ordered them to do. Israeli military opened the corridor about two hours ago and says it will remain open another four hours. But once they get to Southern Gaza, there's nowhere to go and the border crossing into Egypt doesn't appear to open. Meanwhile, the ID continued pounding Hamas targets in Gaza overnight. A short time ago, Israel announced that it killed the senior Hamas commander who is supposedly the mastermind of last weekend's terrorist attacks. An unknown number of Americans are believed to be among the 150 or so hostages now in Hamas' captivity. On Friday President Biden spoke with the families and said the U.S. is doing everything possible to find their loved ones. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Unfortunately, they are not a priority for the Hamas terror organization. Hamas, we really should be asking them, what are your contingency plans when you came over the border and massacred innocent Israelis, took them off as hostages? What do you think we would do? And of course, we can see that they would assume we would, of course, like any normal country, come back and try to completely annihilate their efforts, they have to do this again, and just left their civilians as hostages, they took all of them. 2 million of the civilians are hostages of Hamas in Gaza right now. We are the only ones that are actually trying to save these people by opening a humanitarian corridor. We know it's going about to take time. We create and asked for it to be done within 24 hours.

And as we understand it, hospitals are running on just a few hours of electricity each day. There simply isn't enough capacity. This is an area that already had a crumbling infrastructure on all fronts before the war began. Now, under a complete siege and with the blockade still very much in place. This densely populated strip of land, home to more than 2 million people, is facing a catastrophe on the humanitarian front.

There were at least three intelligence reports, two American, one Israeli, in the days leading up to the horrific events of October 7th.On September 28th and October 5th, the U.S. Intelligence Community issued warnings of potential cross border strikes by Hamas with rocket fire and then the growing possibility of violence around Gaza. Then, on October 6th, there was a third report from Israel, that was the day before the attacks, saying that there was unusual activity by Hamas. Sources are now telling CNN that these reports looked nothing like what ended up unfolding in terms of the scope and the barbarity. A Biden administration official tells CNN, \"There was no information warning about the terrorist attack in advance.\" Instead, sources tell us that the sense was that if something happened, that it would look more like it had in the past, perhaps rocket fire from Gaza. Interceptions then by the Israeli Iron Dome and possible responses into Gaza by Israel. But more profoundly, U.S. sources say there was a general complacency that had taken hold in Israel, underestimating what Hamas could pull off. And given that Gaza and Hamas are in Israel's backyard, American sources say the onus is primarily on Israeli intelligence to have detected the looming plot. Still, with regular warnings from the U.S. Intelligence Community and Middle Eastern allies as well about a buildup of Hamas weapons and growing Palestinian anger, this is also raising questions about whether the Biden administration was taking the Hamas threat seriously enough.

So, that's going to require material support from the U.S. and its allies to Ukraine and Israel simultaneously.And that's going to become a real challenge because already we're seeing domestic political instability in the U.S. that is potentially going to get in the way of signing off on aid bills to Ukraine. At the same time, we're seeing military supplies and military production in western countries start to dwindle. You know, the phrase, the bottom of the barrel is really coming to the fore. So, I think that the Russians and the Chinese are watching this very closely. And if they see the evidence that the U.S. is overextended, is basically unable to support Ukraine and Israel simultaneously, they might try and exploit that elsewhere around the globe.

They have said that these evacuation orders defy the rules of humanity. They've gone on to say that they defy the rules of war and \"that there is nowhere safe.\" That's coming directly from an OCHA statement.Now, why are they saying that? You have to consider what is being asked here of Gazan, some 1.1 million people asked to evacuate in a matter of hours to an undefined destination, head southwards. Where is that? The fear, the concern is that you could be looking at hundreds of thousands of families essentially in the open, on the streets as bombs continue to rain down. Remember, that the Israeli military, just yesterday, said that it had dropped 6,000 bombs in a matter of six days. That's 1,000 bombs a day on average. And under those conditions, Palestinians are expected to pack up their families, pack up their elderly, those who even need medical help, pregnant women, whoever they are and somehow make their way southward where already the United Nations and other aid groups have said there was simply no assistance there. And this is all, of course. under siege. This -- the Gaza Strip was already under blockade for many years prior to this conflict. It is now under complete siege. Rights groups have warned that many Palestinians no longer have access to electricity, no longer have access to clean water. Still, you're going to see hundreds of thousands of people try to make their way south, Kim, try desperately to find that safety. But of course, the concern is, is once there you're going to be looking at a massive humanitarian crisis, one that aid groups can simply not address. Again, because of that blockade that is not allowing aid in. That's why you're hearing the Norwegian Refugee Council call this a war crime of forcible transfer. Now, the Israeli military, of course, says it is targeting Hamas sites, that its stated aim is to destroy Hamas.
