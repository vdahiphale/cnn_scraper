We have CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider, CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paul Reid, and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. They all have new reporting to share with us. Evan, how did this decision come to pass?EVAN PEREZ, Well, Victor and Alisyn, this was a decision that's been weeks in the -- in the making. The -- it was clear, certainly, that the former President, Donald Trump, was going to announce that he was going to run for office once more and that really put the pressure frankly, on the Justice Department trying to figure out a way to insulate or at least try to insulate these important investigations from the political maelstrom that we know for sure is going to be coming. And so, what the attorney general has done is that he has appointed a special counsel. We're going to hear the name of that person in the next 15 minutes or so when he comes out to speak here at the Justice Department. But that -- we already know what this special counsel is going to be looking at. They're going to be overseeing both of the investigations, the Mar-a-Lago investigation, the investigation into the retention of those classified documents that the FBI has found when they conducted a search at Mar-a-Lago, the former president's residence, as well as some key aspects of the January 6 investigation. What that tells us is that this is not taking over all of the January 6 investigation where you know you have more than a thousand people who are facing charges related to the -- to the insurrection. What this person is going to be overseeing is the aspects of this investigation that have to do with Donald Trump, the people around him, and the allegation that they conspired to obstruct the transfer of power after the January -- after the 2020 election. So, those are the two aspects of this -- of these two investigations that have to do with Donald Trump that this special counsel is going to be overseeing, Victor and Alisyn.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Now, let's be clear, the former president has many attorneys. There are two separate investigations here. I just got off the phone with one of his attorneys who's working on the January 6 investigation. I asked for a reaction to the appointment of a special counsel. This attorney said it's interesting, but their hair isn't exactly on fire right now. This is something that they knew was being considered. They're not sure how this really changed this dynamic. But what they're really interested to know is who is it.They know that there is a very small group of people who could really make this investigation not appear partisan. They, of course, pointed to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller and noted that as someone with Sterling Republican and law enforcement credentials, and, of course, that investigation was highly politicized in the press and by Republicans. So, at this point, they don't seem too upset about this. But again, this is separate from lawyers representing him on the Mar- a-Lago investigation, who may feel differently as most sources would agree that right now poses a greater legal risk to the former president. So, they may have a different reaction to that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Victor. So, the most important thing here is special counsel has all the powers that any federal prosecutor, that any U.S. attorney would have. He can investigate, he can use Grand Jury subpoenas, he can get wiretaps, search warrants, he can ultimately indict, take please, try a case, go to sentencing all the things that a normal prosecutor would do. There are some differences, however. As Jessica was saying, a special counsel has a bit more insulation politically and practically.The regulations say special counsel is not subject to the day-to-day supervision of the attorney general. And the special counsel really gets to make all the big decisions himself. However, it is important to note that ultimately, the buck does still stop at the attorney general. The attorney general can overrule the special counsel. If so, the Attorney General then has to actually explain that in a written report to Congress. So, there's a bit of protection here. I think the main idea is Merrick Garland is looking to outsource, at least, the initial decision about whether to bring charges relating to Mar-a-Lago or January 6 against Donald Trump. And the reason -- legally, the reason why you appoint special counsel is to avoid a potential conflict of interest. And I think the thinking here is well, now we have Donald Trump, an official candidate for 2024, there could be at least an appearance of a conflict if you have Joe Biden's DOJ. Joe Biden selected attorney general leading the investigation of somebody who could be running against Joe Biden in 2024. So, it's going to be crucial to see, as we've said, who this person is, does this person have bipartisan or better yet, nonpartisan credentials. There are plenty of longtime prosecutors out there, people who have served under both administrations. It's important to note one more thing. The special counsel has to come from outside of government. So, it is supposed to be somebody who's not currently serving in the U.S. government. That said, I expect it to be a former prosecutor, perhaps a former judge. CAMEROTA: OK, really interesting. So, Evan, just tell us the nuts and bolts of how this will work. Once this person is named in less than 10 minutes, what will they have access to? How long will this process take? Because we all remember that the Robert Mueller investigation at times felt interminable.",

So, what I have learned is that remember, we reported on those dozens of subpoenas that went out to members of Trump's inner circle as well as those who had been associated with the former president back in September, and I have learned that of those -- some of those people were recently contacted and given new dates to appear before the grand jury in the near future.Now, many of these people had hoped that the investigations had stalled or even halted because they hadn't heard from the Department of Justice. Many of them met that document deadline, which was back in September -- October but clearly, they are ramping this up. And it is been to the surprise of many of these people, some of them who were in Trump's inner circle to be getting these dates with their lawyers working on when they are going to appear before the grand jury.",

But frankly, it's not clear whether or not the president actually knew at that point, and that's because I'm told that the White House did not get a heads-up from the Department of Justice as it relates to this decision to appoint a special counsel. White House officials that I've been speaking with have been learning about this through news reports.And we're also told by a White House official that look, the Department of Justice makes these decisions independent of any interference or any influence from the White House, makes these decisions independently saying \"we are not involved.\" So that has been the White House's position as it relates to most matters relating to the Department of Justice and any criminal investigations, whether they be into people -- the president's political opponents like Donald Trump, or his family members like Hunter Biden. The response from the White House is almost always the same, which is, we let the Department of Justice do its thing. We're not involved. And in this case, they are learning about disappointment through news reports, not getting any heads-up from DOJ.",

      "sentences": "Well, to be clear, there are two investigations here. He has many lawyers working on each of them. I spoke with one of the attorneys who's working on the January 6 investigation and that is, based on our reporting, considered to be less of an imminent legal threat to the former president than the facts as we know them in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. So, this attorney who's working on January 6 said that this was an interesting choice. His two questions, though, were who will be the special counsel, right? That's the question of the hour. And then what will their mandate be?Specifically, when it comes to January 6, they assume that it will include any involvement or any potential charges for their client, the former president, but what about his close associates? Will that also be something that the special counsel will be overseeing? Is that also something the attorney general believes is too politically fraught to continue to handle or they just focus on the former president because he is now a candidate? Now, on the Mar-a-Lago side of things, it sounds like the lawyers on that side have been dreading this because this also suggests that this investigation is not winding down. It is not winding up. That it will continue. There's a lot of outstanding questions in that investigation, including the sorting through of classified material, of privilege, personal material. There are other issues, bigger issues being litigated through the federal court systems. We knew this was going to take a while, but by appointing a special counsel, they have sent a message that particularly the Mar-a-Lago investigation and January 6. They are going to continue, they're possibly even ramping up. So, it's not great news for the president's attorneys. We'll be the first ones to tell you that they were kind of hoping things would wrap up soon.",

Otherwise, the Justice Department, normal prosecutors, the regular rank-and-file, there were already well into this investigation. Ultimately, they have the power to make a decision.[14:20:07] Now, what this means is they're going to bring in some outsider who makes the decision who will have some more independence than a typical prosecutor from the attorney general. So, I don't think it makes a -- an indictment any more or less likely. The special counsel doesn't necessarily have any special powers that an ordinary federal prosecutor wouldn't have, but the idea here is to create -- to mitigate any potential conflict of interest. And I think Jeremy's reporting that it appears the Biden administration and the president himself, the White House, did not know this was coming. I think that's a really important point because DOJ, in my view, should be operating independently of politics, independent of the White House, and so it appears DOJ Merrick Garland has made this decision to appoint a special counsel on their own without consulting with the White House, without consulting with the president, and if the whole point here is let's get rid of any appearance of a conflict of interest, then that's a smart move.",
