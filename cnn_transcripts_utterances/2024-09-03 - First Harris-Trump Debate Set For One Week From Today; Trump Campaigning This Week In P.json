      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the mad dash to election day, new TV ad, bus tours, economic rollouts. The Harris campaign is trying to flood the campaign zone one week before the candidates meet face to face for the first time, literally for the first time, on the debate stage.Plus, from a very pro-choice to the most pro-life president, Donald Trump is certainly contorting himself on the critical issue of abortion. I'll ask one of the former president's top supporters in Congress, what stance voters should believe. And a CNN exclusive. The son of a former Republican presidential nominee is slamming the party's current nominee. For the first time, you'll hear Jimmy McCain searing reaction to Trump's conduct the hollowed grounds where several generations of his family are buried. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. And first up, nine weeks away, 63 days away, just 1500 hours or so. Not that anyone is counting election day right around the corner. In some states, voting begins just days from now. If you live in the battleground state of North Carolina, ballots, they actually go out on Friday, which makes the first and potentially only debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, that much more crucial. It happens one week from today in the must win state of Pennsylvania. And it comes after weeks of back and forth between the two campaigns of scheduling and rules, as both sides realize this event could transform this now final stretch of the race. We start things off with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, has been talking to resources inside the Harris campaign. Priscilla, what are you hearing about how the vice president is preparing for that debate at this point?",

The vice president has been familiarizing herself with the former president's record and his statements. Practice sessions have also -- already been underway since last month. And she is approaching this through a method that she is familiar with as a trial lawyer.Now post the Democratic National Convention, sources told me that her pace of travel is going to slow down a little bit compared to the previous weeks, so that she could hunker down and focus on debate preparations again, recognizing that this is going to be an important moment. And one, where she will be toe-to-toe against former President Donald Trump. Now, of course, it is still a debate about the debates, as they still work on those rules, particularly whether the mics are on or off. But certainly, heading into the debate, the Harris campaign is trying to frame this with the economy and reproductive rights. The vice president heading to New Hampshire tomorrow, where she's going to be talking about entrepreneurship, small businesses and innovation. Again, this comes on the heels of another econ related ad released today where they are talking about affordability and fine tuning their message on an issue that is important to voters. And then two, on reproductive rights, kicking off that reproductive rights tour today in Florida. One that's going to be composed of mostly surrogates, elected officials and the campaign says celebrities.",

What should that tell people?AYESHA RASCOE, HOST, NPR \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": I mean, it tells people that things are very close, like we live in a very divided country, almost evenly divided. And the fact is, when it comes to the Electoral College, there's no way that Harris can feel very comfortable right now. She would need to be up four or five points nationally to really feel safe. She's not there yet. Now, she has brought a lot of Democrats home, but she has not -- she doesn't have that comfortable lead yet. And I have to say that when it comes to Trump, you know, kind of trying to get him to be more demure, if we use that word, it never happens, right? Like -- and I, you know, I've done a lot of reporting on this. In 2018, I looked at thousands of his tweets and the way that he tweets about black people. When black people do something are critical of him. His go to line is to question their intelligence, to question their competence. Like this is something that I have looked at, I have studied. It is his go to thing. And I think that it will be very difficult for him to get on that stage and not call Kamala Harris stupid or to question her intelligence. We've seen this before with him. He's already done it. I think it's going to be very hard for him. MATTINGLY: Yeah. The subtext of the Graham opinion piece is, literally, don't do -- please don't do that. Please don't do that. Talk about your record. Talk about policies. Talk about contrast. One of the contrasts Trump's advisers want him to talk about is the economy. And while Harris has closed the gap a little bit on kind of the divide in terms of how voters view Trump on the economy versus where they were with Biden, with her as well. It is clear that's a vulnerability. There's no question about it, based on how people feel. I was fascinated as the Harris team has rolled out some of the economic proposals, Mario, our Bloomberg person, so you got to talk about the economy that her ad that they released today said this, watch/ (PLAYING VIDEO)",

He had a double-digit lead earlier against Joe Biden, that's trickled down to maybe a single-digits, three points or so.What we're seeing is voters aren't asking for a lot. What voters are asking for is an acknowledgement of the economic pain that they felt over the last couple of years as we recover from the post covid time period. Biden. What voters were frustrated with about Biden was that he was on the defensive on the trail. He was touting the Inflation Reduction Act. He was looking at some of the figures. Those figures -- the economic figures that were coming out of Washington D.C., just weren't feeling, you know, they weren't resonating with voters at the grocery store. What you see Kamala Harris doing is acknowledging the pain, and voters are giving her the credit for it. She's cut into Trump's lead. And a lot of that is just that sympathy that she -- and empathy that she's given to voters.",

The fiery demonstrations come as the prime minister navigates war with Hamas and simmering tensions with his closest allies. Three days since six hostages, including one American, were found murdered in a Gaza tunnel.President Biden has not spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The president told reporters last night they'd speak, quote, eventually may not be a friendly conversation whenever it happens. Biden also told reporters yesterday that his embattled counterpart hasn't done enough to reach a deal with Hamas, a comment that infuriated the Israeli government. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live from the White House. Arlette, obviously, there was a Situation Room meeting yesterday morning. There's not been a lot publicly said since.

Now, President Biden yesterday laid bare just the latest tension point between him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When he said that it's his belief, he has not done enough to move these hostage negotiations along. The Israelis bristled at that, saying that they've come to these conversations in a serious matter. Later, a U.S. official saying that the president has made clear that he believes Hamas is responsible for the latest hostage deaths, but also stressing that Israel needs to approach this matter with a sense of urgency. Now, the president convened his national security team yesterday in the Situation Room to talk about the next steps that they can take to try to reach some type of an agreement. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, was working the phones with Israeli and Qatari officials yesterday to try to advance these negotiations. But it still remains unclear what track, what path this will take, and whether they can get the side -- both sides to an agreement? Now, in that meeting yesterday was also Vice President Kamala Harris, who so far, really has not departed from President Biden when it comes to their policy towards Israel. That is something that she stressed in an interview. She did with our colleague Dana Bash just last week. We are also waiting to hear from President Biden directly. Today he will be hosting an event relating to how his agenda has impacted Americans, but it could be an opportunity for him to also addressed questions related to the latest situation in these talks. As both the presidents and other officials have stressed that there is some urgency to try to get this deal done. The question is, what can they do to try to get Israel, try to get Hamas into an agreement to push this across the finish line?",

They wanted a change in this what was a rematch. They didn't want to see Biden and Trump go head-to-head. And the fact that Harris gave them that -- meant that a number of base voters, voters of color, young voters, just immediately came back to her because she gave them something that they had been wanting for so long. Now, there are still uncommitted voters that haven't heard what they want to hear from her. But they also say that they feel as though she is much more empathetic than they believe Biden has been in terms of Palestinians and in terms of Gaza. Now the question is, is what Biden said yesterday, saying -- really calling out Netanyahu, even though it was very brief. Does Harris start to do that more and more? Now, she has been stronger when she talks about Gaza than Biden over the last few months. But does she start to separate more and more, and say that -- that ultimately, it's Netanyahu who is preventing them from reaching a deal and use harsher language when she talks about how the negotiations are going or not.",

Could that be enough to put Trump over the top? So there has to be a concern about that. Now, of course, in Pennsylvania, you may have the opposite concern, right? And so, I think that is why you may see these sorts of ads from the Republicans trying to poke a little bit, because all they're trying to do is get at those margins.
