We consolidated our resource, we're working very, very closely with our regional and state partners, but this is an actual time where we had time to prepare.

So that is why they're so concerned about flooding and the danger of the roads here.If you look down here, I'm told that this is an area that does flood when there is a winter storm or if there's runoff from, you know, the snow in the mountains here, and so this is why they've shut this down so early because flooding could come all the way up to these barricades. Despite that, we did just see people out here who were off-roading out into the wilderness back there. That's exactly what the mayor of Palm Springs does not want people to do.

Does it look like it's happening right now? And yes, it is. All right, our Kyung Lah is there.

And I want just to give you a sense of what the preparations have been impacting this residential commercial area. This entire street here is completely shut down.And the reason why it's shut down as Gregg Canes takes a look through these barricades is if you look down further the street, further down this street, this is an area that is a flood plain. In part because there's a river right underneath this overpass. And then all the water from the mountains, the deserts, not exactly where Stephanie Elam has been but the deserts further east of here, all of that water has to go somewhere. And so it ends up coming into Mission Valley and then heading out to the river. The drainage systems so far appear to be working very, very well here in San Diego, but the concern of course is that how much water can the city take on immediately at once. So that's why you're seeing this preparation. The rain here may look like ordinary rain to you at home, but this is August. This is an area that doesn't typically get this kind of rain. And so for so much of it to come down so quickly is a concern by the city. Also car accidents. What people are doing. If they're paying attention to these road closures. And so the preparation, Fredricka, has continued here in San Diego. You just saw that press conference. City officials saying, look, the beaches are closed, the parks are closed, the Navy has already moved 10 ships out of the bay here. That they want people to heed the warnings over these next 48 hours -- Fredricka. WHITFIELD: All right. Fair enough warning. Kyung Lah, thank you so much for that. All right, let's bring in Los Angeles County supervisor Janice Hahn for the very latest. Janice, good to see you. So this flash flood warning is in effect through the evening.

I don't know if that's a number that you're comfortable with, too.But, nevertheless, a lot of people are there. Storm surges could be an issue. I mean, this is going to be a lot of rain, water, and with that brings all kinds of unpredictable things with the tide as well.

They don't see themselves getting off. I believe we might have had a few that took the last ferry to the mainland, but we are sending extra rescue boats over there. There's already like two rescue boats from our fire department, we're adding a third, and each of the boats we're having extra personnel on.Our sheriff's department is also on the island and they're staffing up to make sure they can help, but there's like 90 properties on Catalina and they know each and every one of those properties. They probably know the names of everybody that stays there. I think the biggest concern is our investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison, operating one power plant over there at Pebbly Beach, and we're worried that it could become flooded and then there would be a massive power outage to the entire island. So that is why we were trying to get more people off. But according to Mayor Annie Marshall they've also gotten the word up. People were stocking up on food and batteries so that they might can last.

Of course the whole state, though, has been feeling the effects of this storm as it's moved quickly up the peninsula towards California.There was that death earlier in the town of Santa Rosalia, a coastal city, a bit further down the peninsula. This was a man who was caught in his car as rain there had really been pummeling the area for hours. Four inches of rain fell in just a few hours. That's about four times the daily average that this town gets in August. So the roads there really became rivers as you saw in that video. And this man was swept away. Authorities have said they were able to rescue a few other people but really high alert in Santa Rosalia and across the Baja Peninsula. Of course this storm moving towards California. It will get there maybe around 3:00 local time, authorities say. Now on its way, though, is Ensenada, that's Mexico's important wine region with a lot of tourist infrastructure there. And then there's Tijuana, the border city that's really been a hub for migrants making their way up to the U.S. And authorities are especially worried about Tijuana, it has very sensitive infrastructure, it's very hilly, a lot of makeshift residences built into those hills and mudslides are common there. So authorities throughout the state warning people to stay home, do not get into your car. They have opened up several shelters throughout the state, Fred.

So whether that be for educational advancement, career opportunities, of traveling, even so we -- I personally travel back to Hawaii, maybe every four to six months on the latest.

And this marks the fourth time since be voted out of office in 2022 that Trump has been indicted.Joining me now to discuss this is Tim Naftali.

And the President -- former President making the argument that this was aspirational. And, you know, that this is -- there was some sense that this was some kind of crazy scheme.And I wanted people to understand this was not a Lucy -- Lucy Ricardo, or Larry David scheme. This was the kind of scheme you would more appropriately see in a Jack Ryan streaming show. This was a serious effort to undermine our democracy, and that it was done in phases. When one thing didn't work, then they try something else. And they ultimately ended up with this pressure campaign that involves fake electors and an attempt to paralyze Congress on January 6. I wanted folks to understand this was like an attempt to overthrow a government that indeed, our government has done via covert action since World War Two. So this is serious, and there should be consequences. And that was my hope, to try to make sense of it all, lay out the story of the conspiracy, so that people who are not necessarily partisan, don't need to be partisan, but care about our democracy. And our Constitution would say, you know, this is something we can't let happen again. So in many ways, this is an argument for making sure the next time we don't have -- we have -- the next one we have a close election, that nobody thinks they can get away with the pressure campaign that Trump, Giuliani and their allies tried to foist upon the American people in 2020 and 2021.",
