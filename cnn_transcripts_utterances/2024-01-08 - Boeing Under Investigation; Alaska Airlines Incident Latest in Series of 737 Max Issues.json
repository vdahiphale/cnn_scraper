      "sentences": "All right, markets rebounding after a miserable start to 2024. It's been only a week, but tech stocks lifting theNASDAQ nearly two percent, the Dow being held down by Boeing. Those are the markets and these are the main events: Investigators are scrambling to figure out how the fuselage flew out of a 737 Max jet. A top Hezbollah commander is killed in southern Lebanon. And Elon Musk denies a report that he uses recreational drugs. We're going to be speaking to a \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who helped write that story. Coming to you live from New York, it is Monday, January 8th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening. US investigators are scrambling as I speak to figure out what exactly caused a near disaster on an Alaska Airlines flights this weekend. A piece of fuselage blew out of this 737 Max on Friday. Can you imagine? This happened almost five kilometers up in the air. People clearly terrified. It left a gaping hole on the side of the plane forcing an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon. Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded many 737 Max-9 aircrafts because they are all undergoing inspection after this incident. Boeing shares have fallen over six percent on this news. It is not the first time it's had issues with the 737 Max. We're going to be touching on that a little bit later on. But Richard Quest is joining us live now from Geneva. So Richard, I was listening to what you were saying earlier on, and that was, you know, the one sort of saving grace was the fact that this happened during takeoff when people's seatbelts are still fastened. Imagine if this had happened later on in the flight when people had been walking around the cabin. I mean, it would have been -- it is already an absolute disaster, it would have been even more so. Just give us your take on what happened here. RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\":   Well, we know what happens when a plane depressurizes. People get sucked out, it's happened before. One woman got sucked out of a portal of a window when Aloha Airways Airlines, the roof came off the top of the plane from Hawaii, people got sucked out. We've had doors, we've had baggage doors that have failed, and people have got sucked out. Now when you look at the size of the -- this was a door size and therefore, if this had happened at thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-five thousand feet, the result would have been very much worse because people would have been walking around the cabin. Remember also, Zain, we now know that this blew off the door of the cockpit. We knew that it took off the headrests of various seats. And that I think is why no truck can be left to find the cause. Having the door plug now will greatly assist that. They will be able to compare it to the one on the other side of the aircraft, they will be able to look at the metallurgy right the way round, all of those parts that failed. Because in theory, remember, the way it works, it pushes out, okay. It pushes out like any other door. The goal is to push out, so it's not supposed to come out. How it failed? Therefore, the structure around it failing, allowing it to come out is going to be the big issue.",

Richard Quest live for us there, thank you so much. We appreciate it. Investigators say the section of plane that broke off landed in the backyard of an Oregon school teacher, and as Richard just said, the missing piece of the fuselage will be an important clue into what exactly caused this mishap. The National Transportation Safety Board says it will give the inside of the aircraft a thorough exam. NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy says a pressure warning light went off three times on that plane since December. She says it's not certain though whether the warning light is relevant to Friday's incident. Mike Valerio joins us live now from Portland, Oregon, where this piece of fuselage was found.

So what's going to be happening in the next few hours, we're just standing a couple hundred meters away from where the plane is parked, this across the runway through the rain and fog of Portland, Oregon is Flight 1282 -- Alaska Flight 1282. Important to note though, as we zoom in, the hole where the door plug should be that is on the other side of the aircraft that is facing away from our point of view. So since they have, the National Transportation Safety Board safety team has picked up that door plug found in the backyard of somebody's home a few kilometers away from where we're standing, they will bring that section of the aircraft back to the aircraft itself. And as Richard Quest was so expertly explaining a couple of minutes ago, compare what fell out of the sky to the part of the aircraft that is still where it is supposed to be on the right hand side of the plane. So that is certainly the biggest prize that's been found in this investigation. But also remarkable developments that we heard late in the day yesterday that not one, but two cell phones found and turned over to federal aviation authorities. At least one of them, Zain, was in good working order. Now how this was found, I believe in the control room, we have the soundbite, a man made a TikTok about how he came across one of these cell phones. He said that federal officials throughout the weekend here in Oregon had told people to go out and look for portions -- for the biggest portion of that aircraft. He decided to go on a walk, see if you could find anything. Lo and behold, he finds an iPhone on the side of the road. Listen to what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I was thinking this could just be thrown out of a car, someone dropped it while they were jogging. But I found it. It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn't have a screen lock on it.

As I was speaking about with Richard Quest, the 737 Max was grounded five years ago after two crashes that killed more than 300 people.

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think we need to get to the bottom of what happened here, first and foremost, right? The issues that you're speaking of hadmore to do with some sensors and information that was flowing into the cockpit that controlled the plane itself. The aircraft, and the issue at hand here is a plugged door, and Ryanair is a very important customer for Boeing. They manufacture this -9 with those additional doors in it because Ryanair likes to fly its aircraft with pretty dense seating configurations. Most other airlines don't fly so dense and so they don't need to use those doors. So that's why they're plugged and they look like regular windows when you're sitting inside the cabin of the aircraft. And look, this configuration has been designed into the -9 aircraft since the previous variant of the 737, what's called the NG, so this goes back to the late 1990s that we've been flying with plugged doors, and the current variant has been flying since 2015, the Max, and all along the way, we've not had an issue with these plugged doors. So we've got a long history without any issues. And then we have a brand new aircraft that comes off the production line here and has an issue two months after being delivered, and in between the time that it left Boeing's facility and this incident here, it also visited a pair of reportedly an MRO facility to have some work done on it as well. So we don't know if this is a manufacturing issue, and it is a complete one-off, whether there was some work that was done to the plane after it left Boeing's factory. It's still TBD here, but I don't think you can draw -- there is no connective tissue here between what happened in the front of the cabin and the sensors that caused the crashes back in '18 and '19 to what's going on here, at least at first blush.",

This is an area, of course, where Hezbollah is known to be active, and it has been the focal point of those ongoing and escalating skirmishes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. We've seen an exchange of fire on both sides of the border escalating from the outset of the war in Gaza. And of course, there have been fears about the potential triggers around this escalation. Now CNN has reached out to the Israeli military. No direct comment with regards to Wissam Tawil's killing in this incident. This has of course, raised concern. We did hear a little earlier from an Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, again, not commenting directly on this latest incident, but confirming that the Israeli military had carried out strikes yesterday into today targeting according to the military spokesperson, Hezbollah military assets, the focus, according to Hagari, on pushing Hezbollah out of the border region. And in his words, and in the words of many Israeli military officials, trying to establish what is being described as a new security reality on the border. Now, of course, we have seen that exchange of fire. This will be seen as a significant escalation particularly in the eyes of Hezbollah. This was the most senior member of Hezbollah to have been targeted and killed since the war began. And of course, we have seen Hezbollah also carrying out attacks on the other side of the border, just over the weekend on Saturday, as well as saying it had launched 62 rockets and had successfully targeted a surveillance post on the other side of the border belonging to the Israeli military. That is something the Israeli military itself has acknowledged. And of course, there is concern that as we begin to see this escalation really intensifying, particularly after last week's strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut and Lebanon which targeted, and of course, killed a senior Hamas leader, which caused -- triggered a retaliation by Hezbollah. We heard last week from Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, vowing to retaliate those 62 rockets on Saturday seen as the preliminary response from Hezbollah, but there has been that repeated warning, the response from Hezbollah, according to Nasrallah will be in his words, limitless. But of course, the Israeli military and indeed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been clear, the Israeli military is determined to remove all threats from the border region. They say they are running out of diplomatic and political solutions and may turn to military solutions.",

We saw the above ground facility where the Israeli military showed us mortar shells that they say were being made in this metal works factory above ground in Al-Bireh. There was a tunnel shaft in that factory that they say led to an underground facility where those shells are then packed with explosive material, including using fertilizer, for example, and other types of materials. The Israeli military has now released a video of that underground facility that they say exists in that location where we were. We can of course, independently verify that. But what I can tell you is that we saw this facility, we also saw some long range rockets in the warehouse just next door. All of this very much embedded in civilian areas. And that was certainly a point that the Israeli military wanted to make today as they showed us these facilities. But I asked Admiral Hagari, whether he was trying to show us that to try and justify the extremely high civilian death toll that we have seen in Gaza over these last three months of war, more than 9,000 children have been killed. He insisted that that's not the case, that the Israeli military tries to distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters, although we know that in far too many circumstances that is certainly not the case.",

Thetwo have been together since 1986 when the golf legend first went pro. Nike stuck with Tiger even through several scandals and of course his 2017 arrest for driving under the influence. CNN's Don Riddell joins us live now. Don, this really is I guess -- was now, one of the most iconic sporting relationships in history. Not only did it last about 27 years or so, but Nike really did stick with Tiger through some of his most difficult sort of personal problems. It wasn't going to last forever, but it is certainly the end of an era.",

Every time he tees it up and he moves the needle like no other player in the sport. He says he's going to play potentially 12 tournaments this year. The kind of indication from what he said today is that L.A. next month is when he will be playing for the first time this year. We don't know what clothing or branding he is going to be associated with. But there's a lot of interest already in that. And just remember, he was already drifting away from Nike. He had talked about how he hadn't been using their equipment really, for the last, what seven years. 2016 was when he stopped using their equipment. He hasn't been wearing their footwear since that car accident in 2021. He's been wearing FootJoy since then, so he already was kind of moving in other directions and forging new relationships. But it will be interesting to see what he looks like when he gets back out onto the course next month.",
