The election of Donald Trump will likely have a major impact across the Middle East. In Israel, Trump's win is also seen as a win for Prime Minister Netanyahu. In his first term, Trump backed Israel on everything from moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, to recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. Now, Trump seems poised to support Israeli settlers' ultimate goal, that is the annexation of the occupied West Bank, and perhaps even parts of Gaza, which would be the final blow for any lingering dreams of Palestinian statehood. So, today, as Trump once again prepares to take control, we look back at how the war is impacting both sides. And we begin where the Gaza war began with the devastating attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023. That's when Sharone Lifschitz learned that her 85-year-old mother and her 83-year- old father were among the 251 Israelis taken hostage. Her mother was freed shortly after the attack. Her father is still in Gaza. They don't know if he's alive. I spoke with Sharone in London in April, six months after the attack. Then, as now, she was advocating fiercely for the remaining hostages to be released. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

About a million people in Gaza, half of Gaza's population, are under the age of 19, which means that they were born in 2004, and the elections were in 2006.

OZ-SALZBERGER:  Yes. So, yes, we have started -- we have not started actually, we've been at it for quite a while now. It was absolutely clear that a war in Gaza will have a terrible toll, a terrible cost in human suffering in Gaza. And I think many of us knew this from the very beginning.

OZ-SALZBERGER:  Well, first of all, let me say, and this is a caveat that I have to make absolutely clear, that unlike the rest of the world who is watching us on the screens and moralizing from the armchair, we are a battered nation right now. We are not only heartbroken, so heartbroken that sometimes it's difficult to be heartbroken for the civilians on the enemy side. We are also mind-boggled, shocked, humiliated. Very few Israelis will admit that, but we might as well say that we also feel humiliated, terribly saddened, and terribly scared with a sense of an ongoing crisis, the worst in our history for sure, and an ongoing sense of tragic loss. I'm saying that this is not only in order -- not in order to play the victim's card. I don't believe in playing a victim's card, but I do believe that many of us have been truly victimized on the 7th of October, and of course, the hostages are still suffering a horrible, horrible fate. I am wearing, like so many Israelis do now, the bring them home token. And our heart, as it says, is captive in Gaza, we are not being totally rational now. I don't think that we are sitting here, most of us, apart perhaps from a few very strong women and men, most of us are not weighing the moral options and necessities in a totally rational way because we are deeply, deeply involved, hurt, injured, surprised in a negative way beyond the capacity of many people to take up complications, nuances, to understand or to try to imagine the other side. And having said that, I think that many Israelis believe that we should have had a humanitarian ceasefire and hostage exchange, another ceasefire and hostage exchange months ago. So, alongside the fear and the sadness and the shock, there is also a mounting sense of anger among the Israeli population against our own leadership, our coalition government and especially our prime minister.",

And having a wounded soul usually means that you understand and empathize with the wounds of others. You are, as my father used to say, capable of imagining the other. Having said that, no, it is not only the writers and the artists who are coming forward to speak about the humanity of the other side and of course, our own humanity that needs to be preserved. Many parts of Israeli civil society, including the veterans of the pro-democracy movement of last year, many good people in this country, most part of the Arab citizens of Israel, the Israeli-Palestinians, my fellow citizens here, and much of the liberal and centrist, left and central liberals, are people who would be willing to talk reason and to see reason and to move towards an international guarantee agreement that is towards hope. So yes, the artists, the writers, the poets may be leading the way, but a lot of good souls in this country which has not lost its soul as yet, a lot of good souls will be able to chime in and to take part when a true process begins. Again, perhaps not peace in our time, perhaps not reconciliation in an emotional sense, but a rational agreement leaving Israel within defensible borders and a strong democracy alongside a viably stable Palestine is the only way we can move forward and this means hope. So yes, I still follow my father and many other great Israeli women and men in the general hope for the future of all of us here of this wonderful Tel Aviv whose lights are twinkling behind me.
