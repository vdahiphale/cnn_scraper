The other detail that I found that really angered me was hearing the -- you know, that the parents were being misled and being told that there's another bus coming that has children in there, and giving them a false pretense that their child is still alive and that could be exiting the bus. I cannot imagine the pain someone's parent, you know, a mom or a father, you know, hoping that there's a bus that arrive - is going to arrive, but that bus never arrived. You know, when you hear those details, it just - it breaks your heart, you know. And then - and you look over to your left, to your right, and you see the parents, and you just - you just want to hug them. You want to hold them and tell them that it's going to be OK.But it also -- what it does, when you hear these details, things that you've never heard of before, it - it will push you to the next level to where you demand justice.",

We're going to stay here until charges are filed, that they get indicted, and that we hold them accountable for that because their failure led to somebody else's death.

And speaking of security matters, Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, he emphasized at Davos just the other day that the only path for regional security for Israel's security is to have this two-state solution.Now, U.S. officials are saying that Netanyahu's comments there are not the final word on the issue. And a senior administration official actually told my colleagues just yesterday that \"if we took such statements as the final word, then there would be no humanitarian assistant going into Gaza and no hostages released.\" Essentially saying that they have been able to change Netanyahu's position on things that he was previously a hard liner on in the last few months, over the course of this war. They have managed to change Israel's behavior and posture successfully. But this is clearly a pretty stark departure from the stated U.S. position. And it comes as President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu have not actually spoken, if White House read-outs are any indication, really since last month. They had previously been speaking much more regularly. So, a rift is clearly opening here. And the administration is emphatic about the need for this two-state solution because they say that this is the only path towards Israel's normalization with its Arab and Muslim partners. Saudi Arabia, which the U.S. has been pushing to agree to a normalization of diplomatic relations with Israel for, they say very emphatically as well that they need to see progress being made towards the creation of a Palestinian state really before these normalization talks can continue in earnest. Now, State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller, he spoke to this yesterday and he said, quote, \"I will say that there is a historic opportunity that Israel has to deal with challenges that it has faced since its founding and we hope the country will take that opportunity.\" So, the U.S. making clear here they do not think this is the final word, but clearly the relationship has gotten a lot more difficult.

The defense secretary was hospitalized on New Year's Day and was released two weeks later, but the White House, lawmakers, and the public did not find out about that until several days.
