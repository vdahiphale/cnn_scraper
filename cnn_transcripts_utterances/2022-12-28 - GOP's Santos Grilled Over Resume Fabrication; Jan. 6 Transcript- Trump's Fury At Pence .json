In fact, they are no longer dumping snow there because they're concerned that it's getting too high. They moved it to another pile on the other side of those trees.But we're talking about more than four feet of snow that fell over the course of several days. And now that snow is ended and the cleanup continues, the driving ban remains in effect because authorities want -- their goal is to clear at least one lane on every street in Buffalo by tomorrow morning. And so, they'll reevaluate that driving ban overnight or in the early hours, depending on the progress of snow removal. But one reason this is so -- one reason this is so important is the number of people who that emergency services could not reach during the height of the storm. We know more than 400 calls to EMS went unanswered. And so that is the main reason for making sure there was at least one lane open on every street so that the city's emergency operations can function properly. As you mentioned, 34 fatalities now, that's three more than we knew of last night. And at least three of those, two men and one woman, are -- two John -- to John Doe's and one Jane Doe, so other unidentified people. Authorities say that families who are missing a loved one should call the police. And we know that the National Guard began at 9:30 this morning, going door to door doing wellness checks in neighborhoods that lost power, much of the power has been restored but neighborhoods that lost power, they're going to check on them to make sure that no one's in trouble inside. And authorities are also going door to door checking on the people who had called emergency services and were not able to be reached. So, the goal here a clear this snow and clear as much as possible before the temperatures warm up to the -- to the 50s to try to avoid a flood threat, Amara.",

He has, of course, been linked to efforts to use the Justice Department to try to overturn the results of the election. She also testified that Meadows was trying to keep some meetings with staffers \"off the books,\" which means keeping them from the official White House Records, the official oval office diary which is a public record.

Interest rates are up, inflation remains elevated, and some analysts are predicting a recession in the year ahead. So, where exactly is the economy going?Joining me now to break it all down, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. Mark, great to see you. So, look, we've seen some signs recently that inflation may be easing slightly. And in a note to clients earlier this week, Goldman Sachs said our most out-of- consensus forecasts for 2023 is our call that the U.S. will avoid a recession and instead continue progressing toward a soft landing. Is that how you see it, Mark? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes. I think -- I guess I'm outside consensus too, Amara. I do think -- you know, obviously, recession risks are high. I mean, when inflation is so high and the reserve is raising interest rates as aggressively as they are, you know, the risks are that we will go into recession. But I do think we have a fighting chance of making our way through without actually going into an economic downturn. Inflation is coming in pretty quickly with that some really good news on oil prices and supply chains because of the end of the no-COVID policy in China. Rent growth is gone flatline here, which is really good for the cost of housing services down the road. And the labor markets easing up, so that should bring down some of the wage and price pressures that are causing the high inflation. So, it feels like things are moving in the right direction. Now, having said all of that, Amara, we need a little bit of luck, nothing else can go wrong, and we need the Fed to get it roughly right here. Otherwise, a recession will occur next year.",

You know, the Federal Reserve is raising rates to try to quell the high inflation, and the most interest-rate-sensitive sector of the economy is housing, right? Most people when they need to buy a home and if they need to get a mortgage, some mortgage rates are really important, and they're up a lot. So, the housing market is taking it on the chin.And I would expect that to continue, you know. I don't expect housing to kind of find a bottom here, at least not in terms of prices for a while.

So, another half a percentage point over the course of the next couple of three months.And then I would expect, you know, if we are going into a recession, that that's the end of the story that the Fed will stop raising rates. Take a look around, and figure out that yes, oh, inflation is coming in, and we don't need to raise rates anymore to get inflation back down. And if that's the case, then I think we'll make our way through next year without a recession. If, however, you know, the Fed takes a look around and it says oh, no, inflation is not coming in, we're going to need to raise rates, even more, then I'm afraid recession seems more likely than not.",

We -- you know, we don't want consumers out spending with abandon because that means then inflation will remain persistent and the Feds going to have to raise those interest rates to quell that inflation. So, we don't want that. But we want consumers to stay in the game, do their part, continue to spend like they do typically. And those Christmas sales suggest that's exactly what they're doing, so another reason to be optimistic is that we can avoid a recession going into next year.",
