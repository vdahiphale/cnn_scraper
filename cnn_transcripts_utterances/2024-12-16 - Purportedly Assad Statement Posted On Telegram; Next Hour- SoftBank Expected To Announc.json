Ousted Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad is speaking out a statement posted to his Telegram account could be his first comments since fleeing Syria. Meanwhile, Cyclone Chido hits the French territory of Mayotte, leaving at least 11 dead. Residents describing the damage as if an atomic bomb fell on the islands. -- statement purportedly from Bashar al-Assad, says his sudden departure from Syria was unplanned, and he says, purportedly, not his idea. The statement was posted to the Syrian presidency's account on Telegram, which has been disabled and then restored since the rebel takeover. In it, Assad, purportedly says he stayed in Damascus, \"carrying out his duties until the early hours of Sunday, December the 8th.\" Well, after rebel swept into the capital, the statement goes on to say, he left the country until late that same day when Russia made the decision to evacuate him from its coastal Air Base in Syria. Well, our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson joining me now. Look, in this statement, Assad, and we have to assume it is him, but we are saying purportedly, because we don't know for sure. But in it, he writes, \"At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge. The only cause of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.\" Nic, what can we learn about the final hours of Assad's dictatorship from this statement?",

And they are saying very clearly that they need, you know, the leadership in Syria to understand that what happens and how they are treated by the international community, depends on this transition to a democratic future that is being talked about. You know, what the U.N. representative was saying was, there is a need, there is a real humanitarian need to get some level of support and aid flowing into the country that it requires these U.N. resolutions to be -- to be changed, you know, and reframed at the moment, to get that aid in.

In fact, right after Donald Trump was elected in2016, SoftBank promised $50 billion worth of investment into the U.S. economy. But look, Donald Trump has put an emphasis on trying to attract domestic investments and domestic production throughout his campaign, and this is certainly a showy early sign of how he can curry favor with CEOs and try to get that repatriation of U.S. product and production and manufacturing here in the United States. And Trump has already promised that companies that put a billion-dollars- worth of investment into the U.S. will have their permitting processes streamlined, including potentially environmental permitting. Now, obviously, Congress could have some say on that, and there will be some regulatory hurdles, and Donald Trump can't just snap his fingers and make decades worth of regulation go away, but this is going to be a focal point of his administration, making it easier and less burdensome for companies to manufacture and invest in the U.S. economy. The flip side of that opponents would say is that we need regulation in place to make sure that these companies are not wreaking havoc on the environment, and polluting, and that their products are safe and not poisoning Americans. And so, there will be an interesting balance to see between Congress, the regulatory agencies and the Trump administration over how to balance this. But right now, Trump is celebrating this early investment, and we will see him just behind me across the water in Mar-a-Lago in about an hour, where he intends to make this announcement and address the media there.",
