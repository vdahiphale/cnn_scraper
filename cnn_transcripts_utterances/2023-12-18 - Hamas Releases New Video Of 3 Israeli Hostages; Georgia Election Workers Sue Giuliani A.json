The election workers' attorney will be OUTFRONT. And, he was hired by the Trump campaign to find voter fraud. He's speaking out tonight right here. What did he find? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Hamas releasing new hostage video, and this new video, which the Israeli Defense Forces call a criminal terror video, shows three elderly men pleading for their release. One of the men in the video is 84-year-old Amiram Cooper. Now, I spoke to Cooper's son Rotem last month shortly after his mother who had also been kidnapped was freed from Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just today, the CIA Director William Burns met with Israeli and Qatari officials in the effort to try to free more hostages. There's hopes that these talks can be constructive.I mean, we'll see, but the reality, of course, as the world saw this horrific event, right, the death of three hostages who were shot while raising white flags by Israeli forces. Their death underscore the deadly risk endured by an unarmed civilians in Gaza. Just today, the U.S. raising concerns about an Israeli sniper killing a mother and daughter outside a church in Gaza. Now, according to the church, the two were on the grounds of the Holy Family Parish in Gaza, they were walking to the sister's convent when they were shot and killed by an Israeli sniper. Now, the IDF disputes whether anyone was killed. But today, the Biden administration is stepping up pressure on Israel, on a civilian front. The Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveling to Israel to tell Israeli leaders that protecting civilians is both a, quote, moral duty and a strategic imperative. The Biden administration wants to see Israel scale back its sprawling ground invasion. They want him to focus on precise missions like rescuing hostages or destroying specific tunnels. And we do have something I want to share with you tonight on that, a new image of the tunnel tonight. So, you're looking at this year, you can see how wide it is. These images can come from both the IDF and also \"Reuters\" journalists who are there to witness it. The tunnel spans two and a half miles. It reaches more than 156 feet underground, it is equipped with electricity, a ventilation and communication systems. It goes incredibly close to the Israeli border, and can be used for large forces to move, right? You can see, this isn't a narrow thing at all this. This discovery comes as this war is spreading beyond Israel's borders, and the Iranian funded militia, the Houthis today claiming responsibility for an attack on a ship in the Red Sea. The USS Carney quickly responded to the ship's distress call. And over the past two months, Houthi forces have been involved in the number of attacks along the Red Sea, actual hijacking, drones, missile attacks, on commercial ships. And all this is adding up now to a lot of ships rerouting, taking longer to get where they're going to go, skipping the Suez Canal. These attacks are taking a toll on the whole world because 90 percent of the world's commerce moved by ship, 10 percent up to the Suez Canal every day, never mind things like oil and liquefied natural gas going through that passageway every second. Today, oil and natural gas prices spiking after British Petroleum said it would stop all shipments to the Red Sea because of these strikes. And we're going to have much more on these attacks in just a moment. I want to begin, though, with Will Ripley because he is OUTFRONT live in Tel Aviv. And, Will, today you are in southern Israel just a few miles from Gaza and what did you see?",

It reads, help, three hostages. A message either missed or ignored by Israeli soldiers, who shot them down from a distance, all three shirtless waving a white cloth.The men hold up in a building and the embattled Shejaiya neighborhood of Gaza City. It's not clear if the hostages were abandoned or managed to escape before the fatal confrontation. The IDF admits the killings broke their rules of engagement, adding pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release of around 129 remaining hostages. Amid growing international calls for a cease-fire, a truce Israel says would only strengthen Hamas. As everyday people suffer on the streets of Gaza, social media images show crowds climbing on aid trucks, a sign of growing desperation, amid a mounting humanitarian crisis, as the number of dead in Gaza approaches a staggering new milestone of 20,000. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera): That number just gives you chills and yet that is the reality in Gaza right now. And also the reality, these new serious questions, Erin, about how the IDF is operating on the ground. The fact that these three Israeli hostages came out shirtless, waving a white cloth, two of them were shot instantly but yet the third who went back and caught again waving a white cloth and was shot and killed before the forces realize he was in fact is really, we wonder what is happening to the countless civilians who are dying in Gaza, some of them face to face with Israeli forces that are on the ground there, Erin.",

She's an expert on Hamas tunnels, and the author of \"Underground Warfare\", also assistant professor at Israel's Reichman University. And I really appreciate you taking the time, Professor. So, when you look at the passageways of the tunnels, now we're looking at the much wider tunnels than we've seen before, you can see a lot of people walking through together as oppose to that very narrow pathway of the other images we have seen either from vehicles, the IDF said even wide enough for a railroad, electricity ventilation communication all of this. I mean, you spent a decade of your life studying tunnels like this, this entire system, what do you see here? DAPHNE RICHEMOND-BARAK, TUNNEL WARFARE EXPERT: I see a tunnel that looks a whole lot like the tunnels that North Korea has dug into South Korea. This is what I see. I see something of a much higher level of sophistication which you described, much wider, more resistance stronger dug not just by hand, but actually with the use of some sophisticated civilian boring equipment. So, we're talking about tunnel warfare on a different level, and I see also in addition to the inference of North Korea, kind of the large tunnels, enabling a massive invasion and infiltration into the country, also see the hand of Iran here, which, you know, is a country that has buried facilities. So, it's very different from what Hamas has done with its underground tunnel network, but you can see that with Iran's help, Hamas has been able to dig deeper and better.",

      "sentences": "So, you know, you talk about the equipments heavy one equipment that would have been used. I know the IDF have shown what they say are some images of construction on this tunnel.This tunnel, though, where it's located, we understand, according to the IDF, it ends just about 1,000 feet before from the Israeli border, specific crossing actually, the Erez Crossing in northern Israeli Gaza border. [09:10:09] So, when you take into account what the tunnel is, you talk about possibly being used for a large-scale invasion, and where you see it, then, what does that layer of context tell you? RICHEMOND-BARAK: So a couple of things. I think you put it very clear. It raises a lot of questions. The first thing I can tell you is that I am pretty sure this is not the only tunnel of the like that Hamas has, not all Hamas tunnels look like this one, but, I presume it has a few dozen I would say of such kind of like more heavy duty tunnels. And now, the question -- the next question that comes out is what did Hamas intend to do with this tunnel? Obviously, it's a very important military asset. It was well-concealed and came very close to Israel's border. So, I see two options. Number one, this is a tunnel that was actually used or some portion of it, or some variation of this tunnel was used on October 7th itself to enable this massive infiltration of over 3,000 Hamas fighters. I mean, these are some of the numbers. We know -- we don't know the exact number. We noticed it's a very high number, and then to go on foot into Israel. I find it -- I would find very surprising that they didn't use any kind of cross-border tunnel. So, maybe this is one of those. But I think another order of question comes to say this was not used, then what was Hamas's plan? Was it to use this tunnel and make it operational? Because it is obviously quasi-operational right now, and make it usable during the war, during the operation to carry out another infiltration, or more kidnapping and more killings. It's either one of these two options. Because of exactly what you said the fact that it is coming so close to Israel's border I see these two scenarios. And I presume that Israel will uncover in the coming days more such tunnels.",

There's a growing number of Iranian-backed Houthi attacks hitting the Red Sea, which obviously is a crucial shipping route for everything. Anything you order on Amazon, oil, gas, you name it.OUTFRONT now, retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. And, General, I appreciate your time. So, looking at the map here, I mean, this has been a huge number of incidents since October 19th when Israel started that scale. Missiles, drones, coming from Houthi missiles intercepted in the Red Sea. What's actually going on here? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Let's do a little bit of perspective first if we can, Erin. First of all, as you indicated, Suez is here, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb, another choke point, and then you got the Gulf of Aden into the Indian Ocean here. There's about 1,300 miles between Yemen and Israel, and Yemen has done a swarm of drone attacks as you indicated in the direction of the eastern Mediterranean, going after U.S. military vessels, naval vessels that were there. They were intercepted by other U.S. vessels that are in this area. When you look at where the attacks have taken place, again, as you described, it's essentially in this area right here. What's important to notice is that most of these attacks really affect the distribution of commercial traffic through the Sioux and through the Red Sea into the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. That has a huge effect in terms of decisions that are being made in terms of what's being shipped where. This is clearly what Iran is trying to do. The Houthis are sponsored and funded by Iran. Iran is now taking a very strong strategic effort in order to move this fight into Gaza. Again, it's not surprising to any of us. So, what we are seeing in terms of where the Houthis are. Here's Yemen, this portion of Yemen essentially is where the Houthis are located. If you go back to this map, again, this is the portion right here. So, their ability to intercept with a degree of precision, all of this traffic is indicative right there for you as well.",

But, much more importantly, the campaign asked me to look at the claims of fraud that other people were making and these claims were coming in fast and furious in the 30 days after the election.

At the end of the day, if I was going to classify the different fraud claims, some of them were I believe honest efforts by people who didn't understand what they're looking at. They misinterpreted data, came up with a wild finding that was bizarre and could not possibly be right, and that was easy to sort of swats away. Others were literally college professors bringing forward complicated mathematical theories that claim to prove that in one state or another state there was massive amounts of fraud. Those took a lot more work, not only because I had to pack my way through pretty dense mathematical theorem, but at the end of it I had to discuss with groups of lawyers and campaign consultant and other people who had no idea what I was going to be talking about to describe in blatant terms why this claim that must have been accurate because of where it came from was in fact false.",
