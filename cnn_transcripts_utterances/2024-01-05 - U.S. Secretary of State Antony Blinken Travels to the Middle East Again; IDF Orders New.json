Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" America's top diplomat is heading to the Middle East. Part of his mission, to keep the war between Israel and Hamas from expanding.North Korea fires hundreds of artillery rounds near the border with South Korea. We'll have a live report from the region. And the search for survivors after a deadly earthquake in Japan. This elderly woman was pulled from the rubble alive, but dozens of people remain missing. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is about to begin his fourth trip to the Middle East since the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. And his mission seems to be getting more complicated by the day. Among his top priorities as he visits eight countries across the region is to keep the war between Israel and Hamas from spreading. Fears are growing that Iran and its proxies are getting more involved. And now ISIS has claimed responsibility for a terror bombing in southern Iran. They killed more than 80 people. Tensions are also flaring between Israel and Lebanon where a senior Hamas commander was killed on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he's committed to committing fundamental change so Israelis can live in peace along the border. The U.S. is fighting back against pro-Iranian proxies in the region. A militia source says a top commander and the assistant were killed in Baghdad. CNN's Oren Liebermann has more now from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A U.S. strike in Iraq, second in a little more than a week, killing the commander of a pro-Iran militia, Harakat al-Nujaba. One U.S. official saying the target known as Abu Taqwa, had U.S. blood on his hands.",

The U.S. has tried to separate the war in Gaza from the rest of the region, but the fighting has burst through political borders. An Israeli strike in Beirut killed Saleh al-Arouri, one of Hamas' top leaders. Lebanese officials warning the attack threatens to spark a wider conflict in a region already on edge. U.S. forces have come under, attack approximately 118 times in Iraq and Syria since mid- October. Hezbollah and Lebanon has launched repeated missile and drone strikes on Israel, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. And the Houthis in Yemen have fired on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea with calls growing for a U.S. response. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  We don't telegraph our punches one way or another, but we take these attacks very, very seriously, the impact that they're having on international commerce and free shipping, and we're going to keep doing what we need to do to protect our interest. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  The common thread here is Iran, which backs these groups. With U.S. Navy forces in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and in the Red Sea to protect international shipping lanes, the U.S. has tried to send a message of deterrence, carrying out strikes in Iraq and Syria. But the attacks across the region have persisted. The Pentagon once again laying out an open-ended threat of force.",

Israeli defense minister says forces in northern Gaza will focus on raids, special operations, and the destruction of Hamas tunnel networks. Israel's military objective of the new phase is to, quote, \"erode the remaining terror hotspots in the area.\"Israel says its goals in southern Gaza will be to continue to pursue Hamas leaders and to bring home more than 100 hostages still being held captive. The outline comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense minister meet in Tel Aviv with the special envoy of U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss the war. [02:04:55] The IDF issued a new series of evacuation orders for Palestinians in part of central Gaza on Thursday. Many civilians say they're too exhausted to flee again. And even if they could, there's nowhere to go. One Palestinian man tell CNN, \"This is not life. It's humiliation.\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more. But a warning, his report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The lifeless body of yet another child, carefully pried from the rubble. Gaza civil defense says this is the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Deir el-Balah, a city where tens of thousands are seeking shelter, heeding evacuation orders like this one dropped by the Israeli military. ABDUL RAHMAN, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSON IN DEIR EL-BALAH:  There is no place to seek safety in this area. There is no water, there is no electricity. We are just surrounded by all the war and then bomb and attack us without any alarm. (VIDEO PLAYING) DIAMOND (voice-over):  It's not just Deir el-Balah. Several cities where civilians have been told to flee have been hit in recent days including this camp for displaced Palestinians in the southern city of Rafah where the Hamas-controlled government media office says Israel has struck six locations over the last three days. At Al-Nasir hospital, the dead lay waiting after an Israeli airstrike killed 14 people including nine children. According to the Hamas- controlled military of health. (VIDEO PLAYING) MAHMOUD SALEH, UNCLE OF ONE OF THE DEAD (through translation):  Where is international law? There is no law. They killed children. Children that are getting shelled as they are sleeping. They are bombing them, killing them with what blood? What blood? DIAMOND (voice-over):  Even the emblem of the Palestine Red Crescent Society is no shield. The group's headquarters in Khan Yunis struck for the second time just this week killing one and wounding six. The IDF told CNN it was reviewing the previous strike. It held a, quote, \"operational debrief\" to draw immediate lessons. Amid the strikes, some are once again on the move. Mattresses and blankets carried however they can. FULLA QADOUHA, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSON IN DEIR EL-BALAH (through translation):  My house is gone. The houses of my sisters are also gone. I'd rather go back home and live in a tent than live in here. DIAMOND (voice-over):  For many, that exhausting elusive search for safety is over. ABU ADNAN, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSON IN DEIR EL-BALAH (through translation):  I tried to go back home twice, but my children pulled me back. There are no toilets, no food, no water, no clothes. With all this, I prefer to go back home and die with dignity than dying this way. DIAMOND (voice-over):  That pursuit of dignity is all that remains. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPTE)",

First of all, as far as the amount of artillery that's being fired, we are being told 200 rounds of artillery has been fired. We don't know exactly what that comprises of. It could be shells. It could be larger rockets.It was fired into the northern boundary which is known as the northern limit line. Essentially the DMZ extending from land into the Yellow Sea. It fell into the northern part of that border. So, it did not enter South Korean territory, and that's important to note. At this point, no reports of any kind of damage or any kind of injury but it is drawing a response already from South Korea, or likely drawing response. We are seeing a text message that was sent to people living on one of the nearby islands, Yeonpyeong. In this text message, residents there were told to take shelter at locations near their homes. Not necessarily to evacuate the island but to leave their homes and to go to some designated safe spaces. [02:10:04] Now, exactly the extent of the South Korean response, how long it will take place and exactly when it will take place. These residents were told in the 3:00 hour, but at this point, Lynda, we are not seeing any kind of images are hearing any kind of descriptions, but it's something that we are on the lookout for in these minutes ahead.",

As we have seen over the years, if North Korea does something, South Korea does something in response and vice versa, very much this tit-for-tat relationship. However, it was just days ago that we saw some military drills by the South Korean navy. That's something that North Korea, perhaps, frowned upon and is making this kind of response.We have seen responses; we have seen these shells fired over these waters before. That's something that's very typical in the winter months. But as far as the latest cause a provocation, it could be these naval drill by South Korea. We also heard statements from North Korea just before the New Year saying that reunification of the North and South is off the table and that the North views South as a hostile neighbor. In addition, Kim Jong-un's sister made some response and remarks saying that North Koreans really had no choice but to amp up and to beef up their military because they are being pushed by South Korea.

Thanks so much for staying across those developments from Seoul.Well, cross border strikes between Russia and Ukraine are racking up more damaging casualties on both sides. On Thursday, Moscow said Ukrainian drones and missiles hit the city of Belgorod again leaving two people wounded. Earlier in the day, Ukraine said a Russian cruise missile hit a city in central Ukraine killing one person and wounding eight others. The explosion damaged several businesses owned by a local energy company. In down south, Russia claimed it shut down a swarm of Ukrainian missiles headed for Crimea. Falling missile fragments reportedly injured one person on the ground. Ukraine is considering changes to mobilization laws that can open the door for more people to be conscripted into the military. Debates on a new bill began in a parliamentary committee on Thursday. The proposed changes include lowering the conscription age and introducing mandatory basic training. Ukraine's military has recently requested up to half a million more troops as the country faces a protracted conflict with Russia. The proposals would have to be approved by the full parliament before being signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

It's getting supplies as you mentioned from Iran and North Korea, including a very ominous reports that North Korea may have been providing Russia with some of these ballistic missiles that have been used in the recent barrages against Ukrainian cities. Ukraine though continues to depend on western allies while clearly, and I would say disastrously falling behind and maybe even losing focus in some parts. This war once again prove that weapons quality superiority can be -- I'm sorry -- quantity superiority can be converted into quality advantages. Russians do have the mobilization potential also that exceeds Ukraine by a factor of at least five. I'll also mention the disparity in the average age. Once again, our currently fighting men are pretty exhausted. They need to be replaced. They need to be demobilized. It's also a question of justice, you know, as a reason in Ukraine. Why do some men have to fight and freeze in the trenches while others seem to be somehow exempt? And there's also problematic sort of return of politics in Ukraine that have been kind of there's been lid on politics. And finally, you know, it's out in the open. There's a quickening of a sort of internal strife due to the underwhelming counteroffensive and a flagging resolve that I mentioned by the allies.
