And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Officials at Fort Campbell, U.S. army base in Kentucky have confirmed the crash of two Blackhawk helicopters. They were doing routine training when the crash occurred. The status of the crew members is still unknown. And sources tell CNN that the New York grand jury investigating Donald Trump's hush money payments is going on a break. It's unclear if and when district attorney Alvin Bragg will bring charges forward against Trump. Meantime, a Florida school has pulled a Disney movie telling the story of \"Ruby Bridges\" off its shelves pending further review. The story about the first Black child integrate and all white school in the southern U.S. is a staple in curriculums across the country. But now faces a ban after a parent filed a complaint. CNN's Leyla Santiago, reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Disney movie tells the story of \"Ruby Bridges,\" the six-year-old first grader who became the target of hatred and racism when she integrated an all-white elementary school in New Orleans in 1960. It is now the latest flashpoint over instructional materials as the state of Florida limits how lessons on race, sexuality and gender are taught in the classroom. The PG-rated movie is now under review by Pinellas County schools in Florida. A review that stems from a complaint by a parent of a second grader asking it be removed from the schools list of approved films. The North Shore Elementary parent whose name was redacted in the complaint form by the district, says the movie is spelling out objections to use racial slurs and that that White people hate Black people and is more appropriate for eighth graders. It's not the first time some parents have objected to how the story of \"Ruby Bridges\" is taught in the classroom. In 2021 in Tennessee, one mom told CNN --",

There was this moment in central Berlin yesterday, a full ceremonial welcome, which no other head of state has received at all since the Second World War. So they're doing everything they can to roll the red carpet out.And then we had that banquet last night where the German chancellor spoke about the King as a highly symbolic visit. Saying it was a tremendous personal gesture. Interestingly there as well, Bianca, as you said Charles was speaking German, but he also had some German relatives there in the banquet as well. So, there are personal ties to the country as much as these deep diplomatic ties between the two countries. Which have suffered, frankly, haven't they since Brexit, but they're trying to reestablish those. I think that that's why the British government particularly wanted Charles to come here as one of his first visits. So Rishi Sunak very much behind the idea of this entire trip.",

And speaking to members of the crowds here, they do talk about him being this green pioneer. So that's definitely part of the story here. He's currently meeting the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and he's then going to come to where I am to the Bundestag and give the big formal speech which is a big honor. We wait to hear what he has to say.The government -- the British government would have been very involved in that speech and I think it will all be about deepening ties. What more can we do? You also mentioned he's going to go along and meet some Ukrainian refugees. He's talked about how Germany has accepted a million of them and he really wants to celebrate how Germany has got behind Ukraine in its war, and he'll call it an unjust war. These images I'm told are coming in now of Olaf Scholz meeting the King. So there you have the head of the government having this meeting ahead of that big speech. I wait to see what Olaf Scholz has to say about all of this today. Today is a bit more political. Yesterday was about the two heads of state meeting. Talking about the historic ties. Today is more about the current ties between the U.K. and Germany and how they can find common ground on policies such as Ukraine. So I'm sure that will come up in the readout we get from this meeting afterwards.",

We're not on the ground. Ukraine has very tough censorship restrictions, essentially to protect its intelligence on the ground. It makes it very difficult. And what you have, of course, is two competing narratives here. One from Moscow, one from Kyiv. Ukraine saying that it's had some success in recent days that up to100 Russian soldiers were killed just in the last period. That they've been able to hold and maintain the city of Bakhmut, but they also admit that there has been partial success on the part of Moscow. Now you'll remember, a few days ago, a couple of weeks ago it was, that the head of Wagner Prigozhin -- Yevgeny Prigozhin was celebrating by putting a flag, the Wagner flag right in the middle of Bakhmut. It seemed all but ready to fall. And even now Prigozhin saying, yes, we are being battered heavily. Admitting that in a voice message, saying that they are still inflicting serious damage on Ukrainian forces, but still struggling, of course to take hold of that entire city. This is a battle that's been going on for months now. So, all eyes on where that goes. But still very much that war of attrition between these two sides as we head into the spring.",

It's all linked to the Israeli Prime Minister's controversial plans to overhaul the judiciary. Those reforms are paused for now, while negotiators from the ruling coalition and opposition hold meetings. But many are skeptical over whether a compromise would happen. Benjamin Netanyahu called the debate public and often painful, but says that he hopes an agreement can be reached. He also downplayed the discord with the Biden administration. CNN's Hadas Gold is standing by live in Jerusalem. Hadas, do we get the sense that these tensions between the U.S. and Israel, you know, mainly around the statements from President Biden.

There were threats of that happening on Monday. And that is what the official said is what ultimately pushed Benjamin Netanyahu over the edge.Now ironically, he actually was prescheduled to give a speech yesterday to the U.S. hosted democracy forum. He gave a virtual speech where he talked about how he says is trying to rebalance the branches of government and now they are trying to reach some sort of agreement and negotiation. Take a listen.
