Well, Al-Shifa's Hospital Director describes patients on the brink of death and children close to starvation. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has a closer look at the situation at Al-Shifa. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Hamas tunnel below Gaza's largest hospital. That's what the Israeli military says this video shows. Nearly 48 hours after Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa Hospital, these are the first images of what the Israeli military says is an operational tunnel shaft on the grounds of the hospital complex. CNN cannot independently verify those claims. But using this frame CNN has geo located this video to the Al-Shifa complex, about 30 meters away from one of the hospital's main buildings. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: It is here in Al-Shifa Hospital where Hamas operate some of its command and control cells. DIAMOND (voice-over): For weeks Israeli officials have laid the groundwork for an operation targeting Shifa Hospital, claiming Hamas operates a massive underground complex below it.

So the Israelis had not been claiming or not been justifying their entry into the Al-Shifa Hospitalcomplex by saying that if there's hospitals around the -- or that there's tunnels around the hospital, they didn't say that there is a large scale, very sophisticated, multi-level underground tunnel structure that -- they can control center of Hamas that is located underneath the hospital. And then earlier this week, they put out a video showing weapons they say were found inside the hospital than yesterday. As you mentioned, they released this video showing a hole in the ground about 30 meters or so from one of the main hospital buildings that looks like it's a concrete lined tunnel. But none of this, so far at least has indicated the existence of this very sophisticated command center underneath the hospital. The Americans say that they are confident in their intelligence that it's there, but none of the publicly available evidence supports this thus far. The U.N. Human Rights Chief has called for an investigation and for that to happen he says that he needs access. He also says that, look, there are two competing narratives here and oftentimes they don't line up very well. You know, even on the humanitarian aid issue in the hospital, you have the Hospital Director Al Jazeera saying that there are children who are starving because there's not enough water to make any formula. The Israelis though are saying that they're providing directly food and water to the people who are still at the hospital. And of course when it comes to these tunnels as well, Hamas blatantly denies that they amount to anything what the Israelis have accused them off, Lynda?",

And so, I think that -- me it's very hard you sort of described as in this fog to understand exactly what's happening in all these places. But what we do know is that children are the most vulnerable in these situations, right? They're little, they're innocent, they have no ability to stop conflicts like this, but they are the ones who suffer the most. And I think as adults, we have to do everything we can to protect them in places where they should be safe, like schools and hospitals. But also more generally, to take every step humanly possible to make sure that you know, 4700 children or whatever the number is now, it just keeps moving. You know are dying in a conflict and as you say five or six short weeks. I mean, it's really devastating. And I think all children need to be protected from things like that from abductions.

That last part seemed to be accomplished during lengthy talks between the U.S. President and the Chinese President. Chinese media have portrayed the event in a positive light.

And the President responded that he does believe that. He said President Xi is somebody who runs a country that's based on a form of government that is totally different than ours. You know initially we did hear a fiery response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, saying those comments were erroneous and irresponsible. But really since then from both sides we've seen that they are not wanting to dwell on these comments at all. Of course back in Beijing the state media has completely ignored it. There's no sign of the comment having been made on Chinese social media which of course, is heavily censored by the government as well. And here in the United States when the White House has been asked about this comment, they were not dwelling on it either. And I think it just goes to show that both countries are very eager to point back to this week as a moment when they were able to sort of hit the reset button on the U.S. China relations that they were able to get some things done and get to some sort of agreement on the need for the two countries to practice diplomacy to actually communicate. Of course, the opening up of the military to military communications was one of the real deliverables that came out of this meeting. So yes, in some ways we saw how this comment from the -- President Biden that is, did overshadow things for a little bit.

The problem is the challenges from what we see, yes, it looks like an entrance to a tunnel. But we don't see what's behind that tunnel. Israel was under tremendous pressure to prove its assertion that Hamas had what it called terror infrastructure underneath the hospital itself and was using the hospital as protection for its complex of tunnels. This, the IDF seems to say is the beginning of that proof with more to come in the coming days. This is the major part of the effort on the Al-Shifa complex to uncover as much of that as they can. They believe there is a much, much more than just a single tunnel. There a complex of tunnels that they are looking to uncover to show their assertion that this really was a terror base for Hamas. They've gotten the backing of the United States. President Joe Biden said the U.S. has its own intelligence not relying solely on the Israelis that Hamas used the hospital above for protection of what they had below grounds. And a lot was at stake here now not just the credibility of the IDF and of Israel, but also the credibility of the U.S. because of the amount of backing they gave Israel. And that's why this is as important, especially as doctors, health officials in the Hamas run enclave have repeatedly denied those accusations. The IDF is still working in the hospital complex itself.

She was found in a structure near the Al- Shifa complex, along with according to the IDF AK-47s and rocket propelled grenades just a short time later a few hours later or so the IDF announced that the body of 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano had also been recovered and brought back to Israel for identification. The challenge here we don't know more specifically where they were on the outside or near the complex itself.
