      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. I'm standing on a rooftop overlooking Tel Aviv, where about an hour ago, the Iron Dome defense system intercepted a number of Hamas rockets, headed right towards downtown here. It is just after 11It has been 19 days since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas caught this country, and frankly, much of the world by surprise. Tonight, we are learning about a raid carried out inside of Gaza, by Israeli troops and tanks, as the Israeli Defense Forces prepare for a ground incursion into Gaza. But, only in America, what I have to interrupt war coverage abroad, to cover hideous acts of violence, a pair of deadly mass shootings, in a bowling alley and a restaurant in the United States. Right now, a massive manhunt is underway for 40-year-old Robert Card. Police say he is the suspect, in the two shootings last night, that killed at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, just north of Portland, Maine. Schools, banks, offices in the surrounding areas, have all been shut down today, as a precaution. And other government offices and businesses throughout the entire state of Maine, also closed, as the manhunt intensifies. Law enforcement officials tell CNN that Card is a certified firearms instructor, in the member of the U.S. Army Reserves. The officials say that Card had recently threatened to carry out a shooting at a National Guard facility. And, he reported mental health issues, including hearing voices. And, that led to Card being sent to a military hospital, where he spent a few weeks under evaluation. This was as recently as the summer, according to sources. Now, Maine does not have many gun safety laws in place, that are available in other states, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control, gun safety group. Maine does have a so-called yellow flag law in place that would allow police to remove guns from someone deemed a threat, if a doctor and a judge agree that the person is a threat. It is not clear if that law would have stopped the gunman in that case, this case involving Mr. Card. That's an issue that we're going to investigate later this hour. Now, many of Maine shooting victims, both those killed and wounded, have not yet been identified. We have confirmed three of those who were killed. Family members told a local TV station that Joseph Walker was killed, during the restaurant shooting. They say police believe that Joseph grabbed a knife, and went after the gunman, and that's when he was shot. A 40-year-old Bryan Macfarlane was also killed, at the restaurant. His sister says that Brian usually went there on Wednesday night, to play cornhole with other members of the deaf community in Maine. Fifty-three-year-old Tricia Assellin was killed, at the nearby bowling alley. Her mother will hopefully join us in a few moments, to talk about her life. We are going to start with CNN's John Berman, who is live for us in Lewiston, Maine. And, John, investigators have been working very working theory, as to why these two locations were targeted?",

But then the suspect's car, Robert Card's car was found in Lisbon, a town about ten minutes from here. And it was found at a boat launch, right on the Androscoggin River. There are lots of rivers and waterways in the oceans not too far from here either. So the coast guard, we are now told, is involved in the search from the air looking down on the possibility of votes moving in the various waterways, and obviously the Coast Guard also looking on the water as well. One might assume that it includes the Androscoggin River, which passes through this area. And also, perhaps out into the Atlantic itself, when you have ports like Portland, and other areas that are on the main seacoast. It just goes to see the extent of this search, which includes the wilderness, the mountains. And some pretty heavily populated areas, Jake. The greater Portland area which Lewiston as part of, has some half a million people living here, Jake.",

And when you take two or three on top of each, other and in rapid succession, where you have somebody who is experiencing a mental health crisis, that can be the kind of thing that can lead to this. The target selection seems to be places he used to go, with the girlfriend who he broke up with. And, people that she would be, with if she were there that night. And, Schemengees, the bar that he opened fire in, was having a cornhole tournament, where she was, they believe, he thought she was supposed to be in that tournament.

You know, they don't follow any rules, and yet they complied. The streets were barren, people stayed at home. And what happened next? There was a wild gun battle. The suspects were throwing bombs at the police. And then, one of them escaped, one of them was apprehended, at the scene. And, they found him, really the next day, when a neighbor noticed a blood stain on a piece of canvas that he had over his boat.

It was a-limited raid, it was in northern Gaza. There were tanks involved, armored personnel carriers involved. There was some artillery fire, and the goal of it was to try to prepare the ground, for a possible ground offensive coming forward.We have heard this continuous drumbeat, coming from Israeli forces, and also Israel's government, trying to hammer home this idea that this ground offensive is going to happen, even as we have seen a continued delay in that ground offensive actually taking place. That presumably due to a number of factors, but primarily, pressure from the U.S., and other parties, who are deeply involved in these efforts to get hostages outside of Gaza. And all of this happening, as you mentioned Jake, alongside the deterioration that we are seeing, inside of Gaza of humanitarian conditions, particularly with regards to fuel. You may remember the U.N. agency, the primary U.N. agency that is operational inside of Gaza, UNRWA had said a couple of days ago that they were going to have to suspend operations on Wednesday night, if they didn't get more fuel. Today, they have kind of caveated that, if you will, and they have said that they are now in a phase where they have had to start rationing fuel, have had to start choosing where they deploy their fuel. They said they have been able to give less to bakeries, to hospitals. And that by tomorrow, if they don't get any more fuel, they may be forced to completely suspend their operations, Jake.",

You have some of the most heavy and punishing bombardment, that, in fact the most heavy in punishing bombardment to Gaza has ever seen. And a lot of that aid, Jake, is not getting to the north. The north isthe part of Gaza that Israeli forces have basically told people, you need to evacuate from these areas. But those hospitals are still burdened with many, many patients, also with displaced people. And they are not getting the eight that is coming in. And the aid that is coming in, according to the U.N., is literally a drop in the ocean, in terms of what is needed. So, there are still a lot of intensive efforts ongoing, to try to open up a more sustained, continuous humanitarian corridor, and just to give you a sense of the sort of numbers that they are talking about.

There have been tens of thousands of forces, a rate up, here in a defensive posture for, now to prevent in effect what happen on October 7th, from Gaza. It happening up here in the north.And the second thing that becomes clear, and I spent, and our team spent most of the day with Israeli forces on the northern border, is at the threat lazy from Hezbollah every day is very real. A triple threat, in effect, from sniper, fire rocket fire, as well as the threat of ground incursions across the border. As we were there up close, they told us to move very quickly through what they knew to be lines of fire. They have drones in the air, armed drones, the Israelis do, looking for Hezbollah forces, just on the other, side to take them out, in effect, before they attempt to cross the border, which they say they have done many times. Of course, there was one case where they did cross the border a number of days ago. And then, of course, there is a very clear connection between what is happening up here, and what they are nervous about is happening up here, and, events down south, an awareness that a large ground incursion into Gaza could spark a reaction from Hezbollah, as a message, in effect, from those leaders in Iran you were just referencing, Jake.",

He was not alone. I heard that from Israeli soldiers as well. The idea that the status quo doesn't work, that having Hezbollah under threat of crossing the border, is enough to say, at least from their point of view, they want to see action, that they want to create a buffer zone inside Lebanon, which, of course, would require Israeli military action inside Lebanon, which they have done many times before through the years. But at a very, very high cost to Israeli forces, as well as two civilians on the Lebanese side. Not to mention, the potential reaction of Iran getting involved, at that point, and broadening this to a more regional war. But when you speak to the folks there like that may or, they don't want to go back, to what it was like pre-October 7th. They want a feeling of greater safety, Jake.",
