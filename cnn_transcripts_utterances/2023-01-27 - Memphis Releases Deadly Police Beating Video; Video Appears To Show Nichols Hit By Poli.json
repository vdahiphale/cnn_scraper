Now, John Berman, will be joining you, along with Don Lemon. JOHN BERMAN, CNN CO-HOST: It is hard to say good evening tonight, having seen the video footage, authorities in Memphis, made public, just a short time ago. I'm John Berman, here in New York. DON LEMON, CNN CO-HOST: And, in Memphis, I'm Don Lemon. We appreciate you joining us, for our special coverage. Today, Tyre Nichols' mom asked me a very simple question, about her son's deadly encounter, with Police, three weeks ago, this weekend, as a matter of fact. That question was, \"Where was the humanity?\" Three days later, her son would be dead, from the beating he'd received. 10 days after that? Five cops, members of a specialized, now deactivated so-called SCORPION Unit, were fired. Yesterday, all five, were charged, with murder. And now, we have video, of what they did, John.",

And I mentioned before, when you're watching this, for the first time, you're left with the question \"What on earth is going on here?\" It's not the beginning of the altercation. He appears not to be fighting back at all! What did you see there? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, FORMER NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INTELLIGENCE &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM: Well, I mean, what you see is officers, who are excited, some of them are worn down, and out of breath. They all appear to be angry, as opposed to having some kind of detachment, which would say, \"OK, let's get this individual in handcuffs, and sort out why we're here.\" But even if you go back to the beginning, John, they're screaming and cursing, to pull him out of the car. And his words are, \"OK, OK, I'm getting on the ground.\" And, one of them says, \"I'm going to spray you,\" and the other says, \"I'm going to tase you.\" And he says, \"You guys are really doing a lot right now.\" I mean, he's trying to calm them down. When he runs away, and then they get to that second location, that's where you see that anger is increased, \"You made us chase you,\" so on and so forth. And there's some telling moments there. You see a police officer, as Don mentioned, with the collapsible baton, the ASP. You flick it out, it extends. He goes and gets two or three strikes in. And then you see him walk away. Well, if the incident is still out of control, if they're in some life-and-death struggle, and he has to strike someone, why is he walking away? This is an example of somebody who is excited and angry, who wants to get his licks in. This, when you look at arrest and control tactics, and training? And I've been through the training myself.

Other cameras that, we've seen, other moments that have caused us to be, on a heightened level of awareness? This would not have happened, the immediate firing of these officers, but for what happened, over an eight-minute period, in the killing of George Floyd. And we could name many in between that, Breonna Taylor and beyond. And why is that? Because Memphis, about a month after, the killing of George Floyd, changed their policies, to have an affirmative obligation, to intervene, an affirmative obligation, to do precisely what the officers charged, in that case, the more rookie cops, compared to Derek Chauvin, chose not to do, which was to intervene in some meaningful way. There's really a clear delineation, here, between when they were officers of law, and when they were a members of essentially a gang that decided that they were going to move by perhaps bravado, perhaps by ego, in some other way, to punish. And what's so striking? And Joey's so right. I mean, I am a mother of a little boy, who calls my name, and calls out for me, so often that that it is so ingrained in me, to respond, to have almost a Pavlovian reflex, at the thought that he might need me. To think that 80 yards away, somebody's son was calling out until, presumably, he was no longer able to speak? Maybe his jaw had been injured in some way? He was not communicating, the same degree. To think of what his mother is going through, in the proximity of that moment?

He says he's launched an internal investigation, for their conduct. And that now they have been placed, on leave, to determine whether or not policies were violated. Both of the deputies have been relieved of duty, and they're now on administrative leave, which is paid leave.

That exit is 12a. You can see the I-55 South, to Jackson, Mississippi sign, to give you some sense of exactly where we are. Downtown Memphis is not far. And what we are seeing is people, who have, on both sides, of I-55, just stopped traffic. They have stopped traffic. They are holding signs, \"Justice for Tyre.\" They are holding signs that \"Police who murder must be put in prison,\" they must face justice. And the crowd is here. There are emotions that are high.

And part of that is because they want people to see that disruption is part of the way they're going to protest, because they are feeling pain.

But now that we've seen the video, we see there were a lot of other people, officers, law enforcement, standing around there as well.

You see, they've charged them with knowing killing, knowing killing, which means that they had to believe, and appreciate that the actions that they were taking, might lead to somebody's death, or certainly grave bodily harm. And so, focusing on the officers, who are restraining the individual, Mr. Nichols, focusing on the officers, who were delivering the blows, who were delivering the baton beatings, and beyond, and would have been aware of the deterioration, from start to finish, is likely the focus.
