They want to prove the president's fitness for office by sending him to all the battleground states, putting him in less scripted situations and having him sit later today for a critical TV interview.Plus, we could be just a few days away from Donald Trump picking a running mate. We'll break down each of the leading contenders what they bring to the ticket and how they could also hurt it. And grow the bums out. Voters in the U.K. sent the ruling conservative party packing. It's just the latest example of voters all over the world saying, they've had enough, and they want new blood in charge. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. As of today, we are four months out from election day, and just two months from the first vote by mail ballots going out. The question is, will Joe Biden be on those ballots? By the end of the weekend, we could have an answer. As we speak, President Biden is on his way to Madison, Wisconsin for a campaign rally. He is also going to sit down there with ABC's George Stephanopoulos for his first on camera interview since the debate. It will be fair to say the most important interview of his very long career because if he's going to stay in the race, he must convince voters, donors and Democratic lawmakers that he can handle not just the next four months, but the next four years. The campaign says, of course he can, and he does not sound like a man about to bow out of the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, in some ways, this is the cleanup tour really started in earnest with the president going to Wisconsin today to talk to voters, and also participating in that primetime interview. Campaign officials that I've been talking to say, look, we acknowledge this is a high stakes moment for the president. But they're also aware that the president is sometimes prone to those verbal missteps.And so, this isn't just about the substance of what the president says during this interview, but also how he delivers it. And then of course, the president will go to Pennsylvania on Sunday. Now, we are now learning from the campaign that his original event in Pennsylvania to speak with the National Education Association will not occur because of an employee strike. And the campaign says, he will not cross the picket line, but he will still have stops in that battleground state. But look, all of this is to say that over the last week, a very challenging week for the Biden campaign. Allies have repeatedly said, they want to see more candid moments from the president, more unscripted moments. And they're hoping that that is what he can display over the next few days. So, this July campaign memo that was released today, in some ways, is them saying, we hear you. In addition to all of these stops, the president also expected to go to Nevada in mid-July to attend two conferences where he'll speak directly to black and Latino voters. It also includes a $50 million paid blitz. So, the campaign is certainly trying to build up momentum, especially as they face pressing questions about the president and whether he is the most viable candidate going up against former President Donald Trump in this very heated election season. I will know because you played the soundbite there earlier of the president at the barbecue. Just yesterday here at the White House that while the president observed the fireworks from the White House balcony, he was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris. She has not been there before for that presentation. In the past, he often engages in other July 4, fireworks engagements. So, this was an opportunity to show unity at a time when they are both coming under increased scrutiny. Dana?",

You saw Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, do sort of -- you know, it seemed like pre rehearsed remarks for the campaign.And, you know, some people did -- you know, were buoyed by that, but I talked to a lot of people afterward. And there's still real frustration. I talked to a high-ranking DNC official that basically said, the only way that concerns can be allayed is if Joe Biden is actually getting out there because they don't date people within the DNC and the White House, no longer believes senior leadership, because they feel that senior leadership wasn't candid with him about Biden's limitations. So, the only way to get out there -- and they even brought up something that, you know, right wing -- media has been bringing up for years like this hierarchy, DNC officials said, it has weakened that Bernie vibes right now.",

As pressure builds, they said Biden's remarks to campaign and DNC officials, which you were just talking about, on Wednesday seemed stilted and scripted, raising further questions among staffers who've wondered whether his tight inner circle is being honest about his abilities. You covered the White House as well, what are you hearing?SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, right. I mean, I think we're just all hearing kind of this broad mass panic among the Democratic Party. Right now, whether it's within the White House is -- you know, among -- you know, most ranks of aides, whether it's among Democratic lawmakers, Democratic donor, strategists, and it's hard to overstate how crucial this interview is tonight. And he has to knock it out of the park in the Democrats view. Just at a minimum, you know, he can't -- you know, that is kind of just the bare minimum for -- to help restore the confidence that -- for the president will help restore the confidence that he has lost among his party since the debate. Certainly, the events are -- the campaign events will also be closely watched. But I will also point out that even just in the last 24 hours or so from Wednesday, when they really did start to do this damage control, especially with the president himself, he has made some couple of slip ups. And in this context, every little bit matters, whether it's sort of stumbling over words in his radio interviews or telling governors that he needs to have a shortened schedule, whether that was said in jest or not, that's probably not the image that you want to project in front of the public right now.",

They remind me a lot of the mood I'd find from Democrats after 2016, and the shell shock they had after losing to Donald Trump.It really was comparable to that, where people wanted solace. They wanted confidence that Biden could bounce back from some people. They wanted -- Bernie was approached by people who were asking him to unendorsed Biden, were to run -- one man I talk to at a run Bernie run sign. But a real panic at the grassroots that every Democrat is having to lay hands on and deal with right now. And from the people who've been organizing the grassroots. I talked to a lot of them who said, they were ready. They were ready for what the Biden campaign told them be ready for on Friday, which was, we went toe to toe with Trump. We solved all the problems we had about the age question, and now go to it and win voters. And they said they couldn't do it. So day-by-day, people who've been organizing Democrats for this whole resistance era are saying, they're losing confidence, and they need more assurance from Biden himself -- if all their conversations are about this.",

Now, obviously, they could probably inherit some of what Joe Biden has, but you know, they can only inherit part that is with the Democratic National Committee. They can't inherit everything that's part of the Biden campaign. And then you could also have Kamala Harris, who -- you know, I think you can make an argument as more electable than Joe Biden right now, but she also has, you know, polling shows that she's not the most popular Democrat either.",

Just that storyline.Sorry that we had a presidency that we can't defend at the ballot box. And they're starting to talk about which governors would complement her well? Who could have a good introduction? All they want to get back to is the theory of the election of a week ago, which was if we just build a contrast with Donald Trump, if we're able to compare his record, his promises to a blunt naive and a blank slate, just to the normal Democratic Party that's been winning in states. We can win this election. How do they do that with a new running candidate?

First, we just saw in that clip, the abortion issue.She has been by far the leading messenger among -- from the White House and in the broader Democratic Party about reproductive rights and no activist. You know, the pro-abortion rights groups, women have been really energized by her advocacy on that issue. And they -- and she talks about it in a way that Joe Biden obviously can't. And also, for -- you know, on the issue of Gaza, you know, even though she is part of the administration, clearly that has its policy. She doesn't get blamed as much as President Joe Biden does on that issue. So, you really have to bolster the support among your own party first.

I want to start with you about where Donald Trump and his campaign is right now as they are approaching a potential change, potential -- like underline potential question mark.This is what he has said on social media. The meanest and most vicious interviewer out there is George, I'm not even going to say that of fake news, ABC, one of the worst and most vile broadcasters in the business, just for the record. That's not true. Happy fourth of July to all including our highly incapable, \"president.\" Also respects to our potentially new Democratic challenger Laffin, Kamala Harris. Someday somebody will explain to me why laughing is a negative but go ahead. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: I mean, look, it is interesting because this -- really in the last 24 hours, we've seen Donald Trump ramp up his attacks. For the most part, he's tried to lay low this week at his club in Bedminster and let Biden and the Democratic hand wringing over whether he's fit to serve for another four years be the story. But these attacks on George Stephanopoulos is exactly what we saw him do in the lead up to the debate. They are trying -- I'm aware. Yeah, exactly. They are trying to hedge their own bets in case Joe Biden does perform well in this interview. They're trying to claim that George Stephanopoulos is a liberal hack. That they're trying to claim that this interview is meant to be favorable to Joe Biden, obviously things that are not true. And so that's what they're doing here. And I will tell you, just from my conversations with the Trump campaign, they are very much watching all of this unfold in real time, like the rest of America. They have no idea what is going to happen. The problem for them is, whatever does happen if Joe Biden ultimately does choose to step aside or even if he stays on, it greatly impacts his own campaign. And what they've been telling me -- even though you've heard Donald Trump and his team for months now claim that, oh, Joe Biden is going to have to drop out before the convention. He's not -- he's going to be replaced by somebody else. Now, they're actually arguing many people on his campaign that they think Joe Biden is the best person for him to run again.

He's very mild mannered. Some of the cons he signed a strict anti-abortion law, a con when you're looking and trying to get suburban women and stricter certainly than Donald Trump has said that he supports, and he doesn't have any foreign policy experience. Marco Rubio, fluent in Spanish, appeals to traditional Republicans has foreign policy experience, given the committee's that he has sat on and sits on right now. But he lives in Florida, and so does Donald Trump. That's not allowed. So, let's see how that would work out. And of course, remember, how can we forget the nasty 2016 primary fight. And then J. D. Vance. We heard from him in those clips as well. He is very persuasive as a MAGA messenger. He certainly has a rags to riches story. He's close to the Trump family.
