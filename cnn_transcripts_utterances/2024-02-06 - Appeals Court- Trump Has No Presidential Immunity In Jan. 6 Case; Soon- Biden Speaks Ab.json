The House of Representatives is thinking about impeaching the Secretary of Homeland Security over the border crisis. There's a bill on the table that they said is dead on arrival. And then Donald Trump is arguing to a federal court that he is immune from criminal prosecution forever because he was president of the United States.I mean, it's utterly ridiculous. So, the politics of this, as you say, are very fascinating to me because I just don't know where the public is on this. It's kind of all over the place. But I think that the politics are right now in Joe Biden's favor. And I'm not sure I'm buying into these polls because we're nine months or so out right from the election. And I think that it's going to be a hard sell for the American public to swallow that they're going to accept this president again, a person who the courts is saying -- and this opinion is really rough, by the way, that they're basically saying you committed crimes.

They believe him when he says that all of these legal entanglements are a product of weaponization of the DOJ, and overzealous prosecution that are simply going after him because he is a main threat to Joe Biden. And he says he is taking this for the American people because they'll come after him, they'll come after the American people next.While that is not true, that is what his base believed. So, in the GOP primary, this isn't going to have an impact on him. But as we move further out, and you look at the ruling that came out today saying that he isn't immune from prosecution, look, most rational people will see you say you don't need immunity if you haven't violated the law or the Constitution. So, they're realizing, look, if he violated the law or the Constitution, he shouldn't be subjected to the judicial system. And we're looking at the latest CNN polls on specifically his legal entanglements. Almost half of the people that we polled say that there should be some type of ruling on these cases before an election. And then we see some of them would prefer it. And a smaller number say that this would be -- it would be better if we had some kind of a ruling before the election. But if you break that down into the politics of this, Democrats, Independents and Republicans, and the -- and the independents are key in the general election as we head into November. We see 72 percent of Democrats that we polled say that it's vital to have a verdict in these cases before the election. 52 percent of independents want to see some type of verdict before November. Those are the people that could potentially change their minds, either for Donald Trump or against him based on a verdict in these cases. So, we're seeing a lot of people that do want to see some kind of justice served before they cast a ballot.",

STEWARTBut we can't look at all of them with the same brush. They're unique and distinct in and of themselves. But Republicans understand anyone serving in public office, if you show any sign that you're not in full support of Donald Trump and his view that this is a weaponization of the DOJ and he is a victim in all of this, then you will face retribution from Donald Trump and many of his supporters. So, the rule or the wording in D.C. is to follow along with Donald Trump and say that -- and recognize that what he says is that he is a victim. But many realize behind the scenes that there's something to be said for some of these cases. And it's really important to make sure that the justice system plays out here. And more importantly than anything else, with regard to the integrity of our elections, we need to make sure that the American people understand that we do have free and fair elections.
