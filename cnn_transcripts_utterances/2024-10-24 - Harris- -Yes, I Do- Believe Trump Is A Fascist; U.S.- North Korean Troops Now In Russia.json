Is -- what is the fact that they are using this strategy here in the final days? Tell you about the state of the race. I mean, it's been clear for a few weeks now that the Harris campaign is trying to target these right leaning independents, these disaffected Republicans, folks who may have voted for Donald Trump in the past, but don't want to support him this time. And I guess they have some sort of data that shows them that this message and argument against Trump, that Trump is a danger to the country resonates with those specific voters, because the folks who are voting for Kamala Harris are already in her corner. The folks who are voting for Donald Trump are already there, but who are those independents still undecided folks who could potentially be picked up? The Harris campaign clearly thinks that some of those right leaning folks, and they clearly think that this argument that Trump is a danger to democracy, it's what's going to resonate with them. It's also worth noting that, as you mentioned, she talked about Liz Cheney a lot last night, and Dick Cheney. She's been campaigning with Liz Cheney in some of those districts, those counties where Nikki Haley won during the GOP primary. She's very clearly trying to target this subset of voters that may still be undecided. And she thinks the winning message there is this democracy message.",

So they're being trained more.Crucially, if they do go into Ukraine, they're going to get battlefield experience, which they don't have. As we understand it, these are elite troops. So what you've got is elite trained North Korean troops who will now have battlefield experience, which makes them a greater threat to South Korea. And then that wider, you know tension between the U.S. and China and what's going on in the Indo- Pacific. So it does have much wider implications because you're empowering North Korea effectively by allowing this to happen and then you've got Kirby's point of view that its just a sign of desperation or desperation on Russia side.

If we don't, it's extremely expensive.Take last year, for example, a record setting billion dollar plus disasters. And fast forward now to 2024, our current year, we already have tallied up $20 billion plus disasters. And not to mention the confirmed fatalities. And, by the way, this data that you're looking at only is valid through August. So they need to still get in the numbers from what was September and October, remember, Helene and Milton that caused so much damage, devastation and destruction? Just look at the trend over the past decades, 2010 to 2019. Look at that. Almost $1 trillion from these disasters and remember 2017. That one stands out, Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria. And the reason for all this is the heat trapping greenhouse gases. We continue to warm the earth. The water takes in a lot of that heat as well. And that allows for more water vapor to be held in our atmosphere. So extreme rain events are becoming more prolific, more frequent and more intense and with that heat baked into our oceans, we're seeing this rapid intensification like what we saw with Milton on several different occasions occur more frequently as well. So these storms are coming in hot and they're coming in a lot more powerful as well. And there are no states across the U.S. that are sheltered from these billion dollar disasters. They happen everywhere and they happen across the world as well. Here's another example. This one, fortunately, hurricane Kristy fish food for the time being -- Kasie.",
