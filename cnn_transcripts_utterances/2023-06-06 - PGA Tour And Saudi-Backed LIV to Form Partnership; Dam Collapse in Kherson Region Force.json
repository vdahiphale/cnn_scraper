Those are the markets and these are the main events. A stunning merger between bitter rivals. LIV Golf and PGA agreed to a partnership. Thousands of Ukrainians are forced to evacuate after a critical dam collapses. Kyiv and Moscow are blaming each other. And strikes in France of disrupting activity on the ground and the sky. We here from airline CEOs about the consequences. Coming to you live from New York, it is Tuesday, June 6th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, we begin with a stunning truce in the world of professional golf, ending a bitter rift between competing tours. The PGA is set to form a partnership with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League, as well as the European Tour. It is a seismic move that unites the sport under one banner, and resolves a legal dispute in which LIV accused the PGA of anti-trust violations. It is hard to overstate just how ugly the spat had gotten. Some of golf's top stars had become bigger rivals off the course trading barbs and recommendations about what was best for the sport. Now that the fighting is suddenly over, everyone is waiting to see how the dust will settle. So let's bring in CNN's World Sport, Don Riddell right now. So, Don, you've been covering the story since it broke early this morning. I know we're still getting the facts right now, but just based on what we're seeing, how much of a victory is this for the Kingdom, for the Saudi Kingdom, especially in terms of their global sports ambition?",

      "sentences": "Well, you're right, Zain. There is still a lot we don't know, and arguably the most important players in all ofthis, the players themselves, they don't really know. They were taken by as much surprise as the fans and the journalists who cover the game were this morning. The PGA Tour Commissioner, Jay Monahan, is going to be meeting with the golfers in one hour, and I suspect he is going to be receiving some very, very pointed questions from them. It is hard to see if we're going to talk about winners and losers. It is hard to see how the Saudi government are anything but winners in all of this, this is what they wanted all along. They would have wanted a year ago to form some sort of collaboration with the established legacy tours. And of course, it didn't go that way. It went very, very ugly. It became very, very bitter. There were lawsuits flying left and right, and now, they've all ended up on the same side. I think the winners might also be the players who defected, the rebel players who went and joined the LIV Tour and were paid tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars for doing so. They were expelled from their tours, and now, at the end of the season, they're going about to find a way back on to them. So I guess then they must be thinking right now, we've had the last laugh because they were roundly criticized for doing so. But to understand just how seismic this news is, just how much of a U-turn this has been for the PGA Tour, I think we should look at what Jay Monahan, their commissioner said this time last year when it was all kicking off. This was how he painted the LIV Tour, and why he didn't want his players to go and join it. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Craig, thank you so much for being with us. I just want to start with the broad strokes here because a lot of people are not as familiar with all the lawsuits between these two leagues, between these two tours that were basically resolved in one fell swoop today. Just walk us through what happened after LIV arrived on the scene. CRAIG SEEBALD, CO-HEAD LITIGATION AND REGULATORY DEPARTMENT, VINSON &amp; ELKINS: Yes, after LIV arrived on the scene, it was viewed as a big threat to the PGA Tour, and there was litigation that was filed out in California liv. LIV and players -- it started with the players and then LIV joined the lawsuit, alleged that the PGA Tour was monopolizing the market for professional golf exhibitions, and it led to a pretty aggressive litigation schedule and lots of discovery out in California, and was set for trial next year. So there was definitely a big battle going on between the two. And the issue really at the heart of it was the PGA Tour, excluding competition from LIV by enforcing some of its policies and not letting certain players play on both tours.",

One is the Justice Department has an ongoing monopolization investigation of the PGA Tour that was announced last summer, and so I think the Justice Department is going to look at this potentially and ask, well, is this another act of monopolization combining the two competitors? So you've got that potential. And then I think just from a merger review standpoint, the Justice Department, European regulators, other regulators -- this is going to pack the entire world -- are going to look at this and say, isn't this odd? I mean, you have the two competitors or the three competitors, actually, because you've got the European tour combining under one entity and just going to control golf? How is that going to be permissible? So I think there's a lot of questions to be remained and a lot of room for the antitrust laws to look at this.

And one of the things to be aware of is in the very short time that we've been on the ground here, we could see this water already rise considerably. So what's going on right now is that the water level continues to go up as water is gushing from the Dnipro River here towards this city and towards other cities in the region as well. Now, we've been in touch with a local security services here and they're telling us that everybody who works in the city, anybody who has any sort of role is helping to evacuate people from areas like over there. There are still hundreds of people who are trapped on their houses, some of them inside their houses and everything is being mobilized right now from boats to large trucks to try and get these people out, and again, hundreds of people have already been brought out, but at the same time, this is very much an ongoing operation. The folks here tell us that operation is going to continue to go on. Now of course, all of this is a huge issue and also a huge risk not just as far as the environment is concerned, as far as this area is concerned, but of course also, as far as the safety and security of the population here on the ground is concerned.

At the heart of the controversy are digital doubles, computerized recreations of a real human being. The same technology that enabled the actor, Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, to appear in the 2016 movie, \"Star Wars, Robe One.\" Advocates say that it like actors take on more work and start multiple projects at the same time. Opponents say it will take away work and erode actors' rights to their own likeness. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland is SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator. He joins us now from Los Angeles. Duncan, thank you so much for being with us. Just walk us through what your fears are in terms of how A.I. will revolutionize the movie industry. Especially when it comes to the use of actors' likeness. DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND, CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, SAG-AFTRA: There is no doubt that A.I. can have some positive benefits. It also puts real risks. I think from the point of performers, the risks include having people use A.I. technology to generate voice or image or likeness models of a person. And then be able to have them do whatever kind of performance in the future that is desired without necessarily having the approval of the performer whose image is being used. We've seen this abuse going on right now on the Internet with deepfakes, especially deepfake pornography. And our members really want to make sure that they are protected from that. And we feel the best way to do that is by ensuring that there is a principle of informed consent for any kind of use of A.I. to deal with a person's image, likeness, persona, et cetera. And also that other before compensations for any time someone's likeness is used. An actor's stock in trade is their persona, is their image, their voice. So if they want to take that and use that to help generate a commercial project, they should be paid fairly for that.",

Especially because there are so many spec movie scripts that have already been paid for that the studio already owns. Obviously, it is a bit more complicated than TV shows. But certainly, with film projects that have already been paid for in terms of buying scripts, the studios can always move forward in terms of moving forward into production. However, when it comes to actors, that is a different game altogether. What is your expectation in terms of what it's going to happen between now and June 30th? CRABTREE-IRELAND: My expectation is that we are all going to work hard to negotiate a fair deal. And hopefully, by the end of the month, we will have a fair deal in place that we are -- our members will be happy with, that is fair to them, and covers the issues that they need dealt with and that the industry can live with. I will say, in my view, the writer strike has already had a very big impact on the industry because, even though there is some examples like you mentioned, where sometimes projects go forward in the absence of a writer, that is really not ideal. It has a huge impact on production both on the TV and streaming side as well as a feature side. But I think the reality is that if we can get a fair deal by the end of the month, then we will be looking at the strike authorization we just received from our members yesterday by an overwhelming majority. Almost 98 percent of our members voting yes on the request to give the authority to our board to call a strike that is needed. That is not to say that we are going to go on strike. That is to say that we are going into this negotiation to make a deal. But if we cannot get a fair deal, we will do what is necessary to get one.",

The term blue economy was born for this. It's a concept where marine resources are used sustainably while also promoting economic growth.
