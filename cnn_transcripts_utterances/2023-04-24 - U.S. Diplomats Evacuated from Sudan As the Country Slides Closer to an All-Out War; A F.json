Florida's Ron DeSantis goes global as poll numbers show him trailing Donald Trump here at home.Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, it is Monday, I'm Christine Romans. This morning, the U.S. has no embassy operating in Sudan, a country on the brink of civil war. President Biden announcing the U.S. diplomatic personnel and their families have been evacuated from Sudan. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, adding that operations at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum have been temporarily suspended. CNN's Sam Kiley is reporting on the situation from Djibouti for us. And Sam, how was the extraction of U.S. personnel carried out, and are officials saying why it was necessary?",

      "sentences": "Well, let's start with why it was necessary there, Christine. You say it's on -- Sudan is on the brink of civil war. I think from the American and international perspective, it is a country in the throes of a very violent, actual civil war. There are, for example, Sudanese jets bombarding positions inside their own capital.And it's that level of violence that provoked not just the United States, but it is enormous in international, military effort centered here in Djibouti or out of here in Djibouti, mainly, to try to get international aid workers and other people, students, and all kinds of internationals out of that country. Now, when it comes to the United States, they were in the vanguard of the evacuation operations that began over the weekend with a very daring raid effectively by some 100 Americans, mostly special forces, involving three Chinook helicopters that took off from here in Djibouti, flew via Ethiopia, where they refueled in Addis Ababa, and then flew very low, but slow. They're not that fast aircraft at about 100 miles an hour, all the way to the Sudanese capital itself, the scene of violence where a ceasefire around the Eid Fitr celebrations for the end of Ramadan were not being observed in any serious way. They were able to pluck out just under a 100 people, mostly embassy staffers, plus their families and a few internationals who were co-located with them and take them out of -- out to safety, initially in Ethiopia on the back of that. An hour or two later, British Special Forces were on the ground, they had anticipated or planned for the worst eventuality, which was having to fight and protect British citizens and others there. They didn't have to do that, but they did have to do an 18-mile, 30 kilometer road moved to a desert air strip where they were able to evacuate people alongside the French, who were also engaged, reportedly in some kind of brief clash, or at least, there is reported to have been minor injuries, perhaps on one person being evacuated there. Now, the international effort is getting underway. There is extreme violence continuing in Khartoum, the central prison there that includes a large number of senior members of previous administration have been let out. Real concerns that the place is collapsing into violent anarchy, and more evacuations would be necessary. (COUGHING)",

Now a few centrist Democrats are pushing President Biden to make a deal with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy over raising the debt ceiling.Now, Biden has said he won't negotiate the kind of deep spending cuts Republicans demand, and will only accept a clean proposal, just simply raise the debt limit. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar on CNN Sunday, as saying, of course, Biden should sit down with the speaker, but only to discuss the budget, not to negotiate racing the debt limit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  A proposal that McCarthy has put forward, that belongs in the budget. We just passed a budget with 18 Republicans voting for it in the U.S. Senate.

Here's what he had to say.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  We do have a very small majority, only five seats. It's one of the smallest we've ever had. But I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Biden's reckless spending. We will hold a vote this week and we will pass and we will send it to the Senate.",

As of now, many conservatives like Congressman Andy Biggs tell us that they're just not there yet. As for the White House, they're insisting they will simply reject this measure outright.But going into next week, the president is facing pressure from some Democrats who think negotiations with Congress need to begin immediately. And now, to just quickly break down what's actually in this 320 page bill, it includes a series of cuts to domestic spending, including a plan to block Biden student loan forgiveness program and rescind new funding for the internal revenue service. But the bottom-line to focus on here is that Congress is running out of time. Current estimates put the deadline for when a deal must be reached at some point this Summer, and that has many members on both sides of the aisle on edge. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington.
