      "sentences": "Well, Kate, we are headed into definitely the final stretch. Opinions today, potentially tomorrow, with just a handful of cases left.But really there are two big ones that really do affect millions of Americans. So, the Supreme Court will decide in the coming days, potentially even today, whether colleges and universities can continue with affirmative action in their admissions policies. Whether they can continue to use race as one factor in admission decisions. This is -- affirmative action has been allowed in this country for more than 40 years, but it is quite possible that the conservative court here will strike down affirmative action and not let colleges and universities consider race in the future. So, colleges and universities are bracing for this. We'll see how the court comes down, but it really could be a major shakeup of 40 years of precedent. Also we're waiting for a decision on a case involving the Biden administration's student loan debt forgiveness program. This is something that the Biden administration had tried to put into effect in the wake of Covid, essentially cancelling up to $20,000 in student debt for 40 million Americans. Lower courts put the block on this program. And now it's up to the Supreme Court to see whether the Biden administration can put this program into effect. So really 40 million Americans, student loan borrowers, waiting on the edge of their seats to see if their student loans could be canceled. Right now, 40 million people are eligible before this program was blocked, 26 million had already applied for this, 16 million had been approved. So, there is a lot riding on this decision. What we saw at oral arguments were the conservative justices really skeptical about whether the Biden administration had the power to cancel all of these students debts that would essentially amount to $400 billion. So, those are the big cases that we're waiting for. Also waiting for a case on whether a wedding website designer in Colorado can be forced, in her words, to make wedding websites for same sex couples. And then a case involving a postal worker who says his civil rights were violated when he was made to work on Sundays against his religious beliefs. So, Kate, we are getting ready. The opinion -- the court starts releasing opinions at 10:00 a.m. This will not be the final day. We are expecting potentially opinions as well tomorrow. So, we'll see what comes out today. This court likes to keep us at the edge of our seats right to the very last minute. Kate.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And it is this sort of chaos which I'm sure Ukrainian officials here were hoping would potentially unfurl in the wake of that startling rebellion at the weekend.Sergei Surovkin, so important because he was indeed running the war in Ukraine this winter, removed from that post because of satisfaction about - dissatisfaction about how badly it was going. But was also one of the few top brass that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner chief who led the rebellion, spoke kindly of. Now, we haven't seen him in public since a Friday video he released basically telling the Wagner rebels to stop and stand down. He looked pretty harried, it's fair to say, in that video. Obviously perhaps because of the circumstances or perhaps as some have suggested because he wasn't comfortable with the message he was giving. \"The New York Times\" report suggesting he had prime knowledge. Well, I've heard from a European intelligence official suggesting that some in the security or military establishment might have known a little bit about this beforehand. That's still unclear. It's also unclear where Surovkin is. Yes, there are reports suggesting he's not been seen. There are other reports suggesting he's been arrested or detained. And there are others, indeed a former MP suggesting, in fact, he's OK and at work as per normal. So, I think it's likely we may get an answer to that question by his appearance sometime soon. But quite where he's been over the past three and a half days, well, that's certainly going to leave an air of suspicion over him. And that's, frankly, I think, exactly what western intelligence and Ukrainians want. They want this blame game. They want this suspicion to continue percolating amongst Putin's top brass and indeed the entire Moscow elite. That's going to be fundamentally very damaging. It's going to limit their trust, their ability to make good decisions and essentially sprawl on for weeks. That will significantly impact their already bad performance in the war in Ukraine. And as you mentioned too, there, John, still an outstanding question as to where is Yevgeny Prigozhin. He's been said to be in Belarus, but he's not confirmed that himself. And he's not a man who's shy of putting messages out on his Telegram channel. So that's fundamentally too a question that needs to be answered until I think Putin, who today appeared at a -- a forum talking about new technologies and drew a bizarre picture on a white board there, trying, it seemed, to act like life is per normal. But until we really get these questions resolved, and this sort of purge-type atmosphere being debated in Moscow's elite, his grip on power still looks phenomenally weak, John.",

      "sentences": "Yes, sometimes what they don't say is just as important as what they will say.We now know that Russian state media is reporting that before Wagner mercenaries attempted to stage the military insurrection, their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had been informed that his private military company would no longer be able to participate in Russia's special military option in Ukraine because, and this is the most important thing, Prigozhin refused to follow an order from Russia's defense ministry that said, all mercenary groups fighting in Ukraine had to sign contracts with the department. To discuss all the angles on this, CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Good morning to you. I want to start with all the presidents men, if you will. We have the situation that we are hearing about, reporting that one of his generals has not been seen for days. There is another report that he has been arrested. What does this tell you about what is happening in Putin's inner circle? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Sara. The main thing that it tells us is that they're in upheaval. The whole inner circle, especially on the military side is, in essence, being called into question. It's pretty clear that Surovkin, the general that's supposedly, possibly in custody, that he probably knew something about this rebellion. His relationship with Prigozhin, it was pretty strong given the dichotomy between the military and the Wagner group. And both of them, both Prigozhin and Surovkin, were very effective commanders in Ukraine, comparatively speaking, with the other Russian commanders that were -- have been involved in the Ukrainian war. So, they had a close relationship in that sense. Or at least as close as one can get in those situations. And now to have this occur and Prigozhin, obviously, being put into exile, Surovkin being questioned about his loyalties, that, you know, kind of smacks o a Stalinist way of doing things. And that this way of looking at this, from an investigative standpoint, is something that's going to be occupying the Russian security services for some time.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's going to be very distracting. And especially when it comes to the leadership. And the one thing we have to keep in mind, Sara, is that the Russian military structure is a top-down military structure. Everything rests on the shoulders of the commander, and then it cascades down to the lower ranks. There's very little initiative on the shoulders that are on the front lines because they're basically told what to do and they follow those orders. They're used to doing that.So, if they put their loyalty into the hands of a particular person, such as a Prigozhin, or a Surovkin, they are going to be loyal to that individual. And it's going to take a while to change their loyalties. It's also going to take a while for the Russian military to integrate the Wagner forces, those 25,000 that you spoke of, into the mainstream military. And it won't be something that's going to be seamless. It's going to be very difficult for them to do it. And those people are going to want to assert control once they get into the Russian military. They could eventually actually be a poison pill for that military, and that could really impede the effectiveness of the Russian military operations in Ukraine at this point.",

And his appearance in Dagestan, which is right on the Caspian Sea, that is something that's very interesting because he is not only reasserting control, or trying to, but he's using this visual of popular support to make a point. He's saying, I have support of the people. You think Prigozhin had support in Rostov when he took over that town. Look at me, I've got support over here with actually a minority group within the Russian Federation. And so he's using that as a signaling mechanism to assert authority.However, Putin is a very, very paranoid man. And his actions during Covid, his actions really throughout his time in power, especially in the last few years, indicate that he really wants to not only maintain control, but he wants to keep the people under him fighting each other. And that is something that we're searing right now. But when they go too far, like Prigozhin did, then they have to be reined in. And those who supported Prigozhin, or even, you know, had some kind of empathy towards Prigozhin, they're going to be paying a price, at least temporarily, depending on how far they were involved in this.",
