Fighters entering the city overnight for the first time since 2016, waving opposition flags and yelling God is great in Arabic. Those rebel forces seen today patrolling the streets of Aleppo where a 24-hour curfew is now in effect. CNN's Ben Wedeman reports for us, the surprise attack is putting pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to respond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The facade of government power in Aleppo was poster thin. Friday evening, rebels stomp on pictures of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Just a few days ago, they were far away from Syria's second city. Now they control some of Aleppo's most iconic landmarks, like the vast central Saadallah al-Jabiri Square and the city's ancient Citadel. Eight years ago, opponents of the Damascus regime left Aleppo in defeat, bust out to nearby rebel-held Idlib province. Now they're back after a lightning offensive. Ali Jumaa fled his native Aleppo eight years ago. It's an indescribable feeling, he says, to return to your land, your city, the place where you were raised. Syrian government ground forces haven't put up much of a fight. Residents report seeing them leave several areas. The Defense Ministry in Damascus issued a statement saying troops had conducted a, quote, strategic redeployment aimed at reinforcing defensive lines. In other words, they retreated. Russian forces are hitting back, conducting airstrikes on both Aleppo and nearby Idlib province, a stronghold for the anti-regime coalition. A major component of that coalition, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, is an offshoot of al-Qaeda but has distanced itself in recent years. Russia came to the rescue of the Syrian government in 2015, but diverted some of its resources to the war in Ukraine. Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon fought alongside the regime during the civil war's darkest days. Most returned home to join the war against Israel, opening the way for the rebel offensive. We participated in the operation to liberate Aleppo, to kick out the militias of Iran and Hezbollah, to lift the oppression from our brothers in Aleppo, says rebel fighter Muhammad Hammadi, and we're going to clear all of Syria, God willing. A brutal war, stalemated in recent years, rages again.",

And now Putin is threatening again to use this new ballistic missile.I'm curious what more you know about this and if it is a cause for concern. LEIGHTON (on-camera): Well, the Oreshnik missile, the new ballistic missile that you're referring to, Jessica, is definitely a cause for concern. It's so far been designated as an intermediate range missile. So, what does that mean in concrete terms? That means that it has a range of about, at the maxim about 3,500 or so miles. And that does put at risk a large portion of Western Europe if the missile is launched from the Western parts of Russia. So, if the Russians have enough of these Oreshnik missiles in their inventory, it can put a large part not only of Ukraine at risk, but also a large part of NATO. And that is definitely something that we have to pay attention to. It's both nuclear capable as well as conventional capable in terms of its warheads. It has multiple warheads and it is an extremely dangerous weapon.",

They know that we have the capability, nuclear and otherwise, to stop them and to and to make them pay for any attack. So, this is a new weapon or a modified old weapon that they're now hyping.

Not just across portions of Michigan, but also Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.And it's specifically portions of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario where we're likely to see some of the heaviest snow bands come through in the next 24 to 36 hours. But we also have a separate system that's bringing some snowfall. This is going to stretch right there along Interstate 70 that runs through St. Louis and continues eastward into Southern Indiana, portions of Kentucky as well as West Virginia. Now, snowfall totals there are not expected to be quite as much. Most of these areas looking at about two to five inches total, whereas farther to the north now we're going to be measuring it in feet. In total, we're looking at possibly four to six feet of snow across portions of the northeast right there along the Great Lakes. Now that's the total that does not -- will count everything that started on Friday all the way through today and continuing into the day on Sunday. Again, some pretty substantial amounts here. It's been causing traffic problems up and down Interstate I-90 stretching from Buffalo back through Cleveland in portions of Interstate 81, near Watertown as well, and that could continue through the evening hours tonight and as well into Sunday especially as those bands get thicker and heavier as they continue through the day. Another concern is going to be the Buffalo Bills game that takes place on Sunday night. Not only do they have all the snow that's already fallen and will continue to fall, but then the snow that's going to fall during the game itself, it could be coming down quite heavy at times. Those temperatures kind of hovering right at or below the freezing mark for much of the game, but place that's going to be cold, in fact 70 percent of the U. S. population is looking at temperatures at or below freezing at s next several days. And it goes pretty far south too. This isn't just a problem for northern cities, Atlanta, Dallas, all looking at those temperatures well below where they normally would be this time of year and they're going to stay there for quite some time. Look at New York City, every single one of the next seven days is expected to be below 49 degrees which is where they normally would be this time of year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "One of the things that is really important to understand is that, you know, Donald Trump when he makes statements like that he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it. Our responsibility is to point out that in this way, he would be actually not just harming Canadians who -- who -- who work so well with the United States, he'd actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and businesses.(END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE (on-camera): Now, Jessica, we also heard from Trudeau following the meeting this morning our own CNN's Kit Maher caught up with Trudeau, asked him how the dinner went. He said they had an excellent conversation. And then he also posted on X saying that he looks forward to working together with Donald Trump moving forward. All to say, to put this into context, this was a very important moment. Not only was Trudeau the first person -- the first leader, I should say, of the G7 to meet with Donald Trump since the November 5th election, but also their relationship is going to be so crucial moving forward, given what Donald Trump has said and the emphasis he has really put on trade and his willingness to really have a heavy hand when it comes to tariffs. I think that's why you saw him personally come down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him. We know that he also spoke with Donald Trump over the phone earlier in this week, just shortly after Donald Trump had issued that terror threat. And what's also interesting as well is that it's not just Trudeau who's doing this. We also saw earlier this week, Donald Trump and the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum speak with Donald Trump over the phone. However, that conversation, they actually took away two different things from that. We know that Donald Trump had said they had a great conversation and that essentially Mexico's leader had promised to effectively close down the southern border. She responded by saying that wasn't true. And has also said that if Donald Trump were to move forward with his threat to put a 25 percent tariff on goods coming from Mexico, that the country would respond with their own tariffs themselves. All to say again, that both of these countries and their leaders, I think, are trying to reach out to Donald Trump and work with him and see what they can do to potentially stop what he has said would be a massive change to their economies as well as the U.S. economy.",

Virtually every economist you consult will say, you know, that these tariffs will raise the cost of these goods. In fact, we saw it last time Trump wage trade wars against these and many other countries. A bunch of studies have looked at who bore the cost of those price increases. You know, was it the foreign countries as Trump alleged? Was it the domestic importers or their downstream purchasers, wholesalers, retailers, U.S. consumers, and either most or the entirety of the cost of those tariffs in those cases was born by Americans? I think we should expect very much the same thing here, whether we're talking about a lot of the produce that we get from Mexico in particular, you know, the groceries that -- that Trump said that he would bring down the price of those are going to get more expensive. Gas prices, automobiles, lots of consumer goods, housing for that matter, since a lot of inputs to housing like lumber and cement that comes from Canada, all of these things are likely to get more expensive.",

The oil industry, oil and petroleum industry crosses borders in both directions, whether we're talking about crude products or refined products. So in in all of those cases, these countries actually have a fair amount of leverage to hit back. Again, it'll hurt them, too, just as it will hurt us. But we saw this last time, again, when Trump waged trade wars before, particularly tariffs on steel and aluminum from -- from these two countries, Mexico and Canada. They hit back with their own form of retaliation. Which, in my view, was much more surgically targeted than the kinds of tariffs that Trump has -- has proposed in this case. So, like, for example, both Mexico and Canada last time around targeted American whiskeys, a politically important sector, as it turns out here in the United States. Also, things like orange juice, potatoes from Idaho, lots of other products that are concentrated in Republican areas. So I think you would expect the same kind of retaliation again.

This is a 365-day rivalry. These two fanbases and teams hate each other that much. And basically what happened, at the end of this game, Michigan upsetting Ohio State, 13 to 10. This is their fourth straight win over Ohio State. And Michigan was a massive underdog. Instead, they go into Columbus, upset the Wolverines, drastically alter the college football playoff picture for the Buckeyes. After the game, Michigan players tried to plant their flag on Ohio State's midfield. I mean, talk about a rivalry, that's how this game ended. After the Michigan players attempted that, Ohio State players wanted nothing to do with that. There was a scuffle ensuing, multiple coaches and police officers on the field were trying to get these two teams separated. A wild finish, but it just goes to show you how heated this rivalry is and how much this game really matters.",
