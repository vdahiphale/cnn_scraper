If you think back to last week, you know, all of the signs were pointing to the potential that the Ukrainians may actually be forced to withdraw. They lost a key bridge cutting off one of the last supply routes in and out of the city. A drone reconnaissance unit was forced to withdraw from the city. And even Ukrainian officials themselves weren't sort of ruling out the possibility of having to withdraw.Now the picture is a bit more gray. You have the Ukrainians saying that in the last 24 hours, yes, the assault continues. There are about half a dozen settles just in the Bakhmut area became under fire. You have the analysts saying that the Russians continue to make gradual progress in parts of the town, in trying to encircle it which is obviously their goal. And you also have a Russian war correspondent now saying, that look, he thinks that there's about 10-12,000 Ukrainian troops still inside Bakhmut. And that some of them have begun to withdraw. But the Ukrainians say that actually, look, things have stabilized. There's a commander on the ground saying that not only are they not withdrawing, they're actually bringing in new troops to the front lines to try to shore up their positions. A bridge -- the bridge that I mentioned that was destroyed last week -- has been replaced by a temporary one, restoring that route. And also a key highway connecting Bakhmut to the next town over to the west is still within Ukrainian control. So, it's really a mixed picture here. I think what's remarkable, is that there are still civilians trapped inside this town. The deputy mayor says there are 4,000 of them. Now, whether or not that number is accurate is one thing. But even if there, you know, is a smaller number, it's still pretty amazing, considering the very intense fighting taking place there. And the deputy mayor says that only 5 or 10 are being evacuated every day, that's down from 500 or 600 who were being taken out at the height of the evacuation -- which, of course, began last year. And a lot of these people aren't leaving not because they can't get out, but because they don't want to get out. And this is something that we see over and over again in towns under fire across the front line. People would rather sit in their homes under fire and take the risk of going into the unknown with really nothing but the clothes on their backs.",
