You know, I come from a culture when a woman is pregnant you're supposed to treat her like a queen because there is the understanding that the mother's mental health actually affects the baby's mental health. That is really important, so beginning to tie all of these other aspects of a woman's health not just when she is pregnant, really but beforehand which is key.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this deal could avert a government shutdown, absolutely non-guaranteed, but it is significant because the Republican-led House and Democrat-led Senate have been at loggerheads for months over how to fund the federal government. The initial deadline was October 1st to avoid a government shutdown but there was not an agreement on funding levels at that point.The then speaker of the House agreed to a short-term government extension. That actually led to his ouster as speaker because members of the far-right were not happy with the United States spending cuts. Then brought in the House speaker Mike Johnson who agreed to extend the government until January 19th for some federal agencies, February 2nd for other federal agencies. And now with Congress set to come back this week, the questions are, can they avoid a government shutdown by January 19th, and today we got our first answer. There are signs that they could, not guaranteed but they could because of this agreement that was reached between the speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, just saying that they agreed to $1.59 trillion with over all government spending for this current fiscal year. That includes all government, the Defense Department, other domestic agencies as well, everything from transportation to Ag, and you name it. That's what falls under that $1.59 trillion level. We are learning some new details, too, about this agreement that was reached. There's actually $69 billion that was part of what's called a side deal that the negotiators had agreed to provide that pump that money into domestic programs. We'll see how ultimately that plays out. But here's the big question. Even though they have reached this agreement between the two sides, now they have to actually implement it in legislation, and actually fund the federal government either through a continuing resolution or through annual funding bill, but they need legislation to implement that funding level. That is where things can get tricky. There will be members, especially in the House, who want deeper spending cuts. There will also be House members and conservatives who want to tie in more restrictive policies along the southern border with Mexico, add that to this as leverage to enact the policy priorities. They do that, that could run into -- run into opposition from the White House and from Senate Democrats with very little time to spare to avoid a shutdown which leads to a question about whether they can actually avoid the government shutdown despite this deal being reached. But this deal definitely a key first step to averting a shutdown. Now they are on the same page over how much money the government can spend, now they got to get into the details about the individual funding levels, but it's a long-delayed agreement, one that's been reached that could potentially avoid a catastrophe in just a matter of days. Again, no guarantees -- Fred.",

I have been speaking to lawmakers over the past months about this government funding process, and a number of top appropriators have stressed that we can't do anything unless we have this top line number agreement.This was very key to unlocking the rest of these negotiations, so today with House and Senate leaders coming out and saying that they have a deal on those top line numbers, it's significant. Now they can try to figure out the specifics within those 12 appropriations bills as these government funding deadlines creep up upon us, January 19th, the first, and February 2nd is the second one. But also as noted, there are several other wrinkles in this process, particularly border security, As Republicans we saw they took a trip down to the border recently to kick off the new year. Some of them are saying that they will not fund the government unless there is substantive border security. And as we know, the Senate has struggled to come to a consensus on this politically prickly issue. So, you know, bottom line is that this was significant step in the right direction today, but again there are still a number of issues and hurdles to come.",

It needs to be attached to whatever agreement it has. So there's a lot of challenges in terms of getting this deal done in the next 10 days or so. WHITFIELDreally are kind of two deadlines, but the first with the January 19, and then, you know, you've got early February to be concerned about, too. So just over 10 days from now, that doesn't seem like a whole lot of time.

President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and even the Pentagon's second in command Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks were unaware Austin was being treated at Walter Reed last week. Austin was admitted on New Year's Day for complications from an elective surgery, but President Biden learned of the events three days later, leading some to question why it took so long for the top Pentagon official to reveal his health issue.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is joining us right now with more on this. Natasha, what are you learning about what was happening?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fredricka. So essentially we've learned that really no one, no senior National Security official knew immediately when Secretary Austin was admitted into the hospital on January 1st. It took at least three days for the Defense Department to notify the National Security Council that he was admitted to the hospital following complications that he had from an elective surgery earlier last week.And so this is raising obvious questions about why there was such a lack of transparency and whether it posed any national security concerns because the president was not aware again until Thursday that his secretary of Defense was in the hospital and for a portion of that time at least he was in the intensive care unit. Now we are told that during that time, deputy of the secretary of defense Kathleen Hicks, she was given some of the responsibilities. She was transferred some of the duties that Secretary Austin normally carries out. Some operational, you know, duties that the secretary could not conduct while he was in the hospital because he was meeting with the doctors or was otherwise unavailable. But she was granted those authorities on January 2nd, and didn't actually find out why she was given those authorities until two days later when she discovered that Secretary Austin was in fact hospitalized. So this is continuing to raise a lot of questions within the Pentagon itself. Several Pentagon officials were not aware that the secretary was hospitalized and of course, there was a lot going on last week as well while he was in the hospital in terms of the national security space. There was a strike, a U.S. Military strike that was carried out in Baghdad against a pro-Iran militia commander and of course, there are tensions in the Middle East that are really escalating at this moment with the Iran-backed groups attacking U.S. and coalition forces all across Iraq and Syria, in addition of course to all the threats facing commercial shipping and the U.S. Military in Red Sea. And so it was very problematic according to many current and former National Security officials that the secretary of Defense did not make the White House or really even his second in command aware that he was in the hospital throughout this period -- Fredricka.",

We know that he had a phone call with President Biden and other members of Biden's national security team on January 1st.We don't know whether that was before or during the time that he was in the hospital. But the White House, we should note, they released a statement just last night saying that President Biden spoke with Secretary Austin and reiterated that he has full confidence in his secretary, and that he looks forward to him returning to the Pentagon. And when we asked the Pentagon press secretary whether Austin has any plans to resign over this incident because of all of the uproar it has caused not only among critics, but also among lawmakers, the Pentagon press secretary said that currently Austin has no plans to resign -- Fredricka.",

At least 11 civilians, including five children, killed by missile strikes around Pokrovsk in the east of the country, authorities say. The buildings they were in reduced to nothing more than rubble. Two houses have been destroyed to the ground, this official says. 134 private houses and 15 apartment buildings have been damaged. Search operations are ongoing. Ukraine says Russia has stepped up attacks both on the ground and in the air in the past weeks, killing nearly 120 civilians and wounding almost 500 more since December 29th, according to the U.S. The U.S. claims Russia has even used missiles procured from North Korea to attack Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. Moscow hasn't commented so far, and Ukrainian authorities investigating the wreckage say they haven't yet come to a final conclusion about the missile's origin. Most likely, this missile was either supplied by North Korea or was produced recently using blueprints and technology supplied by Russia to third countries or to North Korea, this official says.
