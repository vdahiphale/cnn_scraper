As you said, he was originally ruled to have died from blunt force head trauma as the result of a hit and run.But we've looked at investigative files from the highway patrol back from 2015, and even then investigators said that there was no evidence that Stephen Smith had been hit by a car, saying that there was no vehicle debris. The injuries on his body were not consistent with that. And even that his shoes were still on his feet loosely tied. But it became a cold case. And then you June 2021, state law enforcement division investigators announced that they were opening a death investigation into Stephen Smith's death because of information gathered during the course of the investigation into the murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, who, of course, Alex Murdaugh was convicted of killing earlier this month. Now, state investigators have never said what that information they gathered was, but they made a phone call. The chief of SLED called an attorney who had just been retained by Stephen Smith's mother this week yesterday, and he said that they were looking into this as a homicide and that they were working towards trying to solve Stephen Smith's death.",

But he said it has gone on far too long, these baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false.

And then on January 6th, and, you know, to his credit. I won't try to read into his motives. It's possible that he genuinely thought he was doing the right thing by breaking with Trump on January 6th. But he did it so late that he didn't win that much credit from the less MAGA-inclined Republicans either.And so I think all of these Republicans, regardless of where they are on the kind of ideological spectrum or where they are on Trump, all of them sensed opportunism when they saw Pence.
