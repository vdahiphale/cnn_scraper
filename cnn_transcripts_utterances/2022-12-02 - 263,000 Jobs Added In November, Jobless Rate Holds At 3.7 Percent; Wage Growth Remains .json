Robust hiring last month proves the economy is strong and resilient to recession. But it also shows the feds efforts to slow growth some will not get easier anytime soon.Plus, President Joe Biden tries to rewrite the Democratic primary calendar by putting South Carolina first, that shift doubles as a signal. Right now, he's dead set on running again in 2024. And today, only four days left in the critical Georgia Senate showdown. A brand- new CNN poll shows the Democrat with a narrow lead. The stakes are giant, the sniping well, pointed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Since the last time I was here, Mr. Walker has been talking about issues that are of great importance to the people of Georgia. Like whether it's better to be a vampire or a werewolf. This is a debate that I must confess I once had myself when I was seven. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And evidence to though that the feds push to tame inflation is facing major resistance. Here are the top line numbers. 263,000 jobs added last month that beat expectations.And it happens of course, in the middle of a wave of layoffs that had been triggering alarm and headlines. The unemployment rate holding steady from last month 3.7 percent, go sector by sector and what you see is growth, wages trending up too, in a big way. But therein lies the rub, too hot wage growth will prop up inflation. The president a short time ago says though he sees reason, reasons for optimism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: We're in a position now wherein things are moving. They're moving in the right direction. As we go into the holiday season, here's what this all means. The Americans are working, the economy is growing, wages are rising faster than inflation. And we've avoided a catastrophic real strike.

There are just too many people trying to hire workers relative to the number of workers who are available. And this was further confirmation that it remains out of balance.The fed just for context thinks that about 100,000 jobs need to get added every month just to make up for population gains, were more than 2.5 times that. And we have been pretty steadily all year long. So, this is just a very strong labor market, far stronger than what the fed would be hoping to see to feel confident that the economy is slowing down enough to bring inflation back down to its target.",

The data over the last couple of months have been better than I would have thought, none of the financial market indicators suggest we have a recession dead ahead.

BIDEN: The inflation at the grocery stores, thank God beginning to slow prices for things like clothes, television and appliances are going down. As good news for the holiday season.

And he's been actually pretty transparent about all that. And I think Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, Republican activist has a column that everyone should read if they haven't read yet this week, telling Republicans to stop under estimating Joe Biden, that he had a one of the best first term off year elections in history, saying Biden's actually been pretty effective. This is about two things. This is about Trump and then fighting, and this is about the economy. Biden is going to stay focused on the economy. That's his path back.",

Look, I know, this was tough for members of both party to do this. This was also tough for me. He at one point said this was a tough choice. And by that, he was basically acknowledging that something like the rail strike, when you combine that with the inflation that people are feeling right now would have been devastating for the economy, and particularly for consumers, even to the point where a president who has not been shy to celebrate his bona fides and working for unions, was willing to sign an agreement that didn't go all the way for some union members in terms of getting enough paid leave that they want.",

And I think that really speaks to the level of engagement here. People are clued in. It is impossible not to be in Georgia, between those radio and television ads, you cannot ignore of this run off contests.We've also seen quite a bit of star power on the campaign trail. Former President Barack Obama on the trail last night in support of Senator Warnock. He was also here just a few weeks ago during the general election. There's also been a bevy of Hollywood celebrities to America Ferrera, Tessa Thompson, Dule Hill, all in support of Senator Warnock. Meanwhile, Herschel Walker has pretty much been joined on the trail by Senate Republicans, chief among them Senator Lindsey Graham, both of the candidates crisscrossing the state today. We're still learning, waiting to learn Herschel Walker's weekend schedule. We do know though, that Senator Warnock is going to be returning to a college campus over the weekend.

So, if he said, no, it wasn't going to happen. You get the additional Senator, that helps. In the new Congress, we have a Republican House, a Democratic Senate, so very little is going to get accomplished anyways. Yes, it will change some of the committee structure. You may have one more seat margin than you do is a dead-lock Senate. But there are ways to get around that procedurally in the Senate. So, I may not have as huge of an impact that they're saying, but every Senate vote does count, especially as we get into future election cycles.

If you dig deep in it, this is interesting to me. Do you view these candidates as favorable or unfavorable. Senator Warnock, who's the incumbent, 50 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable. Herschel Walker, you know, football hero, University of Georgia went on to play in the NFL and the USFL. 39 percent favorable, 52 percent unfavorable.

Look at some of the gaps, look at some of the crises, look at some of the accusations against him as well. And also remember that we've been here before in terms of runoff election. Just another note on the early voting, there are some prominent Democrats that are pretty excited about some of those numbers.

President Biden now though proposing a dramatic overhaul of the 2024 Democratic nominating calendar. Take a look. The Biden proposal strips Iowa of its first in the nation caucuses, that's hundred plus year tradition.Instead, the new first in the nation honor would go to South Carolina, then New Hampshire and Nevada on the same day one week later, after that Georgia and Michigan would move up. Now, why would these changes? Why this proposal from the president? You look at the map from 2020, the White House position is this would put more diverse states, more diverse economically, more diverse demographically, more diverse geographically on the calendar. But let's be honest about the raw politics that play here as well. Iowa went first in 2020. That was a Pete Buttigieg's state, that Pete Buttigieg green there. Then you had New Hampshire. You notice there, that's Bernie Sanders blue in New Hampshire in 2020. Then we went out to Nevada, also Bernie Sanders blue there. And so, when you come back to the national map, what happens next? Well, what's this? This is South Carolina. Joe Biden written off as done until this big primary night. This is what propelled him to the presidency. And he wants to make it first now on the calendar come 2024. He also wants to move up Georgia. That's a lot of Biden blue to the tune of 85 percent when you look at that right there. And he wants to move up Michigan, another state, a competitive state, but where he ended up winning big in the end. Jim Clyburn, remember he endorsed Biden back in 2020. He's the senior congressman from South Carolina. He says for both parties, he thinks his state going first is a good thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
