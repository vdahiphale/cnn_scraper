There's been a tendency among Democrats to get exasperated at the American people for not voting their material interests for policies that would help them better their conditions. They wonder, as the title of a book raising the concern, goes, \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" And what they really mean is what's the matter with America?But in recent years, a growing body of scholarship has shown that people don't tend to vote rationally, but rather use voting to express themselves in emotional, ideological and moral ways. This view of human behavior, which I would associate with scholars like Daniel Kahneman and Jonathan Haidt sees elections as involving a great deal of intangible intuition and passion. Voters choose from the gut and then rationalize their choice consciously or not. Kamala Harris' campaign seems premised on this latter intuition-based approach. Ever since she became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, Harris has run a remarkably focused and disciplined campaign. What it seems deliberately light on substance and high on feelings. You don't see the dozens of policy papers that were hallmark of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Harris has not yet given extensive interviews or done press conferences, which would force her to detail her positions on specific issues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS.

But that war lasted 18 days, and here we are almost a year after and Israel was not yet able to achieve even one of the two main goals that it sets to topple, dismantle Hamas, capture or kill its leaders, and free the hostages. And because this war is run without the ability to finish it with a political move, with a day after that will ensure that Hamas would not retake the street once the IDF is out, then it can go on and on, and people in Israel I think for the first time at least in my life since I remember, they feel a deep sense of lack of confidence that Israel would prevail. That is not clear. It was always thinking the politicians are corrupt. Maybe the organization or the bureaucracies is not functioning well, but at the end Israel will prevail. Israel will bring the promise that is inherent to the establishment of Israel. A place to keep the Jews safe. And people are losing the confidence of Israel being able to fulfill that promise.",

Tell me the last time around when Iran and Israel went through this process, it was all fairly well- choreographed. While the Iranians did do a big attack, they essentially alerted the Israel and the United States so that the missiles could be intercepted.

And we saw the kind of flight show and, you know, sending out drones seven hours ahead, et cetera. So, that this time there would be a coordinated attack. It would be an attack against a military target. They will, I suspect, avoid civilian infrastructure or civilian areas but would focus on a military target. But that it would be a surprise and this time around the attack would be -- you know, the intention would be to cause pain, to retaliate in a way that leaves an impression and does what April 13 could not do, which is from an Iranian perspective, restore deterrence. They thought that the April 13 attack and the kind of tit for tat that we saw had ended that episode there. And therefore, there wasn't going to be an escalation anymore. Now, they realize that the -- what they thought had been a deterrence was not a deterrence. And that the Israeli prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu, is willing to up the ante even further.

There's a poll showing that men are more likely to vote Republican or vote for Donald Trump than at any time this century.

The Democrat's progressives are much better, he says, at identifying examples of toxic masculinity than in identifying examples of positive masculinity that are distinct from femininity. But to your earlier point, I think, the strongest evidence that we have is that this isn't just about gender. It's about the way the Democrats and Republicans think about gender. So, one-way it was put to me is that it's not as if, you know, Republicans are from Mars and men are from Venus. It's that Republican men and women are from Mars, and Democratic men and women are from Venus. And so, essentially you can, you know, look at the way that say J.D. Vance talks about the fact that childless women aren't doing their duty. Or the way the Tim Walz says that the Republican party has become a bunch of he-man women haters.

Why aren't you -- and when I went and talked to researchers what they told me is, look, here's the mistake you're making. We tend think of a discussion as being about one thing, about your day. But actually, every discussion is made up of different kinds of conversations. And they tend to fall in one or three buckets. There's practical conversations where we're solving problems together, making plans. There's emotional conversations where I might tell you how I feel. I don't want you to solve my feelings. I want you to empathize. And then there's social conversations which are about the social identities that are important to us and how we think society sees us and each other. And if we're not having the same kind of conversation at the same moment, that's when miscommunication occurs.
