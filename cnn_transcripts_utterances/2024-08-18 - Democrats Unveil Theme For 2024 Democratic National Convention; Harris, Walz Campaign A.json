In his late 20s he had -- he wasn't even eligible to be a senator when he was first elected. He had to wait until -- you know, until January.And so, he also did not want his legacy to be one where Democrats wanted him out of the race. And that they would have blamed him if he had stayed in and then Donald Trump would have been re-elected in November. And so, his legacy would have been in tatters among Democrats. And so, this is a moment that they want to get proper due respect to Biden and what he has done. And Harris can't distance herself too much from her own part in the administration but she has to lay out her own agenda.

Ukraine only claimed here a day ago. PATON WALSH (on camera): Well not even the statue of Lenin is unscathed here. This Ukrainian assault, so persistent, and Russia, despite its sense of history, it's sort of past as being so impregnable, completely unable to push the Ukrainians out here. A sound of small arms fire we can still hear, so clearly there is a bid for the Russians to push back, but it simply isn't working, and the humiliation for Putin endures. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Days ago, locals had honored their war dead. But none since the Nazis led Russia to face occupation. PATON WALSH (on camera): You can see the damage that's been done to the street here from the intense fight that rage. Still clearly active fighting happening here.

As it pushes that water in, it could cause some erosion in some of those areas.

So, we're looking at about 30 pounds and about 9 feet? Sounds about right. One of the larger ones? ZACHARY CHEJANOVSKI, FLORIDA FISH &amp; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION COMMISSION: I'd say this is on average of what you're going to find out there. SUAREZ (voice-over): Experts we spoke to have seen snakes as long as 19 feet, weighing 125 pounds. Oh God. The invasive species of snakes have few natural predators and are known to consume prey as large as alligators. For 10 days this month, hunters on trucks equipped with floodlights drive into the night. Their eyes trained on the flooded grassland for the slightest sign of a snake.",
