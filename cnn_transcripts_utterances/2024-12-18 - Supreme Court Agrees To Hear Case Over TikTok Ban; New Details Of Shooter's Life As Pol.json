If they have access to guns and have some mental health issues that may put them more at a vulnerable stage in their lives. And not to say that people with mental health issues are violent, because we see, most often, they're not. But the people who really need to know about this are the teachers or the parents or the fellow students, so that if they see something, they can say something.

And a clear sense of momentum towards a potential hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.But will there actually be a deal? That is, indeed, the question, at this moment, because we are seeing a number of officials arriving in the Middle East to try and get this deal across the finish line. The latest arrival in the region appears to be the CIA Director Bill Burns, who has been the top U.S. official in these negotiations for months now. He often travels and arrives in the region at critical junctures in the process, and this does, indeed, appear to be one of those critical moments yet again, following visits by the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, last week. President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, also in the region. And of course, we've seen an Israeli delegation, Hamas delegation in both Cairo, as well as in Doha, Qatar. And accompanying this flurry of diplomatic activity, you also have the rhetoric. We've heard optimism from the Americans, from the Israelis, from all sides, really, saying that they believe that we are closer than ever to a deal. Hamas also joining that optimistic rhetoric yesterday in a statement saying that they believe a deal is, quote, \"possible.\" A Hamas source also saying that the state of talks is, quote, \"positive and optimistic.\" But they are also offering a note of caution as so many others involved in the process are, as well. Hamas saying that a deal is possible as long as Israel does not continue to make additional last- minute demands in this process. [13:45:01] And all sides are really urging caution, even as they are sounding an optimistic note, because we have seen so many times before, these two sides get very, very close to a potential agreement, but ultimately a deal not falling through. But officials in the region believe that conditions are now at their ripest for an agreement to actually take place. And there's no question that it is very much needed. As we are watching in Gaza over the last 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 38 people have been killed, more than 200 have been injured. And of course, the humanitarian conditions in Gaza certainly not improving. Much needed aid would get in if a ceasefire were to go in place. And then, of course, there are those 100 hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, about half of whom Israel believes are still alive. Their fate, of course, also hanging in the balance.

She's a professor of behavioral neuroscience at the University of Richmond. And the author of the book \"The Lab Rat Chronicles, A Neuroscientist Reveals Life Lessons from the Planet's Most Successful Mammals.\" Dr. Lambert, thank you so much for being with us. You started this research several years ago, and you found that the rats enjoy driving. How can you tell? KELLY LAMBERT, PROFESSOR OF BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND &amp; AUTHOR: That's a good question. Yes, our original work, we showed that that animals or rats that we're in enriched environments learned to drive more readily. But more often, more recently, we were -- I was intrigued by watching the rats, and they seemed to be excited with their rat behavior about approaching the car. They would just jump in the car. And we recently gave them a preference test. They could walk to the Fruit Loop tree -- and our rats love Fruit Loops. That's the currency of our lab. Or they could take a longer path and drive to the Fruit Loop tree. And more of them consistently went out of their way, walked to the car, or ran to the car, and then drove. So they took this longer path to the Fruit Loops tree. So they're showing us with their behavior as they approach and take the long road so that they can actually drive. So it suggests that they do prefer to do this, and they do enjoy it.",

And we saw this driving task as a complex task or skill that they would acquire.And we were interested in how far we could push the rat behavior. They teach me something every day. They're very clever, surviving animals. And so we want -- we're interested in how the brain changes through this. And also how training, just learning a new task changes our stress and coping. And we've seen that going through the training process itself changes the stress hormone profiles. But more recently, noticing that the rats seemed to enjoy this behavior, we're looking more systematically at the role of positive emotions and using a different paradigm in the lab to look at this. I have introduced the term, \"behavior-ceuticals,\" about how we can change our neurochemistry and neurophysiology through behavior, intentional behavior. And so we're interested in how positive emotions, extending our anticipation, changes or sculpts the brain in beneficial ways. So the rats are kind of driving our research in different directions.",
