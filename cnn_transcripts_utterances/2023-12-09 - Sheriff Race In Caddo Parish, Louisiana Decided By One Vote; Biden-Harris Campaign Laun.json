      "sentences": "Well, first of all, it is refreshing that a political campaign's outreach to young black men is about something other than prison and policing. The Biden-Harris campaign launched a new ad focused on black men and the economy. But a new poll shows that more than any other group young black voters are less certain they'll vote in November than they were this time four years ago. So today, why? Two insiders tell us what works to turn that around. Plus white candidate in Louisiana who won by a single vote to be Caddo Parish's first Black sheriff will have to run again after a Judge voided his victory. That candidate Henry Whitehorn is with us and civil rights leader Dr. Benjamin Chavis joins us to explain why he supports the delay in banning menthol cigarettes despite the health concerns, his warning about political backlash from black voters. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show.We begin this morning with the new appeal from the Biden-Harris campaign aimed at young black men. A new CNN poll shows Biden's approval rating is 72 percent among Democrats, 63 percent among self- described Liberals, but only 47 percent of Black Americans approve of his job performance. Black voters in several polls say Biden's key economic policies have not helped them. Now this new ad airing in battleground states looks to flip that narrative. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "My community is usually last on the list and receive any type of funding. When Joe Biden started passing laws like the Infrastructure Plan and Inflation Reduction Act that was really huge for us. The policies and things that he puts in place are striving to make a difference for things that matter, how to put food on the table for our kids and our families, how to get the next job, how to skill up. Joe Biden is actually doing stuff that helps everyday people. President Joe Biden's got our backs because he's not only thing about our President but also our future.(END VIDEOTAPE) BLACKWELL: Is that message an effective one? Let's talk about this now with Cameron Trimble. He was the Biden-Harris campaign's Director of African-American paid media in 2020. And Tharon Johnson is a strategist and former South Regional Director for the 2012 Obama-Biden campaign. Gentlemen, you are the right people with whom to have this conversation. Thank you for being with me. And Theron, I want to start with you with just the numbers and as it relates to young Black people and the intention to vote. The latest Harvard Institute of Politics poll shows that there's been a big drop off in those who have intentions to vote. In fall of 2019, it was 50 percent who said they will definitely vote. That's now down to 38 percent. If -- if the Biden team starts at a 12- point deficit, should this have started focusing on young black voters, young black men earlier? THARON JOHNSON, FMR. SOUTH REGIONAL DIRECTOR, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN: Well, the -- if you look going on at the Biden-Harris administration, if you look at the policies, they have been focused directly on people of color, particularly young black men and Hispanic men and women as well. But the thing that is really encouraging to me, Victor, is that this is an unprecedented investment of $25 million, and very early on in a campaign with little less than a year out to specifically focus on this constituency group. And so while the numbers are still early, I think those numbers will get better. Polling this early really doesn't necessarily dictate what the outcome would be. But I know that if you look at the Biden record of success, particularly around the economy, encouraging black men to basically give them the resources they need to provide for their families, the good things that they've done around public safety, but also embracing entrepreneurship. I mean, if you look at the level of small businesses, unprecedented numbers of record high of new small businesses that have been created by Black and Latino-led businesses, I think that is something that is going to really resonate with these voters. But look, I believe this. Even if these polls that you just quoted Victor wasn't out, the Biden- Harris campaign was going to make this investment anyway. But the one thing that we can't leave this show and not sort of highlight is that how early it is, and it's in key battleground states that's going to be a part of that Biden winning coalition.",

However, when the independents, Cornel West and RFK, Jr. are added, even Joe Manchin, who's not in the race, that league is cut by a third down to 16. So winning the youth vote is not enough.

But the one consistent thing that we've seen within the Democratic Party is that young voters are an essential part of their success. And so those numbers you just quoted, I believe that Joe Biden will basically get back to those numbers and possibly exceed them because right now, we're not in sort of a head- to-head race between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and whoever the Republican Presidential nominee and vice president nominee will be.However, Victor, the independence, it gives the voters an opportunity to look at a another candidate. Now would those independents be able to make the ballot and will they be on the ballot in November of next year? Maybe, maybe not. But ultimately, I believe that once it sort of becomes a head-to-head match-up between President Joe Biden and whoever the Republican nominee will be a possibly a third party candidates or independent, I think the voters will basically pay more attention to those candidates.

And the truth is, is there are structural barriers that make it more difficult for our communities to vote.Unfortunately, because of the poor roads, lack of infrastructure, such as lack of residential addresses, the lack of mail delivery directly to homes. But Native Americans have just more difficulty getting to the polls. And those polls, unfortunately, are often located off- reservation. And Native Americans have to travel to get to those polling locations and registration opportunities in a lot of instances. And that travel isn't small. I think it would be surprising to most Americans that Native Americans sometimes have to travel upwards of 50 miles to get to a polling place, to get to a registration opportunity. Anytime you have to travel those distances, it costs a lot of money. And so you'd have to take a car if you have one. You have to travel poor roads in the wintertime. And you have to have a vehicle that can traverse those distances. And unfortunately, across Indian country, we have of abject poverty that makes it more difficult to vote.

A bipartisan group of more than 70 lawmakers is demanding the removal or resignation of the presidents of some of the country's top universities. The presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT have been under intense scrutiny since a congressional hearing, where they said that calls for genocide of Jewish people did not explicitly violate rules against harassment and bullying.

Origins of the African diaspora, freedom, enslavement and resistance, the practice of freedom and movements and debates. Now, high school as well.

This implicit bias does not come as a surprise to some people. But to those who have are new to this. Explain what you've learned about the different ways that whites and minorities in this country say that they experience healthcare differently.",

      "sentences": "So overall, I think the survey findings really highlight how persistent and prevalent racism and discrimination remain in the U.S. today, and how those experiences extend into health care affecting people's experiences, seeking health care, as well as ultimately their health and wellbeing.As you mentioned, our survey findings, highlight how experiences with racism begin to affect people's experiences, even before they get to the doctor's office with them taking steps to prepare for these visits, concerned about facing insults from a broader or office staff, and also being extra careful about their appearance in order to be treated fairly. But even when folks get into the health care doctor's office, we see them take being treated unfairly, more frequently due to their race and ethnicity, and also saying that they have more certain negative experiences in the doctor's office because of their race and ethnicity. So things like a health care provider not taking their concerns seriously not answering a question or responding to a request, blaming them for a health issue, or not prescribing pain medication that they thought they needed.",

      "sentences": "You know, what's interesting, I found in this survey is that the minority respondents didn't think that it would be any better if the health care providers shared their race or ethnicity. So this is not a white provider, black patient. It is the medical services industry. It is the medical profession. And the patient as it relates to minorities. Explain that a bit more.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, even though survey respondents said that they didn't think they would get better care if they had a health care provider who looked like them. What we actually see in the survey findings is that when adults of color, have more visits with a health care provider who shares their racial and ethnic background, they report having more frequent positive, respectful interactions with their health care provider.So the survey findings actually do point to some potential opportunities and benefits from increasing efforts to improve the diversity of the healthcare workforce. But we also see that the survey findings are pointing wildly to the importance of continued training and education programs to root out the bias and discrimination that are reflected in the survey.",
