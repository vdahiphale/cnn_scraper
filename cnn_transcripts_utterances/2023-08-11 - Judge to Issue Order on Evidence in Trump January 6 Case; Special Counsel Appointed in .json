      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, as you say, Merrick Garland just announced this a little less than an hour ago, that David Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware who has been overseeing the investigation into Hunter Biden, had requested special counsel status on Tuesday.And Garland said that he agreed to grant that. So what the special counsel status means is that David Weiss, who is the U.S. attorney for Delaware, will have authority to investigate this case anywhere in the U.S. And that has been an issue in this case because Hunter Biden lives in California. And one of the issues having to do with this investigation is his failure to pay taxes. And his tax preparer was in Washington, D.C. So this gives him broad scope. It also means that David Weiss will put together a report at the end of this investigation, provide it to Garland, and that report is expected to be made public, so there will be more transparency in this investigation, which has been under fire by House Republicans, who have presented testimony from IRS whistle- blowers who have said that they were stopped from pursuing certain investigative leads. Now, this all comes about after Hunter Biden had reached a plea deal with prosecutors, appeared in federal court in Delaware late last month. But that deal fell apart in court real time, with the judge asking a lot of questions about the scope of the deal, where Hunter Biden was expected to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and reach a diversion agreement on a gun possession charge. So, now that is all off the table. And, in a filing with the judge, the prosecutors noted that they said the parties are at an impasse and not in agreement on either a plea agreement or a diversion agreement. They said that they had given Biden's team until today to say where they stood on their negotiations of what they might agree to or not agree to, and that they asked for an extension until Monday, which DOJ was not willing to grant. So, now this deal know is tatters, I guess you could say, and this investigation is continuing. Hunter Biden's lawyers have said that they do expect a fair resolution. They noted in a statement that they think it's hard to see what other offenses could be charged against Hunter Biden outside of the tax charges, because that is what they say that they believe are the only provable offenses that DOJ could bring. But, of course, that's up to the Department of Justice. This investigation has been going on for five years. Prosecutors have looked at everything from foreign lobbying to money laundering charges. They did reach this deal on misdemeanor tax charges and the gun diversion. But now anything is on the table as this investigation continues -- Brianna, Alex.",

You touched on it briefly in terms of his ability to investigate nationwide, but go into a little bit more, if you will, about what powers he will now have as special counsel, as opposed to the U.S. attorney for Delaware?",

But a White House official did tell me that they did not receive a heads-up ahead of Merrick Garland's announcement. Now, this is consistent to what we have seen when the White House deals with the other Justice Department investigations that have been launched, whether it's relating to the classified documents or in this case relating to the president's son, Hunter Biden. But the expected plea deal that Hunter Biden had initially struck with the Department of Justice, the Bidens had really hoped that that would be an opportunity to turn the page from what has really been a very dark chapter of the family's history. But that matter, as Kara pointed out, was put on hold after that plea deal had fell apart in that Wilmington, Delaware, federal courthouse just last month. Now, the Bidens have really taken great lengths to not weigh in on these matters relating to Hunter Biden and his business dealings. Earlier in the summer, when the expected plea deal was announced, the president and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, they telegraphed their support for their son through a statement from a White House spokesperson, saying that they continue to support Hunter Biden and would not be further commenting on this matter. But it's clear that the appointment of the special counsel is not just a new phase for the investigation, but it will also be a new phase for President Biden, who has sustained -- or been facing sustained pressure from Republican lawmakers about his son Hunter's business dealing. There's also the threat up on Capitol Hill about impeachment inquiries into President Biden. So we will see what further reaction we might have from the White House today, who so far has said that they simply did not have any heads-up when it came to this appointment of the special counsel into the president's son.",

And now you have David Weiss in a position of special counsel, where this doesn't end with the plea deal. It's going to keep going, and will be no doubt looking into the foreign dealings of Hunter Biden. Why don't Republicans trust David Weiss?",

But then, in a letter to Lindsey Graham just in July, David Weiss refuted that, saying he never asked to be appointed special counsel in this investigation. So there is a back-and-forth that has been going on for months with House Republicans with David Weiss and his office. This is not a new relationship. And their argument is, they trust the whistle-blowers. They don't trust the Justice Department -- Brianna.",

So it was, I think, an aggressive charge to bring the misdemeanor offenses, but they had settled on that. My guess is, there was some sense from Hunter Biden's attorneys that there would be an agreement that would perhaps cover additional conduct and that he could no longer be prosecuted for other maybe related matters, or at least that may have been part of the negotiations. But if you look at this statement that has come out about him, about the special counsel appointment, what they're saying is, we can investigate other things in other districts and bring potential charges in other districts. So it sounds like at least maybe part of what the pass is, is the fact that they -- maybe Hunter Biden wasn't going to get the coverage for other conduct outside of Delaware that he was looking for. That's what I would suspect is going on here. But, again, it's hard to say until we get more of the facts.",

And, as a former federal prosecutor, I saw many of those kinds of applications, and certainly someone's drug addiction would be factored in and considered as to whether or not a prosecution of that -- of a potential felony charge would be appropriate. A lot of times those, non-prosecutions and deferred prosecutions would be granted in those circumstances. So, it's -- again, it seems to be an aggressive charge, far from the sweetheart deal, I think, that Republicans were making it appear to be. As to the foreign dealings, that's an interesting question, that this investigation has been going on for over four years, five years. One would expect that they would -- if there was a \"there\" there, that the U.S. attorney would know about it. So I'm not sure how much more investigation really needs to be done. If the plea has fallen through, maybe they have evidence of other potential criminal conduct in other districts that they're now looking to explore if the deal -- if truly there can't be a plea here.",

So, if there was evidence that they had accumulated in their four-to- five-year investigation of -- for improper foreign dealings and money laundering, I would have expected that this request to be a special counsel would have come already, would have come before there was any plea.

They say it's important to get this resolved quickly. It's a matter of public importance. And he is accused of essentially interfering with the 2020 election.

Trump has been out there already publicly saying he thinks this should be after the election. That's almost certainly not going to happen. The judge, Chutkan, is going to set a date, and it sounds like she wants things to go quickly.
