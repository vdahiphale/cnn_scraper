That's at least the assessment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier today, as a barrage of missiles rained down upon two key Ukrainian cities just ahead of the one-year anniversary of Putin's brutal invasion. In Kramatorsk in the east, CNN crews were on the ground when two missiles hit a neighborhood this morning. Local officials say at least five people were hurt and the damage to buildings included a children's clinic and a school. Ukraine says that the missiles used by the Russians are typically used to target aircraft. Dozens of search and rescue workers were already in the neighborhood, because they were searching through the rubble of a nearby apartment building struck by Russian missiles last night. That attack killed at least three people. And in the southern city of Kherson in Ukraine, local residents were woken up by explosions from Russian shelling that killed at least two civilians. A total death toll for the war so far, nearly one full year in remains illusive, but is thought to be in the tens of thousands. CNN's Sam Kiley just returned from Kherson. He joins us now live from nearby Mykolaiv. And, Sam, you describe Kherson as deserted, as desperate. Tell us, how bad is it on the ground there?",

And the reason for this is really rather straightforward.When in November the Ukrainians were able to liberate Kherson from the Russian occupiers, Russians pulled back across the Dnipro river, stopped their guns, turned them around and began bombarding Kherson. That's a bombardment that's been really increasing a pace, particularly this year. They captured -- recaptured the city the Ukrainians in mid-November, they're now talking about 70 rounds a day, from an assortment of direct fire from tanks from mortars, from GRAD multiple launch rocket systems, bombarding the city, pretty much through the day. Now, we were there on the ground for several hours. We lost count, frankly, of how many detonations we heard. There were outgoing destinations from the Ukrainians who were shooting back. But the only people we really came across were the desperate, the poor, the people who were too poor to leave, Jake, who can't find accommodations or can't find jobs to sustain themselves if they can, and many of them had come to the center of the town to seek help from the administration. I met one elderly man who actually tore a plastic sheet off of municipal building that had been hit four days ago, in fact, the municipal headquarters, to take it home to patch up his windows and he's got line of sight to the Russians. His neighborhood, he says, gets hit all day every day, Jake.",

The Biden administration -- and look, I agree with what they're doing, especially not committing -- not committing U.S. forces, but when the Ukrainians make requests to do something, it takes months and usually the bipartisan pressure from the U.S. Senate in particular, think about it, whether it's Patriots, whether it's HIMARS, whether it's tanks, now F-16s, the pattern is the same. It takes forever. We put pressure on them, they finally relent. And a couple days ago, it looked like they were going to do something in terms of making a commitment on F-16s at the pentagon, the president came out of nowhere, said, we're not going to do that.

This past summer, I followed up with the letter to General Milley on the need for F-16s for these pilots. They can fly these after some training. They've shown the capability to do really good flying missions with their MiGs, but they want something more advanced.And as I mention, it looked like the Pentagon was moving that way, you know, I have my sources there, and I think it makes sense. And then all of a sudden, we get to this idea that the Biden administration keeps raising it's going to be somehow escalatory. And I think we get into this point where we're self-deterring ourselves. It's not going to be escalatory to get the Ukrainians the weapon systems they need. And right now, I think there's a good argument to get them F-16s or help our NATO allies like Poland get them F-16s and sign off on that. But again, this is a pattern that's literally happened with every single advanced weapon systems, they end up getting it. By the way, as you know, it's bipartisan pressure that we keep putting on the administration, but it just takes too long. We're losing months in this battle and the Ukrainians don't have months.",

Donald Trump was getting ready to leave the presidency and they were considering, do we now charge him on this hush money scheme?I have the reporting in this book of exactly what happened behind closed doors. There was some contentious, high stakes, heated debate within the Southern District of New York. Of course, we know the outcome. They did not indict him, but I found it really interesting to learn the reasons why. Some of that reason was political. One of the people told me, I'm paraphrasing here, he said, we were well aware of the prudential concerns of indicting a former president. When it comes to the evidence, generally speaking, the feds across the street from the Manhattan D.A. did think there was enough evidence to support and indictment it was a close call, but when it comes to some of the witnesses that we just talked about, who are now going across the state to the state grand jury, there are questions, including this Jeffrey McConney. Some of the prosecutors felt he was marginally credible, and others thought there were real problems. So, we'll see if the D.A. perhaps reaches a different conclusion about their credibility, and if so, maybe there will be a different outcome.",

A deadly crackdown crushed anti-coup protests, forcing the opposition underground, and into the jungle.
