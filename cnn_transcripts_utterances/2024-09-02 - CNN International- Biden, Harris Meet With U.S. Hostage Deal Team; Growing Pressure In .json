That's after the Israeli military, over the weekend, discovered the bodies of those six hostages killed in Gaza. You're seeing on your screen here. Their deaths are also putting Gaza ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowing to keep trying to reach a deal with Hamas. The Biden administration, meantime, is working today in an effort to come to an agreement. U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team. The White House Security Advisor says that the next few days will be quote, \"critical in the push to reach a deal.\" Both Biden and Harris have condemned the killings of the six Israeli hostages, with the President vowing that Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us in Tel Aviv, while we also have Arlette Saenz, who is covering the developments in Washington. But, Jeremy, let me start with you, and talk to us a little bit about the situation on the ground there with the strike. What's the latest?",

And we did have an Israeli official telling us that the Israeli Prime Minister is worried about these ongoing demonstrations in the streets. But, in a cabinet meeting today, it appears that the Israeli Prime Minister is simply doubling down on his previous strategy, insisting that Israel must continue to maintain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, that there will not be a deal if Hamas continues to insist that Israeli troops withdraw from that critical stretch of land between Gaza and Egypt.And now, as President Biden appears to be saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure a deal, I just spoke with a senior Israeli source who said this, that it is, quote, \"remarkable that President Biden is trying to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu rather than Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar.\" So clearly, the Israelis feel that pressure should be brought to bear on Hamas and not on the Israeli Prime Minister. But, I can tell you that there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Israelis who disagree and who believe that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on the Israeli Prime Minister himself.",

It comes as there has been a real sense of urgency relating to these talks on a ceasefire and hostage agreement in the wake of the recovery of those bodies of six hostages who were killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza.Now, the officials across the board in the U.S. have been working for weeks now, very closely, with their counterparts in Qatar and Egypt, trying to secure some type of framework that could potentially bridge the gaps in the differences between the two sides. Now, it comes at a time when there has been, as Jeremy is noting, significant pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get this deal across the finish line. For the President's part, he has really been reluctant to publicly pressure Netanyahu, instead trying to exert that pressure privately. But, this morning, he was very blunt when he asked about Netanyahu's role in this moment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His brother-in-law spoke to CNN about the latest developments and what he says needs to happen now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOSHE LAVI, OMRI MIRAN'S BROTHER-IN-LAW: These six sausages who were murdered alongside many others who were murdered earlier in this war for the past 11 months could have been saved if we prioritized the sanctification of life, if we chose the path of a viable deal to bring them home. I don't know if the deal would have succeeded. Hamas is not a good faith partner to any negotiated treaty. It's a terrorist organization that needs to be destroyed, both materially and ideologically, just like the Nazis were destroyed and just like other vicious ideologies were destroyed in the past. But, we need to prioritize the hostages now, and we already achieved so many military achievements in dismantling the Hamas military capabilities. So, what we want to see is that we prioritize them, because when we saw Omri last in a psychological warfare video showcased by Hamas in late April, it gave us hope that we can still bring him home. It's now more than four months later, Hersh Polin Goldberg was also filmed in a similar video in late April. He -- his life were terminated. He was murdered by Hamas. This could happen to my brother-in-law, Omri. This could happen to the rest of 101 hostages, those who are still alive. We need to prioritize them over (ph) other objectives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kylie, what's been the reaction from the State Department to the events this weekend? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, we haven't heard anything formally from the Secretary of State, but what we have heard from U.S. officials in the Biden administration, as you are hearing from Arlette, is that this really adds new urgency to their efforts to try and secure a deal to get home the rest of the hostages that are being held by Hamas. Of course, this devastating news, the death of six hostages over the weekend, murdered by Hamas, does really demonstrate the reality of just how tenuous and how dangerous this situation is for the rest of the hostages that are still being held. Their death is really something that officials are concerned about, particularly because what happened over the weekend. And so, when you talk to U.S. officials, they say a few things. First of all, of course, there are questions about how serious Hamas is when it comes to these ongoing negotiations to try and secure a deal if they were going to go ahead and murder these six hostages over the weekend, but they also say that this does add, one, new urgency, and, number two, new pressure to Israel to secure a deal, and specifically to Prime Minister Netanyahu personally to secure a deal, because we have seen those protests now erupting across Israel to put pressure on him to come to a deal, to bring home the rest of those hostages, 101 of them in total, about 68 of them expected, believed to still be alive.",

On this Labor Day, the President will join Harris in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as they work to appeal to working class voters. Biden has made no secret how important Pennsylvania will be this November. He narrowly beat Trump in that battleground state in 2020 by less than two percentage points.Let's get a closer look now at the campaign trails. Joining us now from Washington is our Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak. So, Kevin, how much can we expect to see Biden now on the campaign trail for Harris? KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, we'll see him a fair amount. That's at least according to what his aides are predicting. Of course, it will all depend on what Harris herself thinks will be useful in those weeks heading up until Election Day. But, it is kind of a new role for President Biden, no longer the candidate, now acting as something of a validator in chief for his Vice President. And what you're seeing him do today is kind of the start of a strategy that his team has been sketching out over the last couple of weeks or so, as they look ahead to the final months of his presidency. And what he is doing today really does kind of embody that strategy. He will be in Pittsburgh for Labor Day. You really can't imagine more of a Joe Biden-type event. He has been in Pittsburgh for several labor days over the course of his career, really trying to appeal to union workers who Democrats believe can be a mobilizing force in the election. And it does speak to this strategy of campaigning very heavily in the so-called blue wall states, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And in fact, President Biden will be in all three of those states over the course of this week. But, it has been interesting, in the weeks or so since the President decided to drop his presidential bid, he has actually seen his approval rating tick up slightly, and I think both he and Kamala Harris campaign very much want to capitalize on whatever political capital remains for President Biden and they do view that among blue collar workers, particularly in those blue wall states. But, of course, this does launch the final sprint toward Election Day. The Kamala Harris campaign did get some good news over the weekend. A national poll showed her with a slight lead, at least among likely voters. But, when you talk to campaign officials, they still view themselves very much as the underdogs in the race. In fact, a memo from her campaign Chairwoman Jen O'Malley Dillon said that they were the clear underdogs because Donald Trump still has a motivated base of support. So, very clearly trying to guard against any kind of overconfidence within the Democratic Party as they look ahead both to the debate on September 10 and to this final sprint towards Election Day.",

He has no clue what that entails or what that means, but he kind of gave it away, right, in complete contravention to all Republican orthodoxy for the last number of decades about government giveaways. Suddenly, he is OK with government paying for that, but he is not OK with government helping people have more affordable housing, which is a massive crisis in this country.And look, to Kamala Harris' credit, she is at least addressing the issue. Trump, of course, is known very well, going back to when his father was still around, for trying to prevent black residents from moving into his developments in Queens and Brooklyn.

But, get this, in swing states, that number actually jumps to one in five, and that you're seeing this shift to unions among younger people. You think about Starbucks, for example, and some of the efforts there.

They haven't succeeded, and we continue to press our advantage.Now, all things can't be true at the same time. It is true that the Kursk incursion has not drawn as much Russian military reinforcements or activity that the Ukrainians had hoped. Russians are still using some of their battle hardened troops to press that advantage in the Donetsk. It's believed that what Putin wants, within short order, is to solidify his occupation and his seizure of as much, if not all, of the Donbas region, or at least the Donetsk region. And this is what they're trying to do. And so, they have actually been -- they've been pressing this for a while, but they have stepped it up for a bit. And I think the Ukrainians, from what we can determine from talking to military types and to those who are in touch with military types, I think they believe that Pokrovsk might in fact fall. They are retreating. But, they say that they did get a victory in Kursk, and they are not going to give up, and they are not going to be bullied into any kind of surrender or unconditional capitulation. Basically, this is going to go on, and that is what we can see from both sides, despite the enormous pain and the death and destruction that's been going on now for 30 months.",

That number is six percent bigger than this time last year. It really fits into the theme that this has been a huge summer for air travel, the biggest ever. We're talking a quarter billion people passed through TSA checkpoints nationwide since Memorial Day.The numbers for today will not come out until tomorrow, but the TSA is anticipating a pretty big number, about 2.6 million people flying today. The good news is, most of the cancelations and delays have remained relatively low. They really peaked on Thursday, when bad weather hit the Mid-Atlantic.

They are all being impacted. So far, hotels are still open. They're operating, but they're having to do so with fewer resources. They're having to cut back on some services, and they are operating with smaller staffs. What are these working -- workers asking for on this Labor Day? Supposedly a day where we celebrate the contributions of workers and the labor movement. They say they want better wages. They want better working conditions. And specifically, they want a restoration of some of the cuts that were made during the pandemic. As you know, the hotel and the travel industry were so severely affected by the pandemic.
