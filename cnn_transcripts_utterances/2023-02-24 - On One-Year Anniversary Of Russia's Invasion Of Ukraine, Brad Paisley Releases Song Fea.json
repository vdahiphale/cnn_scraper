And one thing led to another. And he's -- President Zelenskyy is very smart about how to reach people. He saw this as an opportunity, I think, to go straight for the heart and basically say through a melody and a song that we're all the same. And that was the point I was trying to make, is that these people fighting for freedom and showing us in so many ways what it looks like to really crave the things that we take for granted over here.

They're just saying, heck, no, probably another word they use, but that this is just not going to happen.
