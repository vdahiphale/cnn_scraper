More leverage, more say in the legislative process, to try to get some commitments on how to cut domestic discretionary spending.

KELLY ARMSTRONG (R-ND): I think it's been the same way he's shown his leadership style over the last four years I've been in Congress. Late last night when there were different groups organizing and meeting and trying to come to terms, Speaker-elect McCarthy wasn't even there. He trusted people on both sides of the aisle to sit around the table, do it as long as it takes and come to a conclusion and it shows that there are a lot of people, even people who some of my constituents disagree with on both sides of this issue that are really negotiating in good faith for what they think will make this place run better.",

Ultimately he said the deal was inked after he saw the details on paper. He said he was comfortable with it and decided to move forward. He just told a group of us just now that they plan to lobby and discuss and try to convince some of the members who may be hesitant to support this right now. Now, also one very important thing he said that was part of the deal is dealing with raising the national debt limit. He just told a group of us that they addressed this issue. This is going to be a major, major flash point in the new Congress. They have to avoid a debt default. And that's going to happen sometime this year, maybe in the middle part of this year. He said there's some agreement on how to deal with. One thing he said they would not agree to a clean debt ceiling increase, meaning they need some conditions tied to avoid a national debt default which has never happened in American history so that is going to be a huge fight going forward. But from what Scott Perry just told a group of us that was part of this deal that has not yet been publicly released but apparently was reached between a handful of these holdouts and Kevin McCarthy. So this deal not just process, giving them more leverage over the speaker, being able to oust a sitting speaker with one individual doing that, having more members of those hard-right Freedom Caucus on some of the key committees, but policy implications as well in dealing with the national debt ceiling. Big significant issue going forward but for McCarthy right now on the floor they're counting the votes right now. The clerks are making sure that the tally is correct. He's likely going to fall short here but they feel clear momentum. They think they can get there maybe not today but very close, maybe in the next coming days they believe that McCarthy will soon become speaker of the House.",
