He arrived there this afternoon, part of an urgent effort to finalize a ceasefire deal for Gaza.Blinken also met with Egyptian officials today, trying to gauge Hamas's interest after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a U.S.-backed bridging proposal on Monday. Blinken says this could be the last chance to strike a deal, and all Hamas has to do is say yes. Negotiations could resume sometime this week. Let's go live to Tel Aviv with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. And Jeremy, Secretary Blinken is in Doha right now. What's the latest you're hearing on negotiations?",

Thank you so much for the update.All eyes will be on what comes of these negotiations, especially in Gaza, where reports indicate more than 40,000 people have been killed in this conflict. Let's get the view from Gaza right now. Joining us live is the founder and president of the International Network for Aid, Relief, and Assistance, former CNN senior international correspondent, Arwa Damon, is live there. Arwa, what are you seeing on the ground where you are?",

      "sentences": "It's a complete disaster. I mean, how do you describe scenes that look like something from an apocalyptic Hollywood zombie movie, only the scenery is not desolate. It is jam-packed with people trying to live on the rubble, on top of the rubble. There's no sanitation. There's no hygiene. There's no nothing.And you really get a sense of just how bad it is when you go and visit some of these hospitals, because things that are very basic, like bandages, are not available. And what this means is, for example, when I went to the Al-Aqsa hospital ICU, a 13-year-old boy with 50 to 60 percent burns on his body ended up having a blood infection and early signs of sepsis because there weren't enough bandages to give him the frequent cleaning and bandage changes that he needs. What this means is a little girl also in the Al-Aqsa ICU hospital, she's a year and a half, she is not stable enough to be moved to another location for surgery that she desperately needs. The reason why she's not stable is this tracheotomy tube for pediatrics, so in her size, is not available. This tube is like a tiny piece of plastic. They don't have it. And this little girl, when she wakes up, is going to find out that she's been orphaned. Her siblings and her parents are dead. Earlier today, I went down to a Nasser hospital. They are also in desperate need of basic things, but also stuff that, I mean, you don't even think about, because they don't have paper, like paper to write notes on, to fill out the patient charts, to write prescriptions on. I mean, when you talk about nothing being available, it's really nothing being available. And people are trying to come up with all of these innovative ways to, you know, utilize what little it is that they do have. But I mean, it's absurd. The situation feels absurd. And if it weren't so dire and dark and deadly, I mean, it's almost comedic.",
