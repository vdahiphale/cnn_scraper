The Federal Court of Appeal said it's like walking the plank. There are thousands of cases, documented cases of rape, torture, persecution, even death. I mean, this is horrific what's happening.

Also including a White House official, her boss who was burning documents in his fireplace during a very sensitive time in the final days of the Trump administration. We'll talk to a former colleague of hers who resigned the day of the Capitol attack. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

      "sentences": "This morning, we're getting new insight into what happened during the final days inside the Trump White House. Former aide Cassidy Hutchinson says that she witnessed her boss, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, burned documents in his fireplace in his office around a dozen times between December 2020 and mid-January 2021 when Trump actually left office.Hutchinson told the committee, throughout the day, he would put more logs in the fireplace to keep it burning. And I recall roughly a dozen times where he would throw a few more pieces of paper in with it. In that same time period, Hutchinson said that Meadows instructed White House aides to keep some Oval Office meetings close hold in the period after the election, potentially leaving those meetings off the books according to one of the transcripts that was released yesterday. So, joining us now for perspective on this is the former Deputy White House Press Secretary under President Trump, Sarah Matthews. Sarah, we should note, you resigned after what happened on January 6. And I just wonder, are you surprised at all to her hear what your former colleague testified about Mark Meadows burning documents in his office?",
