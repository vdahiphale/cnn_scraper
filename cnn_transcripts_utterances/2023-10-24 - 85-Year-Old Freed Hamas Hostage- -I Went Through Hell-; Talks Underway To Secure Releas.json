That's how one of the two elderly hostages released by Hamas describes what she endured after being kidnapped and held in tunnels inside Gaza for two weeks. Yocheved Lifshitz wants the world to know about the brutal assault, how she was held underground and the surprising level of care, she said she received from the same terrorist group responsible for the barbaric slaughter of countless people in Israel.Her story, no doubt stirring a slew of mixed emotions for families of the more than 200 hostages still believed to be inside Gaza, after being violently snatched from their homes on a day that was both the Jewish Sabbath and a Jewish holiday. Sources tell CNN that the timing of a ground invasion remains fluid as talks continue to get more hostages out. Here is what the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said just moments ago about the families of hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And while we have seen two Americans released initially, and then these two Israeli elderly women who were released yesterday.What the U.S. and Israel are now pursuing is something on a much bigger scale. They are pursuing the release of a large number of hostages simultaneously. But these are very, very complex negotiations. And as of yet, it's not clear whether or not these talks will actually succeed in resulting in the release of additional hostages. These talks involve not only the U.S. and Israel, but also the key intermediaries with Hamas, and that is the country of Qatar, as well as the Egyptian governments which are key to this deal. And the hope is to try and reach for a big group of hostages all at once. But there are a number of complex factors involved in this, namely, Hamas has been calling for a ceasefire to release these hostages. The Israeli government has been quite clear that they will not agree to a ceasefire at this time. And the Hamas has also been calling for fuel to enter Gaza. Now on that front, what we have seen is some movement on that front in the last several hours with the IDF chief of staff saying, that they will now allow fuel in places needed to treat civilians inside of Gaza, but that they will ensure that that fuel will not be able to reach a Hamas. Now that is a major, major shift in position from the Israeli government, from the Israeli military, which up until now has been adamant that it will not allow fuel inside of Gaza, even as it has begun to allow some other humanitarian needs like water and food into this coastal enclave. Now, what's clear is that as these talks go on, President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, they have remained in close communication speaking by phone as recently as last night.",

The ability to really focus on targeting the right kinds of cells, how to avoid as much as possible civilians on the battlefield.

When you don't have a government that ensures water or electricity or sewage or care for the people with healthcare. Things break down and you lose the trust of the people.So, when Israel goes in to strikes targeted spells, it's very difficult to say, you not only have to defeat the enemy, but then you have to give the civilian population something to look forward to and that's not part of the plan right now.",

Now they would put that test to the members and say, all right, well 270 members actually vote for Tom Emmer, test that proposition here. How many defects will be a huge question for Emmer.

And the hard part is making sure that you can -- you lose that you're able to get the vast majority of the Republican conference on board. And I think one thing that we should really focus in on -- be focusing on for the next several days is the Trump factor. I mean, Trump has made it clear, and his allies have made it clear that this is not a guy that he wants. I thought it was really interesting how he -- how the former president got really involved over the weekend, calling the several different speaker candidates, because he knows that if he wants to be president, if he is the president, you know, in some fashion in January 2025, he's going to want a close relationship with the guy who leads the House Republican conference, and he doesn't have that with Emmer as of yet.",
