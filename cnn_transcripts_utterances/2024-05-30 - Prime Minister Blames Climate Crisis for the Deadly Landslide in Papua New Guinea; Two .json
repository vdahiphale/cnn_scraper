A 14-kilometer buffer zone along the border between Egypt and Gaza. Israel says it has found 20 tunnels that crossed into Egypt, which Hamas has been using to smuggle weapons into Gaza. The IDF says it now has operational control of the area.Video released by the IDF shows what it says are rocket launchers and other terrorist infrastructure. Egypt denies the tunnels exist. More now from CNN's Jeremy Diamond. And a warning his report contains graphic video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On a hilltop in western refer Israeli tanks overlooked Gaza's border with Egypt, the Israeli military's latest prize. Three weeks into its Rafah offensive, Israel says it now controls the strategic Philadelphi Corridor, spending the length of that 7-1/2-mile-long border which the Israeli military says Hamas has used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt denies these tunnels exists. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (through translator): The Philadelphi Corridor served as Hamas' oxygen pipeline through which Hamas regularly smuggled weapons into the Gaza Strip. So far, our forces have located about 20 tunnels in the Philadelphi Corridor area. We investigate these tunnels and neutralize them. DIAMOND (voiceover): This is the human toll of that military offensive. United Nation says more than 940,000 people have been forced to flee the city in recent weeks. For many, this is not the first time. There is no safety. Al-Mawasi is hit, the U.N. warehouses are hit. The U.N. schools are hit. There is no safety, Taisi Ralja (ph) says. You might die at any moment anywhere. Multiple Israeli strikes on camps for displaced Palestinians in recent days have made that point with deadly clarity, none more so than this strike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night, which killed at least 45 people and injured hundreds more according to Gaza as Ministry of Health. The Israeli military has said it did not expect civilians to die and has launched an investigation into the strike which killed two senior Hamas militants. But at least three people can be seen on the road outside those structures moments before the strike. The Israeli military targeted these two-container like structures just steps away from structures housing displaced civilians, which were also destroyed in the blasts or the subsequent fire. Four weapons experts tell CNN the weapons used in the strike where U.S.-made bombs. They say these remnants found at the site of the attack are pieces of a GBU 39 small diameter bomb. Carrying a relatively small payload intended to minimize civilian casualties. But dropping them in densely populated areas can still have devastating consequences.",

And we want them to keep deliberating because we want them to be able to reach a unanimous verdict, whether it's for conviction or acquittal.
