Well, in just nine hours, a sitting U.S. President and a former will square off for the first time in modern history, in what could be a pivotal moment in U.S. history. And it's all happening here on CNN. The stakes are incredibly high and the stage is set. There, you see it for tonight's debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Here's a look at the debate studio at CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. The podiums will be eight feet apart, and the two candidates will speak directly to the American people without a live audience in the studio. Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will question them on key issues. And microphones will be turned on only when it's each candidate's turn to speak. It was just a little less than four years ago when the two came face to face last time. Both candidates are under extreme pressure tonight. The 90 minute encounter will test their vulnerabilities, questions about their temperament and, of course, the issue of age. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL TYLER, PRES. BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Joe Biden's 81 years old. Donald Trump is 78 years old. What the debate will be is a contrast in the age of their ideas. Everything that Joe Biden is going to talk about is how we take this country forward. How we continue to bring people together to find solutions to improve people's lives. Everything Donald Trump is going to be talking about is about how we take this country backwards. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nobody around the world --no leader around the world is sitting there getting a vote on this. But there can be impacts and implications for them. And the last time these two debated and the last time Donald Trump was sitting in the presidency, the world's moved on a lot. So, there will be a lot to tune into here. Not least of all, we know President Biden is likely to face questions about his policy on Gaza. That affects some of his domestic voters. But what Donald Trump may have to say about the Gaza conflict will be of extreme interest in the region. I mean, primarily for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Does he feel that he really has that same strong relationship, that friendly relationship he had before? Can he kind of play out his own policies in Gaza at the moment and wait until the November election? But it will also resonate, for example, with the Saudis, who Trump was also close with. Remembering when he became President, that was the first stop of his on his international visits during his presidency. It's important to him because he wanted to sort of expand the Abraham Accords there. But if what Donald Trump has to say about Gaza doesn't sit well with the Saudis, remembering they are sort of what the White House at the moment is presenting as part of the day-after solution in Gaza and they are saying that they need to see an irreversible path to a two-state solution, a Palestinian state. If Trump says that's not on the cards for him, well, they're going to be watching closely. And then, of course, there's Ukraine. I mean, not just President Zelenskyy watching to see what Donald Trump may have to say about funding for Ukraine, but the whole of the 32-member NATO nations looking on, as well, and what he has to say about his relationship, potentially, with NATO. You will have the European Union countries, much of them the same, watching closely. President Putin, of course, looking very closely. Does he feel he can continue to sort of run, you know, a high-cost military campaign in Russia through to the elections because he thinks he may get to negotiate next year? That could be something that he could envisage under Donald Trump. So, all of these things in play. And, of course, the Chinese listening to what either of them will say about Taiwan, particularly what Trump would say. The Iranians, the same, listening for information about them. And Kim Jong-un in North Korea. But I do think the things that are likely to come up, aren't they, are going to be the war in Gaza and Ukraine. It seems hard to avoid those questions.",

He's too old. He's too old. This has been fed. And look, he does have an old man's gait. He shuffles. And he has a voice that's sometimes a whisper. If he takes that on, the way he did at the State of the Union address, for example, where he debated the Republican Congress in real time off teleprompter, and I thought showed a lot of power and a lot of command and a lot of energy. He's got to show that energy. Interestingly, you didn't ask about Trump, but Trump has the mirror opposite problem. That's why this is going to be such a fascinating debate to watch. Joe, President Biden, has to ramp it up. Mr. Trump needs to tamp it down. He needs to be sedate. He's got the opposite problem with Joe. People worry that Biden is too old and lacks energy. People think Trump is too crazy. He's too wild. He's too unhinged. So, Trump needs to calm everything down. Joe needs to light everything up. And I wish I could be there. I would play in the holding room for Biden. I'd play the J-Lo songs -- \"Let's Get Loud\". And if I was in Trump's holding room, I'd play Roberta Flack, \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\".",

And so, having that line, you know, where, look, Biden, he has got to make this about Trump being in it for himself, I'm in it for you. That, to me, is the winning message for Joe Biden. Donald Trump's in it for himself, I'm in it for you. Now, I'm a Biden guy, so maybe I'm being unfair, but I think a lot of people think Trump might be somewhat self-absorbed. So, I think you're pushing an open door with that. Trump needs to do in real life what that ad does. That ad is terrific, that Trump ad you played, which is, are you better off, right? Is your cost of living better or worse? And the cost of living is worse. So, we'll see if either of those guys can get to the core message that wins the election for them, right?

Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson, who Joe Biden put on the court, wrote a concurrence where she said, this is not a victory for the women of Idaho. It is simply a delay. And that's all this was. They just kicked the can. Look, the Supreme Court is utterly political. They're more political than I am. They know there's an election coming. They know abortion is hurting Trump. So, they didn't want to have another anti-abortion ruling. So, I don't think that. But any discussion of abortion, Joe Biden wins, period. So, if you just run the clock, how many minutes are they talking about abortion? That's how many minutes Biden is winning. I haven't seen Trump do anything to heal his party's problem on abortion. He says, well, states should handle it. Well, 14 states have banned abortion, even in the case of rape. In those 14 states, the Journal of the American Medical Association in January, six months ago, issued a study that said 54,565 women in those states that have banned abortion in the case of rape have gotten pregnant because of rape. Each one a tragedy and each one a traumatic event. And they've had their rights taken away. So, Biden wins any conversation about abortion. And so, I think that the court tried. I think they actually tried to help Trump by kicking the can. But it's not going to help him politically.",

But that deal is off. The Supreme Court saying that that bankruptcy deal, which would have absolved the Sackler family from all further civil lawsuits, that was just not valid. That can no longer go into effect. So, what it means, the Sackler family will now continue to be open to lawsuits from victims and their families. And in addition, that $6 billion settlement that the Sackler family had agreed to likely won't come to fruition. And that means, you know, state governments and also other companies won't get the funds to try to battle addiction. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag there, but it does it does really negatively impact the Sackler family, which was hoping they would be immune from these civil lawsuits, and now they're not.

It's more of a win for the pregnant women in Idaho who no longer have to worry about it, because theSupreme Court here allowing those emergency abortions -- abortions to continue in that state. It's a decision really for now. It stops that Idaho law that was a near total abortion ban. What it doesn't do is definitively decide this issue. If that Idaho law is proper or if, as the Biden administration argued, it improperly conflicts with this federal law that requires doctors in emergency rooms to perform abortions, if that's what's necessary to prevent severe injury to a woman. Conversely, the Idaho law, that's not in effect right now, it doesn't allow abortions unless death is imminent. So, Bianna, this is really an incremental win for women and doctors really only in Idaho who had really voiced how difficult medical care had become in the past few months since the Supreme Court had allowed this Idaho law to go into effect before halting it today. You know, women in the state were regularly in the past few months being airlifted out of the state when they were having problems with their pregnancies and might need an abortion because these doctors in Idaho just said we're not going to open ourselves up to litigation or criminal prosecution by performing abortions, even if this woman we really think needs it. So, you know, the women in Idaho are now benefiting from this. That law will be on hold. But like you said, Bianna, there are numerous other laws in other states that are nearly identical, that have this near total abortion ban in place that this Supreme Court decision doesn't touch. And that's because this this question of whether this federal law preempts the state law, it still continues. It hasn't been settled. And so, there's that big question mark, which, you know, Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson referred to in her opinion, saying we're just kicking the can down the road here.",

What we want to be able to do is make the medical decisions as physicians in that conversation with the patient, in that most sacred space that we need to have to make these decisions. Because when folks come in with these emergencies, decisions need to be made, and they aren't as cut and dry as an Idaho law would have us believe or would try to have folks believe.

President Ruto was elected by a majority of young people who saw themselves in him. He said he was a hustler-in-chief and he understood their plight and two years in they feel disappointed and disillusioned by his administration and especially as President Ruto keeps informing people that we have to tighten our belts, he says, because we inherited a lot of debt, we have to raise revenue and he's instituted austerity measures but people don't feel that he and his government are sticking to that same principle and that's part of the anger you see on the streets.

So,that's just a microcosm of a significant portion of this country that will be watching this debate today. And what's interesting is the issue of the economy. There are a lot of positive things that President Biden can really tout tonight. But on the question of are you better off today than you were four years ago or even longer, at least with these voters that we just heard John King speak to, the answer is no. How much of a bind does this put President Biden in tonight?",

And if Trump goes on to win this election, I think it is going to be that sense among many Americans have lost economic security coming out of the pandemic that will be responsible for it. Rightly or wrongly, there is some nostalgia for the Trump economy before the COVID-19 emergency. And when you talk to voters, Democrats and Republicans, the idea that they go to the grocery store and it costs them $200 as that gentleman was saying there, that is very pervasive and it's very visceral. The President is warning that Donald Trump is a massive threat to democracy. And many people might believe it, but it's also not the first thing that's on their mind. When you go to the grocery store and you're getting less than you used to, that is a very tangible issue. And it's something that while the President, as you say, can talk about, well, job growth is extraordinary. The U.S. has come out of the pandemic better than any other developed country. You can't get that across to voters if they are seeing and feeling with their own eyes that they're not secure and that's a big problem.",

Stephen, it's a bit paradoxical because time and time again, you hear from voters, oh, not these two guys. They poll very low, both of them, in terms of approval and likeability. They are very well-known quantities. It's hard to find someone who says, I don't know who this person is or where they stand on certain positions.

You have President Bidenwarning that Donald Trump is a threat to everything for which America stands in terms of democracy, the rule of law, basic values. He's even spoken about how the former President has seemed to parrot some Nazi-style language in some of his rallies. He sees Trump as an existential threat to the United States. Trump is making a similar argument in many ways to try and defuse that issue. He says that Biden is a big threat to democracy. He's warning that with his support for Ukraine and because of the war in the Middle East that Biden is leading the United States into a third world war. You know, Trump, of course, is a convicted felon after that hush money trial in New York. And he's promised to wage a presidency of personal vengeance, to use the powers of the presidency to target enemies if he's elected. So, while the candidates are not who most voters would prefer, the stakes of this election are higher perhaps than any modern U.S. election. And I think that is why this debate is important for the President, especially. It could be one of the last big moments where he can turn around a re- election campaign that he is in great peril of losing.",
