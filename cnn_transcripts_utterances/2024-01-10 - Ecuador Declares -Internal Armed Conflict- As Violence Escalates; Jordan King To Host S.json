And now is not necessarily the time for Israel's to start talking about a two- state solution when it's still fighting, what happened to the Hamas states in the Gaza Strip and what that state turned into, and the enemy that Israel faced on its southern border, when Hamas had its sovereignty and its rule over Gaza, what it turned Gaza into, and we see these pictures every day, John, the hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under the Gaza Strip, the factories to make long range rockets with the Iranian design, the attacks that are still being carried out against Israeli soldiers there. This is a war that still has to be fought. That's number one.Number two, a two state solution, like I mentioned for Israelis is something that's hard to digest at the moment, because what it entails is withdrawal from territory in the West Bank, or with some Israelis called Judea and Samaria, the hills that overlook Tel Aviv Herzliya, the coastal plain in Israel. They think about Gaza, excuse me, and they think about the precedent and they say, Can we now do this also in the West Bank? Do we want to have rockets now pouring down from to, for instance, to Tel Aviv? And then the third part is you're right, though, there is that possibility for a wider normalization. We heard that from the Saudi ambassador in the UK, we heard enough from Secretary Blinken. It's not something that we should ignore. And we should have a government that should be thinking about the wider possibility here. Unfortunately, like I mentioned before, this government is not going to be the one that's going to get them to make those moves because of the nature and its composition. Netanyahu is kind of stuck between the Americans who want him to move forward, and very right wing members of his coalition who will not let him move an inch in that direction.",

I think that Israel needs to tell the world and also its own people.What is it planning to do in the Gaza Strip in the day after? We don't want to reoccupy Gaza. We pulled out in 2005, with the intention not to have to go back and to give the Palestinians an opportunity to be able to flourish there.

But that will continue. But that will continue masked on top of the gradual but continual increase in global average temperatures, both in the ocean and air temperatures, and with enormous impacts. We're already seeing those this year. And I don't want people to be fatalistic about this, even though we've reached the 1.5 degrees C tipping Point. We can still keep warming below two degrees C beyond which it's catastrophic. And that's what all the sides says. So we can still keep below that limit if governments get to act action, and do their jobs with regulation, enforcement, taxation of carbon and subsidization of alternative, low carbon energy alternatives. Governments know how to do this, but they just have to get the fossil fuel industries out of the way. They pretend to want to collaborate, but that's a facade. They're simply trying to continue to make trillions of dollars off the fossil fuel resources right now, and resist the transition to a sustainable energy economy because they make too much money at it. And many other governments, captured government offices and officers are part and parcel of the problem. So there's way to do this. We can do it. We need to invest in it.

Was it worse?Because, you know, this isn't your first rodeo. You've done war zones before. You spent time in hospitals in Syria. DR. EL KASSEM: I think it is worse than what I had expected, to be honest with you. I mean I've been in Syria, I have in (INAUDIBLE). There has been bombardment even on hospitals. I work in a basement when the building was bombarded. But the intensity of the airstrikes, the highly populated area of Gaza being, you know 4 by 10 kilometers being bombarded on a daily basis with some bombs I'm hearing 1,000 kilograms. I think I have seen way more injuries than what I have seen in Syria, particularly we're talking within three months that's quite intense.",

And now that you're back home, and you have a moment to look back and debrief have you question those decisions at all? You know, flashback to those moments? DR. EL KASSEM: Yes, absolutely. I mean this is probably one of the most difficult decisions that you have to make us a physician and as a surgeon. [01:34:50} Because when we received, you know, for instance in Khan Yunis hospital, the Nasser Hospital we were pretty close from where the fighting apparently is a few hundred meters. Because you hear the bombardment all the time. You hear the tanks, the airstrikes, the drones 24 hours on top of us. But when you get, you know, 15 injuries I was counting seven or eight children. And, then you have to make difficult decisions because you have so limited medical supplies, limited you know, humanitarian staff with you. And we were only six surgeons from U.S. and Canada. So you have to decide. Who is going to probably go to the OR and who is going to be left behind. Although in an ideal situation, probably, we'd be able to save everyone. We would call in Canada, U.S., a second or a third team. But you don't have that kind of luxury, you know.

EL KASSEM: Yes, I mean to start with the health care system was not probably the best because of the siege on Gaza for years, right. And before that there is, you know, an occupation on Gaza, from 1967. But even after that, it never picked up, it never became, you know, an advanced health care system, if you will. But with this war, it was on the verge of collapsing. And 100 percent, it did collapse. I can see that, and even in southern Gaza, with the two major hospitals in Khan Yunis that we have major lack of equipment, of medical supplies, you know, CT Scan machine, and things like that, let alone the lack of drugs, you know, analgesia, antibiotics.
