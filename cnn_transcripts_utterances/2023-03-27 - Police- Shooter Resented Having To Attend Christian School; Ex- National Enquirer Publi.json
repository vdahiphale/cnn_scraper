It's how to unscramble the egg.If someone is running for office, right, and therefore something they did becomes relevant to someone who wants to extort them for money. Maybe if they weren't running for office, it wouldn't be as relevant but it is. And so that person ends up paying hush money payment to prevent humiliation to their family, humiliation that only came about because they happen to be running for political office. It gets a lot more confusing than just this sort of 1 percent, 50 percent or breaking it down that way. DAVIS:  Of course, I agree with you, Erin. That's what juries are about. I'm predicting when the juries hear the evidence of a discussion about the female vote. Being at risk because of the Stormy Daniels matter coming right after \"Access Hollywood\", I'm convinced that jurors will not believe Donald Trump's explanation that he was worried about Melania. But if the juries are not convinced of that the political motivation was totally lacking, zero, then Donald Trump will be acquitted. And let me remind everyone, Donald Trump is innocent after the indictment, until a jury right to be guilty.",

It's enough for a prosecutor to show that he had multiple motives, as long as one of them was political. You can also have a family or a humiliation type motive.But he is not correct when he says 1 percent is enough. The law says that the political motive has to be some substantial part of it. They don't put a number on it. One percent is not going to hack it. The other problem for the prosecution here is that Mr. Davis' client, Michael Cohen, in 2018 said to the FEC, Federal Election Commission, so punishable by perjury. These payments were entirely unrelated to the election, entirely unrelated to the campaign and therefore totally legal.
