And you can see here the plane hurtling towards the ground before it erupts in a ball of fire behind some buildings. Ukraine says it regards any Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets, but is not confirming if it shot down the plane.

After the impact, the jet explodes in a giant fireball. I heard only two explosions, this eyewitness says, the first one was a dull bang, then an explosion, then big flames. Russian media showing debris scattered across a large area at the crash site. Authorities say, no one onboard survived including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war set to be exchanged the same day. Moscow blaming Kyiv for the incident. The Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv side, Russia's foreign minister said. It targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike. The Ukrainians haven't denied shooting the plane down, but Kyiv says the Russians never told them they'd be flying the Ukrainian POWs to Belgorod, holding Moscow responsible for the loss of life and the failed exchange. Landing a transport plane in a 30 kilometer combat zone cannot be safe. And in any case, should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise, it jeopardizes the entire exchange process, a military intelligence statement says. Based on this, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions of the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our country. Ukraine says Russia often uses the IL-76 cargo jets to transport missiles used to target Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. A recent attack killing and wounding scores in Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast. When the missile attack started, I kneel down near the washing machine, this woman says, look, something hit me here, glass, glass, but I'm alive. Some people died and my flat is gone.

And overall in this complex, which at the start of the war on October 7th, in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks was converted into a shelter for displaced Palestinians. Overall, in this complex, there are tens of thousands of Palestinians who have been forced to move from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip taking shelter. Now in this specific building, which was a carpentry workshop, there were 800 people or so taking shelter. And as you say, the latest figures that we have from UNRWA is that nine people were killed, at least nine people killed and more than 75 injured. And we've seen those scenes of thick black smoke hanging over that building after the strikes on the building created a fire. Now, we've heard from the IDF saying that it doesn't currently believe that these were strikes from either airstrikes or artillery strikes, and it is carrying out a thorough investigation. And it doesn't rule out the possibility that this could have happened or this could have been caused by Hamas itself. Now, we've seen more broadly speaking in this war that Israel always maintains, that it doesn't deliberately target protective facilities, whether there are U.N. facilities or whether they're hospitals, but of course, unless they feel that there are perhaps clear and present dangers, threats, or militant activity happening in and around. And certainly over the past two days, from what Thomas White, the director of UNRWA in the Gaza Strip has been saying there's been intense fighting in this particular part of Khan Yunis, that there was crossfire in his words, and that that is when this particular building was struck. Clearly, there are more details to come. And we will wait to see what the IDF says in terms of its investigation. But certainly, if Thomas White is correct and that it was tank fire, that presumably would be coming from Israeli tanks. But as I say, we are waiting for Israel to come out with the conclusions of this thorough review, which it says it's now undertaking, Rosemary.",

During a meeting in Ankara on Wednesday, Turkey has publicly expressed its desire for an end to the war in Gaza and prevent the conflict from spreading. Iran, however, has taken a different course. CNN's Scott McLean has more now from Istanbul. SCOTT MCLEAN. CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Iranian president's long-awaited visit to Turkey comes at a time when the region is in desperate need of dialog. Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in Ankara and agreed to strengthen economic ties, but it seems it is tougher to find consensus on what to do about the volatile situation in the region. Both men are united in their very tough criticism of Israel, but while Turkey has aimed to prevent conflict from spreading across the Middle East, Iran's proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen have used the war in Gaza as a chance to strike at Israeli and American targets in the area, even commercial shipping lanes. President Erdogan said the pair agreed on the need to end the war in Gaza and find a lasting peace, and agreed to avoid steps that further threaten the stability of the region. Though what that looks like in practice is far from clear. The meeting comes at a time when Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini has called on Muslim countries to cut off political and economic ties with Israel, something that Turkey has given no indication that it is prepared to do. After the meeting with Erdogan, Raisi himself said that the primary issue of the Islamic world is the Palestinian issue, and Muslim countries need to do more. Scott McLean, CNN, Istanbul.",
