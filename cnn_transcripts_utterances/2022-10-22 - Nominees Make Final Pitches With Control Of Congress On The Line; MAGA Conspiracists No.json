And we are in the final stretch, as candidates work to reach still undecided voters. In the Senate race in Pennsylvania, it's all about swing voters in the suburbs. Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman is up against Republican Mehmet Oz. The outcome of the race there is critical, if Democrats want to keep their razor-thin majority in the Senate. CNN national reporter Dan Merica is live in Philadelphia for us today. How tight is this race there this weekend?",

And both campaigns, Democrats and Republicans, acknowledge, there is a smaller and smaller and smaller sliver of undecided voters in this contest. And that is who they are seeking to reach.Now Dr. Oz has been somewhat off the campaign trail today, at least not publicly saying what he's doing. He appeared on FOX News this morning. He spoke about crime and the importance of the debate on Tuesday. That is the key date in this contest where Oz and Fetterman will meet and debate for the first and only time. John Fetterman will appear behind me at a brewery in Chester County, Pennsylvania, a key collar county outside of Philadelphia. This would be a different kind of event for Fetterman. Since he had a stroke in May, and then returned to the campaign trail about two months later, he's done mostly rallies and a few interviews. At those he rallies, he has had notes and a stump speech that he has wanted to make, points that he has repeated. This will be different. This is a roundtable discussion where he will speak with Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, really tailoring that event to these suburban voters here in Chester County. Also of interest, he'll be using closed captioning technology behind me, basically allowing him to read what Amy Klobuchar is saying so that he can then respond. That same technology will be in use at the debate on Tuesday. Klobuchar is not the only Democrat who is looking to help Fetterman. Former President Barack Obama also cut a campaign ad for the Democrat that was released this week, where he urged Democrats to come out and support the lieutenant governor. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: So when the fate of our democracy and a woman's right to choose are on the line, I know John will fight for Pennsylvanians. You can count on John Fetterman. Make sure he can count on you. Vote Democrat on November 8th. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Maybe try something different. It's a bit of a long shot. I would certainly defer to Charlie Dent on politics in Pennsylvania. But the alternative I think is not necessarily all that promising, to do a bunch of rallies that lead you to a stunning defeat. It's a waste of time and effort. SIDNER: All right, Errol and Charlie, I want to move on to another state now. I'm sorry we can't stay in Pennsylvania for you there, Charlie.

Yes. And I think you're going to see probably an impactful number of Camp Warnock voters just as you're going to see in Pennsylvania, Shapiro-Oz, voters and some other states where this is happening, where these deficient candidates, like in Pennsylvania, you have a gubernatorial candidate Mastriano who's so unfit that many Republicans like me can't vote for him.

But this is problematic that we have these people, when you're in a state like that, in Pennsylvania or Arizona, where governors and secretaries of state, you know, you have to certify elections. This is a major issue when you have people, you know, who have a predetermined outcome in mind, and they have those positions as election administrators. That's dangerous.

I mean, you can't have a democracy that way. If there's an entire organization that is dedicated to undermining belief in the very system that we trust in. You know, and then by contrast, Katie Hobbs is in a state as a secretary of state, yes, she oversees the vote, but Arizona has no lieutenant governor. She's second in line to become governor. She has serious responsibilities that she's trying to take seriously. There was just a recent flap where they had to account for thousands of votes that they're not entirely clear about what happened with the registration. We want I think to reward in our system people who take serious responsibility and take it seriously. Not the showmanship, not the lies, not the pandering to a misguided electorate.

The Texas Department of Public Safety won't say why they've decided to let go of Sergeant Juan Maldonado. CNN, though, reported in August that Maldonado was seen on video arriving to Robb Elementary School just four minutes and 51 seconds after the shooting began. And despite that, it took over an hour for officers to breach the classroom and kill the shooter.Also in Uvalde, a Texas state police officer is under investigation after ordering officers to hold off entering a classroom, where a gunman was holed up with the children and teachers. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amid the chaos at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, where nearly 400 law enforcement responded to a deadly school shooting last May, CNN has learned commands by a high-ranking state police officer may have contributed to the broader failed response that day. While a gunman sat in a room full of dead, dying and traumatized children, new police radio transmissions obtained by CNN show Texas Department of Public Safety Captain Joe Betancourt giving an order to stop police from entering the classroom. And one internal memo describes him before he arrives telling officers to stay away from the school and remain on the perimeter during the initial response to the shooting. Captain Betancourt was one of 91 DPS officers on scene in Uvalde. We are now learning he is one of the seven referred for further investigation over his actions. After lionizing the police response in the initial days, the Texas governor and state officials have pushed the blame for what has since been acknowledged as a failure on the local and school police. But CNN has now reviewed memos written just two days after the shooting that detail actions by the DPS that allegedly went against protocol for mass shootings. One lieutenant wrote, \"I heard someone shout out, Captain Betancourt said all DPS personnel need to be on perimeter. Do not enter the building.\" And a sergeant reported he knew this was clearly against established training. And so he entered the school anyway.\" By the time Betancourt says he arrived outside Robb Elementary, students and teachers had already been trapped for more than an hour.",

That's despite 9-1-1 calls from children inside the room. Betancourt says he was relying on information from Uvalde Sheriff Ruben Nolasco that the gunman was a barricaded subject, and no longer an active shooter, and that a better SWAT team was on its way. He admits he never spoke to former School Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who has been labeled the on-scene commander, until after the shooter was killed. The memo referencing Betancourt's actions, and another corroborating it, are some of the clearest evidence that questions are being raised internally at the Department of Public Safety about the actions of its officers. His orders over the radio contradict the official narrative that the State Police were never in command of the scene and never issued substantive orders. When questioned by CNN in September, DPS Director Colonel Steve McCraw confirmed the investigation into Betancourt and promised to resign if his agency was shown to have culpability for the botched response.

Kennedy's assassination, yet it still remains a source of tremendous intrigue.Now, President Biden is facing mounting legal pressure for postponing the release of a final trove of about 16,000 records related to the 1963 assassination. The Mary Ferrell Foundation, the nation's largest online source of JFK assassination records, is now suing President Biden and the National Archives to release them. The lawsuit alleges that the feds have unlawfully redacted other previously released records. Back in 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush signed off on the JFK Records Act, which required all related documents be made public by October 26, 2017. It hasn't all happened. The National Archives say at least 88 percent of the collection has been released to the public. And as for the remaining 12 percent, well, Donald Trump delayed some of it, citing national security reasons. Last year, Biden blamed the pandemic for slowing the review process. The delay has prompted historians and transparency advocates and even some members of the Kennedy family to question the government's motives. When asked about the lawsuit this week, the White House declined to comment. Joining us now is Jefferson Morley. He's the vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, the group suing for the release of the final JFK records. He is also the editor of the \"JFK Facts\" blog. Now can you explain to us, Jefferson, why are these files so important the get out there? JEFFERSON MORLEY, VICE PRESIDENT, MARY FERRELL FOUNDATION &amp; EDITOR, \"JFK FACTS\": This is about 5 percent of the government's collection of JFK assassination records that still contain redactions, nearly 60 years after the fact. And as you explained, you know, we're five years past the deadline set by Congress for full disclosure. The law says that, after 25 years, JFK records should only be withheld in the rarest of cases. That's the language of the law. In response to the language of the law, the CIA says, we're going to withhold 11,275 back documents with redactions. That's what the CIA means with the rarest of cases. So they're not complying with the law. We're going to court saying someone has to enforce the law here. It's up to the president.

He is all but assured on Sunday to be reanointed for an unprecedented third time as China's supreme leader, setting himself up to be ruler for life.Today marks the official close of the 20th Party Congress, China's most important political meeting in decades. This is a highly scripted and choreographed Communist Party event that happens once every five years. But there was a bizarre and astonishing moment that was caught on camera by journalists in the ceremony room. See in the video, the man seated next to Xi, is China's former top leader, Hu Jintao. After several confusing moments, he is led out of the room, escorted by two men. A staff member holding his arm. He appears reluctant to leave. On his way out, he is seen saying something to Xi and then patting Premiere Li Keqiang on the shoulder. Chinese politics is incredibly opaque. We will never know the true circumstances around this incident. And it has not been reported at all by Chinese media. But this dramatic moment has already set off a firestorm of speculation overseas. People are wondering, was this because of a health issue or was it a political statement? Some analysts are saying, regardless of the reason, it is a symbolic moment. It shows the exit of a man who represented collective rule. While Xi Jinping, well, he represents strongman rule. Since he took over in 2012, he has purged his rivals. He has crushed descent. And has reasserted Communist Party control over every aspect of Chinese society. Tomorrow, we will see who Xi's closest advisers will be. But we've already got a lot of hints today. We heard that Premier Li Keqiang and another top leader, who are not seen as having close ties to Xi, well, they are set to retire. What is clear is that Xi is going to stack the top leadership positions with his loyalists. So in the third term, expect to see Xi Jinping double down on his iron rule over China. That means a more authoritarian China at home and more aggressive China abroad. Selina Wang, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
