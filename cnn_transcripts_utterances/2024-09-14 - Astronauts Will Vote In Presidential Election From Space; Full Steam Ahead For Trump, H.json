On September 4, a weapon he used to shoot fellow students and teachers, leaving four dead and nine injured.

That may not seem all that fast.It's faster than it was yesterday. It was only moving at 3 miles per hour. So now we're going to start to see a lot of that rain spread eastward. So far you can see a lot of these yellow, red, and orange areas where they've had two, four, and even six inches of rain already fall. Now, we're going to be adding more on top of it. And as we mentioned, a lot of these areas are dealing with some level of drought, so the rain itself is welcome. You just don't want it to come too quickly because then that triggers a lot of the flooding concerns. And the biggest flooding concern lies along this narrow path right through here, where you can see another three to five inches of rain is still expected on top of what they've already had. Now, another concern is this section right over here. You can see off the coast of the Carolinas right through there. That is actually from what could become our next named tropical system. We have two low- pressure system. What's left of Francine and then this low-pressure system, if you're sitting just off the coast or just off the East Coast, this is the system that's going to ride up along the Carolinas, bringing all of that moisture in and eventually taking that moisture with it into the Northeast as we go into the next couple of days. The real question becomes is does it start that transition into more of a tropical based system? And if so, it could end up becoming the next named storm. Now, as of right now, it has about a 50 percent chance over the next several days to transition into some type of tropical system. If it does, the next name on the list is Helene.

It was interesting once we saw Loomer posting these very racist remarks about Kamala Harris on social media, we saw a number of Trump allies, like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Senator Lindsey Graham, immediately trying to get in there to distance Trump from Loomer. But obviously, that wasn't enough. It took Donald Trump having to go to Truth Social to distance himself. What this ultimately does, though, is that it plays into this argument that Democrats and Trump critics have been making, that there are extremists within the Republican Party, and Trump is tied to this, these extremists, and in their words, Trump is an extremist. So, it certainly does not do anything to help the Trump campaign, as you have Republicans trying to get the former president to really focus on policy, to create that contrast with Kamala Harris. We'll see if he goes the additional step and disinvites her from the campaign events and no longer includes her on the plane when he is traveling. So, when the former president has attacked or focused on the vice president's racial identity, Vice President Harris has simply kind of just said, I'm not going to deal with that, next question please, in the Dana Bash interview. Are they exploiting this, though, in the Harris campaign? Are they going after him on Loomer and this line of his associates?",

I think it's a way, obviously, to, you know, present this argument to undecided voters who may actually have been in favor of Trump's policies, like Trump's economic policies, for example, the swing voters, but they don't like Trump himself -- at play, or his personality, those who he associates with. It plays into this argument that Harris has continuously been making, that Trump is the chaos candidate. So, I think we can expect to see that going forward.",
