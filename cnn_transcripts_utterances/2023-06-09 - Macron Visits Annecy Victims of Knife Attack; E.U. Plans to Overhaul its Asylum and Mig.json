      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York, and this is \"One World\". We will continue to monitor the latest news fromformer President Donald Trump's indictment, but first let's catch up on other headlines. Three days after the catastrophic collapse of a key dam in Russian occupied Southern Ukraine, local officials say the water levels are starting to drop. As you can see there, civilians are still facing a major threat to their safety. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is saying Russia continues shelling flooded areas in Kherson, including evacuation points as well. In the meantime, a Kremlin-backed official claims fierce fighting is taking place on southern front with Ukrainian troops trying to breakthrough Russian lines. And, Vladimir Putin claims the Ukrainian counteroffensive has begun, and in his words, though, without success. CNN's Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Breaking news on Kremlin-controlled tv, claiming Moscow's forces are facing massive attacks in southern Ukraine. OLGA SKABEEVA, RUSSIAN STATE TV ANCHOR (through translator):  Ukrainian forces attacked with NATO tanks and light-armored vehicles. Our army has fought off these attacks. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia's Defense Ministry, releasing aerial videos like this one, allegedly showing their forces targeting advancing Ukrainian formations in the Zaporizhzhia region. Moscow also claims to have taken out a modern western anti-aircraft system close to the front lines. On a visit to an arms depot, Russia's Defense Minister, urging faster weapons delivery. The enemy tried to advance today, he says, so this equipment is needed. Let's hurry up. While the Ukrainians have not confirmed offensive operations and CNN can't independently verify the specific Russian claim, US officials have told CNN, the Russians are putting up stiff resistance. Ukraine's leadership says they understand their counteroffensive will be long and tough, and they'll need a lots of armor to penetrate Russia's defenses. They showed us this repair and modification shop where they fix up mostly vehicles captured from the Russians, including this modern troop transporter. Even with all the Western equipment that Ukrainians have already received, they still have a lot less than the Russians do. That's why every tank and armored vehicle that they can get back on the battlefield will be vital for Ukraine's war effort. That includes even seemingly destroyed vehicles like this blown-up armored personnel carrier, the project manager tells me.",

There were cases of arrest, of torture, and there was, after liberation, a long period of bombardment from the Russians, and now portions are underwater. So, it's been a very difficult time. At the same time, the rescue operation was uplifting. We saw lots of volunteers turning up with boats to pedal out and pull people from their roofs, from the upper floors of their homes. And it was something like what we saw earlier in the war, where you had a real outpouring of volunteer activity in a difficult time. People came together and were helping as best they could, in this situation, where there was very extensive, major catastrophe from the flooding. And on top of that, you have the wars still going on.

Ukrainians have, and perhaps have been planning a river assault across from the river, and that would be more difficult. On the other hand, the flood washed away Russian positions on the eastern bank. So, if you don't mind me saying so, it's a bit of a wash in terms of who benefits from this flood.",

Some 250 planes and 10,000 personnel from some two dozen countries will simulate NATO's response to any potential attack on a member country. Germany's central location makes it a major logistics hub and staging area. The exercise could disrupt some civilian flight schedules as well. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us live now with a preview of the maneuvers which are set to begin next week. So, this has been in the works for quite some time, just in terms of the drill being planned for some time, but surely, the Ukraine war has really underscored NATO members.

Now, the commander of this air operation, the German commander of this air operation, gave that as an example of, you know, how quickly this exercise can come together. How quickly NATO can project this force. How quickly it's able to assemble what it needs to do the training exercise, to improve that interoperability between all those different nations. He gave a comparison with the speedy (ph). He said, look, let's say you're trying to project the same sort of military effect and power with land base tanks and heavy armored fighting vehicles and that sort of thing. He gave the example of trying to ship those, some of the from the United States. Well, he said that would take weeks, even months to do. So, this is a way of putting together an effective fighting force, an effective deterrent because he said this is here to defend right up to that red line of NATO territory. Although he says it's not a message to President Putin, diplomats here say that Putin will be playing attention. It is about bringing all those different skill sets, the pilots, the aircrews supports, all the other air assets that are important to make sure that NATO is ready and prepared, as you say, for the potential of a day where they may need to fight together. For example, more than 100 aircraft that come from the US Air National Guard. Some of them lined up behind me here, come from Colorado, and it's been one of the young first lieutenants flying one of those aircrafts. He said to me, look. I've never been on anything as big as this before, but here I am, just a couple of days ago, flying next to a euro fighter. I can't get that experience anywhere else, and that, in essence, is what this is about at a military level. But as you say, diplomatically, unambiguous message to President Putin. Don't interfere. Don't cross that red light into NATO space, because we're ready.",

French President Emmanuel Macron visited the city of Annecytoday, the site of Thursday's horrific knife attack on a playground. Four toddlers and two adults were wounded. Mr. Macron visited the victims in hospital and thanked first responders and others who helped them. The European Union plans to overhaul its asylum and migration laws. Stricter rules will be introduced across the bloc, according to a statement from the European Council. This will include monetary charges for countries unwilling to take in the allocated number of refugees. The EU says no member state can deal with the challenges of migration alone. And CNN has exclusively obtained an audio transcript from 2021 in which Donald Trump acknowledges that he had retained a secret military document and admits he had no power to declassify it since he was no longer in the White House. The transcript undercuts one of Trump's main arguments against the federal charges that were unveiled on Thursday. The document in question was a classified Pentagon document about attacking Iran. With more on the CNN exclusive and other information about the unprecedented federal indictment of Donald Trump, let's bring in CNN Political Correspondent Sarah Murray, she is in Washington, D.C. for us. So, Sarah, what a day. What a day today. I mean, obviously, this is historic, the fact that a former president is facing a second indictment, plus the fact that this one is a federal indictment, as well.

Appreciate it.It's worth remembering the many legal troubles facing Donald Trump right now, and it is quite the list, trust me. Just yesterday, he was indicted on seven federal charges connected to his handling of classified documents, as our Sarah Murray was just laying out just there. The special prosecutor who led that indictment is still investigating Trump's actions in the wake of the 2020 election, including the January 6 attack on the Capitol. A local prosecutor in Georgia is similarly looking into Trump's efforts to influence the vote counting in that state. She's expected to file charges in the next couple of months. Trump has also been indicted by a New York prosecutor for the scheme to pay hush money to a porn star. That trial is scheduled to start in March of next year. Just last month, a New York jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse and defamation in a civil case. Author E. Jean Carroll has asked the judge to award extra damages there because she says that Trump continues to defame her by talking about the case. And finally, there's a civil lawsuit filed by the state of New York alleging that Trump's company inflated his net worth to get more favorable terms from banks and insurance companies. Time now for the exchange. As we mentioned, Trump is expected to appear in a Florida federal court on Tuesday. Joining us live now is someone who knows that court very well. David Weinstein was a Federal Prosecutor in Florida for more than a decade. He's now a partner at the law firm, Jones Walker. David, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, let's just talk about what's in these charges, what's in the indictment.

Well, now there is a statement allegedly recorded on tape as has been reported where he says, I could have declassified them. I didn't declassify them, and I know they're not declassified, and I'm showing them to you now. So, that cuts against any defense he might have had that he either didn't know that these documents were classified, or that knowing that they were, he showed them to someone, or that he, in fact, did declassify them.

And I think the difference that we've seen here at least, again, based on information in the affidavit for the search warrant and public statements made about both former Vice President Pence and President Biden when he was vice president, the extent to which they cooperated and gave back everything they had and didn't say, oh, this was it, that's all there was.
