Here are today's top stories.Hurricane Helene is now forecast to reach catastrophic Category 4 strength by the time it makes landfall in Florida later today. The National Hurricane Center is telling residents that preparations to protect life and property should be completed in the next few hours before tropical storm conditions arrive. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on at least one federal criminal charge. Federal prosecutors have been looking into Adams' connection to Turkish officials and businessmen. The exact charges are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Caitlin Clark's historic rookie season has come to an end after the Indiana Fever were eliminated from the WNBA playoffs on Wednesday. The Connecticut Sun defeated Indiana 87-81. Clark, the WNBA Rookie of the Year, led her team to its first playoff appearance since 2016. We are tracking Hurricane Helene as it heads towards the U.S. More than 86 million people across five states in the southeast are under tropical storm or hurricane watches and warnings. [04:35:00] Helene is churning in the southern Gulf of Mexico right now and heading towards Florida. It's a massive storm with tropical storm force winds extending up to 345 miles and -- miles from the center. And it's expected to make landfall later today as a Category 4 hurricane with catastrophic winds and storm surge. The mayor of Tampa, Florida, tells CNN her city is doing all it can to prepare for the onslaught. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But for much of the day on Wednesday, this part of the island, the westernmost and even central parts of Cuba, were rocked by heavy winds and rain flooding in western Cuba. It still has some towns cut off.According to officials there, about 50,000 people in the westernmost Cuban province of Pinar del Rio are still without power. And it could take days for electricity to be restored there. All the same, though, many Cubans felt they missed the worst of this powerful hurricane. The hurricane did not make a direct hit on Cuba as it traveled between the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and westernmost Cuba. It does not appear, though, that Florida is going to be as lucky. The panhandle or western part of Florida are looking to be hit by a powerful category 4 hurricane. That is what forecasters are saying that Helene could strengthen into. And that is the kind of hurricane that can bring absolutely devastating storm surge to coastal areas, can knock out power for weeks, take down heavy trees and power lines. So residents are being urged to take final preparations as a storm much more powerful than the one hit Cuba takes aim at Florida. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That happened hours after the U.S. and its allies put out a three-week ceasefire proposal for Israel and Hezbollah. Diplomats are concerned that the fighting between them could escalate into an all- out war.Meanwhile, Israel's army chief now says a potential ground incursion into Lebanon is on the table. But Iran is making it clear it won't stay on the sidelines if a full-scale war breaks out. Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for New York, where he's expected to address the U.N. General Assembly. But an Israeli official told CNN the ceasefire talks are the main reason for his trip. For the latest, let's head over to Hong Kong, where we're joined by Ivan Watson.
