Official say two Black Hawk choppers crashed over a wooded field during a routine training mission. The service members were aboard an HH-60 helicopter and belong to the 101st Airborne Division. The officials say they are still notifying next of kin and that an army investigation team is en route to the scene. Pentagon Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said that there are no immediate plans to ground military aircraft, but added this about the dangers of military exercises. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: When it comes to military training, we're always going to try to take into account mitigating some of the risks associated with that training. As I mentioned before, a lot of the training that our service members do is by nature dangerous, whether it's live fire exercises, whether it's aircraft training, whether it's training on ships at sea, there are many dangerous aspects of that.

Governor, thank you so much for joining us. This is a tragic day for the, state for the country, you noted that this morning. And I was really struck by your comments where you said, we must remember that the freedom relies on those who are willing to serve some of which pay the ultimate price. And that, of course, imply applies to those who are serving this country overseas and here on routine training missions like these service members. What more can you tell us about what transpired and the process of notifying their next of kin? GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D) KENTUCKY: Well, in Kentucky, we love Fort Campbell and its troops. They are a part of us, team Kentucky, who we are, part of our community. And today, for Campbell, the 101st Airborne and the Commonwealth of Kentucky are all morning nine children of God that chose to serve our great country and today are lost. Their families will be grieving the children of God that are irreplaceable. I know that the facility and the general in charge are taking it very seriously and also very hard. And we think of our military in the army as being tough and they are, but they also love their fellow service members as brothers and as sisters and I have full confidence that they want more than anyone else to get to the bottom of what happened to make sure it won't happen again. And I have full confidence in their abilities to continue to carry out their missions as needed.",

Kirsten Gillibrand sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, asking that the slate of choppers in the armed services be reviewed for safety.

We lost nine individuals and those are nine individuals who gave their life in service for this country.So I think we have to figure out the why. I believe that everyone from leadership on the base to leadership in Washington, D.C. wants to see that happen and then to make sure that the next group is safer in whatever training exercise or in any combat exercise that they are in. Now, we do need to continue training provided that it's safe though, because when you look at how important these jobs are, whether it's evacuating individuals in conflict or whether it's transporting people to where we would need them to keep us safe, it is critical that we have the best trained military out there, but we - these are people's sons and daughters, these are husbands or wives, it's really important that we honor those that we've lost that we find a way, find the reason and address it.

The White House has also started to provide a very limited timeline about when exactly they became aware of this detention. The White House has said that last night the White House officials and State Department officials spoke with Gershkovich's employer, the Wall Street Journal, and the State Department has also been in contact with his family.

Officials want to be able to have that access to him to see what his condition is like so that they can also relay that to his family.Additionally, something as the White House and State Department have been talking about this detention, they've simply refer to it as a detention in other instances where Americans have been detained. You have that additional description of the U.S. saying that they've been wrongfully detained. The White House has said that that is currently an evaluation, a process that is being determined whether they can designate this a wrongful detention, that is something that is being evaluated over at the State Department. But certainly still so many questions facing this administration over the detention of this Wall Street Journal reporter at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Russia are incredibly high, not only when it comes to Ukraine, but also the detention of other Americans like Paul Whelan.",

He's actually the author of the book, \"Prisoner: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison.\" Jason and Steve, thank you so much for being with us. Jason, I want to start with you. You were arrested and convicted for espionage. Here we have another reporter detained under somewhat similar circumstances, what was your reaction to this news? JASON REZAIAN, AUTHOR, \"PRISONER: MY 544 DAYS IN AN IRANIAN PRISON\": Yes, Boris, thanks for having me on. My reaction was, well, I know this storyline very well. I've lived this storyline. I appreciate Arlette's reporting from the White House. I would say that the wrongful detention designation, it's only a matter of time before we hear that being the official line of the State Department. There's some checks and balances that have to go through before they can come out and say it but it doesn't seem like there's a there there in this case.

This isn't - we can call it a detention, we can call it any number of different things, an arrest. But what it is, is a kidnapping. There has been a Russian illegal that was detained last week in Brazil with American ties, which is - he was recently charged last week in the United States. So what the Russians are doing is they're joining that that club of these rogue nations, Iran, North Korea, that's - they're looking more and more like those folks when they simply detain people, kidnap them and hold them for things that they want in return.

I was kept in solitary confinement for seven weeks. She was kept in solitary confinement for 10 weeks.This is a treacherous thing that these states do to innocent individuals simply by virtue of our citizenship. As Steve correctly pointed out, we are - we - me in the past, Evan right now, are being held because we're Americans and we are deemed as valuable leverage in potential negotiations and it's also designed to astound. Bianna's question about whether it's safe for journalists to go to Russia is a really good and important one. No, it's not and they are sending a clear message that they don't want us there.",

But from a geopolitical perspective, I mean, if this is all Putin's got is to kidnap Americans and other Westerners as they're being journalists or whatever the reason is in Russia, that's not going to change the situation with the United States and Russia, Ukraine and all of that.The administration has already done a lot. They have tried to convince people. They have tried to be vocal about how dangerous it is for Americans to travel to Russia. So they need to continue to hammer on that. And that's why I think you've heard the State - the White House spokesman and State Department spokesman talk about those travel advisories. But the reason that they do that is because once you're there, once you're where Paul Whelan is right now, once you're where this journalist is right now, it's extremely difficult for the administration, because you get caught into a barter situation, you get caught into these difficult discussions that we saw with, you know, Brittney Griner, for example, exchange for this arms trafficker victim, Viktor Bout. It's just a no win situation for the administration, which is one of the reasons that the Russians like to do it so much, because they know it causes political chaos and sends a very, very strong message to the west, and especially to journalists and others who are trying to do legitimate work.",
