Then, making Europe great again? As the continent drifts closer to the hard right, what this means for the world and for Ukraine. I'm joined by former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. Also, ahead, \"Death Without Mercy.\" Oscar nominated documentary maker Waad Al-Kateab joins me around her new film on the aftermath of the Turkey-Syria earthquake. And the record-breaking hurricane charging through the Caribbean. We will have the latest. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. With less than four months until the U.S. presidential election, two events now have destabilized the race in ways few could have imagined just a week ago. President Joe Biden's unnerving performance during CNN's Presidential Debate has seen calls grow within the Democratic Party for the replacement of a sitting president on the ticket, while a ruling from the Supreme Court has strengthened the power of the presidency to the level of a monarch. That's according to one dissenting justice. This comes as other elections are transforming nations from the far-right, potentially reaching power in France, to the center left, preparing for a sweep to victory in the U.K. And to Iran, where a hardliner and a reformer will face off in a second round of voting this weekend. It's a chain of events forcing people to reconsider what really were given about America and the world. So, what happens next? Joining me now on all of this is veteran U.S. diplomat and president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass. Really good for you to be with us as we continue to try and keep pace with all of these news events. You know, you've been outspoken and forceful. So, we'll start with this. Make the case for us. Why should Joe Biden step down? RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT EMERITUS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, I think there's, there's two reasons. One is given his performance on Thursday night, I think it's increasingly unlikely he will be able to defeat Donald Trump. And if you believe that Donald Trump, by basis of temperament and policy, poses a threat, both to American democracy and to the world that the United States has painstakingly built and maintained for three quarters of a century, then that ought to give you pause. And then secondly, putting that aside, imagine President Biden were to be re-elected, I think it's a stretch to say that for four and a half years from now, which is what we're talking about towards the end of what would then be his second term, he would be in a position to really bring to the job all that a president need. So, this is not any job. This is the most demanding, important job in the world. It ages everybody that's in it. And again, not simply the other night, but if one simply looks at film clips of Joe Biden over the years, and I've known him, by the way, for half a century, as someone I consider a friend, I voted for him, but if you look at what's happened, it's really hard to imagine that in four and a half years, he would be in a position -- he would be capable to perform this job.",

Unless I'm missing it, I see none of this in this Republican Party. I was a Republican for four decades. I work for President Reagan and President Bush, the father and President Bush, the son. So, I don't need lectures, if you will, about the Republican Party. This -- the current Republican Party is not conservative. It's radical. It's populist. It wants dramatic change. It cares not for precedent. It's kind of now wrapped itself around the person of Donald Trump. When I worry about a consolidation of power, almost like a parliamentary system, but without checks and balances and without a court that is prepared to backstop American democracy, and that's a concentration of power that ought to worry Americans.",

They are shaking their heads. But what this tells them is they say they simply can't count on us. The Ukraine aid vote was a signal of that, America walking away from other longstanding policies like commitments to free trade, what we did in Afghanistan. So, increasingly, they're saying, how do we face threats for it by ourselves? Do we defer to more powerful adversaries, China or Russia? Do we have to think about maybe getting nuclear weapons ourselves? To stand up to an Iran, to a North Korea, to a China, to a Russia? What other friends and partners can we find?

They've pushed back somewhat harder against China. I think they've been a very uncertain trumpet, though, vis-a-vis Israel and what's going on in Gaza, as our policy recommendations have been repeatedly rebuffed. What happened in Afghanistan was not reassuring. Plus, Joe Biden now is not in a position where he can speak for America. He couldn't deliver Congress for some critical months in the Ukraine aid vote, which also affected Taiwan and Israel, and no one can know -- he's not in a position to speak for America six or seven months from now, and all of that weakens the influence of the United States. Essentially, what the debate the other night did was turn him into a lame duck. That may not be fair, that may be premature, but that's reality.",

They would all have the -- two advantages, Joe Biden doesn't have one. They'd be an awful lot younger. And with the limited exception of Kamala Harris, they wouldn't have the burdens of incumbency. This is an anti-incumbent moment. You mentioned the French elections. You mentioned the British elections. We saw what happened in India and South Africa. Any of these people would not have the burdens of incumbency. They'd be a fresh face. So, I think it's way too soon to look at polls and take them seriously. One of them will emerge, if that were to happen, and then we see how they do. And indeed, Nikki Haley and other Republicans are saying Republicans and Donald Trump have got to be careful. This could be coming at them and they're not prepared. They're so geared for running against Joe Biden, they're not necessarily geared for running against someone who's 30 years younger.",

And today Mr. Orban is actually visiting Kyiv where he is pushing for a ceasefire with Russia. All of this comes as the far-right builds power in France, the Netherlands, Italy, and beyond. So, with the very real prospect of a second Trump term on the horizon, how can Europe respond to all of this change? Joining me now is Carl Bildt.

Is he able to change gears? Can he sustain energy and strength in a way that any president has to in terms of rallying the American people? So, there's not one thing he can do.

I cannotimagine what it is for the people still living through that horror. You know, you heard the news of the earthquakes when you were in London where you had been living. You escaped Syria. And then, you decided that you were going to get in touch with your friends, Fuad and Fadi. This is so striking to me in terms of how you decided at that moment that this documentary had to be produced. Why? WAAD AL-KATEAB, DIRECTOR, \"DEATH WITHOUT MERCY\":  I think it was very like real for us. You know, as Syrians, we've been through a lot. We suffered like for years. We survived -- the people who survived, you know, we survived shelling, bombing, siege, like beloved ones who are arrested and so many other like tragedies. And for us, that earthquake was like another big shock where we couldn't really understand that this is real and this is happening. So, because of all this trauma, I felt, you know, like, I'm today in a safe place. My family, even my mom, dad, sister and brother and my sister had like -- only like one-month old baby, they were in Gaziantep where the earthquake struck. And for me, you know, I lived there for one year and a half. I know so many people there, like Fadi and Fuad is two of my friends, but I know much more people there. And for us, you know, this is another tragedy we're going through. And to be honest, like the world maybe did not even stop at that second, you know, to know what's going on. It was one highlight on the news and then, everyone moved on while there was people under the ground who is stuck for days, and there was no aid, there was no help. Same situation in Turkey and also in Syria, in northwest of Syria. So, it was just like a huge suffering, a huge tragedy, and I really wanted people to look back and see and look today at what is the impact of this. It is like a natural disaster, but there's so many men, like men who have that responsibility to make that painless for these people or actually -- literally to make so many people survive.",

My family is living in Antakya, in Turkey. First, I sent a message to Yaman, but the text didn't reach him. I texted my brother, Yamen, it didn't reach. I texted my mom, my dad, it didn't each. I texted Yaman's wife, all my relatives. There was bad connection, but finally, my brother- in-law answered. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  No one got out from your family's building. The whole of Antakya is on the ground. All you can hear is people screaming and shouting from under the rubble. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Then Sami started crying. I called out to Koutaiba as he had been behind me. He had even been holding onto my clothes. But it seems that the collapse separated us. I called out to him, but I couldn't hear his voice. I hugged Sami tightly, and then I felt that my shoulder was not moving. I noticed that my phone was still with me. I tried to call the emergency number, but it didn't work. I started screaming in Turkish, help me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet, I want to ask youabout your method in documenting this in terms of what was your thinking? Because these are painful moments for these people to recall. These are people that you know and love. How did you persevere? And more importantly, why did you think it was important to really recount so many painful moments? AL-KATEAB:  Yes, I think like this film was very unique and very different from so many other documentaries like I've done myself or even I've seen around like this couple of years. Like it is important because it's the only way for us to survive. And the pain will never be less, you know, even when these people recorded this amazing, you know, like -- and difficult and harrowing black memories. And the pain will never be simpler and easier. They will never be moving on, you know, when they have their kids who they lost or their entire family who they lost. So, for us, it was a way of like dealing with this and moving forward, finding meaning, finding a message and the reason, you know, why they survive and they have to be alive. And it is a collective amazing team, you know, who did record from under the rubbles like Safa, which you're going to see in the film, from Fadi who lived day by day with waiting for his family and then none of them got out. And with that, you know, he had to pick up the camera and continue with us working on this film. Fuad and so many other people you -- who you've seen in the film. It's a collective of CCTV, news around the earthquake, survivors who documented with their own phones. I think what's really like different and special with this is like it is a way to survive, and it's the only -- like it's made because of this trust, because of this relationship that I have with Fadi, Fuad, and Safa, which we know each other for years, which we trust each other, which we believe together as Syrians who survived so many things, that the only way for us to deal with this is to fight back and make a big message out of this unfortunately horrible tragedy.",
