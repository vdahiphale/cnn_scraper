This is legislation that the president signed into law back in 2022 that expanded health care services available to veterans that were exposed to toxic substances like burn pits and like Agent Orange.And what the president announced at this event was that more than one million claims have now been granted to veterans since that act became law. Now, this issue, as you say, is of deep personal significance for this president. The president has often talked about his belief that burn pits were responsible for the brain cancer that ultimately took the life of his late son, Beau, who, of course, served in Iraq. And we heard the president talking a little bit about that in New Hampshire. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My son Beau was one of those veterans. So this is personal to me and my family, and to his family and his children, and so many of yours. So when I took office I determined that come hell or high water, we're going to protect the heroes and protect our nation. We learned a terrible lesson after Vietnam, as those harmful effects of Agent Orange took years to manifest and left too many veterans without the care they deserved because they had to prove that every illness they had was a consequence of Agent Orange, which is often too hard to do.

You know, this state doesn't necessarily fall in the category for the Biden campaign of the toughest and most competitive battleground states, but I think Biden allies would certainly argue that the fact that he is making this trip up there goes to show that the Biden campaign is reticent to take any state for granted at this point. I will also note the president has now arrived in Boston, where he is going to be participating in two separate fundraisers, coming, of course, after the Biden campaign's April fundraising numbers showed that it lagged behind the March numbers.The Biden campaign's war chest is still significantly greater and bigger than the Trump campaign's, and that is a cash advantage that the Biden campaign certainly hopes to continue having as we head closer to November.",

A reporter did ask him about that earlier today, and he sort of laughed it off and said it would take too long for him to address that in great detail. We do have the White House and the Biden campaign have both addressed the posting of this video.The Biden campaign, for example, saying in a new statement that this video is part of a pattern of Trump's praise for dictators and echoing anti-Semitic tropes. He is a threat to our democracy, the statement says, and Americans must reject him and stand up for our democracy come this November. You know, this statement actually came after the video was finally removed from online, and the campaign, I think, is asking the question of why was it posted in the first place.",

It finds that about two-thirds of adults say that their financial situation was made worse by the cost of living. 31 percent said no impact. 4 percent said -- just 4 percent said that their situation was made better. Another telling finding is that about one in six adults say that they could not pay their bills in the prior month in full.And the problem, of course, is that people are spending more than they're making. Only 48 percent, right, less than half, say that they spent less than they made in the prior month. That's pretty low. 32 percent, about a third, say they broke even. Of course, if you break even, that leaves nothing left to save for a raining day or save up for retirement. And 19 percent said that they spent more than they made. Of course, that is not sustainable, and that speaks to the increased use of credit cards. I think at the end of the day, these findings do speak to the gloomy mood that we hear on Main Street and also to the cumulative impact of inflation. I mean, prices are no longer skyrocketing, but there is this snowballing effect after three years of high prices. And clearly, Americans are still feeling that impact.",

Elliott, right now the parties are debating language about the jury's requirement to find prosecutors proved Trump was part of a conspiracy.This ties back to that meeting in 2015 between Trump, David Pecker and others about how they were going to handle potentially negative news about Donald Trump going into the presidential election.

      "sentences": "Into the weeds, but also to use, you know, stormy weather as it were. It starts getting a little bit tricky here because the question is, are you accusing the defendant of an additional crime by saying he's part of a conspiracy? And this is the kind of area that all parties need to be careful about what they do. Now the question is, as they're debating, was Trump a part of a conspiracy at the time that he engaged in this, allegedly engaged in these acts? And how do you instruct the jury as to what his actions were?Now the judge's question is, if there's nothing criminal at all -- which is what he puts to the defense -- why does it matter if I put it in an instruction or not? And my gut here reading this is, the judge probably lets this in because this is a question for the jury to decide whether you think he committed a crime or engaged in something unlawful. So it's hard to see where they're going to land on this, but it's really big picture. Jury instructions become fraught with peril when you start assigning or accusing the defendant of additional things. That's where you start running into trouble on appeal because the words that the judge gives to the jurors might suggest more criminality than is actually there.",

You'll see at the end, invariably, they will come back with a question that says we can't come to an agreement.And the judge will say, invariably, go back and come to an agreement. And after a few times, it'll give them an opportunity to come to consensus. But virtually every jury I've ever worked on, worked with, came back at one point saying, we think we're going to hang.
