So, when it comes to Lebanon, it's the IDF, the sort of traditional mainstream military that wants an escalation with Lebanon. There seem to be voices in the senior military leadership who believe they have an opportunity to change the balance somehow in Israel's favor against Hezbollah, whereas the political leadership, the same folks who are sort of pushing for a maximalist course in Gaza, Netanyahu and others in his cabinet, understand the risks with Hezbollah. They understand Hezbollah is a much more serious adversary, and they don't want an escalation. So, part of the -- the question here is, who holds the day in deciding how to strike back. If Israel wants to keep this contained, as we saw earlier this year in that very theatrical and scary, but ultimately contained, exchange of fire with Iran, they can do this in a way that, you know, where it basically ends here, right? So, it's less a question of where they hit than how many people are killed. So, they -- they could do something as dramatic as hitting an airport or -- or a Hezbollah headquarters building in Southern Beirut. The thing that will change the calculus for the worse is if they do something that kills hundreds of civilians in Lebanon, in which case Hezbollah will be obligated by its own redlines to retaliate.",

We've seen the Houthis really taking an active role in the conflict, including the drone strike on Tel Aviv last week.So, what it looks like is catastrophic. And one of the things that your viewers should -- should keep in mind is that -- the Hezbollah possesses military capabilities that we have not seen yet in this conflict for many of Israel's adversaries. Hezbollah is very well-supported, well organized, traditional military force. It has rockets; it has mortars. It also has infantry fighters who have been actively at war, engaged in urban warfare nonstop for more than a decade. These -- these are fighting assets that are going to cause real mayhem and real strategic danger for Israel. And unfortunately, they're going to cause a lot of death and damage, right? So, what we've seen until now is that Israel ultimately isn't suffering a lot of civilian casualties or damage since the horrible losses at suffered on October for seventh 7th itself. But in a direct war with Hezbollah, it will suffer hundreds or thousands of civilian dead. It will suffer successful missile strikes against civilian and strategic and military targets in places like Haifa and maybe Tel Aviv, throughout the Galilee. It's exposed in a way that it has not been until now. And just quickly on a regional basis, if and when this jumps to the next level and brings in Iran's Trump card, which is Hezbollah, where we are going to see de-stabilizing violence in Yemen, in Iraq. And probably the rest of the gulf in a way that we have really avoided until now, keeping this very complex web of interests contained with these sort of theatrical or choreographed tit-for-tat exchanges. When that breaks down, it's going to be total war. And that's going to be awful for the civilians who live in these areas. It's also going to be awful for the strategic interests of the United States and its partners in the region.",

They arrived with a team of 17 people to monitor an election of more than 20 million voters, potentially. And they will give us a presser on Tuesday morning.

Well, we are now less than 100 days away from the 2024 U.S. presidential election. And it's hard to believe it's only been a week since U.S. President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has moved quickly to consolidate support from the Democratic Party. Both Harris sand Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took a break from the campaign trail on Sunday and, instead, let their allies stump for them. But the Harris campaign did announce in a memo that it has raised $200 million just since last Sunday. It says 66 percent of those donations are coming from small first-time donors. And according to a new ABC News/IPSOS poll, the vice president's favorability rating has gone up eight points since last week, while Trump has seen his ratings slip by four points. CNN's Jeff Zeleny now with the latest on this race from the battleground state of Michigan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris heading into a new phase of their campaign now, with fewer than 100 days to go before election day. A very busy weekend of campaigning here in Michigan and in battleground states across the country. The former president campaigning in Minnesota, trying to bring that state back into play. Of course, President Biden carried it quite comfortably, but Donald Trump lost it narrowly back in 2016. It's seen as the reddest blue state in the country, if you will. Now, so many different polls are showing that Vice President Harris is doing much better than President Biden. Now of course, this race is still too close to call, nationally and in battleground states across the country. But she is showing gains among younger voters and voters of color. Now, the race to define Vice President Harris is on aggressively. The Republicans are trying to do that through campaign ads, branding her as a San Francisco liberal, in their words. J.D. Vance, the Ohio senator and the Republican vice-presidential candidate going after her aggressively this weekend. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The people are going to learn her record. They're going to learn that she's a radical. What they're going to learn, that she's basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country. And I don't think that's going to sell in Minnesota. I don't think it's going to sell anywhere else. So, as we tell the message, and as we -- as we talk about how President Trump has made people's lives better and can do it again, I think we're going to turn Minnesota red and a lot of other states, as well.",

Vice President Harris has relationships with most of these potential candidates, but the question is, who can be a governing partner? Her vetting team is looking through the backgrounds of all of these candidates. And she, of course, I'm told, will begin weighing in with interviews. She hopes to have a decision by August 7. That of course, will frame this race. Harris and whoever she chooses against Trump and J.D. Vance, going into the final three months of this campaign, clearly too close to call.
