Now, moving forward, we're almost two weeks -- more -- a little more than two weeks to graduation. And the university has said, they will have a commencement here.

And then all of a sudden, the police department is arresting students who are essentially just protesting.There's, you know, they weren't, you know lighting things on fire. They were just protesting. I think what you've seen colleges and universities learn over the course of the week is that protest is a natural part of college and university experience that in most instances, although there are outliers, the students are not going to be disruptive to schools or to graduation. So you want to keep the temperature down if you're a university or college leader. You bring the cops in and you know -- we know exactly what's going to happen, the numbers increase. People who may not even feel allegiance to the Palestinian cause will become involved. And then the third thing that I've been urging on air and elsewhere is, you know, you provide a forum for students. This protest is allowable. You give them off ramp, so you're starting to see colleges and universities do that either dialogue or as we heard that professor say, you know, in other words, you bring people together and then outcomes. And then eventually, there will have to be some action whether it's law enforcement or not, we don't know. It could be suspension. We're in a funny period. I'm at a university, not right now, but I teach there. It's sort of that dead time between classes and graduation. And there's no need to make a decision in most of these instances until you're sort of closer to graduation if this might disrupt the building of capacity to have the graduation.",

And we see what happens in that regard.And also we do have a first amendment rights. We do have protest rights. And these are, you know, they're not children. But on the other hand, it's that kind of energy that, you know, I think reflects the 20 somethings. So that -- since that's the case, the kind of consequences that colleges and universities can do short of arrest is essentially those related to their academic status. And that is going to hurt them. I have no problem with that if we get to that moment you cannot disrupt graduations. I think, for example, USC overreacted. I think it was -- this was a -- USC canceled its main graduation. You have to let Jewish and other students feel protected and safe. But I'm not sure, canceling an entire graduation is good for either side because people become more divided. So if I sound calm, it isn't that I am, it's just that part of this is just buying time. Before you're -- you see some of the disruptions that might be or police actions that might be inevitable at a limited number of colleges and universities, but no one should go first in in the way that we saw originally last week with law enforcement.",

But at this stage, it does feel as if we are getting close to an agreement from both sides, which would be a major step towards ending this conflict.Brianna, let me just go through what we know to be being discussed at present. Hamas officials with Qatar mediators and Egyptian mediators in Cairo as we speak, considering what is effectively an Egyptian proposal, which has been crafted with the help of the Israelis, but not necessarily completely agreed to. But it calls for the following. Phase 1, a period of weeks when up to 33 hostages would be released for a period of calm, during a period of calm, a period of weeks, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. That's less hostages than the Israelis had originally been demanding and that was up to 40. This is up to 33 as we understand it. Phase 2, should that be successful, those first period of weeks? Phase 2 is what is important here. And this is different. Phase 2 calls for the restoration of \"a sustainable calm.\" Now, I spoke to one diplomatic source familiar with the talks who said, that is language which was first proposed by the United States in Doha back in February, which wasn't, at the time, accepted by the Israelis, which effectively suggests a permanent ceasefire without actually calling it that. This is a restoration of sustainable calm for a period of around about a year, during which the rest of the civilian hostages serving Israeli soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages would be released. That would be a major step forward because this would be a long period of permanent calm. Now, that's what's on the table. And that is what's being discussed at present, thanking both Qatar and Egypt for their efforts in all of this. Antony Blinken who was here at what is the special meeting of the World Economic Forum in Riyadh, then an awful lot of diplomatic flurry on the sidelines of this, describe the deal in the following way.

And he said that to date, Washington has not seen a plan. Tony Blinken is here wanting to talk to regional stakeholders, Saudi, in the first instance, and others around this region, about what happens the day after, what happens after this conflict finishes, what is the next stage for Gaza and the Palestinians? The Saudis have said that there is the option of normalization of relations with Israel. But the caveat here is, they have to see a two state solution on the table for the Palestinians. And that has to be an irreversible path. Now, Tony Blinken is on his way from here to Amman and then on to Tel Aviv.

I mean, you had some good testimony from Pecker from -- for the state.At the same time, you had some good information that came in for the Trump team. And that is information like, well, you know, Michael Cohen was doing this. This is the normal way of doing business. There's nothing unique here in setting this type of story purchase up. We've done it for other politicians and other celebrities. And so that's good information that to get in front of the jury. But, you know, this is a paper case. It's a -- it's follow the money case. Those could be boring cases for a jury. And so the prosecution's goal needs to be, as they go through this multi-week trial, is to really figure out a way to keep that hook in the mouth of those jurors so that they can stay engaged and stay interested. You don't do that by having a banker up for a long time. So I think you'll see the banker finishes testimony, talking about how the corporations were setup, how the payments were made, the efforts that went into that, the direction he got about that. And then, you know, you're likely to see some, what I would say, would be a more exciting witness, whether that's Michael Cohen, whether that's somebody closer in to the Trump camp, like Hope Hicks. They're going to have to manage that. Or else, it's like a -- having your accountant, nothing to get -- nothing, you know, disregard for accountants, but having your accountant stand there in front of you for two weeks explaining a tax code.

No. They see that as unfair. And they see this look, quite frankly, as an extension of lawfare. As Michael said, this is a paper case, right? This is a case that's -- a federal case that was passed on by the Department of Justice, and the previous district attorney took a pass on it, and it's being strapped to a state case and being bootstrapped up.
