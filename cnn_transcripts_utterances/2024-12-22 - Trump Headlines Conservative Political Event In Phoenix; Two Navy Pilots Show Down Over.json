So let's talk a little bit more about the president-elect's agenda from putting an iron dome similar to what is in Israel over the US, meeting with Putin. You heard Daniel Strauss talk about, and we rolled the soundbite earlier that Trump wants that to recognize only two genders. He wants to eliminate any transgender, you know, classification or any means to that community. So, it sounds like that he feels like he has a mandate on all things after winning this election. LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES\": Well, he did. He also spent a good chunk of time at the beginning of that speech, Fred, in talking about his great victory, how he says he won in 2020 and, you know, relishing all the swing states that went for him. But here is some other takeaways from that speech. What is notable is he talks about not to a degree, he doesn't really talk about us. He talks about there is them, the people that didn't vote for him and you, the people, the MAGA people before him. But when you look at this speech, it does show a very emboldened President Trump who is laying out a vigorous agenda of things he says he can do and things that he says he could do, probably won't be able to do past day one or week one, such as end inflation and raise our wages.",

Because we just saw through this funding bill that there are some Republicans, there were 38 of them who weren't necessarily on board with everything he had to say as it pertains to the funding bill, when it comes to the debt ceiling.And then we've since heard from some lawmakers today on some of the Sunday talk shows, who said, I like Trump, but I am not necessarily going to be on board with everything that he is advocating.

Ivanka Trump faced constant scrutiny and criticisms for decision made by her father that she was unable to totally influence or moderate. She was alienated by some liberal friends in her New York circle, and she shut down a relatively successful namesake brand after persistent ethics questions. But she is also forging a new path now, where her father is not her boss for the first time since she was 24 years old. She followed him from real estate, to reality TV, to the West Wing. And that is possible in part because her family's businesses have profited from proximity to the presidency and those resulting relationships. Here, in her own words, why she is sitting this one out.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: When you are in a zone like this where there is combat happening at one end of the Red Sea, and then there are other flight patterns that the folks on the USS Gettysburg, the sailors on the USS Gettysburg, have to deal with, it can be pretty easy to mistake targets from one to the other.

And as you recall, there weren't a lot of social events going on during the pandemic from 2020 to 2021, because of the social distancing policies that were in place and drug use is typically a social event. And so it made a lot of sense that drug use was declining during the pandemic.And many of us, including myself, expected that once the social distancing policies were lifted, that drug use would return to the levels that it had been before the pandemic. But really, it is quite surprising what we find is that drug use levels have continued to decline and they continue to decline today. And so I think this is good news. Good news, Fredricka, it suggests from what we are seeing, is that just a one year decline in drug use, a one year halt in substance use initiation, which we saw during the pandemic, or a one year stop in drug use among those who have been using drugs, that that seems to have a lasting effect to lower the drug use of teenagers for many years to come.

So children who've experienced a period of homelessness are four times more likely to have developmental delays. And if those developmental delays aren't remediated that will follow them. TAPPER (voice over): Last year, families with children made up about 30 percent of the homeless population across the United States. And more than half of all families experiencing homelessness live in the nation's largest cities.",

We have a huge gap between the minimum wage and a living wage in the city of Boston, we have significant child poverty. So when you put all those together with the high cost of childcare on top of it, it is impossibly difficult for families.TAPPER (voice over): Karian learned about Horizons through the shelter she was staying in. Then her family's life changed dramatically.",

The volunteers warming up shirtless in the 25-degree weather. That strategy, though, did not work, and many Buckeye fans were not in the best mood after the loss to Michigan, but that changed pretty quick. Ohio State just pouncing on Tennessee. The defense smothering Nico Iamaleava hitting him so hard once his helmet cracked. OSU then scoring on every drive in the first quarter. It was 21 to nothing before you could blink. Ohio State would win big 42 to 17 to set up a rematch with Oregon in the Rose Bowl on New Years' Day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Clemson made this game a little interesting late, but Texas had a season high, 292 yard rushing including the 77 yard score from Jaydon Blue that put the game away. Texas beat the Tigers 38 to 24 to move on to face Arizona State in the Peach Bowl.Penn State, meanwhile, got two pick sixes in the first half against SMU. They would blow out the Mustangs, winning 38 to 10. They now move on to face Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. Now, the first ever home playoff games certainly were fun atmospheres, but in the end, they were all blowouts.

I think that was huge for college football, to be able to have those first round games on campus, to be able to give fans a sense of what college football is like week in and week out. If they were just, you know, casually tuning in. So that was really cool to see. Obviously, the games themselves were not great. Obviously, we had a lot of blowouts. That's pretty common in college football. So that was a little disappointing, but the atmosphere on campus were great.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, that is obviously a big part of this conversation, just how not close these games were and that obviously was disappointing when you have the first year of the 12-team playoff. Obviously, we all wanted these games to be a lot closer, but if you look historically at the four-team playoff that we had from 2014 to 2023, virtually every single year in those first round playoff games, we had blowouts, at least in one of those games.Sometimes neither of the games were close, so I think blowouts happen in college football. I think that's just kind of what we saw. But I do think the bigger conversation with SMU and Indiana, I still think the committee was right in putting them in. Obviously, they didn't play great. They didn't play how we've seen them throughout the year, but I don't know how you can keep 11-0win teams out of this playoff, especially with how they played throughout the season. SMU almost coming back and beating a really good Clemson team on championship Saturday. So I think the bigger conversation is maybe some other teams could have done a little bit better. You say Alabama, maybe a Miami, Ole Miss, those teams that were right on the outside. But who is to say that Alabama doesn't go on the road and lose 24 to 3 like it did against Oklahoma or Ole Miss struggling against SEC teams on the road? They lost three to a bad Kentucky team, LSU and Florida. So you just never really know, and I think the committee's job is to put the 12 best teams in and they did that with SMU and Indiana. So I think it will be an interesting conversation with seeding maybe going forward, and it will work itself out in the coming years, but definitely a topic of conversation for sure.",

That would have earned them an outright bid regardless. But I mean, I just don't know how you can keep a team like SMU or Indiana, 11-win teams out, especially when the broader context of the 12-team playoff is to have these programs that haven't really been on these national stages, give them a shot to go out and prove what they can do.Obviously, they fell flat on those stages. I don't think SMU and Indiana are necessarily going away. I don't know if it will drastically change the way that the committee selects these teams, because on Championship Saturday they are human. They saw SMU play a really good game. I don't think you can keep an 11-win Indiana team out, but it is certainly going to be interesting to see if it drastically changes the way that they select the teams. It is not supposed to. Their job is to just look at a given season and put the 12 best teams in. But it is certainly a topic of conversation at least early on in these first round games. I do think in the next round, these games are going to be really, really good and we may forget about these lackluster first round matchups.",
