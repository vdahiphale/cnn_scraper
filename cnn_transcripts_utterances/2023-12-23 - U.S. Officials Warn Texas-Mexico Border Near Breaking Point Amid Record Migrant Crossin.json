I'm Omar Jimenez, in for Fredricka Whitfield.Some officials are warning the southern border is near a breaking point, with thousands of migrants waiting to be processed. CNN is learning that federal authorities are reporting a seven-day average of more than 9,600 migrant encounters at the border this month, which is among the highest ever recorded. So, joining me now is Rafael Romo on the southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas. Rafael, what are you seeing there today?",

Over the last few hours, we have seen how group after group of migrants get here, and that doesn't stop at night, either. After the immigrants surrender to U.S. border patrol agents at the border, they are brought here to this holding area behind me, where they have to wait to be processed.Just yesterday, Customs and Border Protection released the numbers of what they call encounters with immigrants with Border Patrol agents. For the month of November, there were 191,113 apprehensions along the border, and that number rises to more than 242,000, nearly a quarter of a million people, if we add those who seek asylum at ports of entry. As high as those numbers seem, Omar, officials say they're lower as compared to the same period last year. Congressman Tony Gonzales, a Republican who represents two-thirds of the Texas border with Mexico says, help from the federal government here at the border is desperately needed, especially considering that those in charge of protecting the border are stretched very, very thin. This is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): They're exhausted. We're all exhausted. This crisis has spiraled way out of control and we're at the point of no return. That is where we're at, the point of no return. So, while -- the time to act is now. More people are still coming and there's more people in the pipeline. And I suspect Christmas will be worse than today, and New Year's will be worse than today. We're going the absolute wrong direction. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We mentioned before, a daily average of 9,600, but that's across the southwest border. And he's asking the federal government for help providing deportation flights. Gonzalez also says that there's a great need to increase the number of immigration judges here at the border so that people with legitimate cases of asylum can get the help they need, while those who do not qualify can be deported quickly.Meanwhile, immigration activists are demanding a more humane treatment for the people arriving here daily, but both groups agree in one point, Omar, that the situation here at the border is unsustainable.

There is virtually -- other than the fact that they have to cross jungles and difficult terrains, no government is making a real effort to stop any of them throughout the trek, the perilous trek that they need to take through Central America and Mexico. That's partly the reason why Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier, yesterday, as a matter of fact, that he's going to meet with top American officials on Wednesday in Mexico City to discuss the situation, Omar.",

They are people from primarily Central and South America, and they also include people from Cuba, from the Middle East, from all around the world.So when the United States talks about removing all of these individuals, Mexico is really not under any type of legal obligation to take them. And it's up to their secretary of state and their president whether they want to do so.

But these are long-term solutions.And what we're seeing through different administrations is that our Congress is really not willing to invest in those types of solutions. For example, right now, I think President Biden, his approval level on immigration is just 23 percent. That means about two-thirds of the American public does not like the way he's handling immigration, but ultimately any long-term solution would have to come from Congress. There's only so much the president on his own can do. So, for example, in an ideal world, maybe it might be a nice thing to have something equivalent to a Marshall Plan for Central America or certain countries in Latin America, but that can only come from Congress. What we've seen is that the political will is not there. On the Republican side, to be very blunt terms, immigration is an issue that they can weaponize. When the border is in chaos, that works for them because it could potentially help them oust President Biden. And on the Democratic side, we see Democrats, even the White House sort of hesitant to approach this issue because they are wary of perhaps offending middle of the road swing voters, they're also wary of different constituencies such as Latino voters, the immigrant rights community and progressives. [15:10:07] So, politically, the will is not just there in this country, and quite frankly, it hasn't been there in a long time. The last time we had a major overhaul of our immigration system was 20 years ago. A lot has changed and it's likely going to get worse and we don't really see that change in sight unfortunately.",

So, explain that a little bit. Why is the policy -- the distance between the policy and what is reality is going to be maybe so wide right now?",

      "timeStamp": "15:05:02",
      "speaker": "REYES",
      "sentences": "Right. Well, the distance, when we look at it from a legal perspective. When Governor Abbott is coming up with his statewide immigration policy, but under our Constitution, under the supremacy clause, any state law that conflicts with federal law must give way. And we have federal law, we have international treaties, we have treaties through the U.N. that allow all persons to come through our border into the country and claim their lawful right of asylum.So, on top of that, we have over 100 years of Supreme Court precedent that says immigration is the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. So that's, like, the legal problems. But then logistically, this Texas law allows, for example, local state law enforcement to arrest people they think might be in Texas illegally or without authorization. But it doesn't provide them with any mechanisms or guidelines on how to identify these people. So in a state that's 40 percent Latino, in a state where 70 percent of the people are foreign born, that opens the door for racial profiling. How are state officers not trained in asylum law or immigration law, how are they supposed to decide and evaluate someone's immigration status? By the color of their skin? Whether they speak Spanish? Whether they speak with an accent? That's why we're seeing so many Latino groups and immigrant rights groups come forward not just on behalf of undocumented people or asylum seekers, but they're saying that this law could have enormous consequences for anyone who is Latino or even looks Latino in the state of Texas. The law doesn't take effect until March. And I think, although we don't know its impact, we do know that so far, Governor Abbott has spent, I think, $20 million as part of this Operation Lone Star over the last two, three years. So far, it has had no discernible impact on illegal immigration. We do know it's going to cost the state of Texas a lot of money to arrest people, detain people, house them, give them medical care while their cases are adjudicated, because if Texas arrests them, they would be in the custody of Texas. They would be in the custody of Texas. So it's a big bill for the taxpayers in Texas, and going forward the one thing that's a certainty, is that there will be -- there already are lawsuits from the ACLU and other groups. But we're going to see a lot of legal challenges for this law before it is slated to take effect on March 5th.",

For the first time in nearly a decade, the city of Baltimore is on pace to have fewer than 300 homicides this year. So far, there have been about 257 in the city. 2014 was the last time the city had fewer than 300 homicides in any given year.So, with me to talk more about this is Mayor Brandon Scott of Baltimore where I used to be a local reporter. At that time you were city councilman, Brandon Scott. So great to see you. And, you know, I started -- it was right after the death of Freddie Gray, it was right as charges were announced against those officers. And I learned there was a time when Baltimore was consistently under 300 homicides in a year, because all I had personally known of the city, a lot of it stemming from the 2015 year, was a city that was over that number. That was my norm. But why are we seeing such a drop, do you think? MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT (D), MARYLAND: Omar, we have to think about what we're talking about. We did have those years where we were under, but also in the '90s we had years we were above. That's what pushed me into public office, is growing up in a city where violence was so overbearing. But when you think about what we did, coming in the city -- when I took office, had been stuck between 300 and 350 since 2015, and we were able to do something that hadn't been done before. I created the first ever comprehensive violence reduction plan for Baltimore City, bringing everybody together but also putting the emphasis on the ecosystem, creating a community violence intervention ecosystem, treating violence like a public health crisis, focusing police are those who are most at risk of being a victim and a perpetrator of violence through the group violence reduction strategy, bringing in all of our partners between our federal partners, our state's attorney, our U.S. attorney, but most importantly, the community. And that's how we're doing it and doing it the right way because as you alluded to, we also, as you know, were under a consent degree for our police department and our partners at the DOJ and our consent decree monitors are saying that, wow, violence is down right now in Baltimore, our legal arrests are down, and this, Omar, will be the single largest drop on record in homicides from one year to the next in Baltimore city.",

But the one to comes to mind was from July this year, it was supposed to be a block party. Two people were killed, 28 others injured.And in the aftermath of that, you talked about the ease of access to guns in this country, and why you think that's contributing significantly to the violence issues in our cities, including like what happened in July.

No teenager should be able to sit on their computer at home in some state and order a gun and put it together.But also, (INAUDIBLE). This is why myself and Everytown for Gun Safety in the city of Baltimore are actually suing our partners in the ATF because they're prevented from providing information. I can't know as the mayor of my city where the guns that my police officers that work for me, that are under my command, where those weapons come from. And we know, if you've been to Brooklyn and Baltimore, you know how much of a struggle it is for them to get to the other side of town. You know those people that we're arresting with those guns didn't go to Georgia or Alabama or California or Texas or Florida or Ohio to purchase those guns. We need to be able to go after everybody in the chain. The person that pulled the trigger, the person that trafficked that weapon, and sometimes the manufacturer and the store if they are willingly selling to people and helping fuel violence by giving guns to people that they know shouldn't have them in the first place. JIMENEZ: And the last thing I want to ask you is something I actually talked with the previous mayor of Chicago about this, because obviously they have their own issues with gun violence. Sometimes it's hard to line up what you're seeing in the numbers with what people actually feel on the ground. And so, yes, we're talking about, you know, around a 20 percent reduction year-over-year, which is great.

So, when the community itself is out, helping to reduce violence as well, they are (INAUDIBLE) and people feel it.But we also have to constantly be doing more community policing, being out in the community, investing on the front end. This is why we're putting historic levels of investment into recreation and parks and programming for our young people, so that we're doing it at both ends, that we're offering opportunities for people to change their life through our violence reduction strategy, and if they don't, we will bring the full weight of law enforcement on them.

And certainly President Biden is someone who does believe that conversations and recommendations and advice are best offered to the Israelis privately, that they feel like they will have more effect that way. But certainly, President Biden through his advisers and through his aides has signaled that his patience for this level of war, the level of civilian casualties, the humanitarian disaster you're seeing unfold in Gaza, is not limitless. And so, when he says that he had a long conversation with his Israeli counterpart, I think you can kind of read between the lines, as they discuss this eventual shifting down of the intensity of the war in Gaza. I do think it's notable that in its own readout, Israel said that Netanyahu made clear that Israel would continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved. And so, certainly, Netanyahu has his own viewpoint on this. But they were able to discuss this in these days before the Christmas holiday -- Omar.",

And some of that family might be sniffling and coughing all over the place. The CDC is urging everyone to get the latest vaccines against respiratory illnesses. The agency issued a health advisory last week on the urgent need for updated vaccine coverage.So I'm joined by primary care physician and public health specialist, Dr. Saju Mathew, for more. So, Doctor, we finally have vaccines to protect against the flu, COVID-19, and RSV. But these days it can be tough to know what's behind a cough, the flu, COVID, even allergies. How should we proceed if we're unsure, especially around a lot of family? DR. SAJU MATHEW, PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: It's always a dilemma, Omar, especially as a primary care doctor when you're seeing a lot of patients with a cough. Here is one good rule of thumb. If all of a sudden you feel like a ton of bricks hit you, high fevers, body aches, almost always that is probably the flu. With COVID-19, and with the cold, your symptoms are gradual in onset. As people get together at multiple households, it's really good to find out which virus you might have, because treatments are different. If you're high risk for COVID, you can get Paxlovid. If you have the flu, you can get a medication called Tamiflu that decreases the number of days you're sick.",

In the end, 14 people lost their lives, many of them were students, a couple of them staff members, before the gunman turned the gun on himself. What we've been hearing from police, as well, is that their swift response. They say given the weapons the young man had and ammunition he had on him, they believe it could have been far worse than it was. And it was that swift response by police that allowed it to -- the motive who prompted this young man with no criminal record and legal access to firearms since he had a permit to act in the way that he did. We've been hearing also from the country's interior minister speaking of the fact the country had already been looking to tighten its gun laws. Whether or not that would have made a difference, he said, it was too soon to say. It is now a day of national mourning that the country will look ahead to on Saturday as it remembers those who lost their lives so tragically on Thursday afternoon. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.
