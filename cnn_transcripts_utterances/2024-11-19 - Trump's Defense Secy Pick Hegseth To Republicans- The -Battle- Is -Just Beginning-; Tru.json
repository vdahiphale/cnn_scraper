And I have new reporting about one of the President-Elect's most embattled Cabinet picks. I'm Kaitlan Collins, in West Palm Beach, Florida. And this is THE SOURCE. The picks of who will staff a second Trump term are coming out of Mar- a-Lago, at a record pace. And tonight, another familiar TV personality has been tapped for a top position. The President-Elect is going with Dr. Oz to oversee health care coverage for more than 150 million Americans, nominating him as the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Mehmet Oz, of course, ran unsuccessfully for Senate, two years ago, with Trump's backing, in that race. He's a cardiothoracic surgeon. He does have a medical degree, unlike RFK Jr. who was recently nominated to lead the Health department that his agency will fall under, if he is confirmed. In the past, we've seen Dr. Oz previously push questionable weight loss drugs, and COVID treatments, that were not backed up by science. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MEHMET OZ, AMERICAN TV SHOW HOST AND PHYSICIAN: And now I've got the number one miracle in a bottle to burn your fat. It's raspberry ketone. What I believe is one of the most important discoveries we've made to help you burn fat faster. Green coffee bean extract. This is what four-scone (ph) does to your belly fat. Whoa.",

Allegations that he has repeatedly denied, I should note. The former Congressman will personally be on the Hill, tomorrow, alongside Vice President-Elect JD Vance, to lobby senators, in-person, alongside some of Trump's other Cabinet picks. That includes, we are told, the veteran and former Fox News host, Pete Hegseth. That's Trump's pick to run the Pentagon, who is facing a confirmation battle of his own, after he was accused of sexual assault. He denies the allegation, and his attorney has acknowledged that he did pay the woman, who made it in a settlement agreement, but argued that the encounter was consensual between the two of them. I have new reporting, tonight, that Hegseth told Republicans, during a prayer call, this evening, that was hosted by the Republican National Committee. And I'm quoting from Hegseth now. He said, quote, \"This is a battle that is just beginning.\" Hegseth was seated next to his wife, during the call, he said -- and he said that his family's had an outpouring of support since he was named, and \"That's the reason why we can endure the attacks and the onslaughts.\" Here with me tonight is CNN's Kristen Holmes, in West Palm Beach, as we're covering all of this coming out here. Pete Hegseth, those comments were notable, tonight, because it was really one of the first times we've actually heard from him, since he was announced, and since he was facing these questions, of whether or not he can get confirmed.",

They were talking to him with legal terms. He wanted a bomb-thrower. He wanted somebody, who was going to go out there, get on TV, and spit fire.

He is choosing people, who have gone on television and defended him in the past, who have gone on television and talked to millions of viewers. I mean, even when Mehmet Oz was running for Senate, and Donald Trump came out and campaigned for him, one of the things he kept saying about him, when he was talking at rallies, or in interviews, was, Have you seen how good he is on television, when he talks to people, the women just love him. That is what Donald Trump values. And when we talk about Donald Trump's cabinet, like Sean Duffy, for example, I mean, even before he was a Congressman, before he was a Fox News host, he is a reality TV star. He did Real World: Boston. I mean, these are people, who have spent a lot of time in front of a television. And you can see that Donald Trump is building them out to be, what I've been told, is effective communicators. Donald Trump wants to look up at Fox, wants to look up at the TV screen, and see his Cabinet picks, out there, defending him. And in order to do that, a lot of these people have to be TV-trained.",

But some environmental concerns at the launch site prompted the FAA to delay previous tests. And Musk is suing the FAA (ph) for what he alleges is regulatory overreach. It's really just one example, of how the incoming Trump administration will technically be both Elon Musk's biggest customer, and potentially one of his biggest headaches. It's a question tonight. My source tonight is the retired NASA astronaut, and retired Navy Captain, Scott Kelly, who is also the twin brother of Arizona senator, Mark Kelly, who, of course, knows a thing or two about space flight himself. And it's great to have you here, sir. Between how effectively SpaceX -- SpaceX dictates NASA's launch schedule, and also how the Pentagon is relying on Musk to get a lot of its satellites into orbit. What do you think the Trump-Musk relationship means, for the future of areas like space and defense? SCOTT KELLY, RETIRED NASA ASTRONAUT, U.S. NAVY (RET.): Well, certainly, there's a lot of potential, I think, for a conflict of interest, when you have a guy like Elon Musk, who's involved in so many companies, so many different kinds of technology companies, also working in the U.S. government, as the head of an organization that is going to decide which things we keep, and which ones we throw away. So, on one hand, Elon's an incredible engineer, incredibly talented, does some amazing things. On the other hand, this, I don't think it passes the smell test very well.",

This is where President-Elect Donald Trump has been interviewing potential candidates to run the FBI, which is the clearest signal yet that he plans to fire Chris Wray, who still has three years left in his 10-year term that Trump appointed him to.In a since-deleted tweet, Vice President-Elect JD Vance today pushed back on criticism that was directed at Senate Republicans, who had missed a vote confirming a judicial nominee of President Biden's, last night, by saying, quote, \"I was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including... FBI Director.\" My next guest is deeply-sourced on all things Trump-world and the Republican Party. Semafor's Shelby Talcott is here with me.

And it was, let's just say, very interesting time, in the Oval Office, there, where I briefed prior presidents, dozens and dozens of times, and this was the most interesting time. So, I think what they're looking for is somebody who can not only protect the American people, because obviously that's the FBI director's job, in leading the men and women of the FBI, to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

The other name that's been mentioned, Mike Rogers, I've known him for a long time. And he understands the FBI, because he was an agent, as you mentioned, in Chicago, as what's called a street agent.
