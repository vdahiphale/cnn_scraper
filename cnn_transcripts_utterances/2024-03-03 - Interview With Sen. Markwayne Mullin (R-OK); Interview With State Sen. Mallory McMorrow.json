Nikki Haley says that Trump can't beat Joe Biden without the 30 to 40 percent of the Republican voters she wins in many of these primary contests. Senator, do you think she has a point? SEN.

Nikki has the right to run. Everybody has the right to run. I commend everybody that puts their name on the ballot. However, at some point, you have got to call it.

You can feel that way and still look at a binary choice in November. And this is what happened in 2022. People are underestimating women. People are underestimating how angry women are. People are underestimating how much women, particularly in a place like Michigan, mobilized and fought to codify Roe as a constitutional right in our state. And there's no way we're going backwards on that. So I think we always look for who do you love as a candidate, instead of the binary choice of, at the end of the day, when it comes down to my personal freedom and what I want moving forward...

Younger voters, there is a 16- point drop between those who said they voted for Joe Biden in 2020 versus who they would vote for in 2024. We saw this in the poll we did at Young America's Foundation before the first debate. Number one issue with college students was the economy. Nearly four out of every 10 college students said that they didn't believe that they weren't confident that Joe Biden was effectively doing the issues that they cared about. This is why these polls are showing it there in \"The New York Times,\" but, more importantly, in battleground states like mine.",
