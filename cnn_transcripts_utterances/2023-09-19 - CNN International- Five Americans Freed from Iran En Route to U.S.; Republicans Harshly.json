Among them, Siamak Namazi. He was arrested in 2015 while on a business trip to Iran and charged with having relations with a hostile state. After nearly eight years in prison, Namazi was Iran's longest held American prisoner. Feeling abandoned by the U.S. earlier this year, he appealed directly to President Biden in an unprecedented interview with CNN from inside the notorious Evin Prison. SIAMAK NAMAZI, AMERICAN HELD PRISONER IN EVIN PRISON (via phone): Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out to finally hear our cry for help bring us home. ANDERSON (voice over): Also freed, dual Iranian-American citizens Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi. Tahbaz, an environmentalist, was arrested while on a trip to Iran in 2018. Shargi, a businessman who moved with his wife to Iran from the U.S. in 2017 was also detained in 2018 on similar charges to that of Namazi.",

We're in a campaign season, we're essentially running up to the next presidential election more or less, this time next year. So Republicans are taking a shot at Democrat President Biden over what he's done here. But the reality is Democrats and Republicans have negotiated with hostile governments to get Americans freed from captivity.Think here of President Trump when he met with Kim Jong-un. It was only a few days or weeks or so before when several Americans were released by the North Koreans. You know, Kim Jong-un got a different price there. He got to be on the world stage. You got to meet President Trump. He got to, you know, he got the attention that he was seeking. So there are different deliverables other than money. And the case that the Biden administration is making which is accurate, is that this was Iranian money that have been -- that they'd that they'd paid -- that that was being held by South Korea. And all that's happened now is being put in account that Iran can get access to it, but there are controls and monitoring on what it does with that money. It has to be used for humanitarian -- for humanitarian goods. So there's a there's a win narrative on the part of the White House, but there's -- it has put them in a position where they will be pilloried for this, as they are pilloried for many things in this tense political season.",

It was once again proven that it's no real surprise that weakness arouses evil. It's truly remarkable to think, as we gather here today, the Biden administration just extended a visa to the President of Iran. A man responsible for genocide. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who just arrived in New York to speak at the United Nations. When I'm president, I won't give criminals like Raisi a visa to allow them to set foot on American soil, and we will never, ever pay ransom to terrorists or terrorist states. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A federal judge says he'll decide soon on Jeffrey Clark's bid to move his criminal case to federal court, where he could encounter a more favorable jury pool.

Clark is a former Trump era Justice Department official and one of the ex-President's 18 co-defendants indicted for allegedly trying to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Two legal experts weighed in on Clark's chances.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN GOODMAN, FORMAL SPECIAL COUNSEL, U.S. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT: So I think that it's bad news for Clark. It looks like he's going nowhere. He's going to be tried in Fulton County, Georgia. And it also is a sign for Donald Trump. If you're going to try the same idea of a bid to remove your case to federal court, you might have to testify. Part of the problem for Clark is he didn't testify and the burden is on that individual to prove their case. Without that evidence, without that testimony, it looks like it's really going nowhere.",

The U.S. President Joe Biden is amongst those delivering remarks today before holding a bilateral meeting with the UN Secretary General. Mr. Biden is the only leader of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council to attend. Leaders will be discussing a host of issues, from climate change to the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the annual meeting in person for the first time and is set to address the assembly in the coming hours. He'll be seeking more support for his country amid the ongoing war with Russia. On Monday, Mr. Zelenskyy visited Ukrainian soldiers undergoing treatment and rehabilitation in New York. He also honored some soldiers with awards. Mr. Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Biden and U.S. lawmakers later this week. Ukraine says air defenses shot down 15 of 18 Russian drones flying towards the western city of Lviv just overnight, and the city's mayor says one person was killed. Three industrial warehouses caught fire in the attack, including one full of humanitarian supplies that was destroyed. Meanwhile, the command of Ukraine land forces says troops have successfully broken through a Russian defense line on the Eastern Front. They've liberated two key villages around the Bakhmut region in the past few days. Military officials say the over the -- and the overall the situation remains difficult because Russian forces are fighting to claw back every inch of territory Ukrainian troops regain.

While we are seeing these battleground movements on the southern and the eastern frontline and while we're also seeing the diplomacy now playing out in New York with Zelenskyy courting various leaders from around the globe, there are also civilians who are going about their daily life in Ukraine that are getting impacted by this war and are constantly at risk. We're now hearing reports that one man has died because of the drone attack that Russia allegedly launched over the city of Lviv. The Lviv mayor saying, that there was only humanitarian supplies there. There was nothing military in those warehouses. Huge fires set off as a result of these attacks.This is ongoing throughout and now Zelenskyy is in New York. He will be showing and demonstrating this kind of incident to leaders to explain why he so desperately needs more weaponry, more support, more allied help throughout his counteroffensive. Because the Russian attacks don't stop. And we've been seeing these throughout the conflict. That he needs more weaponry, he's claiming, these long range missiles he keeps talking about from the U.S. He's now secured some aid from Germany just in the past day 400 million euros worth of military aid from Germany. He says he needs more from all of his allied countries and also, crucially, as we go into these winter months. Because not only are these Russian attacks quite difficult and quite strenuous for civilians, but also as we go into winter and the cold weather arrives, the energy and infrastructure that Russia may target is again going to make civilian life even harder. And if again, the counteroffensive was to slow or to stop, and that is the risk if they don't keep making this progress, the fear is on the battlefield, that Russia will then have the time to refortify those defensive lines. So really two risks in the months ahead as we go into these winter months and all of this is going to be on the agenda. All of this is what Zelenskyy is going to be talking about with world leaders as we're seeing him arrive in New York today.",

The European Union has released $5.2 million in humanitarian aid for those affected by the floods in Libya. In a statement on Monday, the EU said the funds will be channeled through partners already active in the country to lend more assistance with shelter, food, water, hygiene and more. Eight Member States have contributed to aid to Libya so far. The EU says they've allocated. 36 million euros in aid in the wake of the disaster.
