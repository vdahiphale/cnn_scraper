But it is just incredible to think that 28 people suffered gunshot injuries in the chaos here last night. Now, we are in the Brooklyn homes section of Baltimore. And last night people here were gathering, just like many other communities are doing across the country right now. They were celebrating the holiday. They were having a block party, a cookout. And shortly after midnight, police tell us shots rang out. We have been speaking to residents here who tell me that it was absolute chaos. People running around, trying to take cover.

One person is in custody and police say at least four firearms were fired inside the building.It has been another gruesome year of gun violence in the U.S. and we're just past the halfway point of 2023. There have been 338 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The research group defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed, not including the shooters. And the archive reports more than 21,000 people have died this year from all forms of gun violence. French authorities say 45,000 police will be deployed across the country tonight following violent protests over the last five days. More than 2,000 people have been detained, many of them minors. Last night, officials say protesters targeted the home of a mayor of a Paris suburb in an attempted murder. Attackers rammed a car into the house in order to set it on fire. France has been gripped by violent demonstrations since police shot and killed a 17-year-old during a traffic stop on Tuesday. CNN's Nic Robertson is live for us in Paris.

It's 11[17:10:00]] So many tourists out tonight, but it's been less violent, less cat and mouse, less police racing around on motor bikes at high speed and less racing around in police vans with the sirens blaring. So, in the central Paris it seems to be so. From what we're hearing across the rest of the country, there is still trouble in some areas, but not at previous levels. Last night was a real test to see if there would be a pivot downwards. Is the trend going to continue tonight? It seems to be so at the moment -- 871 fires across the country in the previous 24-hour period into -- through Saturday into Sunday. That's a good metric to look at because if you look at the previous night, it was 2,560. The previous night, 3,880 fires. So, you can see that trend down. The same with the arrest. The number of detentions were down last night. The number of police getting home was down. The number of government buildings getting damaged was down. But what we've heard from government officials, we've heard this from the prime minister today who, by the way, went out to meet with that mayor at the city hall, his house as you say was attacked. His wife, two young children in the house, the children were 5 and 7 years old, and his wife, her leg was badly broken as she tried to escape the house with the children, one of the children hurt. And the message we heard from the prime minister after that was look, we're going to be tough with justice on all those people who perpetrated violence. We're going to be tough in terms of security. So, again, tonight, that 45,000 police in gendarmes across the country. But at least for those here in central Paris on the Champ- Elysees tonight, it looks like being a quieter night than last night.

They're also concerned about the wear and tear on families. As we so often hear, you know, in the Pentagon, you recruit the service member, but you retain the family.

They're also reducing commitments. Officials said they've reduced commitments in the Middle East particularly, especially as foreign allies and partners in that region can provide some of their own air defense. So, they're going down from five battalions to two battalions. And really these leaders are just encouraging leaders throughout the chain of command to communicate with military families, make sure that they are mitigating some of the unpredictability there with these deployments and ensure that they're taken care of. So, leaders are working behind the scenes. They're aware of these concerns, but also know that these demands on air defense are not going anywhere, if only they're only increasing.",

Air defense falls into three categories, man-portable, the ones that are fired from a soldier's shoulder like the Stinger missile, something they call LOMAD, which is the low altitude equipment, like the Gepards (ph) or the Avengers that we're seeing in Ukraine right now.And then there's the high-mat (ph), the high-altitude equipment that shoots down Cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and high-flying aircraft. It's the high-mat area where there are the problems, the so- called Patriot systems. And it's very easy for the public to say, hey, let's just send the Patriots here or send them there, but there are very few of these equipment. They're called high demand, low density pieces of equipment. There are several areas in the army that are like this and Patriot is the number one system that's like this. And it's because number one, they cost so much. Number two, it takes so much time to train soldiers on them. And number three, they have defensive requirements in various parts of the world as Haley mentioned, Korea, Taiwan, the Middle East, and we've been supporting our allies and partners with some of these systems as well.",

And what happens is when you give those pieces of equipment away or when you send them off to allies, the soldiers that remain that are still doing a very viable mission are stuck with taking up the slack.It's like taking an entire organization, cutting it by a third, and then saying, hey, continue to do the mission you've been asked to do. That's what's happening. So, the 10th AAMDC in Europe is just one of several that are like this. And yeah, work is good, but there's not that many of them.

So, there's been a lot of conversation around that. The other thing I want to notice is those statements that were made at the very top of that clip, it's unclear whether or not the DeSantis team knew what they were doing, but they were taken a month after the Pulse shooting, and they were when Donald Trump was accepting the Republican nomination. And if you actually listen to the entire speech, which I did afterwards, the next lines are protecting people from domestic terrorism.

We just saw the Koch brothers saying that they were going to put $70 million against anyone, essentially, to run against Donald Trump.But the question is, you know, who is that going to be? Because many people believed it was going to be Ron DeSantis, that he was going to come out and really take on Trump head-to-head. And right now, even with two indictments, Trump is still leading in the polls. So, it's unclear if there's going to be a moment where DeSantis has a breakout.

Now we're picking up an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain on top of what we've already had. Tomorrow, that threat continues to push eastward, still looking at New York, D.C., stretching back down into Atlanta, where the potential for severe storms, and a separate area across areas of the Midwest where we could still be looking at some damaging wind gusts as the main threat. Another concern is going to be the heat over the next few days. Two separate areas, we're looking at the southeast for we have heat advisories in effect and some excessive heat warnings out to the West. Temperatures here likely to get into the one teens, if not even as high as the one twenties, especially across areas like Death Valley, Las Vegas and Palm Springs.
