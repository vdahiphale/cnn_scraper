I unequivocally apologize. At that moment she also voted for a House resolution condemning anti- Semitism. And just yesterday, before this vote, she co-sponsored another resolution condemning anti-Semitism and calling Israel an ally of the United States. Would any apology be enough for you to believe she could serve on this committee?",

She apologizes and she continues to spew this type of rhetoric.And, you know, my colleagues focused on the anti-Semitism. In my speech I focused on the anti-American comments because the point is you're representing our country, our Congress to foreign governments. And to have this anti-American viewpoint that you're going to blame our country for what Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro did to their own people in destroying their country and driving those people out into - into poverty because of communist and socialist policies, I think that's a major problem.",

It's about them knowing about our military capabilities. It is about them purchasing farmland here in the United States near military installations, about stealing intellectual property and about -- even in New York, having a CCP police facility right here in the city of New York to spy on, you know, Chinese Americans, many of those I represent.

So, where they got it a little bit off, it was because they undercounted. This is a very, very strong job market. And the employment rate, 3.4 percent, ticked down just a tiny bit. The government pointing out that since the beginning of 2022 there's been no real meaningful change in what is nearly a 50-year low for the unemployment rate. And the government also points out that the hiring was always - it was widespread, led by leisure and hospitality, which, as you know, is a part of the economy that has been booming as people have like shook off three years of kind of restraint and now want to spend on experiences, they want to go out. So, this is a really strong number. This is not what you would expect after eight interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

And what I was so struck by was what you heard from people saying, you know, about one of these clinics, that they would go down there, they would buy them for $3 a pill from these clinics, they'd go back to Kentucky and sell them for $20 and make all of this money. They said they would even sponsor people to go down there for their doctor's visits to bring pills back to other states. DARREN FOSTER, DIRECTOR, \"AMERICAN PAIN\": Yes. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. Yes, the story of \"American Pain\" is basically the story of the greatest drug racquet to hit south Florida since the cocaine cowboys of the 1980s. You talk about the profit margins. Yes, a pill that could be bought for $3 at a clinic in Florida could be resold for ten times that much. And the profit margins were so big that people that were typically dealing in traditional street drugs, like heroin and cocaine, made the switch back in the mid to late 2000s to get in on the pill racquet because it was just much more profitable.",
