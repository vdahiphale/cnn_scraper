President Biden just moments ago speaking as he is sitting alongside Ukrainian President Zelenskyy ahead of their critical bilateral meeting that they are now -- that's now taking place right now. They're both in France. As we know, the president has been there to mark and honor the greatest generation, the 80th anniversary of D-day, and he has been making the connections of the threats to democracy and freedom back then and the direct line to the threats to democracy and freedom today, pointing directly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the example.Let's talk about what the president just said, though, first. We have CNN Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche. She's traveling with the president. Stick with me, Kayla. Let's listen first to President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And I'm not going to walk away from you. I apologize for those weeks of not knowing what's going to happen in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money in it. Some, some of our very conservative members were holding it up. But we got it done finally. And since then, including today, I've announced six packages of significant funding. Today, I'm also signing an additional package for $225 million to help you reconstruct the electric grid. And but once we got the national security bill passed, that was a political issue, we were able to get it all done. And the way you've stood and holding on and holding on in Kharkiv, and you've proven once again that people in Ukraine cannot and will never be overtaken. And I assure you, the United States is going to stand with you. After you said that all during this debate, I continue to say, the United States is standing with you. You are the bulwark against the aggression that's taking place. We have an obligation to be there. And so I'm looking forward to having a detailed discussion with you about where we go from here, but we're still in, completely, thoroughly. Thank you.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, in this new aid package is ammunition, artillery, air defenses, and other critical systems that the U.S. will be providing to Ukraine as part of the sixth package that stems from that supplemental package that was passed earlier this spring after a six-month delay.This, of course, comes ahead of President Biden's meeting with President Macron of France later this week and his G7 summit next week, and, of course, the NATO summit next month, where they will all be discussing new and novel ways to provide aid, not only military aid, but also financial aid to Ukraine as this war nears its third year. President Zelenskyy has asked NATO countries for more fighter jets, more Patriot anti-aircraft systems. He's made some very tall asks and what some allies have described as a shopping list that continues. But today, the U.S. is committing yet another package, $225 million, to help Ukraine continue to make up for some of those losses on the battlefield. That is what the two presidents are going to be discussing in that meeting that you saw just now. President Biden is expecting to get. A detailed state of play on what's happening in Ukraine on the ground and in the air in that country as he has just newly authorized Ukraine to be able to use some of the American-made weapons to strike just over the border into towns where Russia is unloading weaponry to be able to strike into Ukraine. That is a new capability and the president is likely to get an update on how that is going in today's meeting. Later today, he's going to come where I'm standing right now. This breathtaking backdrop, it's called Pointe du Hoc. You may remember it from when President Reagan delivered a speech here 40 years ago, 1984, commemorating the 40th anniversary of D-Day. Now, we know that President Biden is going to be honoring one veteran in particular. His name is John Wardell, 99 years old. He served in the U.S. Army and landed here at Pointe du Hoc just days after the D- Day invasion, just days after those brave Army Rangers, 225 of them, sacled the 100-foot cliffs here at a high cost of life to destroy the German lookout positions that allowed the U.S. and allied forces to succeed on land and at sea on D-Day. We're expecting the president to talk about the heroism, the bravery of Wardell and others and be joined in the audience by many French officials and local leaders. Although at this point, we do not expect the attendance of French President Emmanuel Macron. But there are going to be many themes that will draw parallels to the address that Reagan made 40 years ago, the dangers of isolationism, the power of democracy and the desire to connect what happened here on that day and the bravery of those specific Americans to what is going on, on the frontlines of Europe today, to try to make it real for people at home as there are beginning to be some doubts about U.S. interventionism overseas, as the U.S. continues to be involved in two hot wars that are now going on much longer than the administration expected.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right that those were really the two key things. On the one hand, President Biden saying, look, the U.S. is now in it in the long run, but then also apologizing for some of the delays that happened in some of those weapons shipments, of course, as it was unclear whether or not Congress was going to approve with the Republican House leadership, whether or not it was going to approve any new weapons packages.And you're absolutely right, Omar. I was on the ground in Ukraine when all of this started happening. And when the Ukrainians, I think it was in September of last year, those ammo supplies, especially really became very scarce. They had to ration some of the ammunition. They were very low on artillery shells and it was very difficult for them. They felt all but abandoned by western nations, specifically by the United States, because there simply wasn't enough ammo coming through. And I think what we saw just there, the president sitting there with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy showed that those two leaders but also the alliance right now of Ukraine and its western backers are very much in a different place now than they were before that decision by Congress was made to approve that aid once again. You see right now what's going on in that the Ukrainians have stabilized the front lines in many areas. The president, I think, was talking about the Kharkiv region, where the Russians had been making some advances, but especially since the U.S. has allowed Ukraine to use U.S. weapons, western-made weapons, to fire across the border into Russian territory, as Kayla said, in a very limited way. That's done a lot to hold the Russians up, but also, of course, the fact that the Ukrainians now have a lot more in the way of ammunition and are getting new weapon supplies has also made a big difference as well. The Ukrainians themselves, by the way, have also really stepped things up in a big way as well. As far as mobilization is concerned, they're getting a lot more guys mobilized, a lot more soldiers mobilized and are getting those to the front lines as well. So, right now, that alliance is in a completely different place than it was before. And I think there's one more thing that we also need to pay attention to, Omar, which is absolutely key, and that is the fact that the U.S. is now back on board, in full strength, makes a huge difference also to the allies. You just had the president of France promising those Mirage fighter jets, but you also had for instance the Germans also allowing the Ukrainians to use German weapons to fire across the border as well. So, it certainly seems as though those nations have found their footing and they're certainly projecting a pretty bold picture right now with the president there sitting with the president of Ukraine, Omar.",

People briefed on the matter tell us that his daughter, Naomi, and his uncle, James, are going to testify as part of the defense.They are here to blunt some of the very painful testimony that the jury already heard about Hunter Biden's rampant drug use in 2018, the year he bought the gun. Hunter's attorney said in his opening statements that Uncle Jimmy was a big part of the support system and even paid for some of Hunter Biden's treatment. But, Omar, those are not the only Bidens we're keeping an eye out for. The first lady, Jill Biden, was in France yesterday for the D-Day commemorations but she's back in Delaware today and expected to return to the courtroom to support Hunter before flying back to France for the state visit this weekend. Look, looking ahead to next week, the defense has to make a key decision. Is Hunter Biden going to testify? It seems unlikely. And if he decides to not make that bold move to speak in his own defense, then both sides think that this case could wrap up early or mid next week, which would lead us to jury deliberations.
