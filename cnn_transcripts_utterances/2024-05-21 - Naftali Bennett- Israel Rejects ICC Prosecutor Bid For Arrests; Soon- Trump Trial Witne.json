He is there to discuss the State Department's budget but, of course, will likely face a lot of questions about Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas.Blinken blasted the International Criminal Court for requesting arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leaders. He said the U.S. rejects the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas and called the move shameful. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Washington. Alex, what can we expect today?

Blinken on Capitol Hill ostensibly, as you said, up there to talk about the State Department's budget. But really, he is going to get pressed on all of these international issues -- front and center, of course, Israel's war in Gaza. Questions over the U.S. support for Israel, particularly when it comes to military aid.We have seen recently the U.S. hold back that shipment of 5,200-pound bombs for Israel over concerns about what Israel is doing in Rafah. Israel's ramping up its operations there. Concerns by the U.S. that could turn into a major operation, which the U.S. says it has still not seen. But President Biden, of course, has threatened to cut off more offensive weaponry for Israel if they do step up that operation. We can expect Sec. Blinken to say that the defense of Israel for the U.S. is ironclad and that will continue. But this pair of Senate hearings, Sara, coming the day after the ICC said it would seek those arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister and defense minister. Both Blinken and his boss, President Biden, have come out swinging against the ICC's moves. As you noted, Sec. Blinken saying that it -- that is was shameful. That he fundamentally rejects this equivalence between Israel and Hamas -- excuse me. But then, of course, there are a number of other international issues that we can also expect the senators to try to get to. We have the death of the Iranian president in a helicopter crash over the weekend. Major questions over the direction of that country both in the short and the long term because the supreme leader is getting older. Questions about succession there. And then when it comes to Ukraine, of course, that fight is still raging. The U.S. has just said that it will commit another $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. Questions about where that aid will go as Russia advances more in the northern part of the country. So plenty to get to for these senators as Sec. Blinken sits down in front of them twice today, Sara.",

NAFTALI BENNETT, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER (via Webex by Cisco):  It's a farce. It's a moment of shame for the ICC and for the international community if anyone supports that act.

He also wants a 10 percent tariff on U.S. imports.As you mentioned, he's championed tariffs as a way to protect middle- class, working-class Americans. But this new research from the Peterson Institute finds it would actually do the opposite, saying that his tariffs would cost consumers $500 billion a year. That's 1.8 percent of GDP. That's huge. Some context: that's almost five times bigger than the cost of the last tariffs during the Trump administration. And the average family -- the typical middle-income family would get $1,700 in costs here. Now, it's hard to make out how much of Trump's tariff talk is just bluster and how much of it is real.",

In fact, Graceland is the second-most visited home in the country behind only the White House.So, Elvis' granddaughter, Danielle Riley Keough, is fighting to stop a foreclosure sale of the famous Graceland property that's scheduled for later this week, alleging fraud and claiming that, look, the company behind the sale doesn't even exist let alone own the rights to sale her family's property. Now, Keough is the current owner of Graceland after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died last year. According to court documents that were obtained by CNN, Keough has been able to obtain a restraining order against the sale of the property before any court can rule on her application for injunction. So, how did we get to this point when it comes to Graceland? Well, in the lawsuit, Keough says that last year, Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC presented documents that claimed her mother had borrowed $3.8 million from the company and used the deed for Graceland a security -- collateral, if you will. The firm claims Lisa Marie defaulted on that loan so, therefore, Graceland is now their property. But Keough's lawsuit says that those documents presented are fake. Her mother never borrowed the money and never used Graceland as collateral. The court documents go even further, identifying a Florida notary whose name is on those documents presented to them. But that notary says she \"never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her.\" Now, CNN has tried to reach Naussany Investments. We sent an email to their address and received an out-of-office response that said they'd be back next week. We called the phone number and it was not there. We checked with the Missouri Secretary of State's office and there's no company listed by that name. We couldn't find one nationally. A statement from Graceland DBA Elvis Presley Enterprises was sent to CNN. It read, \"Elvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent. There is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\" John, that foreclosure sale is scheduled for Thursday of this week but there is a chancery court hearing on this lawsuit tomorrow morning in Shelby County, Tennessee.",

This comes as his campaign is releasing new funding totals for last month and the results a bit mixed. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live at the White House. Give us a sense of these numbers, Priscilla, and they are a bit mixed. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Sara. And look, fundraising has been consistently a bright spot for the Biden campaign and they are continuing to tout that even though, as you see there, there was a drop in April compared to March. They raised $51 million in April. When you compare that to the month of March, that was $90 million in March, of course, that was also a month where they had their high-profile fundraiser in New York, and there's more of those to come over the course of the summer. Now, if we break down these numbers, the campaign also noted that recurring donors contributed over $5.5 million last month. They also continue to tout those grassroot fundraising numbers. The majority of donations coming in under $200. Now, that's important. Oftentimes, when you talk to campaign officials, they point to those numbers to note that there is continuing enthusiasm among voters despite the low poll numbers. Now, big picture here, the Biden campaign has $84.5 million cash on hand. That still outpaces the Trump campaign. And when you combine the campaign and affiliated committees, that $192 million. So they're still bringing in a lot of cash and they're using it to grow their ground operation, opening up more offices nationwide and hiring more staffers. Today, the president will go to New Hampshire for an official event on veterans' issues, and then will follow that with campaign fundraisers in Boston -- Sara.",

And Matt Gorman, Republican strategist and a former senior adviser to Tim Scott's presidential campaign.Karen, you heard the reporting right there. I want to read you a headline from a month ago -- some headlines from a month ago. \"President Joe Biden raised more than $90 million for his reelection campaign and the Democratic Party in March, a whopping haul in a month that saw him pivot a general election posture. The campaign announced it has a war chest of $192 million in cash on hand, describing it as the highest total amassed by any Democratic candidate in the history at this point in the cycle.\" And now, a drop in fundraising for last month, Karen. A sign of a problem? KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 CAMPAIGN:  No. I think when you have $192 million cash on hand you're doing just fine. And as Priscilla was saying, when you're looking at those grassroots small donations that really does give you a sense of not just sort of countering the polls but enthusiasm. If people are giving and they are -- those are reoccurring donations -- which, again, those numbers are also quite high -- that's a positive sign. And don't forget, we don't have -- the Democrats don't have to spend any money on legal fees which, unfortunately, that's what we're seeing on the side of the Trump campaign.",

He can campaign more and fundraise less? MATT GORMAN, REPUBLICAN STRAGEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  I think -- I think a couple of things. It seems, according to reports this morning, Trump's saying he raised about $76.2 million. He was always going to get a bump once he got the official nomination and he could raise larger amounts of money. So he could really get about $800,000 a clip from the highest donations, right? I think you couple that with the fact that the polls look a lot better for him. And I think there's been some depression among Democrat activists. But I'm having flashbacks. Look, the dirty little secret is every campaign will spin their fundraising numbers however, right? So if you don't have an impressive amount raised you tout cash on hand and vice versa. And so, it's -- really, you can find anything in these sorts of reports to spin one way or another to make yourself look good.",
