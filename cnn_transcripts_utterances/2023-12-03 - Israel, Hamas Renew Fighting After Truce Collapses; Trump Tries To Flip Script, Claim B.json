Good morning, and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. This morning, the Biden administration issuing fresh warnings to Israel over civilian casualties in Gaza as the war enters a new phase. Israel continues to pound the Gaza Strip with heavy airstrikes, including in the south where it says Hamas leaders are taking refuge and where many civilians have fled. It's the third day of fighting since the truce collapsed. Hamas has launched scores of rockets into Israel. And as many in the president's own party criticize his handling of the war, the vice president and secretary of defense ratcheting up the pressure on Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Seung Min, you are at the White House. Every day, you've been reporting about this debate within the Democratic Party about how exactly to deal with this aid that the Congress is trying to approve for Israel. There was some debate about whether it's the condition should be placed on this aid to Israel, as you can see from your headline on the screens. Just divisions within the Democratic Party. You reported that the White House essentially told senators they would not favor of conditions for Israel. But you're also seeing this uptick in warnings to Israel as we enter this new phase in the war. What do you make of the way they're navigating this?",

So they are pretty committed to it as a strategy. Joe Biden believes he's doing the right thing by continuing to hug Israel close because he thinks that's how he has the most influence. This is something he has thought for a long time in his career of the way to deal with Israel, but also on the politics of it to your point the strategy inside the White House. And the Biden campaign is one that they believe firmly that having some diminishment of support among progressives or young voters of their coalition that they believe that they're going to have an easier time bringing those pieces back into the fold once the full contrast campaign with Trump is engaged.",

You know, you saw the kind of shift over, since the October 7th attack, from his staunch vocal support of Israel to highlighting more of the humanitarian concerns. Kind of making it clear that he was pushing, you know, Bibi behind the scenes about making sure that they are minimizing civilian casualties. But the -- but the kind of his broad approach remains.

This is classic Trump. So now on threat to democracy, which Donald Trump has proven himself clearly to be a threat to American democracy. You see him trying to flip the script here again. And, obviously, it doesn't apply to Joe Biden. There's no factual pattern to suggest that Joe Biden is a threat to American democracy. But the question is, does this have the potential to be successful branding for Trump? And I say that because, you know, I watched this week, Tucker Carlson sat down with Roseanne Barr, two big Trump supporters talking about his support for Trump. And they are, in that conversation, you hear one of the reasons that Tucker Carlson is so committed to Donald Trump that he said, is because when the Feds went in to Mar-a-Lago, that for him was an unthinkable thing and seemed totally like a political strategy from Joe Biden using the Justice Department and the law enforcement to go after his political opponent. Again, there's no evidence of that, but it's not just Donald Trump doing a branding exercise here. There are tens of millions of Americans and supporters who are committed to this belief that Joe Biden is somehow tinkering with this. And just look at our most recent polling, Manu, election integrity and voting rights, that's like second most important issue to people, to the economy, equally important to Republicans and Democrats.

And she was concerned about it and she went to Johnson, who was supposed to call her, according to Greene, never did before Thanksgiving.Finally, he decided to connect with her just ahead of this second vote that she was going to force on impeaching Mayorkas, you know, she said he heard her out, gave her assurances that impeachment would move through committee and onto the floor, address the other matter as well. But it just -- and she did agree to pull that so she did not force the vote in the end.

Now, H.R. 2 is that very hardline immigration package that is favored by House Republicans, but that package is not going anywhere in the Senate, which is led by Democrats. So what kind of a package can get? You know, 20 -- you know, 25 members of Senate Republicans, a majority of Senate Democrats and get enough House Republicans. That is a math equation. I'm not sure anyone has figured out and this comes at a time when the White House is beating the drum louder on how urgent it is to pass Ukraine funding.I don't -- it was really significant when John Kirby, the National Security spokesman said this week that we have until the end of the year. This is the first kind of timeframe that the White House has put on the need for Ukraine funding.
