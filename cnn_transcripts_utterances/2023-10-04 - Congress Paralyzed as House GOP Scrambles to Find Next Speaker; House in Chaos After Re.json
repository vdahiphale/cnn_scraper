The fact that these eight individuals teamed up with AOC, Ilhan Omar, Jamaal Bowman, who pulled the fire alarm the other day, to upend a vote, and Hakeem Jeffries, is disgraceful and it's wrong. The American people elected a House Republican majority to serve as a check and balance on the Biden agenda. They have torpedoed the work that we were doing. They talked about the need to spend single subject spending bills. They have delayed that indefinitely and, frankly, be put whoever the next speaker in a very precarious situation to negotiate with Chuck Schumer and the White House. And so, as far as I'm concerned, I want to know from any potential speaker how they intend to deal with those eight, number one.

We have a lot of work to do between now and November 17th to reduce spending in this country. Joe Biden increased spending by $5 trillion in two years. It is unsustainable. You look at a state like New York, my home state, $9 billion budget deficit next year, $13 billion the year after, a $36 billion revenue shortfall. This is unsustainable across the country. And If we don't get serious about reining in spending, if we don't deal with the migrant crisis at our southern border and stop the open border policies, the sanctuary city policies, the right to shelter that somehow is being interpreted to mean that if you're a migrant, you automatically get free housing, free health care, free education, all at taxpayer expense, this is absurdity and it needs to stop and we need to get serious about these challenges.",

Paul Ryan decided to leave because he's just kind of over it, and Kevin McCarthy now has been deposed as well. The entire generation of new Republicanism that was supposed to take over the mantle is gone, and what they've been replaced with -- the House is always a messy institution, but this is a different level.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  It is a different level. And part of why they're gone, Paul Ryan also wasn't really able to manage this growing extreme faction within the House GOP and Boehner wasn't either. And so that's why Paul Ryan is gone. He now talks about that he doesn't always agree with the direction his party is headed in, he doesn't support the standard-bearer, Donald Trump, would prefer someone else to be at the top of the presidential ticket. But when push comes to shove, Kevin McCarthy decided to, time and time again, make decisions that emboldened that hard right faction and decided to make it so they could only have one person bring the motion to vacate. And even yesterday during his meeting with the caucus -- or the conference when he decided to say, I'm not going to run for speaker again, the fact that he said, I'm not going to sell my soul to the Democrats pretty much shows that he was far more willing to, time and again, do what the extreme Republicans wanted versus even just negotiate a little bit with Democrats to stay in the speakership.",
