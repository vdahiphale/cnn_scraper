The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is OUTFRONT on who she thinks is behind the attacks inside Russia.Plus, Governor Ron DeSantis about to hold his first major event in Iowa as a presidential candidate. He's going all in for evangelical voters. Can he peel them away from Trump this time? And calls for a boycott against Chick-fil-A. A conservative revolt over a DEI executive. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, land, air, and sea. Ukraine bracing for an all-out assault from Putin, including potentially devastating attacks by Russian submarines. This is according to a military spokesperson. And our Fred Pleitgen who is in Kyiv where he says they are preparing for what could be a major retaliation by Putin. And we're going to check in with Fred in just a moment. Because that fear is coming after at least eight drones targeted wealthy Moscow neighborhoods overnight, an area where Putin himself has an estate. This is the first time since the beginning of the invasion that civilian areas near the capital of Russia have been hit. Putin spoke out today, blaming Kyiv for the massive drone attack. Ukraine denies responsibility for it, but one of Putin's loyalists in the Duma said that the drone attack in Moscow is leading Russia down to the nuclear line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN LAWMAKER (through translator): The situation is not going away. Rather, it is escalating. Unfortunately, the response could include using all available means of the Russian armed forces. Tactical nuclear weapons won't be sheathed for much longer. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are images of a train derailed, again, inside Russia, a train said to be carrying much-needed fuel for the military. Now, Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for the train strike. They haven't claimed responsibility for any of those infrastructure strikes. But, as I said, they outright deny involvement in the Moscow drone attack. But I do want to share with you what an adviser to Ukraine's president said, which is basically that Moscow deserves to feel the fear of living in a constant state of danger.

What do you think is the most likely scenario of who is responsible? LT. GEN. CHARLIE \"TUNA\" MOORE (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE: Well, good evening, Erin. Obviously, this could be some type of false flag operation conducted by the Russians for the reasons that you just played in that tape. It's a way of galvanizing the Russian citizens behind this continued war effort. Or it could be the Ukrainian forces, the military forces or some type of proxy force. If I had to guess, I would say it's more likely the matter. And the reason I say that is because I look at what's really to be gained by the type of operation that we saw occur inside of Moscow today. And, in my mind, it's really about messaging the Russians, that Russia, and even Moscow, and even a wealthy neighborhood inside of Moscow, is not safe, and should not be viewed as a sanctuary. And the reason that message is important is because that will then require the Russians to use some of their air defense capabilities, whether it's missile systems, antiaircraft artillery, or electronic warfare capabilities to protect Russia and Moscow. And if they're protecting Russia and Moscow, they can't be used inside of Ukraine.",

They really want to set out to contrast him with Trump and even with President Joe Biden, both men significantly older, of course, than DeSantis. So they want to really project him as an energetic young new force to voters here in Iowa, and then across the country as well, including in other early key states, Erin, where we're going to see him later this week.

And just as a reminder of kind of where their head is right now in terms of the campaign, he's going to be right back here on Saturday.

It showed people that this guy can perhaps make it through a general. I tend to believe he can't, but this abortion question is on the ballot in 2024. And people who know DeSantis know that he's believing that the Republican voter, the average one, is consuming news far differently than they were in 2016.
