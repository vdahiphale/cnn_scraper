If you just join us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories this hour.The race for U.S. House Speaker took a surprising turn in the past few hours with former President Donald Trump endorsing Ohio Representative Jim Jordan. He and Steve Scalise are the only two Republicans who've said they'll seek the leadership position when the House reconvenes next week. Plus, a stunning new report from ABC News. And \"The New York Times\" about Donald Trump and America's military and nuclear secrets. The outlets cite sources who say Trump allegedly revealed details about U.S. nuclear submarines to an Australian member of his Mar-a-Lago club months after leaving the White House. The U.S. president currently says he's being forced to add some new construction to Donald Trump's border wall, even though that means violating a campaign promise. Joe Biden insists border walls don't work but claims he can't get out of expanding the barrier. CNN's MJ Lee explains.

So that will no doubt add momentum to Wall Street when it opens. This is how it all started with Asia, only the Nikkei was down across that region. No big developments moved the markets on Thursday in particular. All of the major indices closed relatively flat. The markets will be closely watching though, for signs that inflation is still not under control and the September jobs report could be a key indicator of that. Economists are predicting a slowdown in the jobs market, according to Refinitiv Data, the Labor Department is expected to report that employers added 170,000 new positions last month. That's down from 187,000 jobs added in August. Analysts say the labor market is still strong, with unemployment expected to inch down to 3.7 percent.

He played nine seasons for the Bears and was selected to eight Pro Bowls. He was known for his intensity on the field but retired at age 31 after a serious knee injury. His larger-than-life personality led to a second career in acting. Now he appeared in a string of TV shows and movies, including \"Any Given Sunday,\" \"Necessary Roughness\" and \"The Longest Yard.\"The Washington Commanders paid tributes to him before their game against the Chicago Bears on Thursday Night Football. The Bears had yet to win a game this season, but quarterback Justin Fields caught the fire -- caught fire early. He ended up with four touchdown passes on the night, three of them to DJ Moore. The victory breaks Chicago's 14 game losing streak, which dates back to October of last year. Tom Brady's final game jersey could set a record when it hits the auction block next month in Las Vegas. Buyers are expected to bid up to $2.5 million for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers number 12 -- grass stains and all. That price would make it the most valuable jersey ever sold by more than double. Brady wore the jersey last February in the final game of his career, which spanned 23 seasons. He retired with seven Super Bowl rings and a long list of NFL Records, of course.
