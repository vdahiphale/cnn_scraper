There are -- there are a couple pieces here.The first one being that Donald Trump has incredible sway among the House Republican conference. They listen very closely to what he says. He's got a lot of loyalists there. Much more so than the Senate, although, you know, there are more Trump loyalists there, now. When he was president, you know, a single Trump tweet could send the House, you know, spinning out, basically, and that reality still exists. He has, frankly, done more on that score to lock down support among the House GOP conference. So from this -- from this perspective, it says to me, it's going to be much harder for a Steve Scalise to get to 218 votes needed to be speaker, because a lot of those people are going to listen to Donald Trump and back Jim Jordan. Now, the second piece of this is those moderates that Kristen was talking about. And they are a very critical block, but there's a key difference between the moderates and the hard-liners. The moderates think governing is important, and their interests are not around a prolonged vacancy here with the speakership. They've not been as willing, because they care about governance, to blow up everything in order to get what they want. And so I think it's much more likely that you see them work behind the scenes to figure how to work with this, than to openly revolt against it.",

I feel that there are certain moderates who -- who don't want to be associated with Trump and Jim Jordan's close relationship with Trump, him, you know, leading the charge against [SIC] the Joe Biden impeachment.

And you had the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, in the middle of all of it, struggling to try and explain this contradiction between a president saying that the border wall is ineffective; that very same president and his administration moving forward with that construction. Instead, what she simply said was that this administration doesn't believe it is an effective use of funds. And effectively, that their hand was forced by this 2019 appropriations bill that had to be used, funding of which, had to be used by the end of this year.
