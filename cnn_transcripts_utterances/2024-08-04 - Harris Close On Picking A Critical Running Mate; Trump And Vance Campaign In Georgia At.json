      "sentences": "You're in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in New York. Vice President Kamala Harris about to make what could be the most consequential decision of her political career so far. Right now, Harris is deciding who will join her on the Democratic ticket as her running mate.Today, she's meeting with at least three top VP contenders, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Earlier today, we saw a motorcade with Pennsylvania license plates rolling out of the vice president's residence there in Washington, D.C. And last hour, former Attorney General Eric Holder, who's been helping with this vetting process, you saw they're giving the cameras a thumbs up. Now, the big announcement is expected to culminate with a campaign blitz across multiple battleground states that you see right there. It will begin Tuesday in Philadelphia, where Harris will introduce her running mate to America for the very first time. So we will continue to follow this developing story and bring you reports throughout the next couple of hours. In the meantime, former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, were in the critical swing state of Georgia on Saturday. They held a rally in the same place where Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned just a few days ago. But besides attacking his likely opponent, Trump blasted Georgia's popular Republican governor as well. CNN's Alayna Treene has more.",

And remember, this has been a struggle for Trump's campaign.They have spent the entire election cycle thus far going after Joe Biden. They actually largely ignored Harris on the campaign trail up until Biden ended his campaign. And so they're really reimagining that playbook and trying to see what is the best way to define her. Now, I also found it interesting that he tried to tie Harris to Hillary Clinton. He noted and really mocked Harris for having celebrity performers at her rally at the exact same venue in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier in the week. Should people like Megan Thee Stallion perform? And Trump argued that he found the whole act to be phony. Now, he also mentioned that it reminded him of Hillary Clinton having people like Bruce Springsteen perform for her on the campaign trail back in the lead up to 2016. He argued and kind of joked that he has a bad trait and argued that he only likes people that like him. Now, another notable moment last night or several moments, I should say, is when he repeatedly criticized and attacked the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp. Remember, Kemp was very central to pushing back on Trump's claims that the 2020 election and specifically the election results in Georgia were rife with fraud. Now, Kemp has said that he was not going to support Donald Trump in the Republican primary, but he has said that he would support him in the general election. Trump called him disloyal despite that and said that he was trying to break up the Republican Party. Jess?",

What I can say is this is, over my 12 years in Congress and then my couple of years since like, yeah, I've matured on a lot of things as I've grown older, but I'm still basically the same guy and I believe the same stuff.

Mark Kelly, I love because he's a pilot and a NASA guy, right? So that's a cool thing for me. And then Shapiro, obviously, Pennsylvania is very important.I think really any of them will be helpful because you just compare them to J.D. Vance. And, you know, he talks about childless cat ladies. These folks will be talking about the future, which I think is a pretty big difference. But I would say probably specifically for Republicans, I'm not sure if there's any of them will make a difference.

And she has a legitimate point of view to say that. I mean, first off, J.D. Vance, like a couple of years ago, was super anti-Trump and now he's his vice president.But, you know, she can say, look, I was a senator in California, which obviously is a pretty left-wing state. And then she became vice president, a representative for the whole country. And so you can see these issues from a different perspective when you're vice president. I think it's important to take those head on, to point out the number of -- Donald Trump does not even really have a true North Star in terms of what he believes anyway. From the Republican perspective, they would be smart politically to focus on the issues. The problem is, as you talked about in the lead up to this, Donald Trump can't help himself from going into attacking her race, saying that she doesn't know what race she is or he doesn't know what race she is, or then turning around and saying, you know, Governor Kemp, the most popular governor in a swing state, is a bad person. It just goes to show how entirely online they are, looking at Twitter, looking at Truth Social and totally disconnected with what the vast majority of Republicans and Americans really want.",

We just wanted to make sure we're getting everybody the latest on that ongoing story as she selects her running mate.Congressman, I also wanted to ask you about this rally that the former president had last night in Atlanta.

To go after him is like, and again, just from an analyst's perspective, it's nonsensical. It's bizarre.But here's the thing. Donald Trump, to his credit, is really good at kind of sensing the crowd, knowing where applause lines are. You can actually, if you watch him, see him adjust what he's saying in the moment to get those applause lines. And so he had a crowd in front of him that probably was the most hardcore, you know, stop the steal, you know, election truthers that actually believe the election was stolen and he knew we could get an applause line like that. So that makes him feel good on the stage because everybody loves to be applauded. But that's doing real damage to the campaign. And so, you know, from my perspective, keep doing it because it's not going to be helping him. But just from a Republican perspective, I'm sure his staff was shaking their head and just like, you know, Mr. President, you got to stop doing that kind of stuff. But he won't.

I mean, they used intelligence, they got in there, they did this incredible thing. And Netanyahu's warning today also designed to deter.But Hezbollah and Iran have been humiliated. Their intelligence has been completely penetrated, and they worry that if they don't retaliate, that they will lose the support of the rank and file and they will lose the ability to deter Iran from -- from attacking them again more in the future.

They've changed their lineup. We don't know for sure whether these illnesses are linked to the races that took place in the Seine River, but there have been a lot of questions about whether this was a wise decision on the part of Paris authorities. It is the water levels, the rain that affects the bacteria levels in the River Seine. Some days it's possible to do it, some days it's not. Tomorrow, the relay race will go ahead regardless, and they say the water quality is such that it can. But, of course, lots of questions now as a result of these two athletes getting ill so quickly after their dip in the Seine, Jessica.",
