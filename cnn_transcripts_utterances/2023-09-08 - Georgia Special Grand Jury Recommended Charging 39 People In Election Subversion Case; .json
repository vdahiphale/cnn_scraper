Prominent names in a bombshell special grand jury report revealing folks who narrowly escaped indictment in Fulton County, Georgia -- Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and former Senator Kelly Loeffler, and former Senator David Perdue. As a report now made public sheds even more light into the alleged conspiracy to steal those 16 electoral votes and who was involved. Plus, inside the presidency of Joe Biden. A reporter who says he came to appreciate the man he now calls the old hack who could. Plus, just hours ago, a Philadelphia police officer was charged with murder. As new shocking body cam video released shows the deadly shooting of Eddie Irizarry. (MUSIC) TAPPER:  Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start in our law and justice lead with this shocking report from the Fulton County, Georgia, especially grand jury. The report shows grand jurors recommended charges against 39 people. That's 20 more than District Attorney Fani Willis ultimately did indict. And there are some pretty big names on the list. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who testified before the grand jury last year. Graham, you might remember, had called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about the possibility of voter fraud in Georgia. Raffensperger testified to the January 6 Committee that the call made him, quote, uncomfortable. Graham just reacted this afternoon to the stunning news from the grand jury. The grand jury has also recommending bringing charges again the two then Georgia Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Purdue personally urged Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to convene a special session of the state legislature so that the legislators could overturn the will of the people of Georgia based on discredited election lies, lies that members of Trump's own Justice Department had investigated and found completely baseless. Loeffler was part of that meeting. The special grand jury also recommended charges against three Trump allies. Michael Flynn who promoted Trump's baseless theories of voter fraud and urged Trump to seize voting machines. Boris Epshteyn who helped organize illegitimate slates of pro-Trump fake electors. And Cleta Mitchell, who was a volunteer legal adviser for Trump and helped the campaign file a lawsuit to invalidate Georgia's results, a failed lawsuit. She too was on the infamous call between Trump and Raffensperger. Our coverage starts today with CNN's Sara Murray who's been tracking the developments in the Georgia elections case for months and she has the big takeaways from the shocking report.

Do we think we could take this to court and prove this to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, which is different standard than what you are thinking of even if you are the regular grand jury who is just handing up an indictment? So, that's something prosecutors had to consider.It's also interesting to see in a number of these figures, including Kelly Loeffler, Lindsey Graham coming out and slamming prosecutors, essentially saying they're politically motivated, even though they didn't ultimately face charges.

So, ultimately, it's the prosecutors job to sit down and review all the evidence, right, because you know, she has the lawyer, she is the attorney and the special purpose grand jurors are not, and make a determination whether or not, not just a law was violated but do they have enough evidence to prove that that law was broken beyond a reasonable doubt. And I think the fact that, you know, that these votes for indictment or these request for indictment that they weren't unanimous I think that speaks volumes because listen, when you're conducting a special purpose grand jury, there's no defense lawyer there, there's no judge there, you're presenting evidence and there's no resistance to that.

Initially, what the Philadelphia police said happened on August 14th was that police pulled over Eddie Irizarry, and they say he got out of the car and failed to listen to the commands of the police officers that are responding at the scene, and that's why shots were fired, resulting in Irizarry's death.Well, soon after that, the family of Irizarry's own attorney came out and found neighborhood surveillance video showing a very different picture. And that is why they wanted the full extent of both body camera footage of the officers to be sent out to the public, and that is why we are seeing this today. Because you can see in that video, it is very clear that Irizarry was inside of his vehicle, seemingly not a threat to police officers when they pulled him over and you could see as you mentioned, Jake, several shots fired within seconds of the police officers exiting their vehicle during that police stop. We know one of the officers has been charged with a number of charges. He's been released from jail at this point on $500,000 bond after turning himself in. The other officer is not facing any charges.",

It's not within policy because you shot a man who was behind a closed door with a window up who may have displayed a knife at some point. That does not make a justifiable shooting.In the legal sense, there are some factors here that will be interesting. The partner sees what he says is a knife in his hand and yells across the car to the officer who fires the shot, he's got a weapon. The officer who fires the shots is telling him to show his hands and the minute he starts shooting, he starts retreating and ultimately runs behind the car to take cover. It is suggestive that the officer who fired the shots thinks that this weapon may be a pistol or a gun.

But I think that there is going to be a lot of explaining to do from a defense perspective and what do I mean? The reality is, is that the analysis by the prosecution will be threefold. Were you an immediate fear of death or serious physical injury? If the conclusion to that at the time you fired your shot was no, what were you firing it for? Were you acting in a willful way that was without justification? So that is step number one.If there's no immediacy, there shouldn't have been a shot fired, much less two, three, four, five or six. The second bill argue from a prosecution's perspective is the disportionality of the force. Did you need to discharge your weapons that many time? And the third issue, Jake, will be the issue of reasonableness. Final thing and that is the consciousness of guilt argument. What does that mean? Why write a report that is so different from what the ultimate facts show on the particular tape if you concluded in your state of mind that what you do was completely justified. Okay. Then say that in your report and say that things that John Miller alluded to, that you heard about a knife, right, you were concerned it could have been some other weapon. You with were moving back because you were running for cover. That's not what the reports says so prosecutors will use that to know that the state of mind was far different, you knew you did something wrong, and that's why your report was inconsistent with reality.",
