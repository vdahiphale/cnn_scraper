And as of now, it seems like a question for the Vice President Kamala Harris is, does your running mate wear glasses? Every parent right now is laughing at home. But sources tell CNN the focus is on two governors, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of my home state of Minnesota. But, and isn't there always but? We're told you cannot rule out Senator Mark Kelly, which is why he's still on that screen, or maybe even a surprise from the rest of the shortlist. Shapiro, for his part, seems totally unfazed by the chances that his life could soon change with a single call. Here he is shooting hoops with his son outside of his home today, but maybe instead of playing the shooting game, of course, they're playing the game White House. Now, depending on who you ask, the V.P. choice has massive consequences for her chances or it may not matter much at all. Got to love politics with that respect. Let's say that history could be a bit of a guide here. The thinking is that she has to pick someone like Shapiro to deliver a critical swing state like Pennsylvania. Well, in 2012, there was a lot of emphasis on Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan from Wisconsin to help him carry that state. \"The New York Times\" on that selection, \"Republicans hoped the V.P. announcement would start the race anew, as well as help make Mr. Ryan's state of Wisconsin more competitive.\" Well, the Romney-Ryan ticket lost Wisconsin and eventually the election. Further back to 2004, you remember John Kerry went with North Carolina's John Edwards. A number of reasons for that particular pick, but among them was the thinking that Edwards would help Democrats finally win North Carolina. \"The New York Times\" from that announcement, \"The addition of Mr. Edwards would put North Carolina into play and bolster Mr. Kerry's bid in other Southern states.\" That also did not happen. You get the point I'm making. Best laid electoral plans sometimes do not work out. The hometown kid does not always guarantee electoral votes. You still have to campaign, which is part of what's good about democracy, right? And while Democrats have been jockeying and pushing for one pick or the other, there are plenty of others in the party who think anyone on that list will do the trick. I mean, just listen to how former Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it tonight on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I said any one of them would have made a great vice president, but only she would be able to judge who she had the best simpatico. Now, I think they're all great. And whoever she picks, I'm for. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The person who has been known to not only reach across the aisle but also bring in some of the expansion folks that she's looking to talk to that have long left the Democratic Party, when you talk about those working-class voters and things like that, specifically some of the white male vote, that's probably going to be Shapiro.
