Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has come on fairly strongly here at the end, getting a lot of attention. He's 60 years old. He's been the Minnesota governor since 2019. He served for 24 years in the Army National Guard. He was in Congress for about 12 years, elected six times from a former Republican district, and then he went to have that, and he's a former high school social studies teacher.

He's in his first term as governor of Pennsylvania. He was the attorney general. He would be the first Jewish vice president. Of course, he's the second one if he was picked. Of course, Joe Lieberman back 24 years ago. And that favorability rating, this is central to him there. And also, he has won three times statewide. When he was elected governor, he won by 15 percentage points. That is huge, of course, in one of the biggest battleground states of all that has 19 electoral votes. Going on to Arizona senator, Mark Kelly. Of course, he is an astronaut, 60 years old. He's been a senator for 20 - or since 2020. A retired Navy pilot. He had 39 combat missions under his belt, but it's that astronaut, spending more than 50 days in space on the endeavor and the discovery there, which certainly sets him apart from any politician. And he's also married to a former congressman, Gabrielle Giffords. So those are the three finalists. But again, all eyes are on these governors.

And we also know that behind the scenes, the U.S. has been engaging in some furious diplomacy. A call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as incredibly tense that took place yesterday and a call with King Abdullah of Jordan and President Biden today focused on efforts to deescalate tensions in the region. Now, this comes as this meeting in the Situation Room has some parallels with the situation that unfolded in the middle of April, the last time President Biden convened this team for this very reason, the expectation of the potential for retaliatory strikes by Iran. The strikes that unfolded then were seen as more limited nature, but the scope of the potential at this moment is still unclear. Of course, it's been the priority of the administration to refrain from the situation in the Middle East becoming a wider war, and that has been the goal for nearly a year at this point.

Certainly Hezbollah is also inclined to retaliate against Israel, not only for the killing of Hamas's leader, but also for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander last week. We know that the Israeli military is not only preparing to ready its air defense assets in the event of a strike on Israel, but it is also beginning to plan for potential retaliatory actions. We know that the Israeli military's top general, Gen. Herzi Halevi today was reviewing and approving operational plans for the Israeli military, not only defensive ones, but potential offensive action as well. We've heard similar language from the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over the weekend, vowing that Iran will pay a very heavy price should it carry out an attack on Israel. As of now, the guidance to Israeli civilians from the Home Front Command remains unchanged, but we do know that several cities in Israel, including Haifa, where we are now, have instructed their residents to begin making preparations to ensure that their bomb shelters are stocked and ready to go should they be needed. There is a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region right now to try and prevent a major Iranian attack on Israel or at least to ensure that what follows will not escalate regional tensions. That seems unlikely at this hour, and so instead what we are seeing is not only those military preparations that Israel is making, but also the top U.S. general for the region. General Kurilla meeting today with top Israeli generals as well as the Defense Minister, talking about readying that international coalition that helped defend Israel against those 300 drones and missiles back in April to try and get that coalition back together in the event of another Iranian attack.",
