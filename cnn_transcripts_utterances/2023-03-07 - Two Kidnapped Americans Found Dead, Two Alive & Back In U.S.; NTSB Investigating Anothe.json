Local officials say one person has been detained after two of the U.S. citizens were found dead in the border town of Matamoros. The two others are thankfully alive, though one is severely injured, according to a U.S. official, and those two have returned to the United States for medical treatment and observation. Family members say that the four were a tight-knit group of friends traveling from South Carolina to Mexico so that one of them could get a medical procedure done across the border. But once they crossed from Texas into Matamoros, friends believe that the group got lost and was then abducted. The Justice Department, White House, and state department said they are trying to figure out exactly what went wrong. U.S. official previously told CNN they believe a Mexican cartel likely mistook the Americans for Haitian drug smugglers. Our reporters are covering every angle of this story. CNN's Rosa Flores starts us off from the border town of Brownsville, Texas, where officials have identified the victims and the survivors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

After what a U.S. official tells CNN was a case of mistaken identity. Two members of the party were found dead, and one of the survivors is severely injured with a bullet wound to his leg, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.In the party of four, Latavia Washington McGee and Eric Williams survived. Zindell Brown and Shaeed Woodard were killed. They crossed the border from Brownsville, Texas, into Matamoros, Mexico, on Friday for McGee to obtain a medical procedure, according to a friend of McGee's. They drove a white mini-van with North Carolina plates across the border and got lost while trying to locate the medical clinic where they were headed, the friend told CNN. Before they were able to locate the clinic, disturbing video shows the aftermath of the kidnapping, as heavily armed men loaded them into a white truck and transported them to various locations to evade capture, according to Mexican officials. The Mexican president saying today during a news conference that those responsibility will found and punished. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation told CNN they believe a Mexican cartel kidnapped the group after mistaking them for Haitian drug smugglers. Mexico's president saying the Americans were caught in a confrontation between two groups. The State Department has issued its highest level four warning, do not travel to the Tamaulipas state, where the group was abducted, due to heavy crime and kidnapping in the region.",

I'm told there are very close relationships between FBI agents and Mexican authorities and so all of that was being leveraged in order to try to identify where these victims are. It is also worth pointing out that although we are now getting a resolution, very tragic here to this incident, investigation is not over.

Of course, there was a 22-year-old girl, a Mexican national, on her way to pick up her child who was also caught in the crossfire of this cartel group that my source tells me, they thought they were attacking Haitian nationals, they ended up killing these two Americans, injuring the others, and then killing this 22-year-old Mexican national.

That is the most common. Cosmetic surgery, weight control procedures are typically done in larger cities where they have larger hospitals, because they require more care after the treatment.

After a series of high profile diplomatic squabbles, China's new foreign minister drew a red line with the United States over the issue of Taiwan. And he defended Beijing's relationship with Moscow, Russia. CNN's Selina Wang went to the National People's Congress in Beijing to find obstacles for journalists covering the foreign minister's tightly controlled debut. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the biggest annual political meeting known as the two sessions. It's the first since China abandoned its zero-COVID policy. But reporters covering the event are still stuck in a COVID bubble, required to stay overnight at a quarantine hotel and get an on-site PCR test. We just left the quarantine hotel right now, headed to the venue. Everything is highly controlled. The foreign media bus gets dropped off at Tiananmen Square. It is very rare for journalists to get access to this. As you can see, there is heavy security, there are guards everywhere. Normally, the two sessions is the rare chance for media to get up and close to China's top leadership. Right here on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, this is normally where you will see media trying to door stop the top leadership. But as you can see, this year, we, the media, we're completely separate from the rest of the leaders. The two sessions is a carefully choreographed event. The new government shakeups that the rubber stamp parliament will vote on have one unifying goal, to strengthen Xi Jinping and the ruling communist party's power. And the COVID restrictions are the perfect tool for Beijing to control the message. So, media has to apply to get access to specific events. We're not granted approval to all of them. And this is the media area inside the great hall of the people. As you can see, it's pretty empty, so, it's clearly not an issue of capacity. Some of the events during the week-long meeting allow expect reporter questions, including the first press conference as China's new foreign minister. He said that conflict with the U.S. is inevitable, if Washington does not change course. Qin Gang called Washington's approach a reckless gamble, accused the U.S. of creating a crisis over Taiwan, defended China's partnership with Russia as imperative, and said it has not supplied weapons to Russia or Ukraine.",

DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK):  Well, I know the foreign minister, and I think his comments about the United States needing to pump the brakes or there's going to be some kind of conflict, I think China, the Chinese Communist Party, Jake, is the one that needs to pump the brakes. Look at what they've done in terms of aggressive actions in the last two years. I mean, obviously the pandemic is a huge issue. But with regard to its neighbors, whether it literally was a shooting war on the border with India, the crushing of any kind of liberty and democracy in Taiwan, the crushing of what's going on with regard to the Uighurs, an economic embargo and coercion against Australia, and the aggressive actions that they take almost daily in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, that's just in the last two years.

The Alaska Federation is very supportive. This is something that we mentioned to the president in our meeting with him on Thursday.And what's really frustrating for us, and particularly Alaskan native leaders -- they were here in force last week in front of the Capitol, we held a press conference -- was this idea that, look, the main drivers of shutting down the willow project are Lower 48 environmental groups. And they like to come up and tell Alaskans, particularly Alaska natives how they should be living their lives. A lot of my -- a lot of the Alaskan native leaders that I know in our state are starting to call this the second wave of colonialism, eco- colonialism from Lower 48 environmental groups that don't know anything about Alaska and come up telling Alaska natives that have been living in our great state for thousands and thousands of years how to run their lives. So, I think the president, this is exactly the kind of project that President Biden should be supporting. It's got the highest environmental standards in the world, his own environmental impact statement from his administration said that. If you focus on racial equity, environmental justice, the vast majority of the native people support it. The vast majority of American working members, unions, all support it. Every union in Alaska supports this project. And, of course, we're talking about China right now. One of the biggest things Xi Jinping fears is an American energy dominance. This is really important for our national security, as well as our domestic energy security and jobs, so -- we're hopeful that the president is going to finally support this project. It's been in permitting for many, many years, as you mention, and it's got the vast majority of Alaskans. One thing I did, I handed the president a resolution from the Alaska legislature, the House and the Senate, back home, every member of the legislature signed that resolution.

That's exactly what we have heard from Ukrainian forces who we've been speaking to on the front lines. They fear that Russia would continue to push westwards while you have a lot of officials and analysts saying they wouldn't be able to. We do expect Ukrainian forces to dig in west of Bakhmut if they were to lose the city. So there would be a lot of officials, military commanders and military analysts who might take -- who would quibble with President Zelenskyy saying there, that there would be an open road. But no doubt that Ukraine has been very successful at degrading those Russian forces. NATO has estimated that for every Ukrainian troop that has been lost that five Russian forces have been lost and so, this fight is far from over but Ukrainian forces continue to stand their ground but no doubt, if Russia were to take Bakhmut, it would be a significant victory for Russia.",
