A mistake or a crime, President Biden's lawyers alert the Justice Department. They discovered Obama era classified documents at a Washington office Biden used during the Trump presidency.Plus, a juggling act abroad today. The president sitting down with neighbors to the north and the south. The Biden White House wants help curbing migration and drug trafficking. Mexico's president says the United States needs to pay more attention and give more respect for Latin America. Plus, first on CNN. A special counsel Jack Smith, is Rudy Giuliani with a new subpoena? It's for records about how Donald Trump paid him if Giuliani tried to overturn the 2020 election. Up first for us, though, new CNN reporting on the classified discovery, kicking up a storm of questions for the current president of the United States. A source telling CNN the documents found in Joe Biden's private office included intelligence memos on a range of allies and adversaries, Iran among them, more details in just a moment. But just minutes ago, no response from President Biden. He is in Mexico to shouted questions about this classified material discovery. It's a repeat of last night. The president hearing then ignoring shouted questions, asked to talk about that disclosure. Look at the picture. Where is he, next to the attorney general of the United States Merrick Garland, who will eventually have to decide if this inquiry into his boss deserves a special counsel. Here's what we know this hour. The find has sparked a federal investigation, ordered by attorney general Garland and led by a Chicago U.S. attorney who has a Trump administration hold over. 10 documents the source says, were classified markings and they date back to Mr. Biden's time as vice president. And Biden lawyers say, they follow procedure to the letter, immediately alerting the national archives when those documents were found back on November 2. But there is also plenty still in need of explanation here. No explanation as of right now for why Mr. Biden had those documents or exactly what they contain. No explanation also about why the Biden White House kept word of the documents and the investigation quiet for two plus months now. Already, Republicans making a very public case, Congress should look into this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL WALTZ, (R) FLORIDA: How long have they been sitting around who had access all of this time? How many people had access all of this time? Where's the FBI raid? Where is this big show of force to make sure there's no other classified documents there? REP. DUSTY JOHNSON, (R) SOUTH DAKOTA: I don't know enough about the difference in the volume and the difference in cooperation. I think those are questions that we've got to have a committee ask. I guess at this point, I'm not wanting to take the Biden administration's word for it. Let's ask a few follow-up questions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is a standard process. This happens, actually, you know, more often than people realize, not just with former presidents, obviously, and former vice presidents.So, the FBI has a process where they take a look at these documents, to try to understand, you know, whether they're still classified, what - who owns that information, which intelligence agency would own that information? And then, whether there's been any harm done to national security as a result of them being stored in a place where they should not have been in clearly. This is what that that's the case where what happened here. What I understand has happened now is that Lausch and his team have completed at least the initial part of this, and they've come back to the Justice Department, they've come back to Merrick Garland, and the attorney general faces an important decision. It's sort of an inflection point of this investigation, which is, what do we do next? Do we open a formal full-blown investigation? And having seen Merrick Garland operate, Chris Wray operate. You know, I think - you know, we've seen them try to make sure that they make sure everything is done by that book, cross every T and dot every I.

But from what we know so far, there are some significant and very, very important factual differences. That doesn't mean politically. We'll get to the politics in a minute. This is you see the Republicans bring in the Congress. Let's investigate. See, everybody does it. Here we go. But in Biden's case, fewer than 12 documents, some top-secret U.S. attorney investigating, and again, based on what we know right now, his attorneys found this, immediately raise their hand and said, we have a problem, please, what's the process? In Trump's case, 160 plus documents, 60-top secret. He's been under investigation. He had lawyers sign off that all of them were returned, they found out they were not returned. This went on for months and months and months, and in fact, is still ongoing. What do you see as the differences we know right now from a legal perspective?

How did the documents get there? And that will take a little bit of work because it happened a while back, they need to trace that. How secure were they in that particular room?

JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: How that could possibly happen? How one anyone can be that irresponsible? And I thought, what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods?

And my understanding is that the president is going to be careful with that because of the DOJ inquiry, maybe not an investigation yet. But when it comes to the facts that you just laid out in that graphic, that is what you're going to hear from the president. And he's right, they are very, very different situations. The Trump situation was he or his people took classified information, and then misled or even lied to the national archives and the federal government about what he had it to the point where they had to go raid.

It's extremely important for the Biden administration to acknowledge this sort of thing. You know, AMLO is he's popularly known, stayed away from that summit on democracies, because he felt the agenda was wrong. And there were people being excluded, countries that were being excluded, that shouldn't have been, he has clashed with President Biden. I thought it was interesting, actually, that this summit got underway with a couple of very symbolic things. Air Force One landing at that airport that AMLO refurbished under a lot of criticism at home. So, you got the symbolism of Air Force One landing there.
