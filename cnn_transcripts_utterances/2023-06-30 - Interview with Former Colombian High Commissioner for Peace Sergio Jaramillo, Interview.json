Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Are we seeing the beginnings of a potential Russian purge? Less than one week after the failed rebellion by Wagner mercenaries, Ukrainian officials say a plot has emerged to assassinate the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. And rumors are swirling about the location of Moscow general, Sergey Surovikin, as new documents show he was a VIP member of Wagner. It's a very public break in Russian unity, but it hasn't slowed the Kremlin's war machine. Today, the Kherson region suffered significant Russian shelling, and it comes as the country mourns those lost in a strike on the Kramatorsk piece of restaurant on Tuesday. A blast that killed at least 12 people, including three teenage girls. I'm joined now by someone who was at that restaurant when the missile struck. The Colombian peace negotiator, Sergio Jaramillo, was in Ukraine as part of his campaign to strengthen Latin American solidarity with the country. And he joins me now from Brussels. Sergio, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, how are you feeling physically and emotionally following Tuesday's horrific blast?",

We know the Colombia's ambassador to Russia was invited for a meeting with the Russian foreign ministry to discuss the \"circumstances of the war.\" And I want to just read from you a bit of what the readout was from the Russian foreign ministry.

And what the Russians are doing is frankly not just breaking the laws of war, breaking IHL, but conducting a policy of terror against civilians such as, I think, the world hasn't seen for a very long time. Because it's not just an issue of military operations, it's the targeted use of military might by one of the largest militaries of the world. And on top of that, by a country that is a permanent member of the Security Council, and as such, should be safeguarding international peace and security. Well, that country is actually targeting civilians, and this as what's happening day in and day out. This is what we need to wake up to. These are just not people who die incidentally, they are targeted all over the country, near the front, far from the front, as it has happened in Duman (ph) and Venetsia (ph).

There's a couple of things they're doing and I think one of them, if you look at the burnup wreckage of buses behind me speaks directly to that, the concern about this damage of public property, all the buses and trams across the country, whole of France are being shut down 9:00 p.m. this evening. That's about two hours from now. There's also the police are going to step up the level of armored vehicles that they're going to bring it to play to sort of -- essentially, to try to control the situation. So, in part, the police will have heavier and struggle tools at their disposal. The Elysee Palace, President Macron's office, were asked about, well, why don't you go to a state of emergency like you did back in 2005 when there was the big outbreak of violence then? And they said, look, back then, the troubles ran for nine days before we declared a state of emergency. This official is saying, that what we want to do right now is just step things up slowly if we need to, not ramp them up too fast, but just take a graduated approach and hope that they can taper off, things will get better and they can taper off.

He was raised by a single mother and in quite tough poverty on the Ohio Frontier. But between then and his White House ascension, he was also a college president, a state senator, an abolitionist preacher, the youngest brigadier general in the Union Army, as you rightfully described. Then the second youngest congressman in the country halfway through the civil war, he became that as well. In his congressional career, he founded the first federal Department of Education. He was a radical Republican. So, he was even more progressive than Lincoln on the social and racial issues of the time.

Because he had seen in his congressional career around Washington this -- the idea that if a politician gets the idea in their head that they might be president one day, it would end up leading them into behavior that would ruin their political career. Garfield saw many mentors and friends succumb to what he called this presidential fever in Washington. And he watched it end up being the death of him.

He would've accomplished minor victories, but we must resist this urge to not remember the realities of his politics at that time. The reaction to his death was not unlike the Kennedy assassination, Garfield was built into this man that he wasn't in American popular memory, and a lot of people look at his positions and they imagine he is this great loss progressive champion.

But he retained a great optimism and the destiny of the Republic, that's a phrase lifted from his inaugural address. And what's very interesting and encouraging to me is despite being this very nitty- gritty and very complex operator and politics back in the Gilded Age, Garfield still had this belief that one day America would be a truly righteous and just society for all types of Americans.

The CIA's support for the Afghan resistance in 1980s that drove the Soviets out of Afghanistan, it was the largest and most successful covert action in CIA's history. Our campaigns against al-Qaeda, to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately, defeat them, primarily in the Afghanistan, Pakistan border region, but Yemen and other places. And in the raid that brought justice to Osama bin Laden.

Complete my college degree, become an officer, which I did, Special Forces officer, and then a CIA officer. Luckily, it all worked out that way. But you know, it was a combination of wanting to do something for my country where individuals could really make a difference, that Special Forces and the CIA, and, you know, see great adventures. Again, you know, I had read T.E. Lawrence and others and I thought, that's what I'd like to do. A high school teacher actually provided or shoved to copy of \"The New York Times,\" my senior in high school, in front of me and it had a story on CIA's paramilitary operations in Laos during in the Vietnam War and he said, you might be interested in this. And I had no idea why he thought, you know, I was probably daydreaming of throwing touchdown passes, but I thought, leading secret armies, this sounds kind of cool, maybe this is something I want to do. And so, then when I went into the Special Forces, I was really blessed by having been all these Vietnam veterans as mentors teaching me, you know, combat tactics and a range of things that helped me advance up the ranks. And a lot of my fellow special operators who rose to four-star ranks really joined in that lonely 1970s period, Admiral Eric Olson, Admiral Bill McRaven, General Stan McChrystal, et cetera.

You know, in Afghanistan, they would have needed four times the force they had to even have a chance of pacifying the country, and even then, they would've taken a lot of casualties. Same is true in Ukraine, and that's why they're hunkered down now in certain regions that they're trying to hold with the defensive lines. For the U.S., I think the answer is somewhat different.

It also failed -- and this is your writing -- to anticipate Vladimir Putin's aggressive actions between '24 and 2016. And if I wanted to add to that, in the broad sense, the Intelligence Community missed everything from -- in the late 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet Union and how weak it was and even now, hasn't been able to figure out or come to a consensus on whether COVID leaked from a lab. Having read your book, I was very impressed with all the things you did, but I also began to worry about our intelligent assessment capabilities. CULVER (voice-over): Yes. So, you know, our intelligence is the best in the world by far in terms of the collection but also in the honesty of our analysis. That doesn't mean that they get it right all the time. You know, if get it right 70 percent of the time, they're doing pretty well. And, you know, it's been said you can divide the intelligence world into secrets and mysteries, you know, if we can get the secret, we're pretty good at that. The more complicated the problem, whether it is not a secret that you can steal, then, you know, it becomes, not a guessing game, but a tougher judgment. And some of those cases certainly fit into that. You know, the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, with both the Russians and a lot of western services thought they would be able to take Ukraine quickly. That's based on an assessment of the capabilities of the Russian armed forces, Ukrainian, et cetera, you can be wrong about, and they were wrong, you know. And there's a number of cases like that. It's a tough job. But, you know, I was more on the collection side. So, I'm -- and really, the covert action. So, I'm a little reluctant to, you know, throw stones at analysts.
