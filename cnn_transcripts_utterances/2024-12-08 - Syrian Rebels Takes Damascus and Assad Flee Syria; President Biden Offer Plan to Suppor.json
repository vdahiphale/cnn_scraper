Rebels have taken hold of the capital of Damascus, one of several major cities. They took control of it in lightning advance. Bashar al-Assad fled the presidential palace. That residence, a symbol of his gruesome dictatorship, has been burned and ransacked.At this moment, Assad and his family are in Moscow after being granted asylum in Russia. That's according to a source. And the entire world now waits to see what happens in Syria. President Biden declaring the U.S. will engage with Syrian groups to establish a transition. U.S. Central Command, meanwhile, saying U.S. planes have struck over 75 ISIS targets in Syria today. That is part of an ongoing mission, which has hundreds of U.S. troops deployed in that region. CNN chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has more on Assad's fall from power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Decades of savage, horrific rule, over in a matter of days. Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets of Damascus after rebel forces advanced on the capital early Sunday morning, declaring it free of President Bashar al-Assad.",

For those of us who have been covering this story for more than 14 years, it never seemed possible that it would end like this. I want to say that the streets are incredibly calm, incredibly quiet, but you can see just behind me, a few cars have been going through the street.There's actually a curfew in place from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. That is a security measure, of course. There has been some looting in Damascus earlier on, some chaotic scenes. And so as a precaution, as we saw in Aleppo, they have put this curfew into place. I want to show you though, Wolf, a clip of the moment that we cross the border because this is a border that I crossed many times when I used to live in Lebanon, when I used to cover Syria at the very, very beginning of the uprising. And the contrast from what it was and what we experienced tonight is just startling. So take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) So we're just crossing now into Syria. It's astonishing to see. It's absolutely empty. The border points before there would have been soldiers, there would have been border guards. Now there is absolutely nobody from the Syrian regime. Some friendly people letting us through. And honestly, the last time I came down this road was back in 2011. I was leaving Syria. I had been undercover in Damascus posing as a tourist. Went back into Lebanon. And I never imagined this moment would come when we would be driving through this border with no one from the regime to stop us. (END VIDEO CLIP) The scene at that border crossing as we passed through it, again, it was already dark, already past curfew, very, very quiet and just nothing like we've seen it before. The only real evidence we saw, Wolf, of any struggle to finally take Damascus, to finally oust Bashar al-Assad was a tank in the road below a torn poster of president or I should say former president Bashar al-Assad. And Wolf, my cameraman Scott McWinnie, just found this on the ground literally as we were listening to that clip. This is the old flag of the Syrian regime, which has two green stars. The rebel's flag has three green stars, but this one has now been literally, we just found it on the floor. I guess a real moment where you see how much things have changed just in the past 24 hours. (END VIDEOTAPE) DEAN:  Incredible reporting from our Clarissa Ward there. Thank you so much for that. And our coverage of Syria continues now with Ambassador James Jeffrey. He's a former U.S. envoy for Syrian engagement and also the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Turkey. Mr. Ambassador, thanks for being here with us.

First of all, as you just reported, our Central Command has just bombed the hell out of the Islamic State positions in the Bada'a Desert. Meanwhile, the Israelis have struck suspected chemical weapons sites that the Assad regime may have left behind. So there's a lot of attention on this. The other thing is, Jilani and his movement, HTS, fought the Islamic State, and while he is officially still on the terrorist list, we haven't seen any what we would consider terrorist activities out of that movement for a good deal of time, for four, five, six, seven, eight years. And in fact, we indirectly -- we didn't work with him, but we were supporting the people, some three million refugees that were under his control in the northwest of the country and we were very appreciative of the efforts he was doing to stop Assad, Russia, and Iran's advance.",

Iran has had since 1979, the revolution, a goal of essentially taking over a hegemony of the Middle East working through proxies, most of them but not all, Shia Muslims in countries such as Iraq, Syria, of course, Lebanon, Gaza, I mentioned, and Yemen, and putting the rest of the region under pressure.That all has been turned on its head. Hamas has been basically destroyed, Hezbollah heavily defeated, Iran, of course, lost heavily in its missile and air war with Israel in the last few months.

If we recall early this morning, when the rebels first entered or took over all of Damascus and started going into government buildings, the presidential palace, they said it was absolutely unclear where Assad is. And it was the Russians actually who first came out and confirmed that Assad had left the country.

One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that these Russian military bases are big and they're extremely important for the Russians because they project power through these bases not just inside Syria, but really also on their way to West Africa, to Libya, and other places as well. And of course, the Mediterranean has become very important. For instance, for Russian naval exercises, which took place just this past week.Right now, it's absolutely unclear what happens to those military bases. One of the things that the Russians have said is that those bases, the soldiers on those bases, the forces there are on high alert. However, the Russians are also saying that they're in touch with all of the armed groups on the ground, they say, and that for now the safety of their soldiers and those bases have been guaranteed. However, it really seems unclear whether or not the Russians are going to be able to hold on to those assets for an extended period of time or if those who soon will be in power in Syria are going to ask the Russians, possibly other foreign forces that are on the ground in Syria, to leave as well. Again, for the Russians, that would be a big blow. These military assets have been extremely important. And just from having been on the ground with the Russian forces at these bases, I was at their air base, I was at their naval port as well, and actually on a Russian ship as well. For them, these places were extremely important as far as their military campaign to support Bashar al-Assad at the height of the Syrian civil war were concerned, Jessica.",

So, a better map to show that probably is this one right here. And what you're looking at is all the ISIS concentrations right in this area.And so, the target area that we're -- that we're really dealing with is this part right in this part of the Syrian desert. This is where those 75 plus targets were struck using munitions that were carried in by the likes of the A-10, which is basically a tank killer, and in many ways, an aircraft built around a Gatling gun, which is a type of machine gun that goes as far back as the Civil War. B-52, the famous bomber workhorse right here, this is something that can -- a vehicle that can carry a whole bunch of bombs, about 31,000 kilograms, 75,000 -- 70,000 pounds of bombs of various types, including the Joint Direct Attack Munition and, of course, the F-15, which is a fighter jet that has a 20-millimeter gun as well as carrying up to 26 bombs, depending on how it's configured.

So, basically, Syria could be looked at as a staging area for Iran to conduct operations against targets of various types, including American targets in Iraq, American targets potentially in Turkey, targets in Jordan and, of course, Israel and Lebanon. So, with the elimination of Syria as a jumping off point for the Iranians, that makes a huge difference and it really constrains Iran's power.So, what al-Jolani was talking about here was he doesn't want Syria to be used as a base for Iranian activity because he sees that as detrimental to Syria as well as to the interests of any future Syrian government that he might lead.",

Now, we also know that the Israeli military has warned the residents of that buffer zone, Syrian residents, to remain in their homes as Israeli troops operate in the area.The Israeli prime minister in that video message also sought to take some credit for what has happened inside of Syria, saying that the fall of the Assad regime here by these rebels is a -- quote -- \"direct result of Israel's actions against Iran and its proxy in the region, Hezbollah.\" Both Hezbollah and Iran have, of course, propped up the Assad regime throughout the course of this 13-year civil war and Israel, we know, has significantly weakened Hezbollah's capabilities both in Lebanon but also inside of Syria. As for the Iranian regime, perhaps distracted by the other events in the region, distracted by Israel itself. And, of course, we know that the fall of the Assad regime will amount to a significant blow for Iran as well. And so that's where the question leads in terms of the future of Syria and the future of its relations with Israel. Netanyahu said that he is extending a -- quote -- \"hand of peace\" to all Syrians across the border and that he would like to establish -- quote -- \"neighborly and peaceful relations.\" The real question, though, is going to be what kind of government actually emerges inside of Syria and will it be one that will preserve what has effectively been a 50-year (INAUDIBLE) between Israel and Syria or will it take another attack. And critically, for Israeli officials, it will be the question of what happens to the weapons that have flowed from Iran via Syria into Hezbollah's hands inside of Lebanon. There had been some hope inside the Israeli government that perhaps the Assad regime would cut off that flow of weapons, secure its border with Lebanon. That, of course, is off the table now. And so, the question is, will these rebel forces now secure the border with Lebanon and prevent Iranian weapons from getting to Hezbollah via Syria? Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
