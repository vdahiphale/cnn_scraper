But since last night's news conference, four more Democrats in Congress have come out to say he should. Now entry, turns to a secret meeting between the House Democratic leader and the president.Plus, great job Joe. Donald Trump box the president's performance. But it's clear his campaign views Biden staying in the race is an in-kind donation to Trump's chances in reclaiming the White House. And writing for Biden. And up close, look at a group of black voters who say, they're not dismayed at all by his debate debacle. I'm Manu Raju, in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, a meeting between the top Democrat in the House and the president of the United States. They talked at the White House last night after Biden's NATO news conference. Now we know little about that conversation right now. And Jeffries in a vague letter offers scant details about the face to face. He said, he relayed quote, heartfelt perspectives, and conclusions about the path forward. He said that Democrats have shared with him the leader. I want to go straight to Capitol Hill and there where we find Lauren Fox. And Lauren, an 18th Democrat just came out against Joe Biden. What do we know about that call for him to step aside and this meeting between the leader and the president?",

But obviously, all eyes are on getting more details about this meeting that happened yesterday. After this press conference between President Joe Biden and the Democratic leader on Capitol Hill Hakeem Jeffries.Now Jeffries has been keeping his views pretty close to the vest, offering very little insight into his position. But we are learning this morning that he did meet with the president. And in his letter to colleagues, he wrote, quote. On behalf of the House Democratic Caucus, I requested and was graciously granted a private meeting with President Joe Biden. That meeting occurred yesterday evening. In my conversation with President Biden, I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspective and conclusions about the path forward that the caucus has shared in our recent time together. Now the caucus had a full meeting on Tuesday morning. They've also had separate meetings, breaking out in smaller groups to discuss what to do about the president's future. Our colleague, Jeff Zeleny, getting some fresh reporting about that meeting between Jeffries and Biden. Where Jeffries did not explicitly offer his endorsement of the president. Again, we are still trying to get additional details about this meeting, but very watched here on Capitol Hill as a lot of Democrats have been waiting to see what their leadership would do and say to President Biden.

Nice to see you all.All right. So, he says -- he says he's running, no matter what. We have an additional Democrats coming out saying, no way. We have to Hakeem Jeffries saying, not offerings endorsement. What exactly does that mean? We're still trying to learn but seems significant. And how will the New York Times reporting $90 million of monies -- we're going to be on hold that were big donors going to give $90 million to this Biden Super PAC, that they pledged to give to him to that Super PAC, no longer going to do that. Does that have any impact now on Joe Biden? That's not an insignificant sum of money. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, look, for just that amount of money, it's going to have an impact, you know, when it comes to the momentum, sort of behind the campaign. But I don't think when you talk to campaign officials, administration officials that they ever thought that this press conference would sort of quell immediately all that dissent among Democrats. Just the fact that we're at this point in time right now, I think does show just sort of the amount of anxiety that Democrats are feeling across the country when it comes to Joe Biden's candidacy. I mean, this is a party where any criticism against the White House, and you're one and two was a pretty big deal if you came and win against the White House. And now we have a situation where donors, members of Congress, you know, Democrats across the country are expressing these concerns. So, I don't think that it's a surprise that it's continued. In the wake of that press conference, there were some flubs. You still had a president that still struggled to make a -- to articulate sort of a coherent case for why he is the best person to be at the top of the ticket to beat Donald Trump. When he was asked about that. He pointed to his record in the first term, rather than providing assurance for the future at this point, which is where the concern is. And I think you're probably going to see that continue in the days ahead here.",

There's not a path, according to that map at this moment. Is no poll saying that he can win it.AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: No. I mean, it is -- it's more than the map. And that this has been clear, even before the debate. Let's be honest that those sunbelt states were going to be tough for him. And the debate, this is the whole thing, the debate was his opportunity to put those back on the map. And it's hard now to argue that, oh, boy, I've done so -- I've laid out my case so clearly and confidently to the public, and to the voters that are undecided that we can put those back in. And the fact that that the campaign basically agreed with that assessment, saying we just got to go and get the blue wall. Tells you what you need to know. So, I think what we're looking at is a map that now is narrower. For Biden, though it's been pretty narrow, I think, for the last couple of months. And to Phil's point about tell me where we go from here. What is the case that Biden makes? And how effective is he at turning the election back on to Donald Trump? Now, theoretically, we have a convention next week. That's all about Republicans. And Donald Trump will be in the spotlight on Thursday, making a case theoretically to those swing voters who right now have parked and undecided, don't know what they're going to do. Maybe they're feeling worse about Biden after the debate. Does he have a message that appeals to them? Or are we back where we have been really for the entirety of this race, which is voters coming away from the debate, and the convention saying, this is a lesser of two evils election?

This is a conversation happening in Washington, but we're not ready to abandon our nominee and really taking a pragmatic approach.

We are a country that is ossified in our political sort of culture, is the best way of saying this. And so, even events that theoretically would move people, just only move people on the edges or -- and so a status quo race still is not great for Biden. That is -- I think that is more of the conversation we should be having, rather than, oh, my gosh, this race has totally gotten away from Biden, and he's collapsed. It's that, the status quo isn't good enough. He needs this race to be less about him, more about Trump. He needs to make a clear case for the future and that he can do the job.",

When people started getting numbers back in their districts, in those swing states and those frontline areas. What they were seeing internals or internals (inaudible) however you want. People were freaked out and that matters. KANNO-YOUNGS: Polls like this two are only going to reinforce sort of the defiant posture that you've seen from this White House, President Biden and his inner circle. And remember, you also have, you know, a Clyburn interview as well, where he's still supportive of him. Next week, you're going to have an NAACP conference to where President Biden is speaking. I think that will -- you'll find a lot of support there. And that's going to reinforce the defiant posture. So, you're going to see that moving forward.

You did see several of Donald Trump's top advisers, many of his surrogates are really responding in real time during -- throughout the press conference posting on social media, doing the same thing we saw Donald Trump do, which was highlight his slip ups as missteps.They mocked him for what he introduced Ukrainian President Zelenskyy where he at first referred to him as Putin. They highlighted that misstep with calling Harris, Vice President Trump. All of that and really trying to seize on this moment. I can tell you from my conversations with the Trump campaign, they are relishing this. They are loving that the attention has been on the criticism surrounding Joe Biden. And the questions coming from within his own party over whether they think he is fit to serve for another four years. But just to take a step back and kind of pull the curtain back on what's actually happening within the Trump campaign. They still want Joe Biden to be the nominee. They want him to be the one that Donald Trump faces off with in November. It's been very clear to me throughout my conversations with all of the people in Donald Trump's inner circle and outside. Everyone in his orbit want it to be Joe Biden. And that's because part of it is their campaign has spent several months, spending millions of dollars on modeling, on data, on ads, focused solely on going after Joe Biden. They also just think that given the current state of his campaign, that he will be the easiest to beat. However, they are already starting to prepare in the event that someone like Vice President Kamala Harris, ultimately becomes the one to succeed him. They've been ramping up their attacks on her. We saw Donald Trump himself attacker in his rally on Tuesday. And they're also working in some of those criticisms and critiques of Harris into some of the conversation in his speeches next week. And so, all of this kind of happening while the Trump campaign continues to watch how this unfolds like the rest of America. Manu?",

We don't want to switch it out.So, I understand it from a -- from an infrastructure perspective, from an ad buy perspective, from a message perspective. I think the other thing, too, is that they have a historically incumbent president with historically low approval ratings that has no shortage of deficiencies in terms of what the public sees and views of him on a day-to-day basis. Switching that up with anybody, even if you think the vice president is easily attacked, or what have her own flaws, or vulnerabilities.

There is no guarantee that she would be the better choice. But I think she starts -- we can argue she starts kind of where we were on June 27, which is the focus -- if the focus of the Trump campaign stays the same, which is, if you -- when you get Kamala, what you get is an administration that screwed up the economy, that screwed up the border, elect me because I will do a better job on those things.

Well, we are within that window. So, it can really happen at any moment. Trump has talked a little bit about, you know, he's spent a lot of time with all these potential candidates. He talked a little bit about Doug Burgum, earlier this week about the issue of abortion and about the near abortion ban that has enacted in North Dakota, the state that he's governor of.
