Then, leading scientist Michael Mann on the importance of fighting back against climate deniers. Plus, \"On The Move,\" author and investigative reporter Abrahm Lustgarten explains the perils of climate migration and how Americans can prepare. And finally, a win in the battle against deforestation. My conversation with the Brazilian president, Lula da Silva. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In this holiday edition of our show, we look back at how 2024 was a standout year and not in a good way for our environment. It was the hottest year on record, and global warming officially exceeded the 1.5 degree threshold for the very first time. Everywhere from Japan to Phoenix, Arizona experienced scorching temperatures. In June more than 1,300 people perished from extreme heat on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. And it's not just heat. In Valencia, Spain, residents are reeling from historic floods in late October that killed hundreds of people. And in the United States, communities are rebuilding after Hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated whole communities. And yet, with all of this, climate denialism just doesn't persist. It spreads. Now, the United States, the world's biggest polluter after China, has elected as president someone who has called climate change a hoax. President-Elect Trump has promised to undo climate progress both at home and abroad. And he's nominated a slew of fossil fuel industry stalwarts to key environmental departments. So with all that in mind, we want to revisit with people who are sounding the alarm and providing solutions to this existential threat. So first up, my conversation with staff writer at the Atlantic, George Packer and climate policy expert Leah Stokes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Phoenix, I think, is about as good a lab as you can find because it really has all the major themes and conflicts and issues of our time. It has political extremism in a big way. Every election year is a tense year in Arizona, and this year is no exception. It has a climate crisis that you just described and that I reported on in my piece, with unbearable heat, as well as disappearing water in some parts of the state. And it also has the border and immigration as a huge factor in the coming election. Abortion is another one. It's got this incredible nexus of issues, some of which divide people almost hopelessly and others have this odd effect of overcoming some of the divisions that seem so permanent and insuperable in our country.",

If Ilose my way on a walk, if I stay out too long, if I can't find water, you are risking your life. And people who are homeless, people who are vulnerable in the ways that I described, are risking their lives every day and dying every day in the emergency rooms. Over the summer fill up with people coming in whose body temperatures are 106 or 7, which is heat stroke, and can be fatal. People find ways of coping. The city of Phoenix has lots of innovative methods of allowing people to come inside and cool off in these cooling buses and cooling buildings. They're trying to plant more trees and build more shelters because it's a kind of naked, exposed city in the summer. But it all feels unsustainable because driving, which is one way to cool off because you're in your car, which is air conditioned, is also burning you up. Because air conditioning causes 4 percent of global emissions. And the temperature rises every year. There is no abating of it, and who knows where it will be in 25 years. So there is a sense of eight months of the year. It's paradise. And that's why people move there. And four months of the year, it's day deadly.",

For decades, it was sort ofviewed as a problem for the future, something that would affect our grandchildren or maybe poorer people in developing countries, you know, maybe something for somebody else. And what we are seeing is that this is the climate crisis. It is on our doorsteps. This is what we are seeing in the United States at just one and a quarter degrees centigrade of warming. What happens when we blow past that 1.5 degrees target that, you know, governments around the world are trying to hold us to? What if we go to 2 degrees or 2 and a half degrees? What does life look like for everyday people? And so this is becoming a really important political issue. And in the United States, for example, with the upcoming election this fall, there's going to be a very clear choice between somebody who says, quote, wants to be a dictator on day one to drill, drill. That's of course Donald Trump and somebody who really is the best climate president this country has ever seen and has really focused on this issue. So will that play out in the election? Will people show up to vote for President Biden because of his climate record? I think it's too early to tell, but we're certainly seeing the impacts are hitting everyday Americans every day.",

Here's another quote, the Republican Party there is more radical than any other state. But the chief qualification for viability is an embarrassingly discredited belief in rigged elections. So you've got that. How does that affect what people think about climate policy, Leah? Because there are conservative Republicans who do believe, I mean, they may be a small group, but they do believe that climate should be a unifier.

But if you look at it locally and in terms of a community's water supply or even the well in somebody's backyard in a rural county, a conservative rural county in Southern Arizona, once people find that they're losing their water, and it's in Arizona, it's partly because in rural areas there is no regulation. Phoenix is highly regulated. And Phoenix has a lot of water. It's not about to run out. But exurban communities around Phoenix and even more rural areas around the state are risking their groundwater. And it's because it's unregulated. And big agribusinesses are coming in from out of state and even from other countries and pumping relentlessly. Local people, including MAGA Republicans are upset about that and are now starting to demand that their state representatives allow legislation to pass that would regulate groundwater. It's still stuck in the partisan gears of the Arizona state legislature. But what's interesting to me is to watch actual personal experience of that incontrovertible fact. My well is dry.

And it is a very detailed plan for how to dismantle our federal infrastructure. Things like getting rid of the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which literally just keeps track of, you know, data around what is happening to our earth. You know, they want to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. We saw what a first Trump administration would do, rolling back almost 100 environmental rules, pulling us out of the Paris climate agreement. And what does a well-organized second Trump administration look like? If you want to know what it looks like, look at that Project 2025 document. It's very scary. By contrast, what the Biden folks want to do is they want to keep delivering. And as you're saying, why don't people know about it more? Well, this law is just beginning to roll out, and we really need those four more years for all of those to start rolling into these communities, for people to get electric vehicles, for them to put in a heat pump, to start seeing those benefits. You know, laws take time to really take hold. And with those crucial years before 2030, whoever wins this fall election will really be rewriting world history when it comes to the climate crisis.

It's true thatthe Green parties did not do very well, and there was some surging in the far right, but it was not as bad as people were predicting in the polls. And the coalition that will continue to govern does want climate action. And of course, as you know, what really matters is who is controlling the countries in the European Union. So, for example, the election coming up in the U.K. within a month, which looks like the labor government, the Labour Party may regain government, it's going to be crucial that they actually govern on climate, that they use these years up till 2030 to make a difference, because as you were saying, we could be seeing rollbacks in the United States. In fact, we would be if Donald Trump becomes president. And so countries around the world really need to be electing climate leaders and having them deliver, because 2030 is just really one election cycle away.

And so these court cases are really starting to change the dialogue. There's also laws beginning to be passed, like in Vermont, really, just in the last couple of weeks, that say that the fossil fuel companies who lied about climate change, they will be responsible for paying for some of the damages that they cause.

In fact, good faith criticism, skepticism plays an important role in moving science forward. But making false and defamatory accusations of fraud, and comparing a scientist to a convicted child molester, which is what the plaintiffs did - - what the defendants did in this case, clearly goes beyond the line. And we sort of, you know, we had no choice. We asked them to take down those defamatory posts and to apologize. They refused to do that. And so we moved forward with the litigation, and it did take 12 years to play out. But we're very pleased that the jury saw, you know, through the smoke and mirrors that they tried to put up during the trial, saw to the heart of the matter, that they had engaged in false and defamatory allegations.

But it really communicates two very important, mutually compatible and complementary facts that there is urgency. And you've just spoken to that we see the urgency in the unprecedented extreme weather events that we are seeing play out in real time now. And 2023 was unlike any other year in terms of the extreme heat, the wildfires, the floods, the devastating consequences we're already seeing. So that's the urgency. But at the same time there is agency. It is not too late to act. And it's really important that we convey both of those things because urgency without agency leads us nowhere. It's not too late.

AL GORE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: To do really is to overcome the political power and influence of the fossil fuel companies which have, you know, been trying to persuade people that this is not such a big deal and they're trying to extend their business plan.

We should all do everything we can to decrease our own individual carbon footprint. In many cases, those actions make us healthier, they save us money, they make us feel better about ourselves. They set a good example for others. But one of the tactics in the new climate war, those D words, there's division, there's doom mongering, there's delay, and there is deflection. They have sought to deflect attention away from the needed systemic changes. Pricing carbon and providing incentives for renewable energy, leveling the playing field in the energy market. They don't want any of that because it will hurt their profits. But it's absolutely essential if we are going to achieve the reductions that are necessary. We need systemic change to do that. So they want to deflect the attention entirely towards individual action, as if it's just about us changing our voluntary behavior. We need both.

That's what this latest study shows with respect to the Amazon rainforest. There was a study out just a few days ago showing that there's another potential tipping point in the collapse of the great ocean conveyors. This was popularized in the film the Day After Tomorrow. The film was a caricature of the real world. But bad things would happen if this climate, if this current system were to collapse. There are lots of these potential tipping points that lie out there. We don't know exactly where they are. So the only sensible strategy, it's like the blind person walking towards a cliff. The only sensible strategy is to stop walking towards the end of that cliff.

It can be both true at the same time that we're making real progress and that we're not yet making enough progress. We have to accept that duality. And we have seen carbon emissions level now globally. They need to come down and they need to come down rapidly. But the first step is to stop going up that mountain. We've reached the summit of that mountain. We've got to go down the other side and we've got to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent over the next decade to avert a catastrophic 3-degree Fahrenheit warming of the planet. And so that window of opportunity is shrinking, but it's not yet gone. And if we see the policy actions that build on the progress we've already made, we can do it. I'll come back to this next election because this next presidential election is going to determine the future path of global action on climate. Without U.S. leadership, there will be no global leadership on climate. We have to set an example and we have to do so by electing, you know, by electing politicians, policymakers who will act on our behalf, who will act on the climate crisis rather than just be tools of special interests and polluters.",

And what that means is a potential revitalization for a lot of those communities, or at least a lot of the opportunity for growth that comes with a growing population, maybe an influx of younger families, energized middle-class families, but to seize on that growth, a lot of the experts that I talk to talk about the need to carefully plan, develop policies that support that migratory movement, that prepare things like infrastructure and prepare things like housing and, you know, and are ready to witness and smooth the path for that movement.

And there people were starting to have conversations, deep planning discussions about this issue, but hadn't necessarily put those plans into action. But there was a recognition of the need for the kinds of things I said like investment in infrastructure. You see cities like Buffalo, New York, claiming that they'll be a climate refuge and marketing themselves that way, but not really developing the policy yet. But presumably that would come. And another interesting case study that I looked at in my reporting is the City of Atlanta, which in some ways is the furthest along. Atlanta, is modeled to be a real recipient of potentially millions of American climate migrants. And Atlanta has spent the last decade greening and improving its infrastructure across large parts of the city in really positive ways that make parts of the city more sustainable. But now it's grappling with a new set of challenges, which is sort of a teaching moment, you know, which is defending against the gentrification that's resulted from some of their greening and the need to, you know, to protect some of those communities as you plan for incoming climate migration.

And there's a lot of reasons for that. But one of the sets of reasons is a host of perverse incentives that the United States has always had to attract people and effectively blind them from the risk that they face in moving to places like coastal Florida. And one of those subsidies is the provision of homeowners insurance or property insurance. And Florida is a great example of this. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, insurers were leaving the state and it might have suggested that property was uninsurable, but the state stepped in and said, we don't want all these people to leave the state because of this economic. We are going to provide our own insurance. And so they created a state-subsidized plan that basically said, anybody can get insurance and we'll promise it's going to be cheaper than any other insurance on the market. And that's the type of thing that has attracted many more people to Florida and has been replicated across 30-odd states in the country. And that's kind of just one example of policies that tend to sort of blunt the risk and the personal economic household decision-making that people have to make about where they live in this country.",

And so that research suggests that if you cut emissions, if you keep temperatures closer to 2 degrees Celsius, which maybe is a realistic target at this point, that the number of potential migrants globally and in the United States would be cut by, you know, by up to half, by close to half. So it really makes a big difference how quickly we cut emissions. You know, we have reduced our warming projections from where were six or seven years ago. That's some progress. The legislation that's been passed in the United States and the goal set here is some progress. It gives me a little bit of hope, but none of it's happening fast enough. And globally we don't yet see the signs of countries like India and China hopping on board, changing as quickly as needs to happen to reduce the net global emissions.

I'm the one that took this commitment to announce that till the 2030 we would end with the deforestation station in the Amazon rainforest. This is my commitment. And the same way Amanpour that I could say to you that Brazil is experiencing a very interesting moment because when we're talking about discussing the climate change and the energy issue, Brazil has to be undefeatable in producing wind power, solar power, biomass power, biofuels, green hydrogen. Brazil has extraordinary energy potential. And we want to take advantage of, take this opportunity so that Brazil, amongst many things, we could have a low carbon agriculture output. You know that Brazil has 90 percent of its energy matrix is clean energy source. And so we have 50 percent of the total energy matrix is clean. And when the rest of the world has only 15 percent. So on the climate aspect and on the energy transition, Brazil will make things happen. And that's why my commitment with the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. And I hope that the rich countries and I hope that the rich countries give a contribution with money that they have to contribute because to keep the forest standing costs a lot of money. And because under each tree there's an indigenous people that lives. There's a fisherman, there's a peasant. And we need to take care of the people that live in the forest. They are human beings and they need to live, they need to have their livelihood. So it's important that people that deforested in their countries, that have industrialized 200 years ago, now, they should take the commitment to pay for those countries that still have forest standing, to preserve their forests. Because I will not be taking only care of the Amazon rainforest, I'll be taking care of the planet Earth. That is the interest of the U.S. The interest of China. That is the interest of Russia, Mexico. And that's the interest of Chile. So that's why people have to have the awareness that to keep the forest standing in the Americas, in Congo and Indonesia, there's a price to pay for that and people have to pay for that price. And this is what we want to do so that credit, carbon credit will really start working to help those countries to keep their forests standing.",
