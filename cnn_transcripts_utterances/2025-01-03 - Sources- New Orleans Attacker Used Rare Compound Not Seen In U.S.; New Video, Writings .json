      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextThe breaking news: The New Orleans attacker, using a rare compound in his explosive devices, so rare that it has never been seen before in the United States. Where did he get it? And a wake-up call tonight. Those are the words of the suspect in the fiery explosion outside Trump international hotel in Las Vegas. Investigators tonight revealing more chilling messages that he left behind. And more breaking news this hour. Trump ordered to appear before a judge to be sentenced on 34 felony charges, all just days before he is sworn in as president. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett on this Friday evening. A lot of breaking news to get to this hour. I want to begin with new information on the explosive devices planted by the New Orleans attacker. Officials are telling our John Miller that the attacker who drove a car through that crowd in the early hours of New Year's day, murdering 14 people and injuring dozens more, used a rare organic compound not previously seen before in the United States, and officials are trying to determine exactly how the attacker may have obtained it. These are crucial new details. We have more on this coming up here in just a moment, and it comes as we are having more information coming in on the man who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Officials just releasing video of Matthew Livelsberger stopping at a charging station in route to Las Vegas. You can see him there walking towards the vehicle appears to get inside of it. Now, officials say that his act in front of the Trump Hotel was a suicide. They say Livelsberger was suffering from PTSD and had trouble in his personal life. We know Livelsberger was active duty. He served in the Special Forces. He served in Afghanistan. He was a highly decorated military member. Similarly, the New Year's Eve attacker in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, also served in Afghanistan, also decorated for his service. His commander in Afghanistan tweeting today, quote, I am in utter disbelief. He was a great soldier, someone who showed discipline and dedication to think that the same individual who once embodied quiet professionalism could harbor so much hate, leading to such unspeakable atrocities is incomprehensible and heartbreaking. But a newly uncovered audio file uploaded by Jabbar about -- about a year ago, offers a look into his religious beliefs. There, he says, quote, Satan's voice is also the misleading of people from Allah's way. They really go hand in hand. And we see with this gradually drives a person to. It's a gentle, gradual luring into the things that God has made forbidden to us. The intoxicants, like marijuana, alcohol, sedatives, opioids, stimulants and others. But despite the military and service similarities between the two attackers, officials say that the two incidents are not connected. But still tonight, law enforcement is on high alert as the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are warning of possible attacks. We've got both stories covered tonight with Natasha Chen on the ground in Las Vegas and Omar Jimenez in New Orleans. And, Omar, let's start there with you with this breaking details here that we are learning, what have you found out?",

Now you see some yellow temporary barriers on the sidewalk, but those were not there when this attack unfolded. The city police department has made clear in recent days that barriers previously installed to try and prevent vehicles from coming down the street were under repair ahead of February's Super Bowl in the city, and many of the current measures in place are temporary. But going back years to 2019, a private security firm warned the risk of terrorism, including by vehicular attacks, remained, quote, highly possible, and recommended the vertical safety structures that can move up and down, known as bollards, be fixed and improved immediately.

In the last ten minutes or so, investigators here in Las Vegas sent the full transcript of a couple of letters they found that they believe were written by Matthew Livelsberger. This -- these writings are covering a range of grievances. They -- he talks about political grievances, cultural issues, for example, not being a fan of diversity initiatives, expressed support for President Trump and Elon Musk.That's the first time we're seeing direct mention of the former president. He also talks about conflicts overseas. He talks about domestic issues, societal issues, and there is also a letter addressed to fellow service members. During the press conference this afternoon, there were some portions of these letters read to the media by investigators in hopes that it offered a little more context as to what might have been his state of mind. Investigators, at the end of the day, say it's clear there were mental health issues going on here. They are just scratching the surface of these devices that Livelsberger owned to look through the data, to look through what writings may have been on them. These are some writings that they found in the notes app on his phone. They did say that there was a journal of activity that he kept for about ten days leading up to the explosion that happened just behind us here in the valet drive through of the Trump hotel. So bottom line is that this Livelsberger wrote in some of these notes that he felt this was a wake up call and that there were a lot of things bothering him, and clearly a lot for investigators to comb through as well.

So I don't think we can read a lot into ISIS not claiming credit.But the fact is they were there. Look, in the intelligence business, I have to tell you, the one thing we worried about the most were lone wolves. How do you track them down? How do you try to protect against this kind of random terrorist act? It is very tough to do.

We don't see any evidence, internally into the Turo systems that these two individuals were connected in any way, first of all. And then secondly, what we've observed is both of these two individuals had perfect criminal background, no red flags. They had a valid U.S. driver's license, as you were noting in previous segment, they were decorated members of the U.S. military.

Obviously, you do this through an app from the buyer or from the renter and the person who owns the car, you know, directly, right?So there's no -- there's no counter, there's no human interaction required. But renters do need a driver's license. That's got to be validated for the app. As you point out, 18 years old, to rent through your site. But then and this is what I wanted to ask you about, Andre. Your company says that it uses. And I want to quote proprietary, multi- layered, data science based trust and safety process. And that's the end of the quote. But that's how you screen the renters.

Unfortunately, some people are hearing about us for the first time in these tragic conditions, but we've been around for over 12 years of operating history. We've facilitated over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips. We have millions of customers, hundreds of thousands of hosts.So we've become a big part of the rental car market here in the U.S. and in the other markets where we operate. And only 0.1 percent of these trips have resulted into what we would call a serious incident, such as a vehicle theft, for example. So we're, you know, we think that it's a solid track record that we've developed over the years. And we believe that that's because we focused on investing both in technology. You mentioned the Turo risk score. I'll tell you a bit more about it. And also people, we have a substantially large trust and safety organization. We have teams of former law enforcement officials that are part of it. And then when it comes to the technology we have used throughout the every renter that comes into the app and creates their account and books with us for the first time, we gather over 50 data points from both the renter themselves. The vehicle characteristics, the trip characteristics over 50 factors that go into calculating that Turo risk score. And, you know, and predictably, the steward risk score was pretty strong positive for both of these two transactions. And you know, when we looked at their backgrounds, they had no red flags. You know, they had valid licenses. They had shared with us a photo, a real photo when we looked at their backgrounds, they had no red flags. You know, they had valid licenses. They had shared with us a photo, a real photo of themselves holding their drivers license. Everything looked like it was perfectly smooth, and there were no red flags associated with it.",

On the contrary, I think we are you know, were very positive about the track record that we've built over the years. So in this case, I think they could have, you know, boarded any flight.

As you noted, he continues to be a convicted felon, but here the judge signaling that he is not going to face any penalties.And that's notable because, as the judge says, he could have imposed a jail sentence here. But in his opinion today, Judge Juan Merchan saying, quote, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the courts inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration. So really, this sentencing next Friday, it will be largely performative. Another thing I thought was really interesting in here is that Merchan really, really seems to concede the point that Trump's lawyers have been making about the fact that he is president-elect and how that should impact this case. He says, quote, to assuage the defendants concerns regarding the mental and physical demands during the transition period. They're going to let him appear virtually. Now, throughout the course of this case, Judge Juan Merchan has not been terribly sympathetic to a lot of the arguments related to status as a former president or president- elect that Trumps lawyers have made. So the fact that he is conceding this point, that's really significant. And, of course, Trump's lawyers, they wanted the whole case thrown out. That was what they were trying to do here. They were not successful, but they can continue their appeals on the conviction itself. But in a statement today, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, he didn't appear to be very happy with this outcome, saying, quote, there should be no sentencing and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead. Of course, the hoaxes being the four criminal cases, only one of which went to trial. He was convicted, but it appears, won't face any penalties and told the Trump team, Erin, they're still weighing if they want to fight the sentencing next Friday or just get it over with and put it behind them.",

It was brought -- brought by a partisan prosecutor.If Donald Trump weren't Donald Trump and he weren't running for president, this case would never have been charged with felonies this way. This complete and total sham. It's a kangaroo court. Of course, he's not going to be punished for it, because the only reason they ever did it was so they could try to call him a convicted felon during the election, which they, of course, did. And then the American people soundly rejected this naked partisan politics. If you're watching New York City news right now, you've got people being burned on the subway, folks running around with all kinds of violence in their past and not in jail. And the criminal justice system is being used on Donald Trump. Take a hard look at who you're electing. It's Alvin Bragg and this judge.

He certainly wanted to avoid time in prison. And that is exactly what he's getting in this case.

That's why he got reelected speaker today because of his own good work and because of his alliance with Trump. But that doesn't change the math. It's a closely divided chamber. And you do have a situation now where virtually any 1 or 2 members of Congress or 3 or 4, you know, a small group can really upend the chamber at any time. And there's going to be some people who want to do that for different reasons, mostly for their own self- aggrandizement.
