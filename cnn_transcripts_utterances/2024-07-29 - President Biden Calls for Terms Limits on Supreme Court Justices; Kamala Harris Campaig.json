And we heard a little bit of this on the campaign trail this weekend. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, he is one of the people on the shortlist to be Harris's pick, he was out on the stump and in support of Harris. And here's how he went after Trump and Vance.

Vance on this ticket demonstrates who Donald Trump is, if you ask me. It demonstrates or shows us exactly what he believes in by selecting a J.D. Vance, who is quite, as the campaign said, weird but also pretty, pretty unprepared, very scary in many respects. [08:05:5] And so when you look at a J.D. Vance, think of him as being or possibly being a president. I can't imagine having a J.D. Vance in the White House with the values, with the lack of variance, and with his really way of approaching people and women.

Secondly, the Supreme Court is at its lowest, and in fact the public has to have trust in the justice system. That's what it's supposed to be. When you look at the Supreme Court, you talked about corporate control, that's who has controlling now the Supreme Court. And when you look at the public and understand why the public is so disappointed and has decided that it's not a court that they could support, we need to do exactly what President Biden has proposed.With regard to term limits, we have to absolutely have term limits. The Supreme Court is not elected. I don't support term limits for elected officials because I believe in a democracy, people have the right to vote for who they want to vote for. But appointed officials such as Supreme Court justices absolutely should have term limits. So I'm very pleased that it's the Biden-Harris administration has moved forward with this.

It doesn't mean that that strike overnight is the last strike. But they're not expecting a major ground invasion right now. Now, that doesn't mean it never comes, right? And I'll tell you when I was there going back to late October and November last year, when you speak to many Israelis, but also those in the military. It's a matter of when not if, Israel solves as they will often say the Hezbollah problem and part of that is driven by all those people, many tens of thousands of people, Israelis who have been forced to flee south from the Northern Israeli border and still haven't been able to go home because of that constant threat of strikes coming across the border from Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon.",

However, they define complete, right? And those military operations are still underway.Smaller scale than we saw earlier in the war but they're still underway, it doesn't mean they could never do it, but that's the thinking. They would much prefer to finish in the south before they do anything in the north. But you have other factors there. You have Benjamin Netanyahu's own political calculations thinking that he pushes out these negotiations further, feeling that he has less pressure now from President Biden now that he is stepping down. You have Hamas, perhaps calculating and you've seen this, John, that extending the conflict there is actually in their interest, despite the enormous civilian casualties. So, that piece factors into the calculations about the northern front as well. And listen, you and I have talked about prospects for a ceasefire deal in Gaza for weeks and months right now. And every time it seems that you're getting close, there's something that pulls the sides back from actually pushing it across the finish line and it's familiar territory and the people of Gaza continue to suffer.

Now, whether that's enough to satisfy Israel and others, understandably not clear that it would be, regardless.There has been some questions as to as to how far Iran wants this to go. Hezbollah has a domestic political problem, right? It is a militant group, but it has a political problem and it -- the Lebanese, people don't want to go to war. You heard that from the Lebanese foreign minister speaking to our Ben Wedeman earlier today as well. So, they know that they wouldn't necessarily have the Lebanese population on their side given the size of any conflagration, right, in the north. But then you have to think Israel's calculus. You and I covered the 2006 war when Israel went into Southern Lebanon, which was already bloody and long and deadly for Israeli forces and so on, and everybody involved. [08:20:02] Hezbollah has an order of magnitude, more missiles and rockets than it had then. So, the cost to Israel, even with its air defences, the potential costs are enormous as well.
