I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. When Russia brazenly tried to take over Ukraine last year, it sent chills up the spines thousands of miles away in Taiwan. The island has been under the thumb of China for years, many of its residents living in constant fear that Beijing, like Moscow, will one day decide to invade and try to capture it fully. The United States is increasingly worried about just this scenario. A congressional select committee war game to Chinese invasion this week. The committee's chair saying it revealed the need to arm Taiwan to the teeth. The commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific command says the U.S. military has done a lot of work in taking lessons learned from the war in Ukraine and then applying them to U.S. support of Taiwan. But he's also been warning that the Chinese threat to Taiwan is closer to us than most think. With me now is Brian Hioe. He is a Taiwanese American writer and activist. Brian, welcome to the program, live for us from Taipei. So, just to continue on this saber-rattling. Just today, China's foreign minister has warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for countries that intervene in Taiwan. Now, on the surface. This is language that we've heard for years now. But given today's climate, how do you interpret it?",

China would actually stand to lose quite a lot in terms of not only just the lives lost but also the economic impact, as well as other countries in the region will feel threatened by China potentially targeting them next. And so, then you have an escalation of rhetoric. We think, for example, there's controversy over comments made by China's ambassador to the Philippines, threatening the 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan. And so, it's a question if China will step up its rhetoric intended to dissuade other countries from interceding on Taiwan's behalf.",

Obviously, this following then Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last year, which really rattled nerves in China, and of course, that precipitates these military exercises that we've seen. As I said, it's also highly choreographed. It's all centered around where you live, your home.

For example, I think U.S. military officials who are offering these datesare trying to encourage the Taiwanese government and the Taiwanese society to take more proactive action to steam off an invasion. As I mentioned, sometimes when these exercises do occur, there's not as much panic and that doesn't always translate into them trying to boost military readiness or prepare for what to do in the event of innovation or a blockade or other scenario. But then, I think that once they're all these dates being thrown around, it also actually pushes China to take more drastic action, because then they don't want to look weak. They do want to look as though they are making steps to take Taiwan and prepare for that. And so, also, this heightened rhetoric actually does also push China to more extreme and aggressive action to threaten Taiwan, to psychological intimidated it, but also, just to project power.",

This happens all the time. That having been said, we have seen an increase in in Taiwan's military budget and expenditure over just the past few years. It increased from $15 billion in 2022 to close to $20 billion this year, and it's projected to go up to $21 billion by 2028. Still, that dwarfs what China's military budget is. When you hear reports from the leaked classified documents that were just revealed earlier this month that the United States' assessment is that Taiwan is not prepared for an invasion right now. How alarming is that for you to hear?",

I mean, for example, the military draft was reextended to one year, and this was a politically risky move forthe Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, but this was carried out after the invasion of Ukraine, using that as the kind of frame by which calling for further steps for military readiness. But I think then when the U.S. or other western powers are continually trying to pressure Taiwan, sometimes it feels like an imposition from without (ph). And so, that actually might do more harm than good. And I do think that hyperbolic rhetoric about the threat of invasion when Taiwan has dealt with this for decades and just talk about it constantly as though it were going to happen tomorrow, it might actually lead to less real successes (ph). For example, I think what's interesting about the Chinese drills is that because they occur on a daily basis, it becomes a repetitive news item. There's not a sense of a developing kind of escalating or progressively intensifying threat. They're just more planes and more planes and it faces the background. So, I think actually, in terms of appeals or attempts to convince Taiwan to do more, there has to be a more carefully crafted message there than just continually trying to fear monger or pulled out these specific times by which China might take action.",

After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, there's more focus on the potential of what would occur to Taiwan than there actually was when there were a live fire drills conducted by China around Taiwan after the Pelosi visit, which took place closer to Taiwan than during the third Taiwan Straits crisis. And so, it's actually seeing these images circulated worldwide and how other countries in the world, quickly the U.S., reacted to the invasion of Ukraine that really caused Taiwan to rethink or to think more seriously about the threat of a Chinese invasion. These exercises, actually, I think had less of an impact. And so, I think that is noteworthy.",

She highlights a generational gap as being a major player here. She spoke to a fisherman called Mr. Chen (ph), who told her, many young Taiwan residents absorbed in their mobile phones, socializing and other leisure pursuits seem oblivious to the danger.

And during her -- when he was in power and under heradministration as minister of culture, there was a youth led movement, the Sunflower Movement in 2014, that was the occupation of the Taiwan Legislature for a month in protest of a trade agreement that the administration (ph) hope to side with China. That allowed for Chinese investment in Taiwan service sector industry, but it was feared that that would lead to the traditional political freedom, obviously, self-censor because of concern about China. And so, that provoked a lot of backlash. And it seems very strange than that sort of face down a youth led movement, that was one of the largest movements in Taiwanese history with 500,000 people have taken to the streets, for example, on March 30, 2014 would then claim that young people are indifferent and not paying attention and just absorbed in their phones. It's a very strange perception. But then, it is a kind of framing of the debates then about their relation with China -- with Taiwan relationship with China, framing it as though economic engagement will cause China to drop the threats and that's actually the DPP that is provoking China through building stronger ties with the U.S. This is a similar narrative that's circulating then regarding, let's say, Russia and Ukraine, saying that Ukraine was invaded because it got too close to the U.S. And so, that provoked Russia into action. And so, members of the KMT and community affiliated groups are circling that, and including circulating narratives that the U.S. would, for example, try to destroy Taiwanese semiconductor facilities in the case of war. And so, someone, actually -- and I do think verges on disinformation or conspiracy mongering at this point.",

It could take as much as 4,000 trees to build a single warship. So, you would have worms, kind of these sea worms that would burrow holes into the bottom. You'd rats gnawing at the ropes and the sales and termites. So, they were very vulnerable, and they were especially vulnerable on this voyage.",

And even after the press gangs had done their work, the ability (ph) was still short of men for the squadron, which needed about 2,000 men altogether And so, what did they do? They took the extreme step of rounding up soldiers from a retirement home. These men were in their 60s and 70s.

But I wonder, could I ever fully understand what the castaways have been through unless I made my own journey? So, I found -- it's probably not the smartest thing I've ever done, but I found this Chilean captain who had a wood heated boat to take me there. He had sent me a photograph of the boat. It looked pretty big, but when I got there, it turned out to be pretty small. Again, just heated by wood. We had to journey about 350 miles to get there. So, I got a real taste of those terrifying seas, just being tossed about. Sometimes I just had to sit on the deck. I couldn't move, just hunkering down or I break a limb. I listen to inaudible recording of \"Moby Dick,\" which was probably not the wisest thing to have done. But we did eventually make it to Wager Island. And it was a really important visit because it really remains this place of wild desolation, and this trip really drove that home to me. It's windy. It's cold. It's -- the temperature hovers around freezing, and it's always raining or sleeting.

So, it's an interesting dichotomy of both wins, but also setbacks and then also in what happens that we see in the environmental community is that the winds are quickly followed by setbacks and we see ambitious legislation followed up by whittling away at the details and maybe watering things down or projects being approved that really pushes in the opposite direction as far as possible fuel projects continuing to go forward at the same time that we say that we're pushing for a more clean energy future. So, the dire warnings that we see coming out of, you know, the IPCC, this is nothing new.

So, that's what I was alluding to earlier, mentioned that it's a time of high anxiety but also high hopes. You know, we see these big developments, we see ambitious legislation that a lot of us have thought was dead because it really had stalled any of the climate action that was coming out of this administration over the last couple of years. And then, all of a sudden, the Inflation Reduction Act comes out and it's really quite ambitious. It is not really what the climate movement wants or what scientists would say that we need to bring emissions down to stay below that 1.5-degree threshold. So, there's that. And then, the other piece that makes it complicated is the legislation is not a ban on emissions or a ban on fossil fuels, it's not even a tax on emissions or fossil fuels. It's really providing incentives for people to move things in a positive direction. There's a lot in there around tax incentives and tax credits so that people can take advantage of those to buy electric vehicles, to electrify their homes, to make their homes more energy efficient. There's a lot in there that people have to take advantage of, but the projections of how much the legislation is going to bring down emissions depend on that. It depends on people taking action. That makes it a lot more complicated because it's not an outright ban, it's not saying, you cannot use fossil fuels anymore after this date, or even putting a tax on it that really people would respond to perhaps even more strongly than credits. So, it's a complicated picture and that it's not enough even as everyone took advantage of it, but also, it depends a lot on people taking advantage of credits and incentives that a lot of people may just not be aware of.",
