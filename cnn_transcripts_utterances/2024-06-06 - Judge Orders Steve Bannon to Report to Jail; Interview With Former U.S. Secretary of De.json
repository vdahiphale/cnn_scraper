She's also described how Hunter introduced her to crack cocaine and how she was embarrassed and ashamed about that chapter of her life. But, on cross-examination, Hallie Biden also told the jury she didn't -- she did not witness Hunter doing drugs around the time that he bought that weapon. CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is outside the federal courthouse in Delaware for us. Evan, court just took a break for lunch. What more have we learned from Hallie Biden's testimony?",

And, as you pointedout, she is the only witness so far and possibly in this entire trial who will be able to say that she believed Hunter Biden was using drugs in the month of October of 2018. He bought the firearm on October 12 of 2018. That's when prosecutors say that he knew he was struggling with drug addiction and knew that he didn't have a -- didn't qualify to be able to buy that. And that's the reason why he's on trial here today. She found the firearm on October 23. And what she testified is that she believed that he was using drugs around the 22nd or the 23rd. Under cross-examination, as you pointed out, she did say that she didn't actually witness it, but she believed, based on his -- on his -- on his behavior, that he was using drugs. Now, the importance of this is this. The defense is trying to drive home the point that the prosecution has him using drugs in September and in November. But during this key period, before he bought the firearm, they don't have any proof that he actually was using drugs. And what they're trying to do is to drive a little bit of distance and perhaps a little bit of his frame of mind from that period to have the jury doubt whether he knew he was breaking the law when he bought this firearm. She was very embarrassed, she said, about her drug use. And you could see that this is a very emotional part of this -- of this trial, emotional part of this testimony. Hunter Biden was looking straight ahead, looking at her periods during her -- during her testimony, Boris.",

So, he thought of himself as sober in that period of time, so that this was not considered and really try to give the jury some of the context so they understand this was not a very well-thought-out decision on his part and therefore not willful.",

I mean, the fact that she was on drugs also could potentially impact her perception of events at that time. But the defense, as we discussed, and I think you discussed a moment ago with Evan, is really focused on trying to say, look, maybe he was using drugs a month prior, maybe he was using drugs a month afterwards, but this was his state of mind during that month. So I think it does -- it's an effective point. But, really, the jury's not going to be swayed, unless they just feel bad for Hunter and think that the prosecution is wrongheaded in some fashion.",

I mean, I think it's important to remember that Ronald Reagan spoke at the 40th anniversary of D-Day. And, at that time, he talked about learning the lessons of war, not forgetting the lessons of war, understanding that we can't be isolationists, that we have to work with our allies. And he ended that speech by saying: \"Your hopes are our hopes and your destiny is our destiny.\" That's a Republican president.

That's the main message today, is that we cannot allow tyrants to succeed.
