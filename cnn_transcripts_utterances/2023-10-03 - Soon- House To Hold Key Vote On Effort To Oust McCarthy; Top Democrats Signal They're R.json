So, what Matt Gaetz is trying to do, of course, is to blow this up, but there is no sense of what is next. That's why this is so consequential.And the last time this happened, at least they tried to remove a Speaker was in 1910. The Cannon Building on Capitol Hill is named after Speaker Joseph Cannon, Republican from Illinois. He was the Speaker then. He survived that procedural attempt by George Norris, a progressive Republican from Nebraska. History aside, what is going to happen this afternoon is going to be modern history. We don't know a couple of things as well. Donald Trump has been very silent. He is in a New York courtroom, I'm told not paying attention to this at all.

Democrats -- you will hear Democrats say a lot that they don't trust Kevin McCarthy. I mean, nobody trusts the leader of the other party. But, there are a couple of reasons why they don't trust Kevin McCarthy, and one is they thought that they were going to avert a shutdown with their negotiations in the summer. But, it really goes back to that January 6 moment, because there was a brief moment when Kevin McCarthy was willing to call out Donald Trump, say that this kind of thing is not acceptable. And in like a 24-hour period or so, he turned. He defended the former President, and he led or allowed himself to be at the helm of the leadership of House Republicans' decision to basically to protect Trump politically after January 6. So, I think that is at the heart of the trust question. If you look at from the time that Kevin McCarthy came to the House of Representatives until now, if you look at, let's say, The Cook Political Report's calculations on how partisan districts have become, if you put those two charts on top of another, you will see how deeply red and --",
