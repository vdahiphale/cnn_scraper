After something goes to a special grand jury, then it's brought to a regular grand jury. And that's what's happening here, this group of 23 jurors will have to now vote on the charges that are presented to them.Now, most of the time, when grand jury's proceed, they tend to vote on charges. Prosecutors come to them and have already vetted, that's saying that they believe a crime has been committed. Most of the time jurors will proceed with charges, but they don't have to. And if they're not convinced by what they've heard, they can just decide not to bring charges against the former president or anyone around him. There were a number of people who were also possibly being investigated here. Any of them could be charged.",

More dams right now are threatening to reach capacity and spill over after what has just been torrential rains. People living in the area for years say they haven't seen anything like this since Irene hit them back in 2011.The flooding has wiped out entire streets. It's left two areas of the state, Weston and Londonderry, completely inaccessible is how they're describing it, with emergency crews rescuing dozens of people.

It's been sort of poking out all day. The bad news is, the water is still rising. This is the Taylor Street Bridge. We're about a block from the state capital, the statehouse here. And I just want to give you a sense of what it sounds like. I'm watching the river. It's mesmerizing to watch because, you know, we were here several hours this morning, since about 5:00, and the -- the water was below the bridge. Now it's coming up over the top, and it has been for a while. They are concerned for the next several hours that that reservoir that is north of here, it may overtop the reservoir there and dump even more water into this area. And that would cause problems with this bridge and other areas. I mean look at the bridge just below us. This is just west of where we're at. That is a walking bridge. Also a trestle bridge. And the water has been hitting that. We have seen everything from trees, to construction debris, to it looks like parts of either businesses or homes hitting these bridges. You can feel it just shake as it hits. Amazingly, so far, there have been no confirmed fatalities in all of this rain that Vermont has had. They've -- they've effected over 100 rescues at this point by water. You see rescue teams now everywhere. And it's just impossible to get through here. I tried to cross State Street this morning about a block up that way, so the main street through the capital, couldn't getting across it. It was up to my waist and it was just moving so fast. There's a car that is stuck in there right now that we've been watching. You can start to see the top of it. So, the water is coming down ever so slightly. But they're afraid in the next hours ahead they may see even more water come down this way. Kate.",

General David Berger relinquished command of the U.S. Marines in this ceremony that happened just yesterday actually, but his successor's confirmation is still on hold and languishing in the Senate. That is because of this man, Tommy Tuberville, a Republican senator, and he is holding up all military nominations right now, more than 250 of them. Tuberville objects to the Pentagon's reproductive health care policies, including offering leave and travel funds for abortion care.Let's get the very latest. Lauren Fox has that from Capitol Hill. It's good to see you, Lauren. This has been percolating for a bit. Where does this stand with the Marines? What's happening now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Tommy Tuberville has had this hold for several months now, Kate, and it has stopped numbers of military promotions from being confirmed in the U.S. Senate. Typically, these would be done by voice vote. They're not controversial. But this is coming under new scrutiny because now, this morning, the Marine Corps is without a leader for the first time in 164 years.And there has been lawmakers on both the Republican and Democratic side who've argued they don't agree with Tuberville's tactic, including Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. But behind the scenes, Tuberville says he isn't feeling any pressure from the Defense Department or his own Republican leadership. Instead, he says, he wants one thing, and what he wants is a vote on the Senate floor enshrining the Pentagon policy that they are going to cover the cost of travel for service members and their families if they have to cross state lines because abortion procedures are not legal in the states where they are residing. It's important to point out to our audience back home that a lot of service members are stationed in places that they have no choice to be stationed in. That is part of serving in the U.S. military. So, the Pentagon, after the Dobbs decision, said that they were going to enact this policy. What Tuberville says is, OK, if this policy is going to come from the Pentagon, it really should be coming from the U.S. Senate. If it can't pass the Senate, then they should repeal it. Now, we should point out that there aren't going to be 60 votes in the Democratic controlled Senate for this policy because there are many Republicans, Democrats don't have 60 votes. So, it's just important to point out that Tommy Tuberville's hold right now, Republican and Democratic leaders could move these nominees one by one on the floor. But, Kate, that would take years at this point. Tommy Tuberville also appeared on Kaitlan Collins' new show last night and he doubled down on some controversial comments he made about white nationalists serving in the military.
