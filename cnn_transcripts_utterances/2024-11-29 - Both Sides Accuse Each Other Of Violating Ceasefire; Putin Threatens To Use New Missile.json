And then on the 23rd of September, the level of casualties that that we faced over here.So all the trauma kits and the medications and all of that were used up extremely quickly. The health sector was under an incredible amount of pressure and one should really note how valiant the health sector has been here, because also at the same time, they were under attack. And we've spoken about it many times, the respect for international humanitarian law. So at this point it's about replenishment. It's about getting more in because people do have these chronic needs. They are -- and this is expensive medication that's needed in a lot of cases. The other day I was at a burn center, and you can imagine how reconstructive surgery, burn centers, those sorts of treatments -- these sophisticated treatments that are absolutely needed given the level of damage to the person that's happened. And this is quite apart from I think, what, you know, everyone should understand, it's been a really traumatic experience for the population here and it continues. So the psychosocial aspects of this are also extremely deep. And remember that how many children have been affected. In the last two months we estimate that three children a day were getting killed. So the impact of that is phenomenal.",
