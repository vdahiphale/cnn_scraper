Several media organizations, including CNN, had asked for permission to broadcast the proceedings, but that won't happen. The former president is in Trump Tower tonight in the midst of a massive security presence in New York City.Here with me on our panel, we have Vanity Fair's Molly Jong-Fast, former federal prosecutor Paul Krieger is here, former Senate candidate Joe Pinion, former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow, and joining us is CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, who as far as we know is not former anything. (LAUGHTER) Um, okay, guys, great to have you all here. Jonathan, tell us about Secret Service and what-how they're preparing tonight and how they can possibly be everywhere and cover this unprecedented event tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, the Secret Service tomorrow plays an interesting role. It's not what we typically see them playing. They're not playing the lead role. The NYPD is the lead organizing entity for the security operation tomorrow.The Secret Service is keenly focused only on Donald Trump, getting him safely from Trump Tower down to the courthouse, and then whether it's back to Trump Tower or to the airport safely and efficiently. But they're not taking that coordinating role and there's a reason why here, Alisyn. Because the Secret Service has to show that they are neutral in this, that they're not currying favor towards the former president, which quite honestly in the last administration they were accused of. They have to make sure that they are not showing favoritism towards him by asking for any special conditions through the-through the processing of him tomorrow. But also, that they're not focused on the D.A, that they're not siding with anything that the D.A. wants to do. So, tomorrow, what you'll see is the Secret Service in a very unique role as just the protector, focused on Donald Trump, and then should anything happen, deferring to the NYPD to deal with the perimeter, the city at large, they are in close coordination, but they are not the main entity tomorrow.",

We know that Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is a big Donald Trump supporter, is coming to protest. And the mayor of New York City called her out by name and told her to behave.DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Alisyn. I mean, look, there have been fears that tomorrow would be a sort of January 6th- style event and what we're seeing online right now does not indicate that that is going to happen. Of course, there are some qualifications there that I'll get to, but what we have seen is there is a lot of outrage online. There has been kind of steady stream of violent rhetoric which we have seen, including threats to the district attorney here, Alvin Bragg, and also, you know, just the general sort of outrage. But what we're not seeing what we saw, you know, in the days and weeks leading up to January 6. We're not seeing that kind of mobilization where people are talking about coming to New York, where people are organizing bosses and flights, etcetera, despite, of course, Marjorie Taylor Greene calling people to New York City. Senior law enforcement officials, people who are familiar with the planning and also experts who track this online are echoing that they're not seeing that kind of surge in mobilization. I will point out, though, very importantly and of course something that law enforcement will be wary of tomorrow, is that, you know, the sophisticated players in this game, they are going to be using encrypted private channels. They know now, especially after January 6, that law enforcement, the media, and everybody else is keeping an eye on these public forums, so it is possible that organizing is happening in private channels.",

So, that has not undermined the real threat of what happened on that day, but I think that we do ourselves a disservice on this unprecedented day when we're trying to find some level of common ground, when we're seeing a pretty divisive action to try to kind of allow that to have even more of an impact on how we view and talk about the day.",

And like there's an opportunity here to just, you know, get-I mean, I don't think he has had a lot of incendiary language. She has, too.

It has never been to a former president, that's true. However, as \"The New York Times\" reports, the false business records charge, which is what people expect with this, is the bread and butter of the district attorney's white color practice.

I always try to see what is the thread that runs in between all of those polls. And the thing that does run it between all those polls is that most Americans believe this to be political.
