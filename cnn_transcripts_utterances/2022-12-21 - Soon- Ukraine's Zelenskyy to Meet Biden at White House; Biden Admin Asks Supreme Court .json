And the American people about to get a look at Donald Trump's tax returns after almost four years of legal fighting. All right. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin this morning with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's surprise visit to the U.S. In just a few hours, he will meet with President Biden at the White House. It is Zelenskyy's first trip outside of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Ukraine's president is expected to address Congress. The Biden administration is about to a now it's a additional $1.8 billion in assistance to Ukraine, that includes patriot missile defense systems. CNN's Clare Sebastian is live in London for us. Clare, Zelenskyy's trip is not without risk.",

In just a few hours ago, when he said he was already on his way. So, those immediate risks to his security.There are also risks for him politically, remember at the beginning in the war when the U.S. offered to evacuate him from Ukraine, he said I do not need a ride, I need ammunition. So I think to make this trip politically sound he needs to bring back that significant weapons package from the U.S. I think that weapons pocket in itself carries some risks as all of these foreign weapon deliveries to, in terms of how Moscow will see it. They do see it as an escalation. The spokesperson this morning saying that these weapons deliveries, it all leads to an operation of the conflict and does not bode well for Ukraine. But, when Zelenskyy appears to have calculated that the benefits will outweigh the risks. The optics of this meeting will be crucial, a face-to-face meeting with President Biden and the oval office, addressing the joint session of Congress, all of that will showcase the alliance with the U.S. and the West and even strengthen it as we head into a new congress, with Republican control of the House. Of course, the substance as well patriot missiles will be crucial for Ukraine as they try to defend their electricity grid and their civilian infrastructure from that continued Russian bombardment, Christine.",
