But, first, we are also following three major stories unfolding this hour. Right now, up on Capitol Hill, a House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a hearing on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. It's the third consecutive day of hearings on the botched security that allowed a sniper to get dangerously close to the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This new body cam footage was posted on social media by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who is demanding more transparency.This afternoon, another story we're following, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address Congress to shore up U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza. Some members of Congress will not attend. The former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, we're just learning in the last several minutes, also will not be attending today. And tonight, President Biden delivers a rare Oval Office address to the nation. He'll discuss his decision to end his reelection bid and what he plans for his final months in office. But we begin up on Capitol Hill, where the FBI director is about to testify about the Bureau's investigation into the attempt on Trump's life. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez joins me here in Washington and CNN Law Enforcement Contributor and retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent Steve Moore is in Los Angeles. Evan, let me start with you first. I mean, this is another big hearing on what took place at that rally. I mean, one of the things I think we're going to hear from the FBI director is whether or not they've learned anything more about the motive of the shooter. But what are you going to be looking forward to?",

      "sentences": "Right. I think that is the big, big outstanding question, Jim. And I think obviously they're also interested in finding out whether there's anybody who's been found who could have been an accomplice or who could have known about this, anything that they've found in his digital footprints that he left behind.Obviously, there's a lot of his search -- searches that they have looked at, and also just people around him, you know, whether he gave any indication of carrying this out of his intent to do this. But I do think that, you know, a lot of what we're going to hear is some basic stuff about the police work that has gone in so far. You know, yesterday we learned some very important things from Christopher Paris. He's the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner, who said, you know, they found eight shell casings at with the shooter, meaning it appears he shot eight times. He got about eight shots off in the seconds that he had to operate. We also know again from Paris that there was -- that he was probably on the roof for about two to three minutes and that he was essentially in the seconds before he started firing. There was a police officer who lifted up his head above that roof, saw him and perhaps prompted him to fire off much faster than he wanted to. I want to refer to that video, though, that video that we've now watched a little bit. It gives us some important context.",

So, Director Ray has seen what happened in the other hearings and knows that he needs to provide information, what we used to call feeding the beast. You have to give them something.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And, Steve, just to bounce off of what Evan Perez was saying, I mean, it might be a little unfair for some of these lawmakers to go after the FBI director about talk about security breakdowns by the Secret Service. I mean, he can't answer for the Secret Service. He may get asked about it, but he's going to say I can't answer for the Secret Service. But I do think this question of the motive of the shooter is still very important. We have that video that we can show our viewers once again of this video of what was taking place on that rooftop that was released by Chuck Grassley's office.And, you know, one of the things that Evan and I were talking about just before we got started here is, you know, this roof, again, when you look at it, it just looks like something where you should have seen you know, a Secret Service agent or some kind of law enforcement official up there.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you should have. And, you know, with the testimony yesterday from the Pennsylvania State Police there were apparently people posted in other buildings who could see this, who could see this roof completely. And it may be that they left their post to go and try to find Crooks thinking that he was very suspicious and needed to be addressed.The problem with that is if you leave your observation post, some people may not know that they've lost eyes on the top of that building. What they should have done is stayed there, guided somebody to Crooks and maintained their post. These are things that are going to be coming out here. I think what you're going to find is there's going to be a series of significant but seemingly at times minor decisions that were made that led to everything coming apart. It's like an airline crash. Three or four things have to happen in quick succession before an airliner will ever go down. I suspect you're going to find three or four tactical decisions that made this possible.",

Again, Director Way, you've been here many times. We appreciate you being here today. We look forward to your testimony and answering our questions.We will begin by swearing you in. Would you please rise and raise your right hand? Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information and beliefs so help you God? Let the record affirm -- let the record reflect that the witness is answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. We have votes coming in about ten minutes, but we definitely want to get through your opening statement as far as we can, and this is going to be an interesting day on Capitol Hill with the prime minister of Israel here as well. So, Director Wray, you're recognized for your opening statement.",

Not that it's going to be earth shattering, but the FBI is going to want to show that it can provide important, actionable intel to the committee, that they're not just stonewalling him sitting behind those big walls and smoking pipes and saying, what do we do with this information? So, I think that leads into it.At the same time, obviously, they're going to be very careful not to release information where the release itself would compromise the investigation or allow evidence to be destroyed.",
