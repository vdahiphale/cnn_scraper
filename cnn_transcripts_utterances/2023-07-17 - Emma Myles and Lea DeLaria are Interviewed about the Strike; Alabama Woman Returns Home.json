      "sentences": "You're a kid, you have this idea, once I'm on something that people actually see, I'll be rich. And you'll look around after being on that hit show and you're like, wow, I'm still in the same one-bedroom apartment. Was this how it's supposed to be? Now Emma Myles and Lea DeLaria join me now.Emma, can you explain to the audience -- first of all, what are residual checks, right? What are they supposed to be? And what does that financially look like for you once you've been on a show like \"Orange is the New Black\"? EMMA MYLES, ACTOR, \"ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK\": OK. Well, in terms of how our business works, residuals typically are paid out for network, cable, movies. And they're basically a share of the profits that come from the revenue, from being on a network. So, there's a lot of advertisement, there's a lot of money that comes with that. So, the residuals for network is -- they're a lot, a lot higher. Like much higher. And we have certain bases in our contract that say that they have to be at a certain percentage. They have to be calculated that way. Now, in terms of residuals for \"Orange,\" we were not based off of network and cable. We were off -- we were based off of this new thing called streaming, which basically didn't exist when we started the show. So, the contract that we had reflected like webisodes and web series and things that were on YouTube and promotional videos. And the way that those residuals are calculated, we are actually not sure because for the millions upon millions of dollars in revenue that these companies, these streaming companies, particularly, are raking in, there's not really much of a kickback for any of the people involved on the creative side. So, for something like an episode of \"Law &amp; Order: SVU\" that you would have gotten like a good, like, several thousand dollars from it re-airing on television, there's - you'd get about, I don't know, $20 for people to be able to watch \"Orange,\" all five seasons of \"Orange,\" in perpetuity.",

But, Lea, you said that there was this accidental moment of clarity from Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, because he compared \"Orange is the New Black,\" which was a groundbreaking show in so many ways, to the other hit show, \"Game of Thrones.\" What did that tell you? LEA DELARIA, ACTOR, \"ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK\": Well, we were all at a party when Ted said that, that we were bigger than \"Game of Thrones.\" And we were all - it was a -- you know, we were a very tight-knit cast. We hung out a lot. And we were all kind of hanging out together, and he made that statement. And it was a complete aha moment for everyone at that party. We all just looked at each other. And, of course, give me the money! Where's the money? I'm still -- I'm still living in my Bushwick (ph) apartment! Where's the money?",

They wanted to get a picture with me. So -- and I'd love to be -- I'm always gracious to my fans. So is Emma. You know, without our fans, we'd be nothing. But it's kind of rough when I -- my last residual check came in June. It was for $20.27. And, like, you know, every time I have to stop and get my picture taken, that's 20 times a day, you know? It seems like first-world problems, but that's how famous we are, and we're making $20.27.",

So, both things can't be true at the same time.How do I see this ending? I mean I want it to end well. I think that we're not going to stop fighting until we get certain protections in place so that what happened to us on \"Orange\" can't happen to any other cast ever again. I mean we should be fairly compensated. They are making billions of dollars off of work that is being kind of shoved out into - into the universe and - and no one can support their livelihoods.

Police arrived to the scene and found her car and some belongings. They even offered a $25,000 reward for any information.Let's bring in now CNN's Ryan Young. So, Ryan, what's the latest on this?

You think about her frantic call to 911 saying a toddler was on the side of the road. And, of course, they did find some of her belongings and that car. And for hours there was search efforts, people were trying to find her. And then on Saturday, she showed up at her parent's home. Now, they released a statement that in part says, look, my husband and I want to make this statement again, as we did last night. It's nothing more to add or take away from how we are feeling right now. God is faithful and he answered our prayers. We are so grateful to each of you for all the acts of kindness, generosity, and compassion you have shown. So you understand the family is just so excited about the fact that she has returned home. But there are other questions. And the police department did say they're waiting for her to go to the hospital, to get evaluated. And at some point they're going to try to sit down and interview her and figure out exactly what happened because, of course, a lot of people have questions about not only where she was, but also what happened to that toddler.
