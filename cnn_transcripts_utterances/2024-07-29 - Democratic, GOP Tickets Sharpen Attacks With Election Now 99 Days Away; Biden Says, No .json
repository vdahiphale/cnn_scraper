I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.Countdown to Election Day, we now have only 99 days left in a presidential race that has been turned upside down in the past week, to say the least. Kamala Harris, the Democrats' presumptive nominee, and her surrogates are road testing a one word attack on their Republican rivals, weird. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird. I mean, that's the box you put that in, right? GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN):  These guys are just weird. That's who they are. So, it isn't much else. But we're not afraid of weird people. We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid. DOUG EMHOFF, U.S. SECOND GENTLEMAN:  It's not about her or her opponent, really. It's no matter what kind of weird stuff they keep saying. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  It's the weirdest thing. He'll go in, like, literally hug an American flag. Now, I love the flag, but, I mean, it's like weird what he does, right? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She made Bernie Sanders look like a moderate Democrat. We have a man that can't put two sentences together, and now we're replacing him with, worse than he is, a dangerous person who's not smart.

That's money for advertising, operations, getting staff fanned out across the country to advance her message. And then I think what's even more instructive about that $200 million is that the campaign says that 66 percent of that money is coming from first time donors.

Just after it was announced that the vice president was going to become the nominee, I set out a challenge to people to raise $100,000 on Twitter in one hour for the vice president.

But, secondly, I think we need to go out there and talk to people.For too long, the Democratic Party has just seated men overall, but especially white men. And, you know, part of why we're organizing this White Dudes for Harris call is because is to show folks that it's okay to support the vice president.

And on top of that, he's just a very down to earth guy. You know, he's not gimmicky or anything like that. And he just gets out there and he's relatable. He's funny. As I mentioned, he came up with that whole line of, you know, these Republicans are just weird. He's an excellent communicator and I know a lot of people have concerns about his age. But he's actually only one year older than Kamala Harris. And I would attribute much of that difference in appearance to the fact that he supervised the lunchroom as a teacher for 20 years, which will definitely age you. And, ultimately, I really think he helps us lock up the blue wall and he's just extremely qualified to be in that position, not to mention his enormous successes as governor.

But what these proposals, the underlying premise of these proposals, especially the 18-year term limits one, is that that these justices actually aren't so independent and they're staying -- you know, let's just take Clarence Thomas, for example, he was appointed in 1991 at the very young age of 43. And he is still there. He's into his third decade.And there's been a lot of pressure, not just from the Biden administration, but for many people thinking that this kind of, you know, decades-long tenure for any justice on either side of the ideological spectrum is too long, and that there would be more fairness brought by actual term limits. And there have been times Pamela when individual justices themselves have talked about a supporting term limits, but I have to say in this case, you know, first of all, 18 years, Clarence Thomas is way beyond that. Even Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed in 2005, is already beyond an 18-year limit. So, it would be quite dramatic, and, as you note, the Constitution does give lifetime tenure.",

What is clear is that the United States understands that Israel will have to respond to this attack over the weekend, but it is hoping that this will be a measured response that sends a message, but that prevents this conflict from spiraling into all out war between Israel and Hezbollah, an all-out war in this region, with the risk of Iran also being pulled into this conflict. I just returned from that community of Majdal Shams, Pam, and I can tell you that this is a community still trying to piece together the horror of what happened. We came across so many people who had been on the scene in the first moments after this rocket struck, and they described absolutely atrocious and gruesome injuries to the children who were simply trying to play soccer on a hot summer evening there. And we also spoke with the father of one of the victims, 11-year-old Alma. She was playing soccer that day and her father arrived on the scene only able to identify her by the bracelet on her hand. He says that there is no question in his mind that Hezbollah was responsible. He wants to see an Israeli response. And he was actually one of the families of the victims who met with the Israeli prime minister today in Majdal Shams. Although we should note that the Israeli prime minister's visit was not welcomed by all. He was also heckled there by dozens of people from that community who told them to go home, who told them that he was not welcome there. Pam?",
