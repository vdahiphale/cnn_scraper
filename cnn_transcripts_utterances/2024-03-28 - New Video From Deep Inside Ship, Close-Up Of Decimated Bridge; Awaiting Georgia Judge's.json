And for the first time, we are seeing what it looks like deep inside that vessel. Plus, Russia tonight claiming Ukraine paid for the deadly terror attack in Moscow, and it comes as CNN has new reporting about what Putin knew exactly in the days leading up to the attack. A special report from Moscow ahead. And live pictures from New York. Biden and Obama together again, about to hold a fundraiser that has already pulled in $25 million. And we have new numbers about a surprising group of voters that have been loyal to Biden and could be key to a win in November. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. We have brand new video just into OUTFRONT from on board that massive cargo ship. Here you can see hazardous material, investigators and engineers from the NTSB inspecting the ship. They're also surveying the damage from the Key Bridge's steel that came crashing down. You can see the debris on the deck. It's actually 3,000 to 4,000 tons of steel that is sitting on top of the ship. And for the first time, we have video from deep inside the vessel. You can take a look at the damage there. Parts of the ship shredded like paper. You remember that at least 56 containers on the ship contain hazardous materials and according to officials, 13 were impacted. And what you see here are NTSB investigators in the bridge of the ship, downloading the vessel voyage data recorder, information that could reveal what happened moments before the ship slammed into the bridge. This as new video that comes as a barge able to lift the thousand tons is heading to the scene, along with other vessels. It is not only a huge undertaking, but also one that must be done with extreme care. It is believed that there could still be four bodies trapped in that debris. There's also new details about the crew of the ship. OUTFRONT spoke with the director of Apostleship of the Sea. It's an organization that provides assistance to international crews. And he tells us that he spoke to the crew three times today. He says they're all still on the ship and have been there since the incident. CNN also learning at least one of the crew members was injured during the crash and had to be taken to the hospital for stitches. And tonight, an incredible story of luck, a construction worker who is supposed to be on the key bridge the night of the crash, telling CNN he requested a last-minute shift change that night. He says that decision saved his life and we'll have more on his story coming up. Brian Todd and Danny Freeman are both OUTFRONT live for us in Baltimore. And I want to start with you, Brian. Tell us more about this incredible glimpse that we're getting from the investigation onboard the Dali tonight.",

And of course they had all the voice data that they still have. So, that's a good bit of info formation that they have to work with. And they are in the process of downloading and getting all the other information that they can get from the bridge, from anywhere else on the ship, from any other recordings are cameras and starting their work in interviewing all of the ship crew and the river pilots. That will be a very important part. So even with the rudimentary data, they have, we have a timeline. We know what happened. We know the speed. The why is going to be much more difficult. They have an even began to release any information on what happened to the ship while it was in dark before it left and enter the channel.

And a lot of people can take this as an opportunity to get to understand the maritime domain and the maritime industry a lot better, as we start to recognize just how critically important it is to our life on land.But what we have to look at are at least three key hypotheses as to what happened. The first is that there's some sort of mechanical or electrical issue perhaps because of maintenance, perhaps because of a human error on board the ship. And that's possible. The second one is that there's a problem with the fuel that was on board the ship. Also possible, probably the least likely, but we have seen this issue come up in the past in 2018, there were quite a few ships that went dead out of the port of Houston, Singapore, Rotterdam, some key ports because of bad bunker fuel. But the third is that there's some problem with the control systems on the ship, and that points to a cyber problem. It isn't clear whether that cyber problem is either unintentional or intentional but we have to again keep a very wide open mind about this to see what really did occur and why it occurred.

Danny Freeman is OUTFRONT live from Baltimore. Danny, what is the latest that you're learning about what is truly an unbelievable story of human survival? DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Briana, the more than were out here, the more than we learn about not only these of survival, but also, you mentioned that those stories that are close calls as well. I mean, when you look at this bridge behind me, or what's left of this bridge behind me, you can imagine that enormous drop, those bitterly cold waters below that violent collapse. And despite all of that, two people who are on that bridge survived. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREEMAN (voice-over):  It's a miraculous story of survival. We're learning new details about the construction worker who fell more than 185 feet into the water and lived. Jeffrey Pritzker, the executive vice president of Brawner Builders, says the Mexican national who worked for the company likely survived by swimming before being rescued by first responders. The man was treated at the University of Maryland Medical Centers Shock Trauma Center, but was released hours after the collapse. Pritzker added the worker is, quote, very, very upset. He does have injuries and I understand he's very stressed out and is suffering from stress. A fellow worker from Brawner Builders told CNN Thursday, the team likely would have been on their brick at the time of the impact. That worker saying he requested a last-minute shift change ahead of Tuesday, likely saving his life. However, less is known about the second survivor who Pritzker said was not part of their construction team. At Wednesday night's press conference, Maryland's Governor Wes Moore said he's spoken with a survivor who narrowly escaped with his life. GOV. WES MOORE (D), MARYLAND:  One of the survivors who I had the opportunity to speak with -- one of the things he mentioned to me was as he was moving off of the bridge and literally saw the bridge fall right after he moved off it was because it was a first responder who was telling him to move off the bridge.",

We saw the slaughter in Mariupol, but we never saw anything like this coming from the Ukrainian side because we are just not doing this.Neither Russian volunteers which are together with the Ukrainians or Ukrainians themselves, despite with all the hatreds and the bloodshed which was inflicted on Ukraine during last 10 years. So, we see very clearly that Vladimir Putin could have reacted on numerous warnings. We know that there were two warnings coming from the United States and by the way, he never said, thank you. I am saying thank you for American people for giving the warnings you really guys try to save our lives. But he ignored that, and he ignored the warnings of his own security services. Why he did it? I think he did that on purpose. Well, one hour. That was the wait time for the police, which was located exactly on the side of the terrorist attack to arrive, 2.5 miles away, there was a SWAT unit which took hour-and-a-half to arrive to the site. I think that couldn't be done by accident. I think they were acting on orders.",

The mood inside obviously is going to be very different. This is thethree presidents, one sitting two former participating in a conversation moderated by comedian Stephen Colbert, they're going to be a number of celebrities and artists in the audience as well. Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Mindy Kaling is going to be emceeing this event as well. The total haul, as you mentioned from the single the event is going to be $25 million, and counting. Sources also telling me about a third of that actually came from donations online that was less than $200. The ticket that was the most expensive $500,000 a pop, that actually comes with extra perks, like getting a photo taken with the three presidents, getting an invitation to the after-party that is hosted by the first lady. And asked for President Biden and former President Obama, they obviously got to spend some quality time together this afternoon. They rode on Air Force One together, the motorcade together. They also spend sometime taping a podcast. I think the campaign released some photos that you can show and obviously these are two men who went through a lot together and the eight years that they were both in the White House. And you can easily imagine a lot of the very a serious topics of the two men probably discuss in the hours that they had together -- Brianna.",

I mean, you know, for good reason, people have been very focused on Trumps gains in polling this spring and last winter with Black and Hispanic voters. He is now on track to not only significantly improved from 2020 with both Black and Hispanic voters, but to run better than any Republican presidential candidates since the civil rights era, among those voters, better than Reagan, better than W. Bush. So understandable that people are focusing a lot on that.The other side of the ledger has not gotten a lot of attention, which is that Biden is largely holding his 2020 vote among white voters. He's running in most polls slightly better than he did among college educated whites, which isn't totally shocking given that January 6 and Dobbs both happened after the 2020 election. And maybe the most surprising thing is he hasn't lost a lot of ground in most of these polls among the non-college whites, sort of the heart of Trump's coalition. And if Biden can in fact hold this support among white voters that he now has been receiving in these polls, it kind of flips the key question in the election. I mean, the key question becomes whether Donald Trump, while running on as racially polarizing agenda as he is using language like immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country, talking about pardoning the January 6 rioters or mass deportation and military action against Mexico, whether with all of that behind him Trump can sustain the inroads that he has made among these non-white voters all the way to November. We know that there's a lot of discontent among them about Biden. He is -- his approval rating is much lower than Democrats -- Democratic presidents usually receive among Black and Hispanic voters, but it's another thing to say whether Trump can sustain historic numbers when more of those voters learn, I think more about what he is proposing and the kind of language he's using.",
