It's good to have you with us.In just a few hours, President Biden steps back onto the world stage, addressing the general assembly at the United Nations. President Biden is expected the stress the themes of diplomacy and democracy. These are thoughts that he recently shared at the G20 summit in India. Unlike the G20 he will be speaking in a room without representation from China or Russia. Biden is expected to spend a good portion of his remarks, drumming up support for Ukraine in their efforts to defeat Russia. All as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes his first in- person appearance at the U.N. since the war started. CNN's Jasmine Wright joins us from Washington. Jasmine, good morning, thank you for being up early with us. What are we learning at this hour about what Biden plans to say?",

Ways to reform the organization to make it more inclusive. And of, course talk a lot in-depth about Ukraine and the war against Russia. We will also hear President Biden talk more about him some defending human rights, and issues that are very prioritized in his administration as he looks to make sure that America is really on this world stage in a significant way, really holding back on his former policy achievements that we've seen over the course of the year. And, of course, that speech is going to be significant. But also what he does on the sidelines, those meetings that he, has we expect him to meet later on with the U.N. secretary general, as well as five presidents from Central Asian countries. And later on this week, we know who had that prominent meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as was others. And, of course, we can expect in, later on this week, to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy here in Washington, as they really make the case to Congress for the need for more funding for Ukraine in major priority of Biden over the last few months -- Kasie.",

And they also came to terms with this prisoner exchange of sorts, where we saw the five Americans, all of whom have been wrongfully detained in Iran.And those five Iranians who are released from U.S. custody. The U.S. official described the Iranians released as, quote, small potatoes. They said these are not people that the Iranian government officials really care about here. And you know, we saw things start to move freely in earnest about a month ago when four of the five Americans were released into House arrest from that notorious Evin prison in Tehran. The fifth one was already under house arrest. And it was yesterday that we really saw that breakthrough moment where they were released from Iranian custody. We saw that moment, there on the tarmac where they got to Doha. And they got to see some of the U.S. officials who had been working on their release for years. They left Ohio yesterday afternoon, and they are on their way back to the United States where they will be reunited with their families for the first time in years -- Kasie.",

We could see scattered storms around the great lakes.But after a dreary start to the day, yesterday, the seaboard looking much better to start your Tuesday morning. So you could see those strong storms start to develop. You could see through Oklahoma, Texas, pushing into Arkansas throughout the overnight hours. Could see large to very large hail, damaging winds, and you could see in that area shaded in yellow that is really where we're looking, at Dallas Metroplex could see some strong storms as well. But your greatest chance of two inch or greater hail diameter for the hail is in the area where the hash marks are. So that's where we could see the largest hail. So your forecast rainfall, looking at about an inch or two of, rain some isolated locations could see even more. But as mentioned, this is really a drop stricken area anywhere from the, plains all the way down to the south. We've had a lot of areas in extreme or exceptional drought. Meanwhile, we are going to see above average temperatures across the south, the plains and northern tier of the country. Below average temperatures for the West, but it is going to stay hot across the south. Dallas would be in the mid 90s, a couple of degrees above normal. Oklahoma City in the 80s but cooling off across the north where we see temperatures in the upper 60s, and for Chicago, and then a warming trend briefly for that region.
