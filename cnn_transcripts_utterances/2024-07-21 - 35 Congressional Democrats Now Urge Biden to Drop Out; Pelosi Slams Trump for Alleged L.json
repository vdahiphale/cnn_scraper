And this is what's ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\"CNN learns former national security officials are now voicing their concerns to Joe Biden about the presidential race, what they're saying, and how the White House is responding. Donald Trump hits the campaign trail with his new running mate. Hear the message he took to a battleground state in his first rally since surviving an assassination attempt. And Israel and Yemen launch more attacks against each other as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to visit the U.S. We are now just 107 days away from the U.S. presidential election, and the race looks very different for the two leading parties. At least 35 Democratic lawmakers are now publicly urging U.S. President Biden to drop out of the race, and he is not taking that in stride. Mr. Biden is reportedly, quote, \"seething\" toward Nancy Pelosi amid the growing list of Democratic defections. Ironically, the former Speaker of the House headlined what was touted as a, quote, \"unity dinner\" in North Carolina. It's a stark contrast with the Republican Party, where the Trump-Vance campaign is in full swing. The former president held his first rally on Saturday since surviving an assassination attempt a week earlier. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden spent another day in isolation recovering from COVID in Delaware, and more than three weeks after his disastrous debate performance. The President's campaign says he's standing firm with his run for a second term. They say he's the only Democrat who beat Trump before, and he'll do it again. Priscilla Alvarez reports.

      "sentences": "President Biden is facing a fresh wave of Democratic lawmakers who say that he should step aside and allow someone else to be the Democratic candidate and nominee. They remain unconvinced that the President is up to the task of taking on former President Donald Trump this election year and continue to pour out letters asking for him to drop out of the race. But as over the course of all of this happening, the President is behind closed doors as he is trying to recover from COVID and has been self- isolating at his residence in Delaware.Sources telling CNN that the President remains in touch with his close advisers as they grapple with what has become an increasingly challenging moment for this campaign, not only hearing from Democratic lawmakers, but also donors, allies, and in a letter obtained by CNN, former national security officials and high-ranking foreign policy experts who say that it's too risky for the President to stay in the race, particularly because it could allow former President Donald Trump to take a second term and, in turn, potentially have a toll on national security. So the campaign, however, is remaining firm. They say that the President is going to stay in the race and that there are no plans for that to change. They also say that once the President recovers from COVID, that he will hit the campaign trail again. Now, the Vice President was on the trail. She had a fundraiser in Massachusetts where she raised more than $2 million. Aides tell me that the Vice President and the President remain close, that there's no daylight between the two, despite some lawmakers floating her name as a replacement for -- to lead the party's ticket. But the campaign saying that this is the Biden-Harris ticket, that they remain on course, even as it becomes even more challenging for them to stay afloat as Democratic lawmakers continue to ask the President to withdraw from the race.

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Understand this, what they have in their 2025, you know that thing, that Project 2025. What's his name keeps saying, I don't have anything to do with it. I don't even know these people. No, they worked in his office. One was the head of the Office of Management and Budget. The other is a head of personnel. He knows him. He knows him full well. And that is the agenda. (END VIDEO CLIP) [05:05:06] PLEITGEN: Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 when he appeared with J.D. Vance at a campaign rally in Michigan on Saturday. It was his first rally since surviving an assassination attempt last weekend. The former President told the crowd that he, quote, \"took a bullet for democracy.\" His speech, however, focused on familiar themes of America being in decline and it all being the fault of current President Joe Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris. Our own Kristen Holmes has more from Grand Rapids, Michigan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump spoke in Grand Rapids, Michigan for roughly two hours. It was all over the place kind of speech. He seemed very much in his element in this crowd that was thousands of people cheering for him. Now, he did touch on some issues that would affect people in Michigan, this critical battleground state that he won in 2016 and lost in 2020. And really, both Republicans and Democrats believe is crucial to winning back the White House. He talked about getting rid of electric vehicles. He talked about boosting up autoworkers, bringing more jobs to Michigan. And he also talked about ending this kind of flood of immigration, quote, unquote, \"sealing the border\" was what he used. Now, the other thing I want to point out is this was the first campaign rally with his new vice-presidential nominee, J.D. Vance. And it is important to note that it was in Michigan because part of the appeal of J.D. Vance was that he could possibly reach voters in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, obviously Ohio, which is now more of a red state, so votes aren't super needed, but in Pennsylvania. These are all critical swing states because of his working-class background. We did hear from J.D. Vance. We saw them interact on the stage. Now, the other portion I want to actually show you or have you listen to is when he talked about Project 2025. They believe him, they being Donald Trump and his team, that Project 2025 is an actual liability to him. This, of course, being the think tank Heritage Foundation's transition approach, which has really come under fire for a lot of its controversial and far-right policies. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND.2024 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Like some on the right, severe right, came up with this Project 25. And I don't even know. I mean, some of them, I know who they are. But they're very, very conservative, just like you have. They're sort of the opposite of the radical left. OK, you have the radical left and you have the radical right. And they come up with this project. I don't know what the hell it is. It's Project 25. He's involved in Project. And then they read some of the things and they are extreme. I mean, they're seriously extreme. But I don't know anything about it. HOLMES: Now, Donald Trump has tried to diss himself multiple times. At one point, he actually said that he didn't know anyone involved in Project 2025, which is not true. Many of the people who are part of the various groups that are part of 2025 worked in his last administration. Many of them are still current advisers, are still currently friendly with Donald Trump. And a lot of them are suspected to be part of a second administration. However, he has said that those policies are, some of them at least, are too far, too extreme. And again, it's not just Donald Trump's team who believes this is a vulnerability for Donald Trump. Joe Biden's team has also been seizing on this, running ads, attacking Trump and Project 2025.

All this follows intense scrutiny over how a sniper was able to get access to a rooftop from which he shot Trump in an assassination attempt.A spokesman for the Secret Service told CNN that the agency has not provided certain resources itself at times, but state or local partners are sometimes used in connection with a protectee. And it stresses that no requests for extra security were denied for that Pennsylvania rally. The Director of the Secret Service will likely face questions over these issues during her testimony this coming week. Kimberly Cheatle will appear before several committees in Congress over the security failures that led to the assassination attempt last week. And, of course, earlier this week, we learned U.S. authorities obtained intelligence about an Iranian assassination plot against Donald Trump, believed to be in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Trump ordered his death while president and boasted about it. Sources say there is nothing to suggest Iran had any involvement in the shooting last weekend at Trump's rally in Pennsylvania.

More than 2000 domestic and international flights in the U.S. were canceled on Saturday and more than 8000 were delayed.

Many international carriers say their systems are back or close to being restored, including Turkish Airlines, Jetstar Japan and Hong Kong Express Airlines.
