They pulled out of Gaza overnight Saturday into Sunday and what the IDF is saying here, they've pulled out the significant force and 98 Division from Han units in the center of Gaza. They've been fighting there for more than three months now, since December last year.The IDF is not saying that this is an end of the fight. They say they are leaving significant forces in the north of Gaza, the 162nd Division, the Nahal Brigade remained in the north of Gaza. But these troops here are being pulled out for recuperation and preparation for future operations that the IDF describes this as effectively marking an end of ground operations in Gaza in their current form. And in that way, that sort of statement and the movement is potentially significant around the negotiating talks in Cairo where the CIA chief, the Mossad chief, the head of Egyptian intelligence, Qatari Prime Minister are expected to further explore how they can get a ceasefire, how they can get the hostages released from Hamas. There have been so many different sticking points, potentially though this offers maybe to change the dynamic but the very clear implication from the IDF is that option to go into Rafah remains on the table. And we've seen along the border here today, airstrikes continuing to go into the Khan Younis area. You can hear the fighter jets won't fight. I just heard an explosion there and you hear the fighter jets overhead. So this war is far from over. This movement though for the 98th division that is significant.

That is a practice that the U.S. and other economies have been doing for decades. And so the other issue Yellen has mentioned, as raised, of course, is a warning that Chinese not to provide any material support for the Russian defense industrial complex to aid Moscow's war effort in Ukraine something Mr. Biden has raised with Mr. Xi as well. And but as we speak, though, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov actually has arrived in Beijing for more talks with his Chinese counterparts, presumably to strengthen their so called No Limit partnership. So, the Chinese obviously have made a strategic choice because of their shared grievances with Moscow against this American dominated world order. And they're determined to reshape it. So, it's good that Yellen is here and having all these talks with his Chinese counterparts after that deep freeze for the past few years, but fundamentally, though, it's very difficult to see how that's going to change this relationship because of the strategic differences between the two sides, especially in the U.S. election year, Michael.",

It looks like we have a storm system though developing on the southern end of the path where a severe risk is growing for damaging winds, large hail, even isolated tornadoes from Texas into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The good news is though it looks like the storms do blow up after the eclipse. We've got a couple of showers kind of right as the eclipse is starting that partial eclipse and then they blow up right after that peak, probably after three or four o'clock so you might have a one to two hour window to seek shelter if you're in a place like Dallas outside to watch the eclipse, though it will come with cloud cover.Mostly cloudy skies in Dallas temperatures in the 70s. 1:42 is your total solar eclipse time, then it ends at three and those storms will fire up shortly after. It's all part of the system that kind of stalls right near that path of totality, bringing you some showers from Middle Tennessee, and then over towards the Carolinas. We do have some clouds that will come with it from Texas into Louisiana on the southern end of the path, some clearing across the Ohio Valley. And even some clearing in New England to also looks like a pretty good spot to catch the total solar eclipse. We're looking at some places like little rock where we'll have some mostly cloudy skies a little bit close to that system, your totalities at 1:51, place like Rochester also finding some mostly cloudy skies with your peak at 3:20. Now what's so cool about this too is we will find temperatures taking a dip while you have the peak totality of that shadow, because it's cutting off the energy from the sun. So those temperatures are going to briefly come down and will pop back up once the shadow moves away from the sun and we get those temperatures to rebound. So something that we'll have to watch out for closely. So not only will you experience the total darkness in totality, you'll experience that temperature drop the relative humidity increases as the temperatures dip closer to that dew point, the winds could have decreased too, and so could your cloud cover.

And that is essentially where the very center of the moon shadow silently slips across the face of the earth.So if you're standing in the Path of Totality, the center of the moon shadow will pass right over here you will find yourself in the moon shadow itself, which from space looks very dark, and from the ground also looks very dark. In fact, it's been compared to a sort of artificial night really, it's a natural kind of night, but a very short one that lasts just a few minutes and you'd be forgiven for thinking that night has fallen. And in fact, you might find that wildlife around you thinks that night has fallen as well and birds like to go and roost and then wake up again. So it's a very strange experience.

And in Georgia, you're not that far away, in fact, so you will have the opportunity to see a very spectacular partial eclipse.Now, the important thing to understand about a partial eclipse is that you can't look directly at the sun during this phase, it would be dangerous to do so. So you need to make sure you have a safe way of viewing that. But if you do have some eclipse glasses, for example, or an eclipse viewer, or if you can project the image of the sun, you'll be able to see the sun take on a crescent shape as it is partially covered up by the face of the moon.",

And Israel was looking for targets and over many, many months, they will gain that information, huge amounts of data from their own intelligence, from drones, from Americans who also were providing information from Pine Gap which is a us military base in the center of Australia, which has also been used by the Americans to help the Israelis. All this data feeds into a system. And what essentially the report shows, this is also backed up by my reporting in the last years, because Israel been using A.I. in warfare before October 7, not on this scale though, is that precision is not the aim here. But the idea was to go after potentially low-level Hamas operatives. It's important to note that how does it define what a Hamas operative actually is and civilian casualties were not a concern. And as soon as this report came out, a few days ago, international lawyers and the U.N. expressed profound concern because without proportionality, these are war crimes, mass war crimes, and tens of thousands of people died in the first month based on this.",

And it's not done with consent. It's important to note that and it also says in that story, which also backed up my own reporting that often its imprecise that its trying to find, so Israel claims, Hamas operatives when often Israel does not actually know who is Hamas and who is not. And more importantly, how they define that is incredibly overly broad and the company behind that you mentioned Core Side (ph) has worked extensively with repressive police forces around the world and including occupation forces in the West Bank.
