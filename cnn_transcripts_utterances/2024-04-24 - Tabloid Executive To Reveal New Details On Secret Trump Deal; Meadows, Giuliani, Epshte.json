ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yeah, Erin, like you said, look, the 11 fake electors from Arizona that Trump fake electors, they were all indicted. That includes Kelli Ward, who was the former head of the Republican Party here in Arizona, along with her husband, Michael Ward. But more importantly, these names that are redacted were wondering more about who those people are. They include, as you mentioned, Rudy Giuliani, the former personal attorney of Donald Trump, that includes the former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and it includes Boris Epshteyn, who is still a very close adviser to Donald Trump.

Look, this investigation here in Arizona, it's obviously coming years after those efforts were first exposed. But it will be always thought that it was really focused on the fake electors themselves. Myself and Marshall Cohen reported though in the last few months that the probe did seem to be expanding and did seem to be looking into people who were connected to the Trump campaign on a national level.

But you can look to this to be attacked on political grounds as the basis for which it's moving forward. I guarantee you that's what all the news reports are going to be.

This is not an expression of the First Amendment. This is not an exchange of ideas. This is -- this is threats and intimidation of violence against Jewish students for who they are, for their faith. And that's a terrible trend that's going on in the country right now. We have these similar types of activities and what are becoming violent protests on campuses around the country. And members of Congress I believe have an obligation and responsibility to speak about this and to demand that it come to an end because it's not good for us.",

It's not a good sign. Some of these students apparently are unaware of the atrocities of October 7, or they're denying it.

This isn't a close call.We have terrorist who preyed upon and attacked viciously and killed many innocent Israelis. And the idea that there would be out here in support of that -- Hamas is using civilians as shields for themselves. They put their operations under hospitals and schools. They are -- they are using civilians in a theater of war. And so it's difficult. Why would someone blame Israel for trying to stamp out the very terrorist threats that are right there on the doorstep? We should not be dictating to Israel their military strategy.
