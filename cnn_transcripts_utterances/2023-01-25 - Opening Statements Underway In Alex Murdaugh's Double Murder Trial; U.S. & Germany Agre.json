The problem is that as they came to that conclusion, they have pounded that square peg in the round hole and you'll hear about it they ignore some witnesses.For instance, that blue tarp with the showed up at the blue tarp. That witness said he showed up to with the blue tarp was shown a blue rain jacket that he talked about he said that's not it. That's not what he brought here that morning. I mean, I talked to her.

You're going to have to evaluate the testimony you hear from this witness stand with a critical eye, critical eye. If you got uncontested scientific evidence, you accept it. I've got no problem with that. The cell phone records he keeps talking about, I would say to you are not necessarily accurate to the extent. I will also tell you that there's going to be a bunch of people and I have been promised something or threatened with something that may take the witness stand and say something. But I'll tell you what they're not going to say, they're not going to say they saw him kill them. They're not going to say that they were involved in it. They're not going to say anything that would give you a comfort level in their testimony. All of you have indicated that you will follow the law. I say this one last time. He didn't do it. He didn't kill, butcher his son and wife. And you need to put in your mind any suggestion that he did. You've been picked because you said you could be fair. You were picked because you said you could follow the law. You were picked because Alex Murdaugh believes that you can be fair. Now, during this process over the next however long we're here, I say something or do something it's most certainly based on my career, I will do that irritates you or angers you. Sometimes I'm a little rough, don't hold that against Alex, hold it against me. If I say something that offends you in some way, don't hold it against Alex, hold it against me. Remember, as you sit there now in your mind, he didn't do it. He is innocent. He would require a verdict of not guilty from you. That's the law. That's your oath. Thank you.",

You've been listening to the opening statements of the Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial right there listening to his defense attorney and state prosecutor who spoke just before the attorney. [16I want to bring in Misty Marris, who is a trial attorney, and Areva Martin, an attorney and legal affairs commentator. Areva, this was really a preview of what we should expect to be presented during this trial. What was your biggest takeaway? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR:  Yeah, my biggest take away is that this defense attorney is good, Pam, and he came out the gate and he challenged the jury to basically disregard everything they heard from the prosecutor. He said look, these are not facts. These are theories and then he did something I thought was really good. He had Mr. Murdaugh stand up and he personalized him. He said, look at this guy, this is not the guy that would butcher and brutalize his son that he was just riding around in a car with bonding. He wouldn't shoot his son in the head so his brains literally would explode out of his head. The he talked about the amount of blood that would be on anyone that executed someone in that fashion, then he talked about the timeline, that the timeline doesn't work. That there wasn't enough time for someone to commit these brutal murders, go back to their home, clean up their body, change their clothes and get in the car and exit that property. So he gave the jurors lots of things they could use to create doubt. And basically said, look, sitting here right now, he is innocent, he did not do this. So I think that was a very powerful opening statement by the defense attorney.",

This video that puts him in a place he said he was not at the time. So, that's certainly going to be something that will play out.But we saw the defense get ahead of this, and to Areva's point flip the script and say, well, the prosecution own experts will put together a timeline that simply isn't feasible. Another bombshell coming out of the defense's opening statement, this foreshadowing of an ultimate theory of the case. It seems like this could have been done by two people. That's something I think we'll see more of as this case goes on, alternate theories proposed by the defense.",

Let's fix that.We also see in our brand new poll that there is broad support in the country for the appointment of a special counsel in the Biden case, in the Trump case, north of 80 percent. By the way, that's across Republicans, Democrats, independents. We don't see that agreement in politics.
