What military maneuvers both sides are making now.Fresh protests as France uses what some are calling a constitutional crowbar to force through an unpopular pension reform plan. And that massive blob of stinky seaweed that was spotted in the Atlantic has reached a popular tourist destination and the tourists are not happy. And we begin this hour with what the U.S. false proof that the Russians are lying about that drone incident over the Black Sea. Now the U.S. military has released footage from the drone showing the encounter they say it doesn't clearly show the Russian jet hitting the drone, but it does show damage to his propeller. A Russia claims the MQ-9 Reaper drone lost control and crashed into the Black Sea near Ukraine. A U.S. official reports that Russia has recovered some small pieces of the aircraft. Russian's foreign ministry says it is important to keep the lines of communication open following the incident. Here is U.S. State Department spokesperson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: What happened is that they came into contact we were forced to bring this drone down. Ultimately, we do not want to see incidents like this because they're dangerous. They're reckless. They have the potential to be exculpatory. (END VIDEO CLIP) LU STOUT: Now the U.S. says it is assessing its drone operations in the Black Sea region and Ukraine's military reports and increased Russian presence in the area. Now we have more now from CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): High over the Black Sea a U.S. spy drone points its camera backwards towards its own tail, a Russian fighter jet closing fast on a much slower MQ-9 Reaper. The Russian jet then begins dumping fuel as it passes by the drone, the clouds of fuel vapor and crucially the spinning propeller clearly visible in the video after the pass. The Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter then flies by on another pass dumping fuel once again the jet comes even closer and the video pixelate when the Russian fighter collides with the U.S. drone. When it comes back online, you can see the propeller with a bent blade damaged in the impact. In these side by side images, you can see the propeller before and after operating and damaged. GEN. MARK MILLEY, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional. We also know was very unprofessional and very unsafe. The actual contact of the fixed wing Russian fighter with our UAV the physical contact with those two, not sure yet that remains to be seen.",

And then you see that Su-27 coming in releasing its fuel and then it crashes into the drone.Now, I think that the U.S. military commentator was correct. We don't know whether that pilot intended to collide with a drone, or wherever it was simply sloppy flying on the part of that flight, that pilot.

And I think that what it does is it increases pressure on the U.S. and its allies to think about the F-16 going to Ukraine, because those F-16s will be far more capable than the MiG-29s. They would give the Ukrainians the ability to essentially strike deep in against the Russian rear, particularly in terms of attacking their logistics and their long range fires, and have some charts of defending Ukrainian airspace against the sort of drone threats that Ukraine is facing now. So I think that it's an important political step by Poland to supply those MiG-29s. What comes next hopefully, is the supply of much more capable F-16s.",

The Ukrainians have been asking for attacking missiles, which would give them a much deeper strike capability using a HIMARS.I do think that what's happening is that the United States and Europe basically have Ukraine's back. The Biden administration is saying for as long as it takes. But there's real concern also about avoiding escalation into a wider war if the U.S. and its allies were to provide more capable weapons to the Ukrainians. The challenge is that if they don't provide those weapons, then it's going to make it more difficult for the Ukrainians to actually decisively win this war. And the greater risk is you end up with a stalemate, that then actually benefits the Russians because they can claim a victory, they have a chance to then rebuild their forces to go again in two or three years time and launch another war, or to be able to essentially, menace NATO, NATO's Eastern frontier elsewhere. So, I do think that the Biden administration and NATO need to recognize that there needs to be a decisive victory by Ukraine in this war.

But as you rightly point out, the other half of the equation is if TikTok still on these government employees around the world's personally owned devices, the threat still exists.The challenge fundamentally, I think, has to do with the legal frameworks, particularly in democratic countries, to be able to create the conditions where they can put an enforceable ban that will hold up legally on personally owned devices. Now, I think that we're at the early stages of the regulatory frameworks to come into place to allow that kind of thing and make it a condition of employment, but that kind of infrastructure has to catch up. But certainly this is a first step, I think, with this global ban across government devices, which is now it's really soon to become, it appears, a global ban.",

And these aren't -- and it's a -- it has the ability and it's on millions and millions and millions of devices across the world. And it has the ability of being a forward deployed intelligence network to collect information. And this isn't a theoretical threat, right? So I think sometimes when the threat, maybe several years ago, when all the energy started around the threat that is TikTok, it was less understood what could actually happen. But we actually have evidence now, right? And so we've seen the chief of TikTok's internal audit who reported back to -- his boss was in Beijing targeting journalists from Forbes, it's been widely reported. And the company has acknowledged they did that, and we're tracking locations of journalists.So we've seen when this threat is weaponized, and that's just one public example. So if you think of that at scale, and your last story mentioned propaganda and manipulating public opinion, you think about that the opportunity to kind of track location of journalists or other officials of governments around the world and then manipulate mass opinion, it's a very, very potent tool in the -- in the tool belt of a global adversary.",

I don't think we've really ever seen anything like that before. And so that's something that I believe China wants to protect.",

The Kohinoor is a 105-carat diamond. It's thought to be from Central India with a highly conflicted colonial past. After Queen Elizabeth died last year, India renewed calls for the stone's return.

More than 22,000 people have been displaced. Millions of people in the Central U.S. face the threat of severe weather on Thursday night. At least one potential tornado was spotted near Fort Worth Texas. Tornado watches were issued for portions of Eastern Texas and Oklahoma, along with Southwestern Arkansas and Northwestern Louisiana.
