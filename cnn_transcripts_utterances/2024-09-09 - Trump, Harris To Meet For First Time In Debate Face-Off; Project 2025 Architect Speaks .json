      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Vice President Harris wheels down in Philadelphia, as Donald Trump is wrapping up his prep from Mar-a-Lago, ahead of their first and perhaps only debate. Plus, a SOURCE-exclusive for you tonight. A mastermind behind Project 2025 is here, for his first TV interview, since resigning. Donald Trump is trying to disavow the roadmap for his second term, as Democrats use it against him. And Miami Dolphins star, Tyreek Hill, is here to join me tonight, after police just released body cam footage of the traffic accident -- incident, where he was dragged out of his car, and placed in handcuffs, just hours before the Dolphins season opener. Actions that his legal team calls excessive. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. As they say, the stage is set, and this is what you'll see, tomorrow night, when Donald Trump and Kamala Harris come face-to-face, for the first time ever, I should note, at these two podiums, in Philadelphia. Vice President Harris will be at the lectern on the right side of your screen. Donald Trump on the left. And it will all take place in just 24 hours from right now. Harris has arrived, tonight, in Philadelphia, after spending several days prepping across the state, in Pittsburgh. Trump, we are told, remains at his Mar-a-Lago club, and he'll arrive there, tomorrow, after a weekend out on the campaign trail, where he was pushing election conspiracies, and threatening to jail election officials. Harris, for her part, has had this prediction, about how she thinks tomorrow will go, in a new interview, out today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right? Where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go and, um, and we should be prepared for that. And he tends to fight for himself, not for the American people. And I think that's going to come out during the course of the debate. I think he's going to lie, and um, you know, he has a playbook that he has used in the past, um be it, you know, his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton. So we should expect that some of that might come out. (END VIDEO CLIP) K. COLLINS: Our sources tell us that, given what she's expecting might come out, tomorrow, Harris is bracing for a barrage of attacks. And not only has she been studying Trump's past policy positions, but also his past insults about her. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is telling us that he'll make the case that Harris, quote, owns everything, when it comes to the policies of the Biden administration. Officials say that Trump will be himself, something that even his own allies are privately wondering whether it will help or hurt him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): He'll go in, game-time ready, just as he does for every interview, every rally that he does. This is not something that is a heavy lift for him. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I think that when he stays on the issues, policies, absolutely, those are -- those are the winning issues. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Well, I think just, you know, stay focused on the issues, and you know, don't make -- don't make things personal. (END VIDEO CLIP) K. COLLINS: The throughline is clear. They would like for Trump to stay focused on the issues. The Trump team is also teasing to expect some surprises, tomorrow night. I should note that what we are going to watch, tomorrow night, all of us, could be the first and only debate that we see between Harris and Trump. I want to get straight to my panel of political experts, tonight, to start us off. And David Axelrod, you know what this feeling is like. I mean, this is incredibly-- DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRES. OBAMA: I'm having PTSD. Yes. K. COLLINS: I mean, the pressure, after looking at the polls that came out yesterday, from The New York Times and Siena College, showing this race could not be tighter, voters still have questions about at least one of these candidates.

No one's ever had more, by the way, which is an advantage for him. But he's not going to change. He's almost 80-years-old. He's not going to change. He's going to be more like he's ever been. And especially if she is composed and confident, I think it's going to be hard for him, if she doesn't engage on the terms that he likes to set for these debates. K. COLLINS: Yes, and he's such a known quantity to everyone, who will be watching, all the millions. She is not as known. I mean, we know her well. You worked with her. I covered her. But for those, who don't know her, who are going to be tuning in. One, I just think the image of the contrast, the two of them will be striking, for people watching. But what does she need to do, on that stage, tomorrow night, do you think? ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR, BIDEN-HARRIS 2020 CAMPAIGN: I really hope she is herself. I agree with David. She has prepared. She knows where she wants to stand on issues. And for those who do not know her yet, allow her to reintroduce -- introduce herself, and reintroduce herself to voters, and do a couple of things. One, I'm the adult in the room, and I can do this job. Two, things are not great, but they can get better under my leadership. And three, look at this guy. Do you want to do that again? No. That's all she needs to do. And I think, all -- there's a whole bunch of pontification going on about this. I think if she can land those three things, and then B, do it in her own way? Don't do it in a robotic way that people think like this is how a woman candidate has to present herself. When she's out there on the campaign trail, people love her. She's personable. She's an engaging human being. Don't talk to him. Respectfully. Don't talk to the moderator. Talk to the American people.",

Everyone's looking at the polls every five seconds, even if they say they're not.I mean, look, if you look at the polling data, what we know is that Kamala Harris came out, when she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, and skyrocketed up, right, took that mantle, took that momentum. And ever since then, she's kind of flatlined a little bit, maybe dropped a little bit, in some of those key battleground states, like Pennsylvania. Tonight -- tomorrow night is a chance to sort of turn the tide, say, Wait a minute. I'm going to take hold of this campaign. We know from those New York Times, Siena College polls, what is it? 28 percent of percent of voters say they want to hear they need to hear more about Kamala Harris. If you look at those who are undecided, that number is actually nearly double that. It's near 50 percent of undecided voters who say that. So, the bottom line is, tomorrow night's a real opportunity, because Donald Trump has consistently been disliked by more voters than he has been liked. And she has to say, You know what? I'm going to take this. If you don't like Donald Trump, vote for me. I can be an adequate stand-in. The real question's going to be is, can she actually deliver those lines in a way that matches up with how popular she is now, versus, let's say, those second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, however number of debates there were back in the 2020 Democratic primary season, where her debate performances kind of fell off. She has to be the person who showed up in that first debate, against Joe Biden, who delivered that great line, and not be the person who show up in those latter debates that honestly seemed a little bit canned. K. COLLINS: Yes. And Erin, you worked for Donald Trump, the last time he was running for president. And I think one thing that he has been kind of scarred by was how that first debate with Biden went. He himself has recognized that he was too aggressive in that. I want you to just listen how the two candidates are setting the expectations, for tomorrow night.

It is not -- when you win a debate, it's generally because your opponent did so poorly, and you were able to capitalize on those moments. Remember the Terry McAuliffe-Glenn Youngkin race, right? That debate, Terry McAuliffe said, during it, he talked about parents and not being able -- and that the state should have more access to their children's education than he -- should. That's a paraphrase. But -- parents -- it was more about state being able to control things. The Youngkin team immediately clipped that and put that out.

It was really a coming together of the conservative movement. And I think that's what's been so threatening to the left. Our side's always been prone to infighting. And what we were able to do here was bring together 110 groups, and really lay out a commonsense plan. Not everyone agrees in what's in that book. But the book's only actually part of the plan.

After Trump wins or loses, there will be a fight, for the Republican Party, from what I would call the Reaganite wing of the party, against the Trump wing of the party. And a lot rides on it, particularly in the national security space. Because the Democrats have no national security wing.
