This morning the Supreme Court is set to hear two cases that could break the internet. At issue, whether tech platforms and social media companies can be sued for hosting or promoting content. It could lead to major changes at sites, including Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube. CNN's Brian Fung is following this for us. He joins me from D.C. this morning. Brian, so nice to see you this morning.

      "sentences": "That's a great question, Christine. These are two really important cases being argued this week at the Supreme Court. One is being argued by Twitter, the other by Google.This first case, Gonzalez v. Google, is all about whether or not YouTube can be sued by the family of an American killed in a 2015 ISIS attack and over YouTube videos that were created by ISIS and recommended to users by YouTube. The plaintiffs in this case -- the family of Nohemi Gonzalez -- that American student who was killed in a 2015 attack -- say Google should be held legally responsible for that attack for recommending those videos. But Google says it's immune from that lawsuit because of a federal law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And that law protects the right of websites and tech platforms to moderate their websites as they see fit. In other words, Google says it's not responsible and it can't be sued. Now, for years, tech platforms have used Section 230 to nip these sorts of lawsuits in the bud, effectively ending them before they can even get off the ground. But now, for the first time, the Supreme Court is set to review this law and determine just how far its protections really extend. Do they cover the sorts of algorithms that make recommendations that YouTube makes when it recommends videos to its user? In this case ISIS videos to people who may be susceptible or interested in terrorist-related content. The -- if the court comes down with a ruling that comes against Google that could be a really big deal because critics of the social media industry say it could create more opportunities for lawsuits and accountability. And those who are defenders of the industry say it could be really bad for the internet undermining a really foundational pillar of how tech companies rank, sort, order content on their websites and forcing them potentially to change their operations in a dramatic way -- Christine.",
