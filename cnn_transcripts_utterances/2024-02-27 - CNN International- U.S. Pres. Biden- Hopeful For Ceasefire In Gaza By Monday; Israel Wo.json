It's unclear, though, how quickly that actually might move along. But President Biden clearly yesterday, as he spoke to reporters in that ice cream shop, expressed optimism that there could be a temporary ceasefire soon. It really comes as the president has been quite eager for that hostage deal to be reached. He has encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do whatever he can to try to secure the release of those hostages. But there are also concerns about the way that Israel has been operating their campaign. In an interview last night with Late Night host Seth Meyers, the president said that Israel could begin to lose more support from around the world if they continue their campaign that the way they have conducted it so far. There is a lot of concern specifically about the expected operation that would be conducted in Rafah. President Biden and top U.S. officials telling and urging the Israelis to take all precautions necessary to protect civilians -- develop a plan to move civilians out of harm's way. There is a hope from U.S. officials that there could be some type of agreement on a temporary ceasefire and release of hostages before Ramadan begins early in March. That is something that the administration has been pressing towards. But so far the president has expressed that optimism. It's just entirely unclear whether that actually will come to fruition as that Monday deadline is quite soon.",

And that is playing out today in the Michigan primary.There is a campaign underway to encourage voters to vote uncommitted in the Democratic primary. The group that is organizing this Listen to Michigan. They've phone banked, reached out to over 100,000 voters in the state of Michigan. Their goal is to get at least 10,000 people to vote uncommitted to show the signs of the frustration and the angst about the way that the president has handled this war. Now, it comes as there's a significant Arab American population in the state of Michigan, specifically in a city like Dearborn. The city's mayor has been quite outspoken about Biden's approach to the war in Israel over the course of the past few months. And according to Emgage, which works to mobilize Muslim American voters, they believe that there were around 140,000 Muslim Americans who voted in the Democratic -- or in the presidential primary back in 2020, really showing how important this group could be for Biden in that critical battleground state. But it's not just Arab American and Muslim voters who are frustrated. There is also a significant number of young voters who are frustrated with the way the president has handled the war between Israel and Hamas. So really, today, the Democratic primary in Michigan, while President Biden is fully expected to emerge as their pick for the nominee, it will be a critical test of his support among voters, specifically young voters, Arab American, Muslim voters who want to see the president take a different approach when it comes to the situation in Gaza.",

But what it certainly has done in the fact that the German's Chancellor Scholz had to talk about a lively debate.But the consensus being against sending troops about how the Slovakian prime ministers expressing disappointment that peace talks weren't more on the agenda in those talks, I think it's generally focused minds on how vital the fight for Ukraine is here for European security because ultimately I think the consensus there was that they can't allow Russia to win. But what exactly is Europe prepared to do in order to assist that? Are they actually willing to put their own soldiers on the ground if it came to it? Clearly, the consensus this morning in a series of hurried comments from the U.K. and NATO was, well, no is the answer. But it is increasingly desperate on the front lines here, and I think Ukraine beginning to have to get their head around the idea of things not going their way. And we saw precisely how hard the fight is and the kind of tools that Ukraine is now using because of a shortage of artillery when we met a strike drone unit just inside the city of Kherson. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATON WALSH (voice-over): They flit around fast, hiding each week in a new, abandoned shell. Drone operators have been Ukraine's secret weapon for months. But now, it is getting harder. We saw this unit in December, but their base back then has been bombed. Yet still, they hunt every day for a single mistake. A Russian who gets himself spotted.

Yet another place along the front line where there are concerns amongst Ukrainian forces that Russia is beginning to throw the sheer weight, the sheer volume of its often poor tactically commanded forces at yet another front line.More bad news, potentially, has emerged from Avdiivka over the last 48 hours. That was withdrawn from by Ukraine two Saturdays ago. They had to yesterday admit that they pulled out of a village called Lastochkyne, about three miles to the northwest of Avdiivka. Multiple points along the front line where Ukraine is feeling the pressure, just as they now have to publicly address the absence of Western aid here. These European leader's comments about sending troops or more importantly about the fact, they're simply not going to send troops I'm sure will sharpen the minds in European capitals about how far Europe is willing to go, because I have to say, you know, the prospect of things not going Ukraine's way is nearer now than it seems to have been really over the past two years.

Food, water, and medicine are already scarce. And now, people are fighting over what little aid there is. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over): Today, Gaza's humanitarian crisis looks like this. Palestinians desperate for food, paddling and swimming out to sea, after at least one plane airdropping aid appeared to miss its target, sending pallets of food crashing into the sea. In central and southern Gaza, hundreds crowding the beaches to try and secure their piece of the rations. But this is the other side of desperation, groups of men wielding whips and bats, steering crowds away from their precious cargo. Months of hunger and war, triggering fights for survival. And there is not enough for everyone. This is what they are fighting over -- ration packs, a lifeline for the lucky few. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I was lucky and able to get one of these aids. What about all those other people who were not able to get this aid? Look, this one didn't get any. And this one didn't get any. DIAMOND (voice-over): But so much more is needed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm asking from the Arab nations. We are thankful for the aid through the parachutes, but we need more and we need it distributed in a better way. This will not stop our hunger. We don't need a capsule because when we eat this, we will eat it. And that's it. It's finished DIAMOND (voice-over): But nowhere are people more desperate for food aid than in northern Gaza, where women and children wait in long lines for what now passes for food. A cloudy soup mixture made with dirty water and whatever grains can be found. AMAL MOHAMMED NASEER, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): There was no food or drinking water, no flour or anything? There was no cooking oil, not even drinking water. Death is better than this. DIAMOND (voice-over): Humanitarian aid deliveries this month dropped by half compared to January, according to a United Nations relief agency, explained, Israeli military operations and the collapse of civil order in Gaza. In northern Gaza, aid groups suspending aid delivery amid looting and attacks on aid trucks, leaving many with few options to stay alive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Look, we are eating animal feed against our will, but have to aid us. DIAMOND (voice-over): Without food or clean water, their voices are all they have left. AHMAD STEF SAFI, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): The suffering of Gaza is extremely difficult. Where are the authorities? Where is the government? Israel made us hungry and our government made us hungry, and people are stealing. Shame on you, Arabs. Where are you?

Any time now, flight controllers are expected to lose contact with the first American spacecraft to land on the lunar surface in more than half a century, if they haven't already.Intuitive Machines, the private company that deployed Odysseus, also known as Odi, says it intends to keep collecting data until the lander's solar panels are no longer exposed to light. It was suggested that that would happen after nine or 10 days, not five. They've already released these images from Odysseus's descent. Oh, my goodness. Isn't that beautiful? But we have yet to see any images taken after it touched down last week. The antennas on Odysseus may be pointing in the wrong direction because it tipped. When it landed, it ended up on its side, but at least it left us some spectacular images of our Earth. All right, well, Britain's Prince William will not be attending an event at Windsor Castle today due to what's being described as a personal matter. The prince was scheduled to attend a memorial service honoring his late godfather, King Constantine of Greece. A royal source wouldn't elaborate to CNN on the last minute change in plans. Max Foster, though, is here. He's joining me now from London. Hi there, Max. So we're not getting much detail on this news from Prince William. What do we know? Why is it significant?",

And, you know, the plan is still for her to return to public duties at Easter, so a month or so away. A bit longer than that.We're not being given any updates on her. We're not -- we haven't seen her in public. You know, the paparazzi do normally catch a picture of her every so often. But she does pop into the school, obviously, quite regularly down the road. But we haven't seen any of them either. So, you know, she was a very public figure. She was always on the front pages. We haven't seen her now for weeks. So, lots of people very interested in that. But again, a vacuum of information as to exactly what she's suffering from and how she's really feeling, only that she's doing well. So I think that, really, the mood music we're getting from the palaces is that we shouldn't be too overly concerned about, at this point, about any of the members of the royal family. But, you know, there is -- there has been this string of, you know, health scares, and I think it's been quite unsettling to many people.",

So, yes, Dallas, Texas yesterday you were 94. Mineral Wells was 97 degrees and cold front's going to come by and knock that completely gone.For today, Dallas gets to 90, tomorrow back down into the 50s. Even for Chicago, Wednesday you're going to be 70 and then knock your temperatures down by 37 degrees to 33. That's the cold front, and it's the same cold front that could make severe weather tonight around Chicago, around southern Michigan, also Indiana, Illinois. And then by morning, possibly all the way down toward the Ohio River. When you have warm air like this, and the cold air wants to push it away, there is the potential for those storms to want to rise. When you push those storms into the air, you get severe thunderstorms possible, even this time of year. I know we think about March, April, May being severe weather season, but when the warm air is this warm, you can certainly get severe weather, 70 degrees in Chicago on Wednesday and then here's your, really, your knockdown all the way to 21 for a morning low. Some of the outdoor plants may not like that very much. We'll have to see what happens to all of those things that want to grow. Then all of a sudden Mother Nature says, nope, how about 21? That'll freeze them up a little bit. So we'll have to be very careful and possibly even get them covered up if they start to peak out there.",
