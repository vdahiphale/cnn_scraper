But, you know, this research really tells us what vaccine experts have long suspected, that if you feel crummy after getting your Covid-19 vaccine, like having a headache, fever, or chills, it's a sign that the vaccine is working and could be eliciting a greater immune response compared with if you didn't have these symptoms. But, if you look at the data here, researchers still emphasize, if you're someone who did not have any kind of side effects after getting the vaccine, don't worry, the vaccine is still eliciting an immune response for you.Among more than 900 study participants in this research, antibody reactivity was still observed in 98 percent of people who did not report side effects. So, these were 98 percent of those who were asymptomatic. And then antibody activity was observed in 99 percent of those who did report symptoms, Brianna.",

And these ads are targeting black, Latino and rural communities. They're going to be released in 15 U.S. markets. So, starting today, you could see these ads on your TV screens. And the goal here, Brianna, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services told me that they're really trying to encourage people to get the updated vaccine ahead of winter. So, this is before we see our friends and loved ones and family for thanksgiving, Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah.

Did they sit around and wring their hands and say, woe is me? No. What our ancestors did was replicate the white world from which they had been excluded. And it didn't matter what form that exclusion took, if there was a white version, we had a black version. Starting with the Masons, the Prince Hall Masons, which were founded a year and a day before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. And the ultimate social network, which was formed by our enslaved ancestors, was called the Grapevine. And even John Adams, in 1775, right after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, in his diary noted that these black people had this odd way of communicating, miles and miles, and it was the Grapevine, which -- to which Booker T. Washington gave its formal name in 1901, likely before clubs, fraternities, sororities, secret societies, black doctors excluded from the AMA formed the National Medical Association, black dentists, the National Dental Association, black lawyers, the National Bar Association. There were even black bridge clubs and, if you can believe this, a black skier society.",

And that is exactly what black people did.When the larger white society said that black was ugly, what did black people do? Say, no, black is beautiful. And I know black is beautiful because I'm beautiful. What did black people want to do? They fall in love, raise their children, worship God in their own image, go out on Saturday night, dance, invent their own dances and, as you well know, invent one of the world's truly greatest civilizations, starting with the spirituals, the blues, ragtime, jazz. You know, we even -- in 1821, William Alexander Brown, in New York City, founded the African World Grove Theatre, a Shakespearean theater. And they were performing Richard III, of course, Othello, before black and white audiences down on what's now Greenwich Village. They -- my favorite organization, secret society, was called the Royal Knights of King David. And I'd like to be a member of that myself. And a man named John Merrick of (ph) Durham was one of the organizers. And to show you how these networks had broader implications, it was a secret society, but in 1898 he and some of his fellow members of the Royal Knights of King David formed the North Carolina Mutual Insurance Company, which became the largest black business in the whole country.",

J. BAKER: Yes. Well, there's a lot to prepare, let me tell you. I mean, there is a ton of logistics, so much gear. I mean, we've been planning this for a couple of years now. And, I mean, in just water, we have to figure out how to manage about 200 pounds of just water on the wall because everything that you need you can't just turn on the water, you've got to - you've got to carry it with you and haul it up in these giant bags, bags like this that we call the pigs and set up -- we set up complex anchors to create leverage to pull the bags up. But it's just a lot of aspects. And then, on top of that, how do you do that with - with Sam? And so we've got a lot of creative ideas of what we're going to do at each camp to kind of help inspire us to get there. And so it's a lot of components of this. But the biggest part of getting ready has been Sam's personal training. And he has been working on this goal every day for the last at least 18 months we've been intimately working on it.",
