And disenchanted voters in Japan give the ruling coalition a nasty surprise. So, what comes next? The stock market here in New York set to open just about 30 minutes from now, and if we look at the futures, fairly positive picture on this Monday morning. Always nice to see some green to start your week. Investors anticipate earnings reports this week from tech giants including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Meta. Well, with just eight days now to go until the official Election Day here in the United States, the candidates are making their final pitches to voters. Donald Trump taking his campaign to Madison Square Garden here in New York in a marathon rally Sunday night featuring Trump loyalists who unleashed demeaning, vulgar and racist rants on familiar Trump targets, including immigrants as well as Trump's current and former female challengers for the White House. One of the most disparaging remarks coming at the start of the rally from a Comedian and Podcast Host Tony Hinchcliffe, who went after the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

None of that was an accident. These campaign events are put together. They are vetted.

And look, he -- his campaign long ago, gave up on trying to win over people that they won in 2016 but lost in 2020. They don't think that that is a winning strategy. They don't believe that if you were outraged by Trump, in 2020 that you suddenly will come back home. But what they are targeting, and who they are going after are those voters who tend to not vote, and those voters who may be tired of the direction of the country, but don't necessarily get engaged in politics very often. And that is who they are targeting with this this kind of messaging. And by going to Madison Square Garden and having a whole bunch of comedians and influencers and Elon Musk involved in the closing days of his campaign, because at the end of the day, the rhetoric from Trump has been incredibly dark and quite divisive, even if his campaign is trying to distance himself from other remarks. Take a listen to, for example, what he had to say about his plans to deal with immigration on day one.

She's also had previous stops there where she's tried to relay a similar message, trying to draw that contrast with Former President Donald Trump, often casting him as someone who has made big promises but hasn't executed on them, while essentially arguing that she has and will do that if she is elected in November. Now she is going to two of the most closely watched counties in the state. So certainly, the vice president's team trying to keep the focus on manufacturing in those areas, while making sure that they can try to lock in that part of the coalition. And that's really what the last 24 hours or so has been. Has been the vice president and her team trying to shore up support in her core constituencies. For example, yesterday in the Philadelphia area, she was courting black and Latino voters blitzing around the Philadelphia area, visiting multiple places, a church, a barber shop, a bookstore and a community center and a Puerto Rican restaurant. Now that was pre planned, but certainly campaign officials were quite pleased with the split screen that unfolded given the remarks that were made at the Madison Square Garden rally for Former President Donald Trump, and it was after those comments about Puerto Rico that bad bunny actually weighed in for the first time, indicating his support for the vice president and her plan for the island. Now this is critical for the vice president and her team, because he does carry immense influence with Puerto Rican voters, who, by the way, make up a sizable portion of voters in Pennsylvania, which is a crucial battleground state. Now, to get a good idea of the strategy from her team here, it's Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, we call the blue wall. So, her team is doubling down on those states in the final stretch of the election, while again, trying to lock in support, including with black voters, where there has been winning enthusiasm.

The Republicans have also filed cases involving the voter rolls, poll watchers and for the very first time, overseas voting by military members and expats overseas. So, there is so much out there, and it's challenging to keep track of it, but our colleague Tierney Sneed has been looking at the wins and losses. And just in the past week, Republicans secured a major victory in a case in Mississippi. Obviously, that's not a swing state, and the ruling won't kick in right away, but that could help the Republicans in other states, because that case was about the deadline for when mail ballots can get counted. A conservative federal appeals court ruled that ballots must arrive by Election Day. They can't be postmarked by Election Day. That was a rare win for the GOP, but in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, just last week, that court rejected the Republicans lawsuit that attempted to end ballot curing, that's when voters whose mail ballots are rejected are given a chance to fix the problem. So, one or two wins, but a bunch of losses for the Republicans, they have really not succeeded very much in court this time around.",

And a military official telling me earlier today that they expect that it will continue for at least a few more weeks, at least as it relates to the operation in Jabalia refugee camp. And that is where, of course, we have seen a dire situation, not only in terms of hundreds of people who have been killed in recent weeks, but also the hospital in Jabalia Kamal Adwan Hospital that has been damaged by an Israeli operation late last week, and where we saw dozens of medical staff members detain and patients' lives certainly put at risk. The Israeli military raided the hospital late last week after the Israeli military says they engaged in multiple fire fights with Hamas militants around the hospital area. They said that they did not engage in fire fights on the grounds of the hospital itself, but claim to have recovered multiple weapons and ammunition at that hospital. They also dealt some damage to the hospital itself as they entered. There was a wall of the hospital that was damaged as Israeli troops entered, and then the oxygen center at the hospital was also damaged by Israeli fire. The military official I spoke to today acknowledging that they did indeed intentionally damage that oxygen center, saying that oxygen tanks could be booby trapped and that they had to be dismantled. Now, as the Israeli military operation is set to continue for weeks to come, there are growing cries of concern from United Nations Human Rights officials who say that the situation in Northern Gaza is catastrophic. The human rights envoy saying that there is such a blatant disregard, he says, for basic humanities and the laws of war, and that this operation in Northern Gaza must stop. In addition, of course, to those who have been killed and injured in the fighting, the fact that hospitals at this point have very little in terms of supplies and fuel to be able to continue providing care to people in Northern Gaza, what we are also witnessing is that the conditions for those who remain, whether those who are trapped inside of buildings, as the fighting intensifies, are not able to reach a sufficient aid because very little humanitarian aid has actually gone in. We are coming very close now to that 30 days that the U.S. told Israel they need to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. So far, some steps taken, but certainly not all, Erica.",

Now, to be clear, just because traders are betting, that doesn't make it so, right? Markets are not omniscient. They've been wrong before, and polls do still suggest that this could go either way. Still the venture capitalist Gene Munster, he told me that if Trump wins, then this company will be worth more than $8 billion. And if he doesn't, he thinks it could only be worth a billion dollars.
