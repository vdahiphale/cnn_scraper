President Joe Biden, for the first time, is allowing Kyiv to use long- range U.S. weapons to strike deeper inside Russia.The decision had been under consideration for months as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for the green light, but U.S. officials have been divided and concerned it could escalate the conflict. The weapons are expected to be used primarily in Russia's Kursk region for now. That's where Russian forces are looking to take back territory alongside North Korean troops who've joined the Russian offensive. CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments and joins me now live from London. Good morning to you Nada. So what is the latest reaction to this major U.S. policy change?",

As you mentioned, there has been a lot of debate within the Biden administration as to whether this is indeed the right move, questions as to whether this could escalate the war further and of course concern around the low stockpile supplies. Of course, because of that, we're not expecting to see an immediate overnight shift in the battlefield.But of course, as you mentioned, this comes as we see tens of thousands of Russian troops amassing in the Kursk region, as well as North Korean troops now being deployed, which has been a real spark of concern for the Biden administration, concern that this could be perhaps a new phase to the war, seeing North Korean troops deployed. But these attack and long-range missiles are expected and intended to be used according to sources primarily focused on that Kursk region. There is concern that we are perhaps seeing Russian troops preparing in an attempt to take back territory following a Kyiv surprise offensive in the summer in an attempt to stop Kursk from being used as a sort of bargaining chip in any future peace talks or negotiations. That is something that the U.S. and the Biden administration does not want to see in the future. But of course, again, there is still concern within the Biden administration between U.S. officials around this. This won't be an overnight shift. And we've been hearing from the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who of course himself has been pushing for these weapons to be supplied to Ukraine for some time now. We heard from him just yesterday calling on the U.S. to make good on its commitment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today there's a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions. But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves. They certainly will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, will it change the war? I mean everybody who is an expert in -- the military expert is saying probably not. There are some questions, you know, especially about how many weapons there actually are that Ukraine could use. They are very expensive. It takes quite a while to produce them. Ukraine only apparently has a few. Actually, even the United States, some here in the United States, say that the United States could be limited in the amount that it could provide. So there are questions, but it is no issue here that this is a major decision by Biden, and it comes at a critical time. I mean, you have a new incoming U.S. president, you have Putin warning that a step like this would -- there would be retaliation for a step like this.

Ultimately, there are others, though, even Republicans, who are saying this step was long overdue, that the Ukrainians have been fighting essentially with their arm tied behind their backs. And so that's the debate right now. But there's no question that with just two months to go, it does leave Trump with probably an escalated war.

And there are a few others like that, the governor of North Dakota is going to be confirmed as Interior Secretary. But you have a concentration of controversial people. And I almost think that Trump has done that because there's safety in numbers, and he's appointing enough very controversial nominees, knowing that Republicans can't possibly turn them all down. They really can't, because the Trump base would revolt against them. So in a sense, there's some protection for all of these people because of the number of controversial candidates.

How dangerous might this be given the many threats Patel has made against those he claims Trump's enemies? SABATO: This whole emphasis on revenge and retribution, it turns out, was not just campaign rhetoric. That is precisely what Donald Trump is pursuing, even before he reenters the Oval Office. And it's something, frankly, that Americans, if they are as understanding of and supportive of constitutional rights as I think they are for the accused, including generals who may be coming up before some strange tribunal, it's going to turn into a major fiasco for Trump in those first few months. And that's not what a new president needs.

We heard just last week from the Foreign Minister of Israel that the ground operation was going to be expanding, and that's certainly what we are seeing.We have heard as well that the Israeli military on Sunday said that they're now using artillery batteries based inside Lebanon itself. So these previously had been stationed on Israeli territory. They were being fired across the border into southern Lebanon. But now we know that according to the IDF, they have moved these batteries into the Lebanese territory itself. Now, we had heard early last month when Israel decided it was going to carry out this ground operation, that it would be limited. Now, there was plenty of skepticism at the time that this was going to be a limited operation. And indeed we are seeing that it is anything but with the Israeli military saying they're expanding even more, saying they're attacking targets in support of ground forces during their operations. Now, it's coming, this expansion in military operations, at a time when there is a ceasefire proposal on the table. We know that it has been given to Hezbollah. It's a U.S.-Israeli ceasefire proposal. And we understand from a Lebanese official that they believe Hezbollah is looking at it positively, or at least they are optimistic that there could be some kind of an agreement. We don't have an exact timeline on when that could come. But this would be a 60-day ceasefire. It would be a temporary one, but with the hope that this would be the basis for the permanent ceasefire. It would involve the U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the last hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah back in 2006. It means Hezbollah has to move from southern Lebanon. It potentially means the Lebanese military could take more of an active role in that area. We're not certain of that at this point that could be a sticking point and Israel has to pull out of southern Lebanon and move to the border itself. Of course, one of the complicating factors could be that assassination of Hezbollah's media spokesperson on Sunday. Mohammed Afif was one of really the last public faces of Hezbollah as he was doing press conferences still in the ruins of some of the buildings in southern Beirut. Many other Hezbollah personnel have gone underground knowing that they could be a target. At the end of September, the ceasefire proposal talks were ongoing. They were very much derailed at the time by the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chief. We don't know at this point whether this will have an impact on the current negotiations.

Also, all in-person classes for students have been suspended and now we're seeing some flights now even being diverted from the city because the flight visibility is just that low. Of course, these measures are in addition to the ones already put in place since last week, for instance banning some types of construction work. But despite these solutions Rosemary, there isn't that much relief for the 20 million residents in Delhi. Here's what some had to say about what it feels like to be there right now.

And second, because we're seeing dust also from construction and from roads, and also, very importantly, emissions from vehicles contribute to air pollution. And third, as winter settles into India, the cold actually acts as a blanket and traps some of those air pollutants. So for those key three reasons, Rosemary, we're seeing this toxic smog choke Delhi year after year.

The problem, a Russian-controlled part of the station, is leaking air needed by astronauts to breathe. While Americans worry over a quote \"catastrophic failure,\" Moscow feels the situation is not as dire. The Russian crew has reduced the leak rate and feels operations are safe. But NASA disagrees and is pushing for independent experts to evaluate the problem. CNN aerospace analyst Miles O'Brien joins us now, good to see you Miles. So just how dire is this leaking air? And a part of the International Space Station, as we mentioned, controlled by Russia. And what are they doing to fix this problem? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: Well, it depends on who you ask, Rosemary. NASA has come to the conclusion that this leak, which first materialized in 2019 and has steadily gotten worse, although it's been mitigated somewhat recently, as you alluded to, that this leak is potentially catastrophic. Now, NASA cannot prove that. On the other side of it, Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, says nothing to worry about. It's not that serious. But Roscosmos can't prove that either. And so the two agencies are at odds over this. This is an engineering duel in the context of a geopolitical tension, which has risen, of course, since the invasion of Ukraine.

They're still, in theory, speaking their languages, their respective languages. But the tension is unavoidable and cannot be overlooked. It is definitely the elephant in the room, as it were. So it's pretty difficult when you've got human beings doing their best as engineers and technical people. There's still human beings with subjective views of things. And so how that creeps into these decisions, it's really hard to quantify that. It requires an engineer, and that is not going to be something we're going to get a good answer to.

Many of the other key components of the space station were built in the same time or a little bit later. And it's, you know, it's been up there moving around at, you know, 28,000 kilometers per hour.
