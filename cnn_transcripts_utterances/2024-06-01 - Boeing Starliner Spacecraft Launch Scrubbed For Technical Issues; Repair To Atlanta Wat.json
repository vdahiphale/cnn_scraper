NASA officials are expected to speak soon. This will be the first time that they're speaking since scrubbing the launch of Boeing's historic Starliner test flight today. An automatic hold stopped the countdown clock with less than four minutes to go. The two astronauts who were headed to the space station are now back at crew quarters after leaving the capsule a short time ago. CNN space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher is live from the Kennedy Space Center for us. So, Kristin, as you explain to us, while we were all waiting and watching and hoping this would happen, this potential launch has been in the making for years.",

We had a progress docking, 88 progress this morning at 6We had a great chance to go look at the helium leak in the service module, what we call the P2D2 flange and the manifold three and the port dock house, manifold two in the port dock house. And we looked at that leak today and that leak looked like it was about half of what we saw before so, you know, we talked about it being on the order of 80 PSI per minute. And that manifold today, it looked like it was around 40 PSI per minute. So that leak, you know, we think maybe the seal moved a little bit or the defect got sealed up a little bit. So that was good and that would have been no issue for launch. So we went through our whole troubleshooting procedure and that would have been just fine. I would say that the launch vehicle did great. The Atlas and Centaur did great. The self-regulating valve that we talked about, we're worried about a little bit going into the countdown, performed well. We didn't see any resonance at all so that went really well. We did have a couple of items that we worked in the counting and (INAUDIBLE) talked more about those. We had -- we stopped in the topping phase on the Centaur. We had a little bit of a failure on the ground side I would say in the command and control system for those valves that are on the ground. And the ULA team did a magnificent job working through that. We got into good configuration there. And then, you know, right before we got into the final phase of the count, went off of ground power on to spacecraft power. We saw a little bit of a swap in the cabin fan, a little voltage sag. The ground team did a great job of troubleshooting that. We verified both fans were good. And we got those in a good config for launch. And then of course we got inside four minutes and then we had a problem with the ground launch sequencer and I know Tory will talk more about that. I know it's a little disappointing. We were all excited. The Butch and Suni were excited to go fly. This is kind of the way spaceflight is. I've been -- this is my 37th year at NASA today. And I've been doing this human spaceflight for -- (APPLAUSE) STICH: Thank you. Long, long time. And every time you go to the pad for a crewed flight, or really any flight, you've got a chance of scrubbing. So the team did took the right steps. We weren't ready to go today.

But this is one component, a very important component where it does begin to look like the erosion of underwriting standards. Now, United Wholesale has said that underwriting standards are much better than back in that period. They are correct. But one of the primary underwriting standards is how much of the home value is being purchased with debt and typically you keep that at 80 percent, not 100 percent.And the lower the better in terms of safety. So in this case, going to 100 percent is unusual and it's relatively high. Secondly, these loans are geared toward individuals that make 80 percent of the median income in a particular area so they're being targeted toward those individuals that cannot accumulate a down payment, which seems appropriate, but those individuals also can't withstand things such as a temporary loss of job or other disruptions such as a major health expense, and they're more at risk of losing their home as a result.
