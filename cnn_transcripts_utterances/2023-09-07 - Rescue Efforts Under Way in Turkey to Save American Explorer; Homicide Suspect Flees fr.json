He has received six units of blood, and has been stabilized. His condition is improving. His bleeding has stopped. He is able to walk on his own, and in stable condition, according to the Turkish Federation. He is, right now, at base camp and that's still about 3,000 feet from the entrance, and it is a real logistical challenge to get him out of there. This is a rescue operation right now involving more than 150 personnel from Turkey, from its emergency and disaster agency, as well as rescuers from many countries, including U.S., Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, Croatia, and many others. And this is a very complex rescue effort. Mark Dickey, himself, according to his bio is a very experienced caver. He has been doing this for decades right now. He has been caving in 20 U.S. states and 10 countries since is '90s, he's a rescuer himself and a rescue instructor. He's the chief of the New Jersey Initial Response Team focusing on cave, cliff and abandoned mine rescue. The Turkish Federation says, it takes 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. And this cave has really narrow and winding passages, making it hard to get him on a stretcher and get him out of there. They're consulting with doctors on moving him out. And they expect that this effort could take days. Kate.",

The first is out of Washington. D.C. Metropolitan Police are looking for this man that you see here to my right. He is 30 years old. His name is Christopher Haynes who, they say, escaped custody while at George Washington University Hospital yesterday. An emergency alert describes the homicide suspect as armed and dangerous. Now, that comes as police in Pennsylvania is searching for Danelo Cavalcante. He escaped prison last week after this incredible video where he's crab-walking his way up the walls. He looks just a bit like Spider-Man when you see that video. I want to discuss all of this with Former U.S. Marshall John Muffler. Thank you so much for joining us, John. We're seeing this dramatic video of Cavalcante, sort of, making his way up the wall. Very much like Spider-Man. And apparently, there was another inmate that almost, an identical escape in that same place back in May. What is your reaction just seeing this video and how he did this and that nobody caught it? JOHN MUFFLER, FORMER U.S. MARSHALL:  It's -- yes, it's quite remarkable that it happened twice. Once was plenty, that should have been fixed. I know there was an assessment done to fix that. Those recommendations required them to fix that, but it did not happen. And another inmate took advantage of that, and was able to, as you say, be Spider-Man and go up the wall very easily. It shows you some strength there, too, on his behalf and able to exploit that gap that wasn't fixed.",

So, there are some complications with that. But, yes, and you're looking to find any way to gain an advantage using technology to locate this person, via drones or whatever it may be. But that is one way they're looking into it to track him.",

Report anything that seems remotely suspicious, whether that's, you know, as I have said before, you know, loose change from your car being stolen, those are small items but, you know, Cavalcante has to survival somehow. It's hot. He's got to be hungry and thirsty. He is obviously moving at night time. So, be vigilant. Lock your doors. Report all of those things.I will say this, too. I just learned this from some sources, but our law enforcement authorities have been in contact with Brazilian law enforcement authorities. And they've learned that, you know, he lived in the trees in Brazil after -- while he was on the run in Brazil. So, that's something that investigators need to keep in mind. It's not just what is in front of them or under them, he could be up in the trees, which is a very heavily wooded area in that part of the state.",

The judge gave Texas just over a week to pull them out of the water after the Justice Department argued they violated the law. But Governor Abbott's office says, the ruling will be overturned. And added, they are ready to take this fight all the way to the Supreme Court.CNN's Rosa Flores joins us now the very latest on this. Rosa, where is it headed?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, John, this is going to be a big Texas brawl between Governor Greg Abbott and the U.S. Department of Justice. But let me take you through this order by this federal judge, because it's very interesting. This judge from get-go said that he was going to stick to the facts, and he laid out the facts in his latest order saying that by federal law the State of Texas needed a permit to deploy these border buoys in the river, and that the State of Texas did not obtain that permit.Let me read you a portion of this ruling. The judge saying, \"Governor Abbott announced that he was not asking for permission for Operation Lone Star, the anti-immigration program under which Texas constructed the floating barrier. Unfortunately for Texas, permission is exactly what federal law requires before installing obstructions in the nation's navigable waterways.\" Now, this judge goes on to say that the State of Texas tried, attempted to use a self-defense argument here. In essence saying that the State of Texas is under an invasion by migrants and by the cartels. But this judge was not buying it. He did not buy it in court. I was inside that courtroom. He actually stopped the attorneys from the State of Texas multiple times telling them to stick to the issues and not to fentanyl or to widespread immigration issues. And he did the same thing in this order, saying that he was just not buying the argument. Saying, \"It was unconvincing.\" Now, Governor Greg Abbott striking back. Sticking to the fact that, according to Governor Abbott, the State of Texas has constitutional authority to deploy these buoys. Saying in a statement, \"This ruling is incorrect and will be overturned on appeal. We will continue to utilize every strategy to secure the border, including deploying Texas National Guard soldiers and Department of Public Safety troopers and installing strategic barriers.\" John, this is a brawl. It will continue. We will follow it all. Back to you.",
