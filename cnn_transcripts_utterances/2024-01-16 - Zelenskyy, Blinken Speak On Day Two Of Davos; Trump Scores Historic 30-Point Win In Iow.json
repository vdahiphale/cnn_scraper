That's largely because of borrowing. We'll get to that later in the program. Those are the markets. The main events of the day. Donald Trump takes Iowa, and now everyone wonders what's next? Here in Davos, President Zelenskyy takes WEF, and everybody wonders when's the money going to arrive for Ukraine. We are alive at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It is Tuesday, January the 16th. I am Richard Quest, and together with AI Al (ph), we mean business. Good evening. It is only minus nine here in Davos, and it is day two of WEF. The snow has stopped falling, although there might be some more. And the night is still -- make no mistake -- this small Swiss village is abuzz because not far from here, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his entourage have literally stopped the traffic along the Promenade. In every direction, nothing is moving as he visits the Ukraine house. The president is here to deliver a wake-up call to the world's elite about the war in Ukraine. With him is the Secretary of State -- the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Of course, people here have also been talking about what happened last night in Iowa -- that big win for Donald Trump and his effort to become the Republican presidential nominee. And the interesting aspect of this, of course, when you put together Iowa, Trump, and the prospects for Ukraine and Russia, then you start to see how the knitting comes together. Jim Sciutto is with me in Washington. It's often we talk about these things, Jim, in sort of esoteric grand ways. But the reality is it's real life and it starts to come together now.",

You could see there, he won more than 50% of the vote. Ron DeSantis in second place, but nearly 30 points behind, just ahead of Nikki Haley. A lot of buzz about her going into this, whether she might finish in a strong second. Her campaign is now looking ahead to New Hampshire, where she does hope to make it a much closer contest there.

What it's all about is expectations. Does the candidate outperform expectations? And now is why I think the expectation game was so important for Nikki Haley. Was she in fact going to do better than her final poll suggests in Iowa? Because if she did, history might suggest that she would go on and do better in New Hampshire than the current polls had. But in fact, Nikki Haley basically matched her final polls. The only one who really exceeded was Ron DeSantis. And as you saw in that University of New Hampshire poll, that CNN sponsor, Ron DeSantis is, you know, 40 points, 35, 40 points and back of the leaders at this particular point. So he's not somebody who's really going to be able to do anything with that momentum that he might potentially get for exceeding expectations coming out of Iowa. But again, he finished at just 21%. But one last thing I'll note, Jim, which is the fact is Iowa usually doesn't pick the winner on the Republican side, but it does when it matches the national poll leader. That's happened twice. That happened with Bob Dole in '96. It happened with George W. Bush in 2000. So at this particular point, there's no reason to believe that Donald Trump is anything but a prohibitive favorite going forward.",

During that time period, post February 2022, that there was a great deal of unanimity here -- Republican and Democrat. There's still large bipartisan support, but not enough to get aid across the finish line. Remember, President Zelenskyy came here to Washington, made a pitch directly to lawmakers -- Republicans and Democrats. That didn't move the dial. That aid is still hanging in the balance with genuine questions as to whether it comes through. That is a new political reality here, and that will have a big impact on the war.

Just one issue with that theory, she placed thirdin Iowa, narrowly behind Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. And of course, most importantly, neither one came anywhere near Trump. Even combined, they trailed him. But the close race for the civil -- silver metal -- medal in Iowa could prolong a wider field of Republican challengers to the former president, and that could conceivably make it easier for Trump to glide to the nomination. CNN's Kristen Holmes, she is in New Hampshire. And Kristen, I wonder if, while Trump wants those other candidates out of the race, I imagine to concede to him. On the other hand, he might see some wisdom or some benefit rather in continuing to defy -- divide the field of voters who prefer another candidate. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, this was the exact outcome that they wanted for the reason that you are saying. They wanted Ron DeSantis to come in second, which is surprising given the fact that they spent months and months attacking him. But that's because of what they saw in New Hampshire, which was Ron DeSantis doesn't have a ground game here. He is not polling above third place or in some polls even below that. Nikki Haley, though, however, is a close behind Donald Trump in New Hampshire. This gives him the divide that he needed. Ron DeSantis coming in second. Stops the momentum of Nikki Haley. Stops the narrative that Nikki Haley is having a surge. But, also slows things down in New Hampshire. If Nikki Haley comes in second, he would still have Iowa. So, he does like this ping ponging back and forth. And I will say, Nikki Haley saying this is a two-man race. It -- two things can be true at once. One, it's not a two-man race, that's not what Donald Trump believes. However, when it comes to New Hampshire, he does believe that it is a two- man race. They do believe that Nikki Haley is close. That she is racing in the polls and they have been spending an extraordinary amount of money trying to stop that. They have hit her on immigration. They have hit her on Social Security and Medicare. And they're going to continue doing that. Likely, we're going to hear him say that in his remarks tonight, to go after Nikki Haley because they do believe she's doing well here. We have to remember, New Hampshire is a completely different electorate than Iowa. Iowa, he was expecting to win Donald Trump, and he knew that Ron DeSantis would take voters from him. New Hampshire, you have a lot of independents who can vote in a Republican primary, and those independents can identify as even more left leaning or moderate. Those left leaning and moderate voters, those are the ones that Trump's team thinks are going to go for Nikki Haley. So, they're trying to siphon off votes from that. Again, they do believe he has a grip on the Republican Party. They say they're confident in New Hampshire. But Jim, they did add an entire week of events after they started seeing her rise in the polls.",
