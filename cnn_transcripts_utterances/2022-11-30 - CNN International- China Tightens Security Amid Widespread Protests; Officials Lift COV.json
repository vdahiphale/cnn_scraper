We're live in Hong Kong with the latest.Then celebrations inside Iran, even as the national team lose out to the U.S. in Qatar. We'll explain why. Plus, a potential breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's. We'll have more on an experimental drug that's got everyone talking this morning. New protests against China's zero-COVID policy flared up Tuesday night in parts of China in the face of the government's tough efforts to strike them down. In southern China, protesters clashed with police. They were seen throwing empty plastic bottles towards officers who responded by deploying tear gas. Police information approached protesters wearing hazmat suits and helmets and carrying shields. All of this happening in a narrow alleyway of an urban village. So far, CNN has verified that 23 protests have erupted across 17 Chinese cities since the weekend. You can see it on that map. CNN's Ivan Watson has been covering these protests since they began, and he joins us now live from Hong Kong. Ivan, what more have we learned about the Chinese state police handling of these protests? There have been reports of attempts to obfuscate searches and suggestions of external forces being responsible. What more do you know?",

Thank you so much.To Qatar now and the celebrations and commiserations after a dramatic night at the World Cup. The Iranian team is set to head home after a one nil defeat by the United States. Christian Pulisic's goal the winning goal, but was then taken to hospital with an injury. Remarkably, some Iranians celebrated the U.S. win in an act of defiance against the government given the ongoing crackdown on protesters in Iran. There's also concern over the team themselves. A security source had previously said that threats were made against the families of the team if the players did not, quote, behave. Back in Qatar, there are some big matches to watch out for later as well. Lionel Messi will lead Argentina against Poland, while Tunisia take on France. Nada Bashir is with me for more on what Iran's exit will mean now. Nada, how material are the threats to the players and their families, obviously, off the back of their support for protest and equivocation over singing the national anthem?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, we've seen the Iranian regime placing pressure on its athletes. Before you'll remember the case of Elnaz Rekabi, a competing rock climber who was competing overseas without her hijab. There was some concern around her safety and a lack of clarity on how she would be treated upon her attendance, has to be said when it comes to the Iranian people.She was met in Iran by what can only be described as a hero's welcome. Now, all eyes tonight will be on how the Iranian football team will be met at the airport, of course, both by the regime itself and the Iranian people. And there is concern over their safety because, of course, some of the players chose not to sing the national anthem ahead of their opening match against England. Now they did sing the national anthem in the match against the United States. But as we've learned from a source working closely on the security of the games, the team players themselves, their coach, as well as their family members back at home, have faced threats from the security forces warning the players too, in their words, behave essentially not to show any signs of dissent or solidarity with the protest movement at home. And crucially, to ensure that they did sing the national anthem ahead of that very politically charged match against the United States just yesterday. So there is some concern, of course, around their treatment upon their return. According to the state aligned Tasnim News Agency, they are expected to arrive later tonight back home in Iran. But, of course, what was also remarkable to see across the country overnight last night was the celebrations taking place both in the capital in Tehran and numerous other cities, particularly in Iran's northwestern Kurdish region, where we saw people taking to the streets, celebrating, chanting, cheering, honking their car horns in celebration of the U.S.'s defeat of the Iranian national team. Now, of course, while the Iranian pairs themselves may have their own personal views, the team has been seen as a sort of symbol of the public facing aspect of the Iranian regime and institution and this has been taken as part of that process movement.

Before that, an update from injured U.S. star Christian Pulisic. He's promising to be back in action on Saturday while the U.S. head coach gave this update to CNN just in the past hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GREGG BERHALTER, HEAD COACH, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: He seems to be doing good. Just spoke with him a couple of minutes ago and we're going to see what he can do on the training field tomorrow and hopefully he'll be ready for the game against Netherlands.

Russia's war in Ukraine will be among the top items on the agenda as French President Emmanuel Macron pays a three-day visit to the United States. Mr. Macron touched down in Washington late Tuesday. He'll meet with Vice President Kamala Harris in just a few hours and then later he'll attend a private dinner with President Biden and the First Lady. This is the first time Mr. Biden has invited any world leader for an official state visit since he took office nearly two years ago. And some news just into CNN. We're learning that a Buckingham Palace aide has resigned over what have been called unacceptable comments made to a charity campaigner at a reception given by Queen Consort Camilla. The palace says it takes the exchange extremely seriously and this could overshadow the Boston visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Well, there's no better to talk to you about this than CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster, whose life for us in Boston.

      "sentences": "Bianca, this drug is promising, but we do want to manage expectations. It's not a cure, it's not clear in -- if it gets into the real world, exactly how much it will help patients. Let's take a look at this study. What they did is they took 1,800 people who had early sort of mild stages, mild Alzheimer's early stages. They divided them into two groups.Some of them got a placebo and some of them got the drugs. After 18 months, so this took a while, after 18 months, those who took the drug had a 27 percent slower rate of cognitive decline. So, in other words, there was decline, but it was 27 percent slower. Also, their amyloid levels dropped. Amyloid is the plaques that you see in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. What's unclear is what this means for people. Will they live different lives? Will they feel different? Will their families perceive them? Will you be able to say, wow, she seems really different, she seems much better? It's hard to know. And here's the main question. Whatever advantage people get from this drug, is it worth the risk? And there are risks. They did find some side effects from this drug or I should say, adverse events. So when they looked at folks who were taking the drug, 17 percent of them had brain bleeding and 12 percent of them had brain swelling. Now, to be clear, some people who got the placebo had those two things happen, but a much higher percentage who were on the drug had them. There were two deaths in the group with the folks who took the drug, but the company said were unrelated. The deaths did get a lot of media coverage. Bianca?",
