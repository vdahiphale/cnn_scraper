Donald Trump's lawyers make a Hail Mary request for an April 2026 start to the 2020 election trial, and the try to make sure the case never sees the inside of a courtroom.Plus, a game of risk. New reporting outlines how Republicans plan to conquer a Trump plus debate, well another Republican warns his party appears poised to fulfill the textbook definition of insanity. And President Biden invokes the whole enemy -- my enemy is a friend theory of foreign policy. Today pushing to neighbors to put aside a generation of bad blood and send a message to the country, just a couple of blocks away, China. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We're going to start with this. Up first, two questions. Do you know what you're doing on Monday? Do you know what you're in April 2026? The answer is no. For me both of them. Donald Trump, though, has plans for both. More specifically, Mr. Trump knows where he won't be on Monday. And what he hopes he won't have to do more than two and a half years from now. We start our coverage today with CNN's Sara Murray in Washington. Sara, let's start with Monday. What won't Mr. Trump be doing?",

He was encouraged not to go through with this. Obviously, he has a number of pending legal matters that this would not look great for.Here's what he said on social media. My lawyers would prefer putting this, I believe, irrefutable and overwhelming evidence of election fraud and irregularities in formal legal filings. Now, of course, we will wait to see whether his attorneys actually do include any of what he calls irrefutable evidence that's been refuted many, many times in these court filings. But I do think there was a lot of concern about the former president going out there with this pending case in Georgia, as well as the federal election interference case.",

And in this court filing last night, Trump's attorneys that raise a number of issues.They point out one, that he has a lot of other legal matters on his hands, which is certainly true. He's obviously got the criminal case when it comes to the Mar-a-Lago retention of documents. He has the Manhattan hush money case. He also has this Georgia case that he's juggling. But they also lay out just the amount of evidence that they have to go through. The amount of discovery they have to go through. Related to this case, they say it's 11.5 million pages of documents. And they've included a very handy visual aid in their court filing of what those 11.5 million pages of documents would look like if they were printed out compared to the Statue of Liberty. That's the first little block you see there. And then the Washington monument, the second little block you see there. So again, it's up to the judge to decide when this trial date is going to be, but this is how the Trump team is framing it and they're filing last night.",

And that's not where this judges head is at.You can tell already from what she's been saying from the bench, that she does not think this needs to be delayed that much. And so, I think one of the things that you'll hear is, she'll point out that, for instance, you know, that graphic is a snazzy and beautiful as it is, it's just this is deceptive, right? Because a lot of those pages are email headers, a lot of them are not really relevant to the case. A lot of things that was produced as part of this investigation are not the things that they're going to use as part of this trial. And they know that. And so that graphic is kind of BS, you know, for the purposes of really trying to make your argument to that -- to the judge, right. I mean, the fact is, that there's a very small number of pages that are going to be relevant for this case, and they know where to find those. That's when in fact, the Justice Department will provide a roadmap for that, and they don't have to buy that because they already know a lot of the allegations and the testimony from some of the witnesses. So, it's going to be a lot less difficult for the judge to cut through that, I think. MATTINGLY: Kaitlan, you know, we heard from the former president yesterday, his sit down interview with Larry Kudlow. I want to play something to that. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: They have four of them now, if you look, I mean, this is not even possible. Four, over the next, last couple of months. And, frankly, it discredits everything. And they're all very similar in the sense that they're -- there's no basis for them. It's a disgraceful thing. And Republicans can't get -- let them get away with him, Republicans have to be tough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They know she's moving pretty aggressively. So, as ambitious as Jack Smith's January 2024 trial, ask was, they are also doing that and making an aggressive move with the April requests. They know that it's not going to happen in April 2026.But they looked at not just the discovery here and the level of evidence that Evan was pointing to, but they looked at other cases, and how long they took. Of course, the circumstances of this are different in the sense of, it's the former president, he's on trial. He's also running, and he was the Republican frontrunner right now. And so, I think they're worried though, that she is going to set a pretty aggressive timeline. And to the point, though, about the attorneys knowing what's coming, the attorneys that are handling this are pretty new to the team. I mean, the two that had been handling it, Jim Trusty and John Rowley had been new to the primary ones working on January 6, they departed the team over the summer. And so, it is fresh faces that are on Trump's legal team. Are they using that to their advantage? Yes, probably.",

As a lawyer, if you're a prosecutor in this case, how are you looking at this, given the fact that it runs smack head into the political schedule?AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, I think first, I would start with the concept of the speedy trial. And we often think about a speedy trial as a defendants' right, but the public also has an interest in the speedy trial. Anything here when you're dealing with a former president, who's seeking high office again, the public's interest in that trial happening before the election, I think is extensively high. So, I think that would be my starting point there. As far as whether to consider the election and how the court thinks about that. I think what Judge Chutkan has made clear is that if anything that only pushes her to make a trial happen faster, not slower. And I think what's important was, she also noted that pushing this trial out allows more time to influence potential jurors. It allows more time to intimidate potential witnesses. I think she's made clear that if anything, all of these factors lean towards making the trial happen faster, not further out.",

Mike Pence, for example, has been holding mock debates that include Trump, and ones that don't. If Trump does not show the DeSantis camp believes that he will become the focal points of the debates.And yes, we have talked to candidates' strategy teams who have suggested they have been studying up on the Florida governor's record in the Sunshine State, as well as his lesser-known time in Congress, trying to show a different side of the Republican governor than perhaps most voters are used to. Now for DeSantis, though, this is going to be a new experience for him. He does not have past debates performances that are anything like what he's going to experience in Milwaukee. And I'm told that he's working with one of the best debate coaches in the industry, Brett O'Donnell, who has coached several past Republican presidential nominees. And one of the things they are going to be working on is DeSantis' mannerisms on stage. He has a tendency to have some visual tics when he is getting a question that he doesn't like. He can gnashed his teeth, sometimes hell famous smile. And those things can be amplified when you're in front of a national audience. So, I'm told that that's something that we're going to be working on going forward. And then for these other candidates, you know, as much as DeSantis has tried to make this look like a two-person race, the fact remains that he is actually much closer in the polls to the rest of the field than he is to Trump. And so, for someone like Tim Scott or Vivek Ramaswamy, who have seen a little bit of boost in the polls. This is an opportunity for them to continue on that momentum, and potentially carry them into the fall. And then for candidates like Pence and others who are polling in the single digits, they're going to have a wide and large audience for one of the first times during this cycle. And this might be their last and best chance to not only get on the next debate stage, but even to continue their campaign.",
