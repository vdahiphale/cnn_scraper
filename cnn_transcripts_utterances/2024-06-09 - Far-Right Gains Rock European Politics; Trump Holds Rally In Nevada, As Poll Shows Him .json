In a powerful display of voter dissatisfaction, voters in 27 European countries give a powerful surge of support to far-right parties in the European Union elections. Now, this has led French President Emmanuel Macron to dissolve Parliament and call a snap election in France after polls show his party being trounced by the far-right opposition party. Macron said he's called this election to give voters a say after these most recent EU elections. CNN correspondent Melissa Bell is joining us now from Paris. And Melissa, walk us through these elections and what they mean and what the fallout is.",

The center right came out as the biggest bloc in the European Parliament, but the far-right made some pretty big gains with that radical right, now representing the second biggest block, and that could have important implications for the kind of policies that we see coming forward here in Europe in a number of different areas, climate policies things like immigration They will have more of a say, the far-right with very different policies than the traditional right than they've had in the past. Biggest fallout, though, here in France. Now, Emmanuel Macron did not have to draw from the far-right in France coming first with more than 30 percent of those votes in European elections, the consequences that he did. He did not have to call a snap election as a result. He has, because of the significance for the scale of the far-right victory. He says now that people need to be given a chance to vote in legislative elections, which means that later this month and in early July, we'll have a series of legislative elections. The parliaments dissolved, a new bunch of lawmakers will come in. And if the far-right does very well in these forthcoming elections, there is the possibility that France could have a chance a prime minister drawn from the far-right. And historically that would be extremely significant. Politically, it could mean big changes, Jessica.",

What I find really interesting about that is that over the past several days, both Donald Trump and his allies have been railing against the verdict and using it to call for retribution against his political opponents. We've heard Donald Trump over the past several days claim that he would potentially prosecute his political opponents, including President Joe Biden if he were to win in November. So, I found it very interesting, he didn't bring that up. However, he did talk about his legal troubles more broadly, and he specifically attacked President Joe Biden. He argued that even in third world countries, that they do not have a justice department or a government that weaponizes their power as much as here. And he also claimed that the only way Joe Biden could win again is if he cheats. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I tell you what, no third world country has weaponization where they go after political candidates like we have either.

The other is that we know that the 2020 election, despite Trump continuing to claim that it was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud.But I will say, from my conversations with Trump's team, they really tell me that they want Donald Trump to leave his week's long criminal trial in the past. They are very eager for him to return to his general election campaign messaging, and that includes talking about immigration, crime, the economy, all things they think voters will actually head to the polls for this fall on. And we did hear Donald Trump do that. One big piece of news, he said today is that if he were to win another term, he would eliminate taxes on tips.

First of all, it's still it's not even summer yet, but also that the polls show that people who follow politics and are likely to vote and are engaged actually give Biden a lead. People who don't pay much attention to the news, who are not particularly reliable voters put Trump ahead. And if I were running a presidential campaign, I think I'd rather have the likely engaged voters on my side going into the election. But you know, this is, I've said for a long time, this is an election that's really not about policies anymore.

Their propaganda is effective. They are working very hard to undermine democracy around the world with the aid of authoritarian regimes in places like Russia and China.But Americans need to understand that these were elections for the European Union Parliament, not individual parliaments in Europe. And the European Union has never been as popular, as a lot of folks might think it is and sometimes this is a kind of a safety valve where people vote for European Union elections to send a really hard message in ways that they would probably not vote at home And I suspect that's why Macron has called for this snap election to say, OK, that's what you voted for the European Union. Is this really how you want to be governed at home? You know, let's answer that question. Let's remember that Great Britain, which has pulled out of the European Union, you would think, you know, the kind of the hardest right environment there is, their conservative party is on the verge of losing a major election in the -- in the coming weeks.

[19The United States has been much more careful. And so President Biden has been saying you can use weapons, but pretty much only because of this area, the city of Kharkiv that has been attacked by the Russians a lot kind of on the border, and you have to be more moderate in how far you go in. It really is a big debate, but you can definitely say that the trend is to allow the Ukrainians to go farther and farther into Russia and for Putin, that is a real problem because he has tried to depict it as a war that doesn't really affect the homeland. It is really in Ukraine, and that's not the case.",
