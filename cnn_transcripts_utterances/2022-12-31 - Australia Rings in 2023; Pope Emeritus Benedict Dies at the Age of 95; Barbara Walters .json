We don't know, at this point, whether any of the Russian missiles actually hit their targets or whether what we saw the plumes of smoke coming from Central Kyiv, if that was merely debris hitting the ground. Now, in addition to that, several other Ukrainian cities have come under fire. The City of Mykolaiv in the south where six people were injured according to the mayor there. Also, Zaporizhzhia and Venezia. So, this is not unlike what we saw day before yesterday when dozens of Russian missiles and cruise missiles -- I mean, excuse me, drones, were fired at Ukraine.

And once they got that arrest warrant, then on Thursday, criminal charges were filed in Idaho, four counts of first-degree murder, one count of burglary.

So, it's really an amazing story and one that highlights really the really remarkable surveillance capacity of the FBI.So, we know that the subject was already on law enforcement's radar while he was in Idaho, probably shortly before he left to see his parents, or travel across the country. And we also know that the surveillance was established in Idaho and actually followed him across the country. It's an incredibly complicated, well-choreographed ballet, if I may, of surveillance efforts that would cross multiple FBI field divisions, would involve multiple surveillance teams that were following him through their own areas and then, handing him off as he crossed state lines to new teams. That surveillance ends up in Pennsylvania in what is we know a very rural area. It can be very challenging to surveil someone in those circumstances because any kind of vehicles or people that aren't normally from that area, really stand out to the local population and, of course, to the subject. So, great job by the FBI surveillance teams here to be able to maintain an eye on this subject while the investigators and prosecutors were working back in Idaho.

And his methodology is flawed -- guess that at a certain point, he became so fascinated with the actual thought process of somebody preparing for a crime. Some of the questions like what were, what were you thinking and feeling before you left the house? What was happening in your brain while you committed the crime? How did you feel? It's almost as if he didn't trust the survey results, if he even got any, and crossed over, went to the dark side. Decided he needed to do it. To be an expert on it.

The tax filings were made public by the House Ways and Means Committee after a year's long legal battle. CNN's National Correspondent Kristen Holmes has the details.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Little or no income tax, foreign bank accounts and eyebrow raising details about loans to his adult children. Just some of the findings after the Democratic led House Ways and Means Committee released six years' worth of Former President Trump's federal tax returns. The returns spanning from the year Trump announced his first run for president, 2015, through his last year in office, 2020. REP. RICHARD NEAL (D-MA), WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent. The tax forms were really never audited. HOLMES (voiceover): Previous reporting from the Joint Committee on Taxation revealed shockingly low tax amounts paid by the former president, including paying only $750 in 2017. And in 2018 and 2019, paying a combined $1.1 million. And paying no income tax in 2020, his final year in office. Trump offsetting his income by claiming millions of dollars in losses, raising questions about the former president's business failures. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I've been successful in every business I've been in. HOLMES (voiceover): And while Trump paid less than $1,000 in U.S. income tax in 2017, the former president's tax bill totaled nearly $1 million in foreign taxes the same year. Indicating notable business dealings in more than a dozen countries, including Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, Israel and Brazil. Shedding light on where Trump's business interests were, while he was in the White House. The returns also showed Trump maintained foreign bank accounts while serving in the White House, including in China. Some of Trump's business spending raising eyebrows among experts, including a 2017 claim that one of his businesses, DJT Aerospace, made exactly the same amount spent, zero net insuring there was nothing to tax.
