This is what it all looked like, though, just a few hours ago.The IDF says Iran fired more than 200 missiles and drones on Israel overnight. With the vast majority of them shot down before reaching Israeli airspace, including by U.S. forces stationed in the region, Tehran called a response to an Israeli strike on Iran's embassy in Damascus earlier this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken with U.S. President Joe Biden on the phone. He told Mr. Netanyahu, Biden did, the attacks were largely unsuccessful, which he described as a win for Israel. Our MJ Lee has learned the President told the Israeli Prime Minister the U.S. will not take part in any Israeli offensive action against Iran. President Biden will meet G7 leaders on Sunday to coordinate a united response to Iran's action among its allies in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu addressed his nation earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, in recent years and especially in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran. Our defensive systems are deployed. We are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively. The State of Israel is strong. The IDF is strong. The public is strong. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have been consistently saying for months now that there needs to be a ceasefire in Gaza, calling for more humanitarian aid to go in.And they have made their feelings very clear when it comes to their anger at what has been happening in Gaza at this point. And then when you hear from the Iranians themselves, they are justifying this by saying that it was an act of self-defense because of what happened on April 1st, talking about the strike on the Israeli -- excuse me, the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which killed two Revolutionary Guard commanders and five others, something that Tehran has blamed on Israel. Israel has not claimed responsibility at this point. But it does go to show that there is this delicate balancing act. For example, in Amman in Jordan, we have images showing that there were missiles or drones, some projectile being shot down in that area as well. It was filmed from the ground, of course, just to the east of Israel itself. So it shows how difficult it is for some of these countries. These are countries, for example, with Jordan that have U.S. assets there, that have relations with Israel, also with the United States, but also have been calling for a ceasefire and do not want to be seen as collaborating in any shape or form with Israel or with the United States. So it is a very difficult situation. But when it comes to what we're hearing from Tehran, the message is quite clear that they believe that they have done enough to show deterrence when it comes to what happened on April 1st, that they have shown retaliation. And one of the quotes from the Iranians was, quote, \"the matter can be deemed concluded.\" So as far as they're concerned, they have done what they needed to do. But, of course, it's not up to them whether or not it's concluded at this point. The question is, what do the Israelis do next? And they have also had an answer for that, saying that if there is more Israeli aggression, Iran's response will be, quote, \"stronger and more resolute.\" Jim?",

Wes Bryant is a retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant, author of, \"Hunting the Caliphate: America's War on ISIS and the Dawn of the Strike Cell.\" He joins us now from Raleigh, North Carolina. Good to have you on, sir. It strikes me that one headline from these attacks, some 200 missiles and drones, including ballistic missiles that went into space, and at least one of them apparently struck down in space by Israel's aero system, but also the U.S. taking part in this, striking down as many as 70 of these missiles and drones, with very little damage in Israel and no casualties, it appears, in Israel. That's remarkable. Strikes me a headline of this is that they're getting very good at shooting down missiles like this, that the layers of defense, Israeli, U.S., and other partners in the region worked here. MASTER SGT. WES BRYANT, U.S. AIR FORCE (ret.): Yes, I'm -- I'm -- I think we're all relieved that there have been no Israeli casualties. And you're absolutely right. This shows the -- the, you know, level of technical ability and tactical ability of the IDF and of the U.S. That's a positive thing. And I think, you know, Iran definitely took note.",

I just think technologically and tactically, really, Iranians just are not nearly as capable.So, to me, this was a bit of, you know, throwing a bunch of darts at a dartboard and seeing what stuck.

According to two U.S. officials, U.S. forces intercepted more than 70 drones that were targeted towards Israel. That interception included fighter jets, although it's unclear what types of fighter jets. The U.S. has a number in the region, including F-15s and F-16s. It's also unclear if there were also ground-based aerial defense systems that were part of that interception. But the number itself is what's significant here. More than 70 Iranian drones targeting Israel were intercepted by U.S. forces.In addition, at least three ballistic missiles were intercepted by U.S. warships operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. There are two U.S. destroyers there that picked off at least three, potentially four of those ballistic missiles. This is possibly the first-time warships based or operating in the eastern Med have intercepted launches like this since the beginning of the war. We have seen intercepts by warships in the Red Sea, but if I'm not mistaken, not yet in the eastern Med. So the U.S. clearly is showing that it will work with Israel on its own defense. And after that, what wasn't picked up was largely intercepted by Israel's own aerial defense arrays, which are very capable and very significant. In terms of the conversations between the U.S. and Israel, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, several hours ago. According to a U.S. official familiar with the contents of that call, the U.S. asked to be updated and notified when Israel carried out a potential response to this Iranian attack. So the U.S. and Israel trying to stay on the same page, we clearly saw they were on the defense. Will they stay together on the same page moving forward here? That's what we're all looking at, Jim.",

It is directly on Iranian territory.Israel could also target Iranian assets in Syria, and this has been something that has occurred in the past as well, beyond the April 1st attack in Damascus. Israel has frequently targeted Iranian assets there. So, there's a wide range of responses in terms of Israel, but there is also kind of the extent of this and how far will this go. I mean, obviously, Iran's message from the U.N. mission was essentially an effort at de-escalation.

And so, at least from the Iranian perspective, it seems like they'd like to keep it between Iran and Israel.There's been statements warning regional states against Israel using Iranian airspace. So there's been this effort to keep it contained between Iran and Israel. It's unlikely that Iran would encourage any kind of attacks on the United States just because Iran does understand the capabilities the United States has, which is obviously far more superior than Israel's. That being said, Israel does have the capability to do so and to launch strikes on Iranian territory. So Iran didn't go into this with the assumption that Israel wouldn't retaliate. I think that's quite clear. And this is probably something that was a tradeoff when Iran was contemplating whether or not to strike Israeli territory directly. So there is an anticipation. There's been movements, at least from open-source information, movements of missile defense systems within Iran. So there is an anticipation that potentially this would result in a direct military strike on Iran.",

It's very unlikely Israel is going to use a nuclear weapon to respond to Iran. But Iran does have a nuclear program that is really intensifying and growing in terms of its work with fissile materials. So that's essentially what you need to make a nuclear weapon and also some of its research and development. So Iran's nuclear program has been growing exponentially since theTrump administration's withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal. But Iran hasn't made the political decision to weaponize or to convert its civilian program into one of military nature. And you can potentially see Iran holding this over the whole conflict. It has loomed large about Iran's potential to break out. And so that's, I think, the nuclear dimension of the conflict.

In addition to that update, the U.N. Secretary General released a statement a short time ago saying, I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation. I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East. I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford war. Those are the words of the U.N. Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. The U.N. Security Council will convene later today, Sunday, following a request from Israel's U.N. ambassador. Iran's mission to the U.N. is warning that if Israel commits what it called any further military aggression, Tehran's response will be, quote, \"stronger and more resolute.\" CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on what we're hearing from Iran.

      "sentences": "The Iranians have said that the massive strikes that they unleashed on Israeli territory were a direct retaliation for the strikes on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus that, of course, the Iranians say killed several top-level members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Now, the Israelis, of course, have not claimed responsibilities for those strikes in Damascus, but the Iranians have said that they do hold Israel accountable for it, and so they say that right now the retaliation was for exactly that. The Iranians put out a statement earlier where they said that with this retaliation, as they put it, the matter can be deemed to be concluded. In other words, it could stop there, but the Iranians are also saying that all of that, of course, depends on the United States and depends very much on Israel as well. In fact, the Iranians are saying that if Israel does decide to take this further, to retaliate once again, that then the Iranians would, for their part, also launch what they call a proportional response to all that. The Iranians were saying that the strikes that they conducted, which, of course, involved a lot of drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, that they consider that to be an act of self-defense, as they put it. At the same time, they warned both the United States and Israel not to take things even further. One nuance that was very important in all of this is that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps actually put out a statement as well where they also said that they hold the U.S. accountable for any actions that Israel would take and told the U.S., as they said, to stay out of the matter. Of course, the Iranians threaten the United States quite frequently in the Middle East. One of the things that we've heard repeatedly from Iranian officials, but also from former members of the IRGC, is that they say the United States needs to understand that next to every military base, or almost every military base that the U.S. has in the Middle East, that there is an Iranian-backed militia out there that could attack U.S. assets in the Middle East. So certainly, the Iranians are saying that for the U.S., this could get very real. But at the same time, they also say that they don't want this matter to be taken any further. However, they do say that if the Israelis do launch attacks against Iranian territory, that Iran would be ready. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
