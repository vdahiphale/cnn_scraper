It's a little not exciting right now, but it will be a totally different picture in just a few hours. Actually, there's not even crowds in Times Square just yet. The police have not opened up all the pens. But, of course, this whole area will be filled with more than a million revelers ringing in the New Year as we will, too, with Andy and Anderson later tonight. But, also, of course, when you get crowds like this, as we know, every year security is a top priority for the NYPD. We got sort of the briefing about all the things they're looking out for. Of course, there was a major incident that happened last year if you remember. There was a person who tried to attack three officers at one of the security checkpoints with a machete. They have learned lessons from that experience to bring into this year. That means more cops, more checkpoints, more areas shut down to people so police can react quickly. On top of that, Victor, because of what's happened in the Middle East, we have seen protests every single day since October 7th, thousands of protests. NYPD has had to react to those. That is something they're keeping their eye on, as well, this year, as they focus their attention on Times Square in dealing with protests, having cops be nimble to them. I want you to hear from one of the chiefs at the NYPD about how they will react to any protests that try to get disruptive in this area tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN CHELL, NYPD CHIEF OF PATROL:  We're not going to allow unlawful behavior into a lawful assembly and celebration on New Year's Eve, just like we did for the tree lighting, the same posture.

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, Victor.Listen, you know, first, I want to note that, you know, law enforcement has conducted a joint threat assessment with the FBI, DHS, and local law enforcement entities. You know, they have assessed that there is no specific or credible threat to any New Year's Eve celebration in New York or broadly across the country. However, that doesn't mean that threats don't exist, and that is why you are seeing this significant mobilization of law enforcement and public safety resources being applied to these public gatherings. The reason being is that, in assessment by law enforcement, they have concluded that events such as New Year's Eve celebrations remain a very attractive target for malicious actors. What I mean by that is for terrorist organizations, homegrown violent extremists, or what is top of the list and top concern for law enforcement are the lone offenders, what we refer to as lone wolf attacks who are seeking to exploit the opportunity. So, what are you going to see? You're going to see a large mobilization of both uniformed and plain clothes officers that are securing a specific perimeter around events such as at Times Square. And then you're going to see that perimeter radiate out in concentric circles, basically establishing zones of diminished threat. What they're trying to do is ensure that any type of threat, whether it's a lone actor or an organized group, you know, are pushed as far away as possible from the event site, ensuring that the safety and security of those who are attending is not impacted. So, you're going to see everything from, you know, K9 and bomb technicians. You're going to see countersniper, aerial surveillance, a significant overt security structure being applied. All of this is being done with the backdrop of intelligence services both from the federal, state, and low resources that are trying to identify any type of new emerging threat, any type of new attack tactic that could be used against these events across the country. So it's a very significant security structure that has been set up, not only in New York, but you're seeing this across most major cities and any type of large gatherings this evening, all with the aim of ensuring that we have no type of interruption to the celebration.",

The reason being is they look back at what has been done in terms of the security posture in the past, and they realign it to the current threat environment. As Brynn talked about in the intro here, last year we saw an attack against three NYPD officers at a checkpoint.Taking lessons learn from that type of attack, that is why you're seeing the perimeter push out. So, the security apparatus isn't static. It's constantly evolving. Why? Because the threat environment is constantly evolving. The backdrop of the Israeli/Hamas war plays a significant impact to security planning for these events, ensuring that, one, peaceful protesters have the ability to express their First Amendment rights, however, if those protests transcend into nonviolent direct action or direct action, civil unrest, law enforcement must be prepared to react quickly to ensure that type of action doesn't impact the celebration.",

You know, we're focused on times, a couple of square miles of New York City, but there are over 300 square miles in New York City that law enforcement must protect. They have to maintain, you know, civil order across the city as well as, you know, address, you know, the criminal element that persists every single day. Now, those secondary targets are a concern. We're talking about areas that do not have, you know, hardened security structures built into it -- hotels, restaurants, you know, transportation hubs. Law enforcement is putting resources, you know, through the coordination with federal, state, and local partners, to ensure that they start eliminating as many of those soft targets as possible, trying to eliminate, you know, the opportunity for someone to cause harm.",

You got to know, am I suppose to bring a coat, gloves, or maybe an umbrella? Something like that.Right now, here's a live look at New York City. The sun is up. Temperatures are hovering around that 40-degree mark. It is dry, and we hope it stays that way for the remainder of the day today. The big concern is going to be this system right here. We're starting to see some wintry mix, some snow and even some freezing drizzle across portions of the Midwest. That's going to begin to dive down to the south and east over the next few hours. That means, even though we have winter weather advisories out for several states in the Midwest, most of those are expected to drop by the back half of today. So, by tonight, conditions are expected to improve significantly if you have some New Year's Eve plans. We're also keeping an eye on the next system that's making its way onto the West Coast. This is a look at what is expected to be at midnight tonight. You will see the bulk of this moisture is still expected to be off the coast, so it's going to be a close call, but I really think most of those areas are going to get lucky in holding off that rain until the overnight hours, especially into Monday, before that surges into southern California and Arizona. This is the low-pressure system, however, that's likely going to cause the biggest problems for any New Year's Eve plans tonight. It starts to shift down into the mid-Atlantic and the central Appalachians by midnight tonight, so unfortunately, places like Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Scranton, even around Syracuse have that potential for a rain/snow mix around that midnight time line. Now, I want to emphasize, we are not talking feet of snow or anything massive. Most of these areas will likely pick up some sprinkles, maybe even some drizzle. At most, a lot of these areas picking up 1 to 2 inches total of that snowfall by overnight tonight. So, not enough to cancel your plans but something to be aware of. If you are planning to be in New York City specifically, those temperatures will hover into the low 40s. Pretty similar to where they are right now, mostly cloudy skies. You may have a few sprinkles here and there closer to midnight, but we're not looking at anything heavy by any means, not just here but for a lot of the surrounding areas as well.

Second, it's acknowledging that we have 114 million globally, globally displaced, that's unprecedented. The U.S. can't do it alone and that's why we need to invest in root causes. And then, the third is making sure that we are not just supporting the immigrants, but also the welcoming communities. Immigration is a national issue and there has to be a federal solution. The Biden administration needs to step up. We have solutions of coordinated national responses like the refugee resettlement system, but for asylum seekers, they come in and there's essentially a cliff. And so, we need to reallocate resources instead of putting $3 billion per year into private prisons, put them into nonprofits, community-based organizations, churches who are serving these migrants.",
