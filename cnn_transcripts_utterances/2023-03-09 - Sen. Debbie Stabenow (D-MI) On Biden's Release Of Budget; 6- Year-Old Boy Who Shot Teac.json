The Republicans say they want to raise the age of Social Security, raise the age of Medicare to 70 -- both of them to 70 -- and privatize them. Let Wall Street manage Social Security. Let's see how that would work. And the president is saying no, we're going to strengthen it. We're going to take the money from negotiating prescription drugs -- the savings -- and put it back into Medicare and strengthen Medicare. And we're going to say to the folks at the very top hey, you can contribute a little bit more to something that is beneficial to everyone. So this is a vision about people investing in communities, investing in people, as opposed to the other side whose radical -- seriously, radical proposals would once again say those at the top do well and we're going to pay for it on the backs of seniors, and veterans, and kids, and everybody else.",

She was out after about a week after being shot in the chest.But her main question now -- or this other part of recovery is figuring out how this happened. Her attorney alleges that school officials knew that there was a gun on campus that day. Now, the previous principal -- the principal at the time -- has denied this. But the teacher's attorney wants to know how this all unfolded, especially since the attorney says that this kid had a history of behavioral issues and had just been suspended for breaking this teacher's cellphone. And it was the day, according to this attorney, that the student got back that this shooting happened. So obviously, still a lot to sort of here even if the 6-year-old isn't going to be charged.",

They've struck several major cities. You can see the immense amount of damage here. They knocked out power. Civilians have been killed hundreds of miles away from the front lines -- nowhere even close.Ukraine's military says that Russia has fired all sorts of different missiles overnight, including hypersonic ballistic missiles that cannot be shot down by Ukraine's air defenses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YURII IHNAT, SPOKESMAN, UKRAINE'S AIR FORCE (through translator):  As you can see, the attack is really large-scale and for the first time using such different types of missiles. This is an attack like I don't remember seeing before. Different types of aircraft were used -- strategic, long-range, MiG-31. There were 81 missile launches. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly, they affected places like Kyiv but also -- and Odesa -- but also just widespread across the country, Kaitlan. All the way -- hitting all the way as far west as Lviv.
