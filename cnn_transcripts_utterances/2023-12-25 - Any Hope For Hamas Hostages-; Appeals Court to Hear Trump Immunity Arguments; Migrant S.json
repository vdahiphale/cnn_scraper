Just two days from now, Secretary of State Tony Blinken is headed to Mexico to try to find some solutions here and also reach some agreements on how to slow that flow through Mexico.

So we could get some sort of weigh-in from the appeals court on whether there is immunity around the presidency, whether Donald Trump has to go to trial from them. And then whoever loses that is very likely to take this question to the Supreme Court, because we never have had a president, a former president, being charged with a crime before. And this is a very big question that has to be resolved before Donald Trump goes to trial on these charges. He lost, obviously, at the trial level, with a judge saying no court ever, no branch of government ever would give anyone who served in the presidency a total pass from prosecution in the future, as Trump is arguing that he has absolute protections and immunity for what he was doing while he was president. He says -- Trump's team has been arguing in court in briefs, but Trump also has been on TRUTH Social highlighting what his position is, saying, over the weekend: \"I wasn't campaigning. The election was over. I was doing my duty as president to expose and further investigate a rigged and stolen election.\" And so that is one of the issues that the appeals court is likely to be looking at. Was Trump doing something that was part of his duties as president? There are other courts who have said, no, the campaigning, the electioneering, that isn't part of the presidency. And then, on top of that, they will have to address that question of whether somebody who was sitting as president could be charged with crimes for that time period -- Sara.",

And Haley has managed to -- certain issues that are die-hard issues for Republicans, like the life issue and abortion issue, she recognizes that, in order to broaden the electorate, not just in the primary, but into the general election, she's changed the messaging. So we're not talking about abortion bans.

Look, here's the thing out of Iowa. You want to have a good, strong finish out of Iowa, second or even third with Donald Trump. But Iowa isn't necessarily about picking the winner.

That's not desirable when you're trying to really capitalize on the earned media you're getting outside of the real work he's doing on the ground. Look, he's put in the work. He's been to all 99 counties. And he's really working to meet these people. But when this palace intrigue really not just makes national news -- you have local papers covering this -- it does raise some concerns. But he does have a strong caucus operation in the works.

O'LEARY:  Well, first of all, it's long overdue. That's what they should have been doing from the very beginning. Intelligence-driven raids with special operations forces conducted at night after specific individuals from Hamas' leadership, you capture that individual. By the way, you limit civilian casualties, because most civilians aren't moving about at 2:00 in the morning, when these operations are conducted. You take detainees. You interview and interrogate them. You gather what we call sensitive site exploitation material off of the target and then you bring that back and you exploit it, whether it's documents, electronics. And all of that gets exploited and it gets fed into your intelligence picture, and you start driving towards other targets every night, and then it starts telling you where the hostages are. That's what should have been done from the beginning. A second point is, yes, Israel is like to transition -- likely to transition, but it's probably not because that they're prioritizing hostages, because they won't be able to sustain this ground campaign. This is a reserve force. I mean, they have -- yes, they have active-duty troops, but they are augmented by a sizable contingent of reservists. And these are shop owners, doctors, teachers. And, frankly, they just can't stay activated for this long. Israel's economy is plummeting, especially their agricultural industry. So, Israel has to pivot at some point back to something else, which brings into the question, well, what if the axis of resistance led by Iran, with Hezbollah, Kataib Hezbollah, the Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, if they all of a sudden flip the switch and really turn on some violence?",
