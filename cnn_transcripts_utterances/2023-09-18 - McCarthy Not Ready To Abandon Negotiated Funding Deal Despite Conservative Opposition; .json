Now earlier today, McCarthy expressed his own level of concern and frustration at those same members who are vowing to take down this short-term spending bill, asking them what they want. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), HOUSE SPEAKER: I've never seen anybody win a shutdown. We only put the power in the hands of the administration. If you want to secure the border, past the homeland. If you want to make America strong and secure, you pass the DOD approach bill. If you're not willing to pass appropriation bills, and you're not willing to pass a continuing resolution to allow you to pass the rest of the appropriation bills, and you don't want an omnibus, I don't quite know what you want.

It is a shame that our weak Speaker cannot even commit to having a commission to discuss our looming fiscal catastrophe\". And the numbers really tell you all, Dana. As you know, this is a narrowly divided House. If Democrats don't support McCarthy on any number of issues, he can only afford to lose four Republican votes to pass measures along party lines. He doesn't have the votes to avoid a shutdown and there's a risk now. He may not have the votes to stave off that push for his ouster. Dana?",

On the other flank, he is these hard-right conservatives. It's a very precarious situation even for a really strong speaker, only be able to lose four votes from your own party is rough He is in a really tough spot and she just may be a canary in the coal mine.
