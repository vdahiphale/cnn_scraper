And so he if continues to do things that are going to alienate those advertisers, it's going to be hard for him to keep the lights on.You have to remember, even though he's gutted a lot of those employees, there are still a lot of things that need to be paid out. Those employees, some of them have severances. The company still has physical headquarters where they have to pay electricity and other utilities. And then, of course, Twitter still operates like a business that has to pay vendors for various things that it does. And so it is going to be a big problem if he continues to alienate that advertising community in the short-term, but, hopefully, in the long-term, if he can hedge on subscriptions, maybe he can solve that problem.",

What Musk is now saying is that companies will get a gold check mark and governments will get a gray check mark. So, there would be some sort of visual differentiation between the different types of accounts.But my question is how do you characterize certain accounts that are important to the app. So, for example, a local fire department or any sort of first responder, a local police department, are they considered government? Are they considered a company? What about nonprofits? I think we have a lot yet to be seen as to how this color coding is actually going to work and whether or not, to your point, people are actually going to pay for it.",

And what experts are telling us is that by sort of arbitrarily saying, well, we're just going to give amnesty to suspended accounts but for some, we're going to suspend them if they do X, Y and Z, they're not being objective and diligent enough in proving out how they're going to moderate the content. And so if Twitter does not adhere to the expectations of that law, of course, that would result in things like fines and penalties out of the E.U.",

There have been people that have said Twitter is going to be knocked out tomorrow, it is not going to be online. I do think that is the case. I think there is going to will be a lot of bumps along the way as he tries to bring reform this product, which hasn't innovated so much in the past decade.But I do think in terms of his leadership style, it's very jarring to see it. I mean, you see him tweeting out that Paul Pelosi misinformation article, that is not something normally big tech CEOs want to get into the crosshairs of. Of course, he deleted it. Some of his blanket approaches to moderation have been jarring, especially compared to likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, other CEOs who have tried to be very thoughtful so that they don't come on the bad side of regulators. But Elon Musk, I will say, this has always been his M.O. He's led many other companies being erratic and being spontaneous. And so whether or not this gets him into big trouble with Twitter, yet to be seen. But for now, I'm hoping for the best.",

Now, we should take what he says because it is being said in the context of a propaganda war, which is going alongside the hot war that is being prosecuted here. He's claiming that to have information from sources on the ground but above all from looking at blogs and other statements made by Russian journalists that there might be some kind of Russian withdrawal from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station.The Russians captured this back in March. It has been used by Russia as a fire base for attacking civilian targets on the other side of Dnipro River still in Ukrainian hands. The Ukrainians have tried to recapture it at least twice, to my certain knowledge. It is very, very unlikely indeed that the Russians are even thinking about evacuating that nuclear power station because it would mean giving up a stranglehold on the very electrical-generating capacity that they currently hold. That nuclear power plant, when it is at its peak, provides 20 percent of Ukraine's energy needs. And as you pointed out in the intro there, the energy structures here have been systematically attacked several times, at least seven, by wave upon wave of cruise missile strikes and other use of drones, Iranian drones, over the last month-and-a-half. And in addition to that, I have to say, it is also an important tactical location if the Ukrainians were able to move back in there. They would use that as a bridge head to further their prosecution of the war and try and drive south towards the Crimean Peninsula. But, ultimately, though the overwhelming number of targets here in this country, according to the Ukrainian government remains civilian. They're saying 32,000 targets, less than 3 percent of them have been military.",
