And I think that probably gave a lot of people pause. I hope also that the understanding of the black churches within the SBC, around 4,000 black churches, who were opposing the law amendment because of the many women that serve in pastoral roles on their staff, I hope that also played into it.",

So I think next year is going to really be a testing period to see. And I think also, even though the law amendment did not pass, I think women in the SBC should still be very worried about the implications of this. I mean, over 90 percent the vote yesterday to kick out a historic Virginia church over the issue of a pastor -- of a female pastor on their staff, who was not a senior pastor, as well as the fact that the vote was so close. It was only about margin of 500 votes that kept the law amendment from passing. And that is a very close margin. And so there are more people who voted yesterday for -- I mean, who voted today for the law amendment, who support the law amendment in the SBC, than there are, who do not support it.

That we always have to be careful about what we are called and what we do. And that even this still plays into the sex abuse reform that is ongoing. That has become rather lukewarm and, in many ways, within the SBC. And I think that SB -- the sex abuse reform has also told women that our voices do not matter as much as protecting male pastors. And so I think this is just reaffirming the trajectory that the SBC has been on for a long time, that women are less valued within SBC churches and, thus, in the eyes of God for women who are in the SBC.",

Jason Lewis (ph) was a teammate killed on my deployment. His widow was there. Donald Lewis (ph), Gold Star, family member, talking about how this program was caught for her kids.

I got a lot of messages online when I posted about this. Most people were incredibly supportive and said, hey, Virginia needs to hold this up. For 100 years, this program has been in existence. And all of a sudden, overnight, it went away. And there were a lot of people who would say to me, oh, it's just another entitlement program we need to cut. And this is not an entitlement program. This is something that needs to be clearly understood. And I talked about this in my message. There is a huge difference between an entitlement, meaning maybe you're part of society as a citizen or resident of the state of Virginia and you receive some sort of benefit just for being part of the state or part of a federal government, as opposed to something that's earned at the absolute highest level through tremendous blood and sacrifice. And it was a covenant the state of Virginia made to all of us. We were aware of it. And it was promised to us. And now that promise, that covenant has been broken. So this was one of the biggest things. We are pushing for the General Assembly -- June 28th, they meet again.
