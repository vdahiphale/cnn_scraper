Coming up this hour President Biden bring South Korea and Japan closer together in a major summit. Air defenses in Moscow shoot down a drone. Hurricane Hillary heads towards California. And England and Spain prepare for the Women's World Cup glory. Well, history is about to be made next hour at the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David. Japan and South Korea will set aside decades of bitter differences and their leaders sit down with U.S. President Joe Biden. The summit is seen as a response to shifting ties and growing concerns about China and North Korea. But the U.S. says it's about more than the countering threats. Here's what the National Security Council's John Kirby told CNN a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: What these three leaders are going to be focused on today is the future. And then just a few hours when they stand behind me here and do a press conference, they're going to announce a set of initiatives and a framework for making sustainable all these commitments that we're going to be making, and it's not just in the security realm, although that certainly will be front and center given all the threats and challenges, but it's on the economic front, on supply chains, on microelectronics, diplomacy, people-to-people ties. There's a whole spate of terrific initiatives that will come out of this meeting today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now President Biden has spent time fostering individual relationships with these world leaders but now comes a moment where the three of them can have robust discussions, and what senior administration officials have stressed is that they have shared interest against that backdrop of mounting security concerns. So among some of the initiatives that we anticipate hearing more about throughout the day is the following. According to senior ministration officials they will discuss annual military exercises, discuss intelligence-sharing agreements, and set up a three-way hotline for the three leaders to communicate. What will not happen, though, is a formal alliance commitment or collective defense agreement. This is an opportunity for the three leaders to come together to talk about those shared interests especially as they have seen aggression from North Korea and from China, and also had discussions about economic prosperity and technological advancement. So all of this expected to happen throughout the course of the day. The big question, though, is how much of this can be maintained in following administrations? What commitment will be institutionalized so that they can come -- they can continue to unfold in the years to come? That's really the big question here, but for now, senior administration officials are really embarking this as a significant moment for this White House and for these three leaders.",

      "sentences": "Well, this has been a really pivotal year for bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea.As recently as 2019, South Korea had suspended an intelligence-sharing agreement that it had with Japan. The U.S. has been trying to bring it to kind of almost closest allies in Asia closer together and it's taken Tokyo and Seoul to patch things up, their two leaders, to help make this historic summit possible. So, you know, the Japanese and South Korean leaders, this will be their fifth time kind of meeting face to face this year alone. And it shows you how far they've come and this is exactly what Washington wants to see. It is not what China wants to see which has criticized what it describes as clicks or clubs emerging in the region. It's not just this trilateral, it is Australia and Japan getting closer in defense partnerships. It's the U.K. and Australia and the U.S. agreeing to work on submarines together. And all of this is pretty in response to a collective sense of insecurity at the rise of China, it asserting itself, making threats against Taiwan and claims, for example, to the whole South China Sea. China growing closer to Russia which just invaded Ukraine last year and is waging a war that is having ripple effects all around the world on the economy. So that is a part of what's driving this. The Japanese prime minister when he left Tokyo for the U.S., he put a couple of tweets saying that it is the security environment that makes this meeting so important. And to that point you had just today Japan scrambling fighter jets in response to two Russian reconnaissance planes that flew between the Korean peninsula and Japanese islands. You also had this week the Japanese Ministry of Defense announcing that it had grave concerns because of a joint flotilla of Chinese and Russian warships sailing through the southwest of the Japanese island of Okinawa which the Japanese government said is clearly intended as a show of force against Japan. That is part of what has brought South Korea and Japan together with the U.S. at this historic summit.",

It has gone ahead with testing missiles that are banned by multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. The U.S. has tried to bring Japan and South Korea together in the past to help deal with that, with kind of missile detection systems, and presumably that kind of proposal will be on the table here. To get all of these three military allies to pull their resources to face a common North Korean threat, North Korea doesn't like these types of meetings. It perceives that as a threat to its own national security. So we've got to watch closely to see how Pyongyang may be acting in the hours and days ahead.",

Those Russian plans also flew over the East China Sea.

Russia released this video of what it claims were ships on naval patrol with China. Beijing says the joint patrols are in line with international law. Well, Ukraine is a step closer to getting long sought after American F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. official says the Biden administration has committed to approving the transfer of the jets as soon as pilot training is complete. A timetable for the training is not yet clear.

Sowe don't know what its ultimate destination has been, but the area it struck which is around the Moscow city sort of complex of offices and apartment buildings has been hit on two previous occasions. So it's possible that it was en route to that exact place. It hit in the end a convention center, an expo center which is on the banks of the Moscow River, just a short distance from where I'm talking to you now, right in the center of the Russian capital. It didn't cause a lot of damage, although there's video of quite a large explosion. But it's the latest in I think what we've been seeing, a spate of these relatively small-scale drone attacks that have been sort of coming on an almost daily basis towards the Russian capital and other areas of Russia as well. They're not military that significant. Nobody was injured. There are a little bit disruptive, there were plans that were stopped from flying into Moscow's main airports as this drone strike, this latest drone strike got underway, but I mean, the main significance of them is when you add them all together, while, you know, it makes Russians generally and Muscovites in particular understand that there are consequences for the war that's underway in Ukraine. I think also symbolically, they show the Kremlin and they show the Russian state to be not entirely in control, that it cannot content even its own airspace, and with each one of these drone strikes, it makes the Kremlin look a little bit weaker perhaps in the eyes of the Russian population. And I think that's what the importance is symbolically of this continuous now drone strikes.",

Over 1,000 missing, according to the governor, his last statement on that, and given the fact that a lot of the powers back up on the island, a lot of the communication is back up, you'd think we would have heard from those folks by now. And what's especially grievous is when you think about how many children were home that day. I'm hearing again and again from kids there was no school when the fire hit. A lot of young ones were with their grandparents or someone else while the parents worked. So you can imagine the agony in those families if they haven't found their children.

You showed some live images coming out of Cabo San Lucas. Here's Cabo, that is the southern section of the Baja Peninsula. This is roughly 400 kilometers away from the center of what is major hurricane Hillary. 230 kilometers per hour storm. This is already an expanding wind field and some of those outer edges, the outer rain bands of this impacting Cabo as you already saw with a live imagery coming out of that area. They have tropical storm warnings in place, hurricane watches for the central sections of the peninsula, and we anticipate those to be extended further northward as we get this 11:00 Eastern standard time update from the National Hurricane Center because this storm is going to be moving at a fast clip over the next 24 to 36 hours. As it approaches the southwestern U.S. likely to still be a tropical storm for places like San Diego, perhaps even into Los Angeles. It will move inland and bring havoc with rainfall and the potential for flash flooding. So let's time it out, you can see the impacts of the wind for the middle of the day on Sunday across the Baja Peninsula, and then into Sunday overnight, early Monday morning, just in time for rush hour, right, we get some of the worst wind impacts for Southern California. Again this will be a weakened storm but nonetheless, it's still going to be an impactful storm for some of the largest populations across the western portions of the U.S. Now this is interesting, too, from the Weather Prediction Center. They have highlighted the eastern facing slopes of the mountains of Southern Central California to have this high risk of flash flooding for the day on Sunday into Monday morning. They have never done that before, and this is why they're concerned because the potential for more than a year's worth of rain could fall in a matter of a couple of days with the passage of this system. And we go back to 2022 in Death Valley, California, Lynda, where they received about 37 millimeters of rain. Their average rainfall for the entire year 53 millimeters. We are predicting with this current storm, 75 millimeters plus, so it could leave scenes like we saw here last year.",
