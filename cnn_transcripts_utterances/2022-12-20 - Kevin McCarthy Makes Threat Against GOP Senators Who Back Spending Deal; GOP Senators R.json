      "sentences": "Yes, Jake. Well, you heard what he was telling his troops on the ground earlier today, that is message. It looks like he will be able to deliver directly in person to President Biden. Right now, planning is underway for President Zelenskyy to visit the White House to meet with President Biden face to face, a visit that will coincide with the announcement of a new security assistance package. A package that will include something Zelenskyy has long asked for.And over the course of the last several weeks, the White House and the Biden administration has moved closer to agreeing to deliver. That's a Patriot -- the Patriot missile systems that White House officials and the Department of Defense have been weighing over the course of the last several weeks and have been moving towards signing off on. Now, this planning is still tentative and no final decision has been made yet, but this is something that has been very closely held and has been something that a very tight circle of administration officials have been working on over the course of the last several days. We do know that the administration has been moving toward saying yes to the idea of sending Patriot missiles and other advanced weaponry as well, something that underscores the realities that are happening on the ground right now. But I think the significance of the moment is also something worth pointing out. Should Zelenskyy appear at the White House, as you noted, it would be his first trip out of the Ukraine since the invasion back in February. And it would be a trip to a steadfast ally and a president that has made clear unequivocally throughout the course of the nine months of this war that the U.S. will stand behind Ukraine in every way that it can, not just now, not just in the near term, but for as long as it takes. Up to this point, the U.S. has already delivered almost $20 billion in defense assistance over the course of this war, very clearly planning to deliver more in a very much expanded package in terms of the type of weaponry and systems that the U.S. is willing to send to the Ukrainian troops right now, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Jake, no better way for President Zelenskyy to say thanks than to be there in person with President Biden if that's how this plays out. Patriots are perhaps the second most significant system that the U.S. has sent Ukraine since the beginning of the war, perhaps only bested by the HIMARS that Ukraine has used so effectively. The Patriot itself is a large system that requires a large crew to operate.And as Phil pointed out, Ukraine has been asking for this for quite some time to beef up their aerial defenses. It would offer them a long range aerial defense on top of the medium range NASAMS and the shorter range Stingers and those sorts of options that Ukraine already has. And that's why it's such a significant announcement and such a significant moment, even if it will take a matter of time, weeks, perhaps even months for the training, not only on how to operate the system, but for the maintenance and logistics. Jake, I will add that we're also learning that another part of this package will be what are known as JDAMs, kits that go on, quote unquote, \"dumb bombs\" to make them precision weapons that will also be included. We've learned from U.S. officials that will add to Ukraine's capability to attack Russian forces, Russian hard points. That also there comes with its own challenges how to fire a U.S. made weapon off a Soviet era fighter. That's a challenge they've already overcome before. But with Zelenskyy here, the expectation he's coming, certainly a momentous occasion in and of itself, because he hasn't left Ukraine since the start of the invasion, but he'll be here for that announcement of Patriots and more.",

They extended it to December 23.And then last night, actually early this morning, 1:23 in the morning, they rolled all twelve appropriations bills into one massive bill, $1.7 trillion worth, more than 4,000 pages and they plan to push it through Congress in just a matter of a few days. It would fund all federal agencies, including more than $44 billion in aid to Ukraine, have a host of key policy measures, including the Reforming the Electoral Count Act to try to prevent another January 6 effort to overturn the electoral results when Congress counts those results.
