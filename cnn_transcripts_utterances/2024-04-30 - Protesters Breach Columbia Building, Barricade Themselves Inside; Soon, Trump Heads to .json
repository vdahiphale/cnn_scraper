Just behind me, that is Hamilton Hall, where dozens of students are inside at the moment occupying that building all in their protest against the war in Gaza and against Columbia University trying to get it to divest from any kind of investment that touches Israel.We should also let you know, we've been seeing images that coming out from inside of those halls inside of Hamilton Hall, where dozens of protesters have used everything, from chairs to desks, to vending machines to block doors to restrict entry from any official coming in. And we also have been seeing this morning a huge banner that you'll see there that says, free Palestine, hanging from the second or third floor of Hamilton Hall at this hour. We know that there are also some protesters that are blocking the front entrance. We have been for days watching this protest. It is clear that things have gotten even more tense between the students and the faculty and officials here at the university. Let us bring in our Polo Sandoval, who has been following this for days now. Wednesday will mark, right, the second week of this protest. And now you've got this situation here. Can you give us some sense of how this all happened?",

I think this is certainly going to now amp up the pressure further on Columbia University to see what they will do to actually respond because you now see the potential.Actually, we are seeing yet another layer of disruption for some of those students, especially those who have been observing what's been happening, as you mentioned for two weeks now, but there are still a lot of questions about who these people were. We've been -- myself, my colleagues, have been on campus for the last couple of weeks, speaking to members of this encampment. The encampment itself has been largely peaceful. They've done gatherings there, and it's really been contained more than anything into the hedges there, basically where they have been camped out. However, something happened last night, as we saw in these pictures here. And it is clearly going to be the reason why university officials may now have to calculate that next step. What we know is that access now to the campus is now going to be further restricted. I had an opportunity to speak to a couple of students a short while ago. Unless you live on campus, it's likely that you may not be able to actually make your way onto campus until we find out a little bit more about what might be the next step. But I'd like to go back to what happened yesterday, especially when you look at these extremely dramatic pictures of dozens of people, most of them with their faces covered, basically advancing on the building that you see behind us, which has a history of protests going back decades. And I want you to hear directly from Jessica Schwalb, who's a student at Columbia, as she describes what she saw during the overnight hours. She used her phone to capture it all. Take a listen.

It's a pretty quiet scene so far. Honestly, the people I spoke with, they are undergrad students here at Columbia. This is the vibe. It's very quiet. People are just holding their breath to see what will happen next.I want to show you these look like the windows, the door that was used to get into the university building, Hamilton building, last night. They blocked it off. They're trying to protect the students who are inside. They don't know what's going to happen next. There's a feeling of just will the school, as Paolo mentioned, bring back the New York Police Department to help remove these people? This is private property after all. And last night, I'm sure you've seen those videos, students went up the columns, they hung these banners, they tried to rename Hamilton Hall, Hines (ph) Hall after a Palestinian girl, six year old, who was killed in a conflict in Gaza. There's a lot of questions hanging here, Sara. People don't know what's going to happen next. Columbia just closed its doors to all students. I was very lucky. I am a student here at Columbia University and I was one of the last people allowed in with my Columbia I.D. If you don't live on campus and if you're not an essential member of staff, you can no longer come in to campus.

And now universities are trying to figure out what to do while the students here are very passionate about their cause, saying that they want these universities to divest from Israel in any type of way. Also, they want to see a ceasefire in Gaza. I know all of those things are being discussed by the State Department as well.

Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan report that sources say Mr. Trump wants him to attack witnesses, attack what the former president sees as a hostile jury pool and attack the judge.

If you remember that gag order hearing where Todd Blanche fought his arguments against it, and the judge saying there that he was losing all credibility. So, possibly, it stems from that.But just quickly about Blanche, of course, he is one are said to be one of Trump's favorite attorneys. He's representing him in two other criminal indictments. Obviously, this is the first one to go to trial. But according to The New York Times reporting, he is saying that he's not being aggressive enough in this trial and actually complaining about how much his lawyers are costing him. But I have to tell you, when I was inside the courtroom last week, they are talking to each other the entire time during testimony for this trial. So, we'll see where that goes. But, yes, trial picks back up. This is the third week of this criminal hush money trial, and it is going to resume with testimony of Gary Farro. Now, that is that banker that Michael Cohen actually worked with to set up those shell companies in order to make the reimbursement back to Stormy Daniels. Of course, that is at the heart of this case. He also took at a home equity credit line in order to make that reimbursement. So, the prosecutors in this case have always said, John, as we talked about yesterday, that this is going to be a document-heavy case and this is where we are in the trial, getting those documents admitted into evidence and seeing the paper trail that was made in order to lay out the argument for those charges of 34 counts of falsifying business records. So, we will see him back on the stand. But, John, of course, we don't know who's coming up next. We know there's a long list of big names out there on the witness list, but we don't know the order because the prosecutors are not telling the defense or the public that because, again, they have said in court that they worry about Trump taking out on social media anything about the people who are about to take the witness stand. So, we'll see what comes next.",
