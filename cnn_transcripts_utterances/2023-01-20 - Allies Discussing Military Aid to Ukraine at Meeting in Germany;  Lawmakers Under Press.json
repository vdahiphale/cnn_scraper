He's been key point of support for President Zelenskyy and others in intelligence officials Ukraine.And we're learning now -- according from one U.S. official and two Ukrainian intelligence sources who are familiar with these talks -- that he was there to provide a briefing to President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian intelligence officials regarding that spring offensive. Now we don't have any further details on that meeting but of course we do know the U.S. has been playing a key part in keeping the Ukrainian armed forces aware of what their intelligence is telling them regarding that spring offensive. But the message from President Zelenskyy, regardless of that meeting, has been clear. They still need more weapons. For now, the concern from Ukraine is that at this stage Ukraine has enough to perhaps stave off a Russian victory but not enough to go on the offensive to establish a Ukrainian win. And that is, of course, the concern. We've also seen the CIA director in the past meeting with Russian officials. We heard actually just on Wednesday from the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov acknowledging that meeting. Saying that there were no breakthroughs but it was useful. We've also heard from the Kremlin that there could be potential at least from Russia's perspective for further talks with the CIA director. But of course, those talks are still way off just yet. For now, the focus is very much on these talks looking at getting more military support to Ukraine, more modern armaments. We've seen pledges from at least nine European nations for further support on various fronts when it comes to military and intelligence. Of course, the key focus for President Zelenskyy is getting those tanks.",

That has happened 61 times since 1978, including three times under President Trump, with little GOP pushback.

But at the moment Republicans who are swing votes are not ready to go there with the White House's refusal to negotiate. As Congressman Don Bacon told me, he said there needs good faith negotiations, some commitment to finance fiscal restraint.
