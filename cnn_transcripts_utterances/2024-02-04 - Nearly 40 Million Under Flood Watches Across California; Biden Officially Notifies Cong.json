I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, we're monitoring several developing stories at this hour starting with breaking news in California, where nearly 40 million people are now under flood watches. Officials issuing a state of emergency and evacuations for some areas, severe rain expecting to bring life-threatening flooding. Meantime, the White House has now officially notified Congress about a series of strikes conducted against Iran linked militias in the Middle East this weekend. The US launched punishing retaliatory airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on Friday, and in response to the killings of three US soldiers in Jordan. On Saturday, the US and UK kept up pressure in the Middle East with a new barrage hitting 36 Houthi targets in Yemen. Houthi leaders now vowing to meet escalation with escalation. Also at this hour, we are watching the US southern border. Right now, Republican governors for more than a dozen states are gathered for a briefing on the border crisis. Texas is going toe-to-toe with the federal government over access to the border. We are expecting to hear from those governors soon. All right, first, the powerful atmospheric river hitting the West Coast. Parts of four counties in California have issued emergency evacuation orders. The storm is bringing potentially life-threatening floods. The incoming storm forced scheduled changes for NASCAR and the PGA Tour. But as of right now the Grammys being held in Los Angeles are still on schedule tonight. CNN's Camila Bernal is live for us near the Los Angeles River and meteorologist, Elisa Raffa is tracking this major storm system from the CNN Weather Center. Camila, let's go to you first how are the conditions?",

So the wind is picking up a little bit, but this really is still the calm before the storm and it's the time that officials are telling people to get ready especially if you're under those evacuation order zones.Now in LA County, those areas include places near the canyons because the concern there is the debris flow, the possible landslides. They are also telling people to be extra careful if they are near the river or near areas where they know it is likely to flood. Now, there are evacuation orders not only in place here in Los Angeles County, but further north in Santa Clara County, in San Jose, and then you have evacuation orders in Ventura County and Santa Barbara County. In fact, in Santa Barbara County, some of the school districts there have already said they're canceling classes for the children tomorrow. Now overall, officials telling people in California to be prepared for widespread power outages because of the wind, and because of the probability of downed trees all throughout the state. There's already about 8,500 personnel in place and ready to go; that includes swift water rescue teams, helicopter teams, and in general, everybody waiting to see what they're going to be able to do or what they're going to need to address with this storm, which could be extremely dangerous. People here in Los Angeles have been stopping by their local fire stations just to grab sandbags and prepare in that way. I want you to listen to one resident that I spoke to and what he was doing.

US Central Command says the strikes were conducted in self-defense and included Houthi anti- ship cruise missiles that were preparing to launch. The strikes hit 36 targets across 13 locations that were aimed at military storage facilities, as well as other weapons used by the Houthis to attack shipping lanes in the Red Sea. A day earlier, the US launched a series of airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq and that was in retaliation for last week's attack in Jordan that killed three American soldiers.

      "sentences": "Well, his trip, of course, comes just days after the United States carried out those very significant strikes in Iraq and Syria against those Iranian-based proxies after the United States continued to strike Houthi targets in Yemen as well.And so the Secretary of State will be trying to balance that military response, which the United States feels is needed to try and reestablish some kind of a deterrence factor to show that the United States will respond to attacks on its forces in the region, but to try and balance that military response with the diplomacy aimed at trying to avoid this kind of slow simmering regional conflict that we are already witnessing from exploding into a much more significant regional war that has, of course, been the aim of the United States, but there is no question that the temperature is very high as the Secretary of State is set to arrive here. But what he will also be focused on very critically, is the possibility of another deal to release dozens of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in exchange for a pause in the fighting, the entry of humanitarian aid, as well as freeing up Palestinian prisoners as part of that exchange. We know that the Secretary of State is arriving about a week after the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel agreed to a broad framework that has now been put to Hamas. And we are still waiting for Hamas' response, but it could very well come while the Secretary of State is in the region, and he will be going to some of the key capitals, including Cairo, as well as Doha. The Egyptians and the Qataris have been key mediators in this effort, and so the Secretary of State, no doubt focusing on that there. But he is also visiting Saudi Arabia, as well as well as Israel. And in those conversations, you can expect that beyond all of the previously mentioned issues, that he will also be looking longer term, and that is at the possibility that this conflict, this war between Israel and Hamas, could actually potentially be turned into an opportunity to try and see if there is a possibility of a two-state solution, of Saudi- Israel normalization as part of that broader conversation. And of course, looking as well at post-war governance in Gaza. So a lot of short term critical issues on the Secretary of State's plate, but also very much looking longer term at the possibility of trying to establish some kind of a new normal in this region a more peaceful normal, if indeed that can be unlocked.",

We have the sandbags and sand bins full of sand at those locations to make sure that they are available to support them and we have the resources. Our volunteers are doing an amazing job. Our community emergency response teams, our search and rescue youth, our police explorers, they are out there helping the residents put sandbags in their cars so our residents are prepared.",

The swift moving water in the LA River and the San Gabriel River are really significant challenges for us as far as we're encouraging everyone to stay away from that. Don't go near the fast moving waters.Also, one of the challenges that we saw are people driving through flooded intersections. If you see a flooded intersection, stay away. Don't go through the intersection. That creates additional challenges for us. In addition to that, if you don't need to be on the road, stay home. And that's really the goal here is we're trying to talk to the community to stay home, even puddling or pooling alongside the roadways create very slick road conditions and can be very hazardous.

The state continues to build barricades despite a US Supreme Court ruling allowing federal border agents access to a state park along the border.With me now is Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.

The governor is presently denying the authority of the federal government, but he's also denying the law of the land, of the Supreme Court, which has indicated that our federal law enforcement, in this instance, Border Patrol agents have to have access to the Eagle Pass Park. And so I frankly, believe that the president has to act in some way, charging Governor Abbott with illegal activity, even if he pretends that he is protecting the people of Texas, we want to protect the people of America, and the people of Texas. And we can do that when our state's including those governors who are now getting a briefing from a single governor, if we work together, we can protect the American people and safeguard the southern border, there is no doubt that we can do that.",

And so I think the White House is trying to respect the individual rights of states, but we have a higher responsibility, and that is getting all 50 states to work together, and all 50 states to abide by the law, and to not have a segment of governors who happen to be Republican, come off to a meeting and suggest that there's any basis for them violating the law. So I would encourage the White House, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security, to find the appropriate response for this blatant disregard of federal law, and that is of the Supreme Court. I think the American people are better when we all adhere to the laws of the land and that is not what's happening. We have had issues where we've tried to help provide a feeding program for the children of Texas and this governor has rejected the federal feeding program, causing three million children not to have a feeding program in the summer. That's an option that they have the right to do, but it still hurts Texans. Well, I think what they're doing now hurts Texans as well, because the Lone Star Border Program has not proven to be successful. It has not proven to stop migration. It has not proven to be safe, because we've already seen a mother and her two children drown. What more do we have to see to know that it is better to work with the federal government and the president of the United States, who is -- who is welcoming a potential Senate drafted budget and proposal to secure the southern border? We all need to look at that, and know whether or not we will go forward in that direction. But what is happening at our border, and basing on the Lone Star effort that has been going on for more than a year, we can see that it proves unsuccessful and it is not making the border at the south more secure. The southern border is not more secure because of the Lone Star, going with your own programs that our state is trying to do. Let be the United States of America. Let's work with the president and let's get the job done by doing it together, not singularly and not violating federal law.",
