We are off to the races in what polls have predicted may be a razor thin victory for either candidate in the state. Wisconsin is one of those so-called blue wall states. The big question this morning is will the blue wall stand for Harris or crumble for Trump this election?The way Wisconsin counts its vote and the shift from Trump to Biden in 2020 after nearby Milwaukee was counted led Trump and his allies to begin unfounded questioning of the fairness of the election. Cedarburg, by the way, which is a picture-perfect town with an extremely high voter turnout to the tune of 90 percent, this city has voted Republican for every single presidential election since 1936 until 2020 when it broke blue for Joe Biden with its 12,000 plus voters. Biden won by just 19 votes then. And it foreshadowed what happened to the entire state of Wisconsin, which went to Biden by 20,000 plus votes. The weather, by the way, not picture-perfect, though the town is. It is raining here. But there are already 50 people who are outside in line long before the doors even opened, and now they are all coming in.

      "sentences": "Yes, so Wisconsin is one of those blue wall states. The states Trump one in 2016 then Biden flipped in 2020.So, let's start in Wisconsin. As you know polls are already open but before we got to today a little more than 1.5 million ballots were returned already. That's a little over 40 percent of their active voters and while early voting by mail was down slightly, early in- person ballots cast were up over 40 percent. Women here also outpace men in the early vote, as they did in all the blue wall states. And then, when you look at the map here. We are keeping our eyes on the margins in Milwaukee and Dane Counties where Democrats typically win big but also keeping an eye on the west and northern suburbs of Milwaukee, which have been historically Republican but trended more Democratic in recent years. Those counties by the way lead the state in early turnout. So, the question is when will we know? Well, they can already start processing early ballots now that polls are open and in Milwaukee the election commission had estimates all election day votes will be counted by close to 11:00 PM Eastern Time or maybe earlier; absentee ballots, likely overnight. And for perspective in 2020 CNN projected the race here for president within 24 hours of polls closing. Let's look at other blue wall states, in particular, Michigan. Polls are also already open here. Before we got here though, over three million Michiganders voted either early or absentee, according to state data, that's about 44 percent among their active voter rolls. I mean, look at the counties we're looking at, Wayne County, home to Detroit where more people live than anywhere else in the state. And so, we are looking at the margins there. Biden won 68 percent of the vote there in 2020, but we're also going to keep an eye on Macomb County in the suburbs which went for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but Obama in 2012. In the western part of the state, in Muskegon County, outside Grand Rapids, it went to Biden by just 500 votes in 2020 out of the more than 90,000 votes cast there. The secretary of state said she hopes to have final results by midday Wednesday. And then, last but not least, basically most, Pennsylvania. More electoral votes up for grabs than any other battleground state, polls are open. Over 1.7 million absentee and mail-in votes have been returned so far. But let's look at the counties that could make a difference and be critical, especially when it comes to the margins. So, Philadelphia County, but also the suburbs with big populations, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, color counties as they are known. They went to Biden in 2020, same story when you head West of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. And if you look in the northwest there is Erie which Biden flipped in 2020 by less than 2,000 votes. Remember, it was this project in 2020 that triggered the call for the presidency, it could play that same role this time around. But by the way, the Secretary of State stressed, patience people, they have never had final official results on Election Day.",
