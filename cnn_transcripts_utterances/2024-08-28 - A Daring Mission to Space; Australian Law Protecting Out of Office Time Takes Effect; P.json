Considered by some countries as a continent, it`s the collective name for the islands scattered throughout the Pacific. We`re headed down under to Australia now for our next story, where a new law is allowing Aussies to ignore work emails after work hours. It`s called the right to disconnect law, and it applies to workers in any company with more than 15 people. The law says that when employees are off the clock, they don`t have to monitor, read, or respond to any business-related contact like emails or phone calls. With work-life balance at the top of mind for so many people working at an office, many Australians are embracing this change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For all of Australia`s beauty and relaxed reputation, it might be hard to imagine that many people here feel overworked. But according to some lawmakers, Australians are working an average of six weeks unpaid overtime every year. And so the government has stepped in to protect people`s right to disconnect. As of Monday, people won`t have to answer out of hours calls, texts or emails.",

STOUT (voice-over): Around the world, ill-defined job expectations and constant connectivity has allowed our jobs to encroach on our private worlds. The gray areas remain. There may be times the boss still requires an answer, but workers can now defend their right to disconnect in court if they want to.",

The athletes, or Paralympians, are grouped together by how much an impairment, like impaired muscle power or vision impairment, can limit their activity in sport. Some 4,000 Paralympians will be aiming for gold, and ahead of these games, I sat down with Team USA`s Oksana Masters, one of the most dominant Paralympians the world has ever seen. A 17-time Paralympic medalist competing in both winter and summer games, she was born in Ukraine with her body damaged from radiation poisoning from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor incident. She was adopted, moved to the USA in 1997, and she`s been an inspiration ever since. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE (on camera): Have you ever had a perfect race?",
