And a House Democratic lawmaker just told me -- quote -- \"There's a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president's candidacy representing a broad swathe of the caucus. We are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision,\" meaning to step aside,\" but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn't.\" All of this as new CNN polling is telling us what voters think about Democrats' chances in November and whether Biden is the right choice for the top of the ticket. So let's turn now to CNN political analyst Mark Preston. All right, let's talk about it mark because Trump has a six-point lead coming out of the debate. That question that we just posed about, what voters think, what does this show us?",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple of things. We have this new poll that just came out about an hour ago, Brianna.It is chockful of information. These are just a couple of the data points and. i have got to tell you I haven't seen a poll like this in a while, and I'm not hyping it up. It is incredibly interesting. So Donald Trump, as we saw, as you note, has a six-point lead over Joe Biden. That hasn't changed since Donald Trump's lead back in January, but here's where the problems come for the president right now, President Biden. If you look right now where his support is among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, he has lost 3 percentage points. Now that's a small amount, OK? But, again, this has only been a few days since we have seen this debate. The conversation just seems to be getting louder. The governors, as you note, will be here in Washington tomorrow. Some will be virtual, trying to figure out or at least expressing their concerns about what happened the other night with President Biden. We saw a Representative Quigley this morning on CNN talking about his concerns for it, Sheldon Whitehouse, the senator from Rhode Island. The voices are starting to come up. But this is problematic as you go on. Could this poll even be worse than we're seeing right now? Let's look at his approval rating right now. It is all the way down to 36 percent. Now, just to put that in perspective, if you look at the last four presidents who were under 45 percent going back to Jimmy Carter, they all lost. So that is a troubling data point right now, Brianna, for the Biden campaign, as are many others we have seen in this poll.",

[13:05:16] Now, look, there are technical financial rules that regarding the campaign funds that have already been collected, and Kamala Harris would be entitled to those. So there's that. But there's also the political part of this. Could you imagine if the Democratic Party came in and said, we are going to replace Joe Biden, Joe Biden decided to step away, and Kamala Harris, guess what, even though you're the first African-American vice president, and you're a woman, first woman vice president, you're out, like we're going to put somebody else in?

CNN's M.J. Lee is following this development from the White House. M.J., what are you learning about that? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Pam. Well, first of all, we are learning that nearly everybody in the Democratic Party is looking for reassurance. And this, of course, is one example where some Democrats are just not going to be reassured. Their minds are not going to be altered. But our Jake Tapper, relatedly, is reporting that a group of Democratic governors is seeking now a meeting with the president at the White House, so that they can be reassured, so that they can discuss their concerns about what they saw on the debate stage last week. We are told that the White House is eying tomorrow as a potential time for this group to come in. And the group, we are told, according to Jake's reporting, had a call yesterday amongst themselves, led by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and they were discussing their concerns about the president's debate performance. And the emphasis really appears to have been that they would like to hear more directly from the president, as well as the vice president, Vice President Kamala Harris. Now, there are, of course, some serious sensitivities right now within the party. The group of governors on this call discussed their concerns about going public with some of the concerns that they have been discussing privately. And one of the concerns is that, if they were to do, that that could backfire and lead to the Biden campaign and the president digging in even further. Now, so far, we have not actually had any readouts from the White House on the president directly calling top elected Democratic officials, like a Leader Jeffries or Senator Schumer, which, of course, Pam, is really remarkable, given the crisis mode that the party is in right now.",

And this has been a rare bright spot, we could say, for the campaign at a time when they haven't had a lot of good headlines. The campaign says that it raised $127 million in the month of June, and it now has $240 million of cash on hand. But I will tell you, according to our reporting, there is a lot of effort going on right now by the campaign behind the scenes to try to very much reassure donors who are freaked out and worried. Jeff Zeleny and I spoke with participants on a call that campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon held with donors yesterday, and we are told that she tried to offer a very staunch defense of the president's health on this call, at one time -- at one point on the call saying: \"He's probably in better health than most of us.\" Remember, this was a call with some 500 donors on it, and one of the participants said that they thought that that was an offensive thing to say and basically not taking into account the seriousness of what everybody saw on the debate stage last week. Now, this, of course, is not the first example of some Democrats saying that the dismissive tone from the campaign has been off-putting and dismissive overall to the gravity of the concerns that a lot of folks in the party are feeling, including the use of the term bed- wetting, which some Democrats have described to me as disgusting and disrespectful.",

They are talked about in the media. These are not Democrats behind closed doors that are quietly, privately expressing these concerns. Democrats are doing it in the open. And that's significant, including, as you said, Congressman Lloyd Doggett becomes the first sitting Democratic lawmaker to call officially on Biden to withdraw from the race. And, notably, in his statement, he says: \"I make this decision with strong reservations about doing so,\" making them in public, but decided that he had to do this. He said he did not make this decision lightly to go forward. We also saw a significant statement this morning to our colleague Kasie Hunt earlier today from Congressman -- Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley, signaling some openness to also replacing Joe Biden on the ticket. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL):  But I think he has to be honest with himself. This is the decision he's going to have to make. He clearly has to understand, I think, what you're getting to here, is that his decision not only impacts who's going to serve in the White House the next four years, but who's going to serve in the Senate, who's going to serve in the House. And it will have implications for decades to come. It's his decision. I just want him to appreciate at this time just how much it impacts not just his race, but all the other races coming in November. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I wonder, Brian, if you think sitting down for an interview would do the trick. BRIAN STELTER, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, \"VANITY FAIR\":  I have been making calls about this, Brianna, for the last 24 hours. I have heard from lots of White House correspondents, network executives. There certainly is a lot of interest in an interview, right? That would be a prized interview right now. But this reminds me of the old phrase about putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. An interview at this point would just be a Band-Aid on a giant, gaping bullet hole. This body, President Biden, is bleeding out, and a single interview is not going to change that. The news in the last couple of hours is just even more damning for him. I think that, instead of just an interview, think about another debate. Think about a rematch between Trump and Biden. Think about a series of press conferences. Think about a series of town halls. That would be a little bit more, I think, in the realm of what might help at this point.

He's right now in a political crisis of his own making, and he's not taking that action. We have heard reports about the president being best-equipped between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. If he could hold a prime-time news conference, he probably would. And I think that's probably what a lot of Democrats are getting at as we hear these private calls. I think, Brianna, what's so interesting now is, what people are saying in private is more honest than what they're saying in public. I'm hearing Democrats say to me that this is a guy that's been wrapped up in bubble wrap for years. And now they're starting to get honest about the condition he's in.",

But you're absolutely keen on the key issue for the president and his aides. If he does come out and answer questions, whether in an interview in a news conference, and he stumbles, that stumble will be the main story. And that is not the media's fault.
