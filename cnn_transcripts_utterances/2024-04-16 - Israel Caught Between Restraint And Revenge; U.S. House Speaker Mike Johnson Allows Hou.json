The meeting concluded without any word of any kind of definitive strategy. But here's what we know so far. It's not a matter of if Israel is going to respond. It's a matter of when it will happen and how severe it will be. Sources are telling CNN the U.S. expects any potential Israeli military strike to be limited in scope.

I mean, certainly the Biden administration is waiting to hear what comes out of those war cabinet meetings, as well. Obviously, they have a better line into the prime minister's office than we do. But there is a real sense that they're waiting to see what Israel does. Now, the U.S. would prefer that Israel do nothing. Of course, the U.S. thinks that Israel has every right to defend itself. But at the same time, the way Washington is seeing it right now is that Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Iran responded and Israel defended themselves very, very effectively. Ninety nine percent of those projectiles were taken down with the assistance, we should note, of the U.S. and other countries. And so, equilibrium has been reestablished, according to one senior Biden official I spoke with. And so, they have been putting pressure. And it is, of course, significant pressure when it comes from your closest ally on Israel not to do anything. But that may be wishful thinking. The sense is that Israel will go ahead and do something. The question is what that will look like. And what we've been told by multiple officials is that it is expected to be narrower in scope, a limited kinetic action. So, that would mean something that is quite visible. So the world would know that Israel has struck Iran, but in not -- in such a way as to hopefully not trigger an Iranian response. So far, what we're told is that there has been no warning to the U.S. by Israel that anything is imminent. And you heard in that clip there from the Pentagon, the U.S. is still very much on high alert. So, the U.S. would hope to get a courtesy warning from Israel, because if Iran were to respond, U.S. ships and troops and diplomats around the region could be in harm's way. So far, we're told there has not been that warning. So, the message from the Biden administration has been to Israel, take the win. You guys did a great job defending yourselves with our help. Take the win and move on. There's a lot of goodwill for Israel right now because they've been attacked. Goodwill that Israel has not felt from around the world, frankly, for the last several months. But certainly, what the U.S. is hearing from Israel right now is they feel a need to restore that deterrent effect against Iran. Zain.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's a little blip on just how things are going to work in this trial. Whenever ajury is in the room, sometimes prosecutors and the defense lawyers have to talk to the judge about the law or something that's happening before the jury. But they don't want the jury to hear. And sometimes you can't have the jury hear or it would cause a mistrial of some sort. So, the judge will have what's called a sidebar conversation with those lawyers. Defendants have the right to listen in on those proceedings. Sometimes they do in headsets. Sometimes they walk up to the bench. But in this case, Trump yesterday appeared to be wanting to engage in those sidebar conversations. Today, he's signing a form waiving his ability to do that. He said he doesn't need to be. What that means in the big scheme of things is, well, we'll just have to see how that plays out, how many sidebars there even are as this trial gets started and progresses. But Erica, right now we are moving kind of swiftly through some of the questioning of these potential jurors. There are 18 prospective jurors in the box right now answering questions from the prosecutors that the prosecutor was asking them things, telling them you're going to have to decide what Donald Trump's intent is behind these charged, falsified business records related to the payment to Stormy Daniels in 2016. The prosecutor also told these jurors, take a moment and look at the defendant, even look at the defendant in the eyes and look inside yourself and come to terms with whether you can consider finding this person guilty if the facts are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jurors from our reporting in the courtroom answered yes, that they could weigh this case fairly. That was the apparent conclusion of the prosecutor's questioning of this batch of jurors. The defense team will get to ask their own questions of jurors, as well. Remember, though, there's two parts of this. There's striking people for cause, including the people that say they can't be fair and impartial. Many of those people have been taken out of the jury pool, dozens at this point. But then there's the other piece of this, where the prosecutors and the defense are just trying to get more information about these people because they can -- they each have 10 strikes. They can remove people for no cause at all. And so, that is the portion of the questioning we're in related to these 18 to see if anyone will say something about their politics, their background, their family or Donald Trump himself that would give reason to the defense team or the prosecutors to not want them to be a juror on this case.",

It's good to see you. I want to pick up on some of what Katelyn just ended with. She was talking about the reporting that we're getting from inside the courtroom that one of the attorneys for the prosecution had asked everyone whether they'd be able to return a guilty verdict if they could look the defendant in the eye and do that. They said yes, as Caitlin noted out. We also have a note that Donald Trump was looking at them, appeared to be looking a lot of them in the box as they answered that question.

Can you still believe him even though he may have been up to fraud and he's been convicted of a crime? There was a saying as prosecutors that we heard from the top down when under Morgenthau that even someone who is guilty of robbery in the past or guilty of drug dealing in the past can still be a victim of a crime. So, in other words, whether or not you like that person, whether or not you think he's a good person, whether or not you'd want him to be your neighbor, that's not the question here.

Fisher's attorneys arguing the law really only deals with tampering or destroying evidence not staging a protest even if it was a violent one.
