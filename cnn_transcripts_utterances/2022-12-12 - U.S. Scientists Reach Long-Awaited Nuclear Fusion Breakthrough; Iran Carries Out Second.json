Thank you.All right, so public health officials in New York City, Los Angeles and Seattle, they're urging people to start wearing masks once again indoors amid the surge of COVID, flu and RSV cases that we're seeing all over the country. And, of course, this is happening just as everyone is preparing to gather with family and friends for the holidays. Elizabeth Cohen joining me now with more on this. Elizabeth, so, what is the new guidance now?",

This is guidance, as you said, Kate. This is not a mandate. This is guidance.And let's take a look at one graph that kind of explains why they're doing this. It is about hospital capacity. Hospitals are overrun with this tripledemic of flu and COVID and RSV. All the way to the right is the capacity currently. And so for 80 percent of beds in use, that is actually higher than at other points during the pandemic. I was sort of surprised by that and things were so horrible during the pandemic. Well, now, it is actually even worse. Let's take a look at some other graphs that really -- sort of maps, rather, that explain why they're making these suggestions. When you look at this map of the U.S., you see it is almost all red and purple. That means almost the entire country has a high or very high level of flu activity. There is a lot of flu or flu-like illness around and that is putting people in the hospital. As a matter of fact, when you take a look at community transmission, you can see COVID, also there is some pockets, not entirely, but there are some pockets of high level of COVID community transmission. So, for all of these reasons, those locations are saying we suggest you wear a mask. I think they're probably aware that many people will not listen. Kate?",

I emphasize that this was a public execution, meaning residents could have potentially walked past his body on the streets this morning. Absolutely terrifying and gruesome.Iran's authorities say he was convicted of waging war against god. The allegation is that he stabbed and killed two members of the security forces and wounded several others. But there is a crucial detail here, Kate, that will explain why he's already become a rallying cry. Authorities say this killing of these two security force members, that it took place on November 17th. That means in less than a month, this man went from accused to facing the death penalty. And that is why Amnesty International, in particular, which has been tracking these executions, say they're carried out by sham trials, that these are kangaroo courts, that there is very little in the way of due process. And that the actual intention behind them, Kate, is to intimidate protesters, to keep them from coming out to the streets and that simply these executions just another tool of repression.",

They are planning counteroffensives in the coming weeks despite the plunging temperatures. They actually say that the ground freezing will be to their advantage because they will be able to move heavy equipment and weaponry much more easily on the hard ground and so we could see an escalation and the fighting in the coming months and not the slowdown that the United States have been hoping for as they try to contain this.But they are providing Ukraine with tens of billions dollars in defensive weapons. The last aid package, the latest one just announced on Friday, Kate, and President Zelenskyy had a phone call with President Biden thanking him for the $275 million in artillery rounds and counter air defense capabilities, ambulances, medical equipment, generators, but they say they need more. And the biggest thing they need are patriot defense missiles to fight against this onslaught of Russian missiles, as well as other air defense systems to fight against the kamikaze drones that are just devastating the power grid here in Ukraine, Kate.",

Kevin de Leon is seen on video being confronted by a protester who charges the embattled councilman with his body and then a fight ensues.That's the city councilman there who had the Santa hat on and then, yes, there he is right there. This all happened at a holiday event. The activists and others are demanding de Leon's resignation, and you'll remember likely why. This is for the racist comments that he and other council members made were caught on tape, hearing made earlier this year about a fellow councilmember's black child. Joining me now, L.Z. Granderson, he's an opinion columnist for the Los Angeles Times. L.Z., I mean, this is one of those things that -- I mean, we've talked about this in the past and then you've got -- this is another turn in all of this. In an interview on Saturday, de Leon says that he has absolutely no plans to resign, and here's how he put it. My commitment is solid to my community and to my constituents. I'm not going to let a group of extremely hostile individuals from outside the district bully me or my staff or my constituents. What do you make of this latest episode and what you have said before and called a really heartbreaking turn of events? L.Z. GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  It is. And I think each day that Kevin decides not to resign from city council is a day in which he shows who he really is, which is really unfortunate because he built his entire political career really showing his heart and soul to the people of Los Angeles and the state of California. But now, it's getting boiled down to him holding the city hostage. And, really, there's nothing that the residents can do other than organize and spend millions of dollars on a recall. So, it's either force him to spend money on a recall or he has several years left in his term. There's nothing in place to force him out. He has them hostage right now.",

I mean, one thing we know is that Karen Bass is a seasoned politician, she's well-respected, she's making history now as the first female mayor of city of Los Angeles. But in a city of 4 million people, the nation's second largest city, with the challenges facing the city, she's got a huge, huge, huge job ahead of her. It's good to have you here, L.Z.
