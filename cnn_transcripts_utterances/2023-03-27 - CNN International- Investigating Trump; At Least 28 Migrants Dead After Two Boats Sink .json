Elian Gonzalez now seeking to become a lawmaker, some 23 years after he was caught in a U.S. Cuba custody dispute. And as he told our Patrick Oppmann, that experience taught him a lot about U.S. Cuban relations and about his own father. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Elian Gonzalez walks with his wife and their daughter in his hometown of Cardenas, Cuba. Preparing to step back in the public view. Gonzalez is here to vote for himself and the other candidates for Cuba's National Assembly. Candidates run unopposed, so he's all but guaranteed to win. It will be Gonzalez's first official role since the legal battle that brought him back to Cuba roughly 23 years ago. Early on in our interview, Gonzalez makes it clear the U.S. is still on his mind. Elian Gonzalez, Former Refugee, Cuban National Assembly Candidate (through translator): I'm someone the American people know and I can help bring the American and Cuban people together, and not just the people, he says. That our governments reach an understanding and remove all the barriers between us. Our country doesn't have any sanctions on the U.S. OPPMANN (voice-over): Now that he's a father himself of a 2-year-old girl, Elian says he better understands the ordeal that his own father went through during the bitter custody fight with his Miami relatives, as well as the pain of all Cuban families separated by political divisions. Gonzalez (through translator): It's helped me to understand my father, he says. It's made me more sensitive. It's helped me understand how all the Cubans feel who are separated from their families and fathers who aren't able to give all the attention and things their children want. OPPMANN (voice-over): By joining the 470-member National Assembly, Gonzalez could become a high-profile spokesman for the government, something his Miami relatives said they were afraid would happen if he was returned to the island.",

GONZALEZ (through translator): Cuban exiles, what we want one day is that they are no longer exiled, that they come home, that everyone understands that all the youth that has left that when they're willing to work for Cuba, the well-being of Cubans beyond the political party and ideologies, he says, that our doors are open to build a better country, which is what we need. OPPMANN (voice-over): It's a hopeful sentiment of someone uniquely connected to both Cuba and the U.S. And Gonzales may prove to be instrumental in uniting Cubans and rebuilding the island even if he has a long road ahead of him.

More protests taking shape their over proposed judicial reforms by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu fired his defense minister over his opposition to controversial plans for judicial overhaul. But since then, several other prominent political figures within his coalition and outside of it have called on him to drop the plans. Do you stay with us for any updates as they come in.North Korea conducted more weapons tests on Monday morning, this time short range ballistic missiles. South Korea's joint chiefs of staff say two such missiles were launched flying about 230 miles or 370 kilometers before falling into the water east of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has ramped up missile launches amid ongoing military exercises between South Korea and the U.S. They are the largest joint exercises since 2017 and will end in early April. The condemnation is growing amongst Ukraine and its Western allies over Vladimir Putin's announcement that Russia could move tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus. NATO calls the move dangerous and irresponsible whilst noting the alliance doesn't see -- or hasn't seen any change in Russia's nuclear posture. Meanwhile, a senior White House official downplayed Putin's announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: We have not seen any indication that he's made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around . We've in fact, seen no indication that he has any intention to use nuclear weapons period inside Ukraine. Obviously, we would agree that no nuclear war should be fought. No nuclear war could be won. Clearly that would cross a major threshold. I would also tell you that as we monitor this, and we monitor every day, you have to, with the rhetoric coming out of Moscow. And with rhetoric that's been coming out since the beginning of the war that we've seen no -- nothing that would cause us to change our own strategic deterrent posture. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On Sunday, the Central American countries signed a formal document recognizing one China and establishing diplomatic ties with Beijing. It comes after breaking off relations with Taiwan.CNN Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang joins us with more. And this is a coup for Beijing. STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: That's right. It's been held as such as a major diplomatic victory here. And officials and state media here also made a point of noting how this now means Taiwan has only 13 formal diplomatic allies left in the entire world. Taiwan obviously pushing back with its foreign minister, saying this is but the latest example of Taipei no longer interested in engaging so called daughter diplomacy. Now this is something Beijing would never acknowledge publicly. Actually, they have been accusing Taipei of doing so, but there have been precedents of some small and often impoverished countries switching diplomatic recognition back and forth between Taipei and Beijing, depending on who offered them more money. And Taiwan officials have said Honduras had asked them to provide the country with billions of dollars in the form of foreign aid and forgiven debts. But obviously many view this latest development as another sign of China's growing clout on the global stage, diplomatically, economically and politically. But it's worth noting that even as Beijing continues to a squeeze Taiwan diplomatically, the self- governing island itself has become a very popular destination for Western politicians, especially legislators to visit to show their support as this island is now being viewed being on the front line in this global competition between democracy and autocracy as President Biden has put it. And one of the biggest tests on this front is likely to come in to come in the coming days as Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen is widely expected to meet with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the U.S. doing a stopover as she visits some of the island's remaining allies. Remember how China reacted furiously when then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last week. So that's why all eyes are now both Beijing and Washington to see how both sides handle this meeting between Tsai and the new U.S. House Speaker -- Max.",
