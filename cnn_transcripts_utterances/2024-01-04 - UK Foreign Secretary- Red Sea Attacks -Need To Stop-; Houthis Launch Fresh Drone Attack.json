Bearing in mind the loss of the last couple of days. But those are the markets and the events that we're watching closely. Houthi rebels launched new drone attacks in the Red Sea. The chairman of the world's biggest shipping management company tells me it's impossible to keep ships safe. European inflation on the rise. High numbers from Germany and France. And one man's trash is another man's treasure. The CEO of Goodwill tells us about the boom in secondhand fashion. Live in New York, on Thursday, it's January the 4th. I am Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, every economy will suffer. That's the warning from the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, if a spate of attacks on cargo ships does not end soon. You're familiar. For weeks now, shipping lanes in the Red Sea have been targeted by drone attacks from Houthi rebels based in Yemen, supposedly in solidarity with the Palestinian people. The latest such attack came just this morning. Tonight, the head of one of shipping companies' -- largest management companies tells me the disruption will have big significance for world trade. Let me show you exactly why if I can do so on here. We begin, of course, if you are going from Singapore up through the Suez Canal, say, to Rotterdam, now, that will take you, I don't know, anywhere -- let me see the number. It takes you a certain number of days. It takes you may be up to 30 days, all right, to make that trip. However, if you then have to go from Singapore right the way down around and then to Rotterdam that way, that can take up to 47 days. As you can see, a sizable difference. It's been 30% more. I realize that's a little bit messy to show you. That's the one route, and that's the other. And that gets even more so when you think about going to, say, for example, North and South America. The reality, of course, is that shipping rates, because of the potential for all of this, and ships now going that other route have doubled. Britain's Foreign Secretary David Cameron says every economy could be affected and is warning of the consequences for those responsible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They basically sent this vessel in to international shipping lanes and it detonated, and according to the US military did not hurt anybody.

We heard yesterday from Iran's secretary general, warning that if Israel wages war on Lebanon, that the response from Hezbollah will be, in his words, \"limitless.\" We also heard from the Lebanese government, its foreign minister speaking to CNN yesterday, saying that the government doesn't want to see a war break out. They are trying to convince Hezbollah not to wage a war with Israel. As you mentioned, the targeting of that senior Hamas leader on Tuesday in Beirut, in the heart of a Hezbollah stronghold, has certainly raised alarm bells on what this could trigger. We are expecting to hear once again from Hassan Nasrallah tomorrow indications that the focus of his speech will be more focused on Lebanon tomorrow. Certainly, all eyes will be watching to see what he has to say then. Today, we saw thousands gathering to pay their respects for al-Arouri who was carried in the procession before he was buried at the Martyrs cemetery at the Shatila refugee camp, a place that is clearly very much in support of the Palestinian cause, the historic Palestinian refugee camp. Of course Hamas has pointed the finger squarely at Israel for that strike on Tuesday. Hamas' political leader describing it as a cowardly assassination. As we mentioned, Richard, there has been no outright claim of responsibility nor denial from Israeli officials. A U.S. official has told CNN that the U.S. understands Israel was behind the. Strike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been clear from the start, Israel will target Hamas leaders wherever they are located, not just in Gaza, not just in the occupied West Bank.

I mean, are modern cars less or more likely? PETER VALDES-DAPINA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER:  Modern cars are much less likely to get stolen. The main thing that these vehicles lacked, these were all vehicles that had the old-fashioned ignition that you and I both grew up with. You put a key in and you turn. It what they lacked was an electronic immobilizer, which is a computer chip that would be in the key and in the car itself, to double check and make sure that that key really belonged to the car. Not having that made it much easier to tear apart the ignition, just jam a metal object into it, like a USB cord, and turn it and get the car to start. It was pretty easy to fool. Almost all new cars these days have electronics to prevent these kind of thefts. Many of them have just a push button kind of ignition that relies entirely, almost entirely, on that kind of electronic thing. So much harder to steal now.",

Of course, Epstein you arefamiliar with; the multimillionaire accused of sex trafficking before his suicide in 2019. Yesterday a U.S. judge unsealed hundreds of pages of documents, including depositions from some of his victims. Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton were all amongst the names mentioned. It is very important to note that, mainly because you are included with the names as an associate, it does not indicate wrongdoing or illegal activity. Much of the information revealed yesterday had been widely reported before. Shimon Prokupecz has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Long awaited documents finally released. The first batch of sealed court filings pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public Wednesday. The document stemmed from a civil defamation lawsuit brought in 2015 against Epstein's Former Girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Prominent figures including Prince Andrew and Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, included in a 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, a former employee of Epstein. She says in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and quote, he said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls. When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein, she said she understood Epstein had quote, dealings with Clinton. Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein and has denied any kind of criminal activity. But in 2019, he admits to having flown on Epstein's private plane but knew nothing of the financiers quote, terrible crimes. Sjoberg also recalled a time she was with Epstein on one of his planes and pilots said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffrey said, great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to, I don't recall the name of the casino but we'll go to the casino. She says in the deposition, she never gave him a massage to Trump. This is the first reference to Donald Trump but he is not accused of any wrongdoing. LISA BRYANT, DIRECTOR, \"JEFFREY EPSTEIN:  FILTHY RICH\":  Right now the only person who has been prosecuted is a woman; Ghislaine Maxwell who certainly you know should be behind bars. But it's interesting in this you know network of all these men who've been trafficking young women and underage women for decades and yet the only person that's been prosecuted you know it's a woman. There are many, many other people that you know should be held accountable as well. PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The documents also contain excerpts of depositions taking a Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who previously reached an out of court settlement in her sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew. Giuffre alleged in her deposition, that Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people including former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, Prince Andrew and tech guru Marvin Minsky. Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell said in a statement on Wednesday, she has consistently and vehemently maintained her innocence. This is the first set of documents to be unsealed under a December 18 court order, with more expected in the coming weeks. The documents are expected to include nearly 200 names including some of Epstein's accusers, prominent business people and politicians.
