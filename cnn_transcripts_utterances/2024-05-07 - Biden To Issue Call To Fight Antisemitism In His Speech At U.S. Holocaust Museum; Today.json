      "sentences": "Yeah, it certainly does, John, and President Biden plans to use this Holocaust remembrance speech as an opportunity to offer a forceful condemnation of antisemitism in the country. But it also comes as Biden is trying to balance his steadfast support for Israel's campaign against Hamas with growing frustration over how that war has been conducted, especially when it related to the impact on civilians in Gaza.Now, that frustration has manifested itself in protests on college campuses across the country in recent weeks. But those protests have also resulted in some antisemitic incidents, which has caused growing concern for President Biden and the Jewish community. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says that the president plans to address the horrors that took place on that October 7 attack by Hamas while also talking about the alarming rise of antisemitism in the country. The administration also plans on taking a number of steps to try to address antisemitism at this time. That includes the Department of Education sending a letter to school districts and college campuses outlining some examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. But even as the president prepares to deliver this speech on antisemitism on the grounds of the Capitol, he is also grappling with an increasingly fluid situation in the Middle East. Overnight, Israel took control of the Palestinian side of Rafah. And while Israel has said that is a limited operation, the White House has been watching this with some concern. President Biden making clear in a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about his position on Rafah as the administration continues to warn against a widescale operation there that could impact civilian lives. Take a listen to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Monday's testimony from two witnesses really important because jurors finally got to see the sort of documents that prosecutors say were falsified. And this was sort of getting into the nitty gritty of the details here. We heard this from Deborah Tarasoff, who works in accounts payable for the Trump Organization. She said, look -- she was asked by the attorney, \"Now, you talked a little bit about invoices\" -- and I'm quoting here -- \"I want to talk a little bit about who could sign the checks, particularly for the Donald J. Trump account. Who could sign the checks,\" he asked, \"for the accounts in 2016 and 2017?\" And she says, well, \"You are talking about Mr. Trump's personal account?\" And the attorney says, \"Yes.\" And she says, \"Only Mr. Trump.\" The attorney asked again, \"Was that true back in 2016 and 2017?\" She said, \"Yes.\" And she said it's still that way today. So she is still working for the organization. She further says that if Trump didn't want to sign a check, he certainly wouldn't do it. Can you give us some sense of how important this kind of testimony is and how far this went to help, potentially, the prosecution make their case that Donald Trump knew what was going on here because he signed the checks?",

Can you put a check in his hand under his signature?But that really is not the crux of the government's case. The case deals with have you falsified records as it relates to federal election law? And so, that has not been accomplished yet. So they're moving that way to it. I mean, this is a paper case. Paper cases are not inherently interesting. This one is a little different because it involves a former president. But the prosecutor has to put some meat on the bone. So they've sort of started building out a little bit of the flesh and they're getting that way. But they're going to have to now go from he knew about the checks, he signed the checks, over to he actually was involved or gave some direction -- gave some direction as it related to these false business records that are at issue in the indictment.",

That gives you some time to prepare if you need other things to do, especially when you have a trial that takes this long. I mean, that's usually sort of the professional courtesy that goes back and forth. There are reasons that that's not happening here.But this sort of standing up and pounding your chest and claiming that you've been harmed because somebody didn't tell you until this morning who may be on the stand -- I mean, that's just sort of the way it rolls for him because he's not been able to keep his mouth shut. And so, there's this reason that being -- that prosecutor does not want the witnesses to be subject to tweets and comments and postings and all the night before the day before they testify -- as if somehow, that might put pressure on them. And so, this is probably a bed of his own making, but it certainly is red meat to the base -- to play it to the game and play it to the argument that he is being abused and misused by the criminal prosecutors here. That this is all a sham. And so, not much substance to his -- to his post, but certainly some fodder for the campaign trail.",

We'll find out shortly.In the meantime, overnight, with only a couple of hours left on the countdown clock, NASA scrubbed the launch of the Boeing Starliner rocket due to a technical issue. Astronauts were already in the cockpit when it was decided they would be on the ground for at least another day. This is supposed to be the first crewed mission for the Starliner and, if successful, it would join SpaceX's crewed Dragon rocket in shuttling astronauts to the International Space Station. CNN's Kristin Fisher is at Cape Canaveral. Look, it's been a long, difficult road for Starliner, and this is one more bump in the road I think they didn't want or didn't need. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, but the irony here John is that this scrub -- despite all these delays, last night's scrub was not caused by Boeing. Last night's scrub was actually caused by an issue with the rocket that propels the Boeing Starliner spacecraft into space. So you have Starliner on top, the rocket on the bottom. The rocket is called the Atlas V. It's built by the United Launch Alliance. And the irony is that the Atlas V is America's longest- serving active rocket. This is a rocket that's responsible for launching -- this would have been its 100th launch. It is 100 percent success right -- rate. Very reliable. But last night, about two hours before liftoff with NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on top and inside that Starliner spacecraft, they ran into an issue where they found a faulty oxygen relief valve. This is the kind of valve that vents some of the oxygen -- some of that pressure that builds up from inside the oxygen fueling tank. And so, out of an abundance of caution, they called off the launch. The United Launch Alliance said if it had just been satellites -- non- human payloads on top of that rocket -- those satellites would now be in orbit. They would have gone ahead with the launch. But because there were people on board for the first time, they decided to scrub and delay another day. So if all goes according to plan, those astronauts will launch again. They'll spend about a week up at the International Space Station. And the whole point of this is to give NASA some redundancy in terms of getting their astronauts to the International Space Station so they aren't 100 percent reliant on SpaceX to get their astronauts there and back, John.",

And this is leading to new avenues of research. It turns out that more than half of the food that U.S. adults consume is considered to be ultra- processed -- 57 percent, according to recent estimates.Now, what this actually is -- ultra-processed foods -- is based on a formal classification system that groups foods into four groups. Group one is unprocessed or minimally processed -- things like fruits and veggies, milk, eggs, meat, rice, and things like that. Group two are processed culinary ingredients. Things like oil, butter, sugar, and salt. Then you get to group three, which is processed but you're not yet at ultra-processed. That's essentially when you're combining groups one and two and you've got, like, veggies that are in brine or you've got freshly baked bread or cheese. Things like that. Then you get to group four, which are ultra-processed foods. And some experts don't even really refer to these as foods. They call them food products because they're sort of created with these industrial processes. And these are all of the words you see on food packaging that you have no idea what they are for the most part. Now, there have been a ton of studies linking ultra-processed foods to all kinds of health problems, but there is only one controlled clinical trial that actually shows a causative effect of eating these foods. It was done by the NIH on 20 people who actually lived in the NIH hospital for a month. And what they found is that when folks ate a diet made up most of ultra-processed foods, on average, they ate about 500 calories more and over two weeks, they gained about two pounds. People eating an unprocessed diet had the opposite effect. They lost about two pounds in that period of time. These are important implications, guys, for our health and they show up in the new dietary guidelines -- Sara.",
