We'll find out as the weekend continues.The country may soon have to say so long and goodnight to some of the things that we rely on every day, at least temporarily. Satellites, thousands of them that are up in the solar system, may go offline. Telecom companies, they say that they're prepared for some of the fallout from this and they can deploy repairs at the solar flare's notice. But any breaks in the solar system would create a lot of panic, well, pretty much everywhere.

And what Canadians heard was that because of the strength of this storm, and you just heard Chad go through it, the colors might be different, right? We're used to kind of that greeny color, the milky color, sometimes some blues. It's that purples, in some cases, the pink. They're really looking in different directions and in different areas to see if they can see that intense color.I will say, though, that the cloud cover here in the eastern part of Canada where I am is kind of keeping things at bay. I'm glad that Chad said that perhaps by midnight, we will get a second shot at this. Hopefully, it'll give some time for the clouds to abate. But even though Canadians are used to it here, the magnitude of this storm, the sheer strength of it is really what is catching everyone off guard. And I heard you guys talk last hour about 1989 in Quebec. Quebec is right over my shoulder across the river there. They had a huge blackout, just talking about things that can happen. Massive blackout in the entire province. Millions of people shut down. And again, it was because of this solar -- this kind of a solar ejection. I guess the issue is now, we are told, that this is unlikely to happen going forward, no matter the strength of the storm. They've reinforced the grids, and things are done differently right now through the grid so that wouldn't happen. But the other thing that I just find amazing is the fact that Chad is tracking this with satellites, that in 1989, when that big blackout happened, did not exist. So, we know so much more now about these kinds of solar storms in terms of what's happening, their magnitude, and when they're going to happen than we did back then. So just extraordinary information, which means people aren't on their porch every minute of the evening, but certainly keeping an eye to the sky and waiting for those clouds to clear.",

Right?And so, with space weather, we can take those mitigation steps that we've been working really hard on. So, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, also known as FERC, back in 2012, actually said, hey, you know, grid owners and operators, look at your vulnerabilities, do your assessments, and come up with ways that you can mitigate the effects of space weather storms. And so, you're seeing that happening. As soon as we hit that G5 today, we called that FERC hotline, we alerted the grid operators, and they started taking the actions needed. They are seeing effects in their systems. But because we have those mitigation techniques, we are able to kind of alleviate those right now. Right? So, we don't know what's coming through the weekend. We keep seeing CME after CME, as you've heard. And so right now, all is okay, even though we are seeing effects, but it's because we have been taking those steps for mitigation over the past decade that we're really, you know, building that resilience that we're seeing now.",

Did you go back to that major event in the 1980s that kind of shut parts of the Canadian grid down for a bit? And you just studied that like a hawk. I mean, was that sort of the point of reference?

And so, the best way to do it is to take what we've seen before and then just maybe take it a little bit higher to say, okay, well, we could build our systems, withstand these impacts, but what about a little more resilience, just in case that we haven't truly experienced the biggest storms the sun has unleashed on us yet?",

So, if you're outside like my friend is in Denver not seeing anything, just wait a minute because things are going to start to ramp up here. All the red, you're going to see it, except if you're under these clouds. The clouds are a problem today.But this is not an eclipse. This will happen for the next probably three nights in a row. So, if you miss it today, that's okay because we've had more than one, what we call coronal mass ejections. This big plasma that has been thrown at the Earth. And we have more than one. This right here in the middle, that's the sun. Even though it's blocked out by the satellite here and by the picture here, you would notice the sun under there if I took it off, but then everything else would be completely blown out, you wouldn't be able to see anything. But you see these waves, kind of little smoky waves coming out. That's how we know that these ejections are coming toward Earth in the first place. Now, if you think about it, the sun, the big round ball, the Earth way out here, think about how many other directions these coronal mass ejections go every single day, usually, especially in a solar maximum, and we don't even notice them. But we're only caring about this one because it's headed right toward us. This is the big event for us. And I think probably somewhere plus or minus 12:30 is when we'll start to see that. If you want to go to spaceweather.com, you can go to spaceweather.com, great website, look for a little thing in the left, top left, and it says \"DSCOVR.\" It's D-S-C-O-V-R, acronym, you know. If you take a look at that, you click on that. You can actually see the top line up here. This is what I've been showing you all day. When these two lines start to go crazy, that's a 30-minute warning because this satellite here is one million miles away, and the solar wind is going 1.6 million miles per hour. Wrap your head around that.",
