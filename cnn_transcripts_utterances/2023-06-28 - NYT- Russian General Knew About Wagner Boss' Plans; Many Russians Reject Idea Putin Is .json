      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, live from Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, questions tonight about a top Russian general who was reportedly in on the coup attempt against Putin. Where is he tonight, and were there other top Russians who may have helped Yevgeny Prigozhin?Plus, live in Moscow where Russians are speaking out to CNN. And a U.S. marine vet here tells me why he's risking everything to fight for Ukraine. And then preparing for battle. I'm going to take you to a Ukrainian training ground in the frontlines where troops are about to return to the fight. Let's go \"OUTFRONT.\" And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. We are live tonight in eastern Ukraine, in the city of Dnipro. We are just west of the front lines deep in the country where the brutal war is being raged. Now, this is a city of nearly a million people, and, as you can see in the darkness and rain right now, all city lights at night are turned off because of security concerns. And, again, tonight, we heard the sound of air raid sirens. And, with that came this warning from the air force, quote, threat of using ballistic missiles, weapons, do not ignore the alarm signals, go to shelter. Now there are unconfirmed reports of explosions in this and other areas. That warning, though, is now over. And the fears of an attack, constant fears come as Putin is desperately trying to contain the fallout over damning new revelations about the armed insurrection led by his one-time loyal lieutenant in the head of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Now, questions are now mounting about the whereabouts of Russia's former top commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin. He reportedly hasn't been seen since Friday. Now, Christo Grozev, you know him. He's the lead Russian investigator for Bellingcat. He tells us that his team tried called Surovikin and the phone was answered by Surovikin wife, who answered, quote, he's not back from work yet. Well, according to \"The New York Times\", Surovikin may be key to a much bigger plot against Putin. The Russian general had, quote, advanced knowledge of Yevgeny Prigozhin's plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership. Keep in mind, this is a man who has been a decision maker along with Putin, alongside him. So, what does it say about Putin standing? If someone with such a high rain might have been complicit in the insurrection against him. It also raises the question as to whether there are more people inside of Putin's military who have aligned themselves with Prigozhin. A European intelligence official tells CNN tonight that the top Russian security officials we have known about Prigozhin's plot before it happened and may have wanted to see how it played out. These are stunning developments and they do suggest that there may be more than just cracks when it comes to Putin's hold on power, which may explain this rare surprise appearance by the Russian president. Today, Putin traveling to the region in southern Russia. The video from the Kremlin issuing Putin's supporters. People cheering him on. Putin is saying that he didn't doubt the support of Russians during the insurrection. Of course, they are putting this video out. We do want to say, though, Dagestan is a region where violent protests have broken because of the sheer number of men who have been drafted to fight in Putin's war and would die. It has been reported that ten times more men in the region of Dagestan have died in Ukraine than from Moscow. We also hear the resentment from Russians on the frontlines. Just listen to these exclusive intercept calls from Russian soldiers. They are speaking just before Ukraine's counteroffensive. Listen to this.

But we ask for help from artillery, from mortar men, we call them and ask for help, but there is no help. Well, at this very moment, our strip is, well, almost surrounded by Ukrainians, almost.

Of course, there are other big questions, like what happens to Wagner now, what happens to the other assets.

Clearly, rough but intelligent, and he would have -- you know, he had at that time, Chechnya on his resume. And later on, as reported, he went to Syria and the nickname was the butcher of Aleppo.

That is why he was trusted by Putin. But now, Putin, of course, he understands that the biggest problem posed by Prigozhin is not Prigozhin himself, but the reaction of the army, and people like Surovikin. So, he needs to teach a lesson. At same time, he needs to -- he still needs capable generals. For him, it is a tricky question.

So, today, we went to visit members of Ukraine's 128th infantry brigade. They are operating in southern Ukraine on the counter offensive front line. This group we were with had just returned from the front lines, they're preparing to go back. They're training now for more hand to hand combat, simulating trench warfare, laying grenades. They know better than anyone the dangers that they face in this war. But they are still undeterred. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (GUNFIRE) BURNETT (voice-over): About 15 miles from the counteroffensive frontline, members of the 128th infantry brigade are here training. They are the ones doing the hand to hand frontline combat. They train here for 2 to 3 days. After that, they go right back to the front line. Then they stay there for 3 to 4 and they do the cycle again. UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (through translator): Yes, we are ready, we are waiting for this. (GUNFIRE) BURNETT: What you are watching right now is practicing storming the Russian trenches. This is what they would do actually going into takeover and enemy trench. Some of them are wearing lasers on their bulletproof vest. And when the lasers light up, it means they are dead. Nathan (ph) was working at an online retailer before the war, after fighting this past year, he has now a trainer. UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (through translator): It is very important even for defenses, already know the tactics of your enemy, what they will do.",
