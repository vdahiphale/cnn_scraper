Cameras will be allowed because, as you know, in federal court sometimes cameras obviously are not allowed. But today we'll hear the men give their statements. There will be victim impact statements. They will talk about the torture. They will talk about how they felt and how their lives have been pretty much ruined. They don't even want to work anymore because they've been traumatized by all this. And let's not forget, one of the officers, one of the deputies, took a gun out, put it inside the mouth of one of the men, and pulled the trigger, lacerating his tongue. He's had to learn to re-speak again. All this has played out and this community wants to know what happens next. They're wondering if the sheriff's department, which is just behind us, can continue the way it is. They're calling for the leadership to step down. There will be a rally here later on this afternoon of the weather holds up. But people say they want to see action and they want to see it now. Serious charges ahead. John.",

The House Republican leadership still sort of blocking down that - that aid to Ukraine. The Ukrainians are saying that they need that aid badly. In fact, one of the things that the Ukrainian president has said just in the past couple of days, that if the Ukrainians don't get further military aid from the United States, they could very well lose this war. Now, I asked him what exactly losing means, how bad that would be for Ukraine, whether Ukraine, as a nation, could survive. And he then became more combative. He said that he does believe that things have stabilized right now, but they need weapons and they need them quickly. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are at war and the enemy is serious. But let's be realists and not pessimists. Let's be realists. Now the situation is stabilized. Once we have weapons and concretes, political steps from our partners, we will break Putin's backbone. I understand that this is not easy and everybody is thinking about oneself and we are grateful to all our partners. But what we have now is not sufficient.

Democrats have - advisors have long argued that abortion rights will be a galvanizing issue for voters heading into November, and they expect that to be no difference in Arizona, especially on the heels of this new ruling.Now, President Biden condemned the ruling yesterday in a statement saying, quote, \"millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban which fails to protect women, even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. This ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedoms.\" Vice President Harris, who has served as the administration's lead voice on abortion rights, also released a statement where she said, quote, \"Arizona just rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote. And by his own admission, there's one person responsible, Donald Trump. That is a theme that Biden's campaign repeatedly turns to, trying to call out the fact that Trump has taken credit for overturning Roe v. Wade after he had appointed supreme court justices who made that Dobbs decision two summers ago. Now, Harris will be pressing the case herself as she has planned a trip to Tucson, Arizona, in the wake of this ruling. And campaign advisers that I've spoken to in the recent weeks and months, they have already been looking at Arizona as being a place where they believe abortion will play in November. That comes as Arizona is one of those states that is considering a ballot measure that would protect the right to an abortion in November's election. So, officials have believed that that measure could serve as a galvanizing force. A way to organize their voters. And there's no question that they will try to capitalize on this ruling from the Supreme Court in Arizona as they're trying to battle out former President Trump in Arizona, especially on the issue of abortion rights.",
