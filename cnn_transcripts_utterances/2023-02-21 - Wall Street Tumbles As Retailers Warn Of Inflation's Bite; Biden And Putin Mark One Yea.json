Who knows what could happen in the last hour because that's when the books squaring goes on, but the market is down sharply and we'll get to the reasons why. And these are the main events of the day to bring to your attention: Two US retail giants are warning of a slowdown ahead. Russia is pulling out of the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement with the United States. And tonight, the Microsoft President is with me from Brussels, where he is trying to sell the EU on a $69 billion deal. We are live in New York on Tuesday. It's February the 21st. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. We start tonight with the alarm bells on Wall Street. Investors perhaps preparing for the grim new economic reality as further interest rate hikes are on the cards. The Dow is on track for its biggest one-day drop in over a month. There have been gloomy guidance from two of the biggest US retailers, and that has raised concerns about inflation. The S&amp;P is headed for the worst day of the year so far, with signs of business growth in the US and Europe, fueling anxiety that interest rates could stay higher for longer. The two companies involved, Walmart and Home Depot sparked the selloff. They cautioned investors for a difficult year. Now, why Walmart might be up when Home Depot is down is obviously Walmart does rather well as a discount seller or a bulk seller in times of recession. So that way, you might see a bit of a disparity. Rahel is with me. This is really, as I described it, the chickens coming home to roost. There is a reality now that higher for longer.",

And there was sort of a growing consensus, at least amongst some that 2023 would be the year that the Fed starts to cut interest rates? No, no, no, the conversation now is how much higher will they go. And so, it has really been quite a drastic change over the last few weeks and what has happened over the last few weeks. Of course, we've got retail sales that came in much stronger than many people were expecting. We got that January Jobs Report, that was almost three times what economists were expecting in terms of job growth, more than 500,000 jobs being added, unemployment ticking to a fresh 50-year low. And of course, Richard, as you know, it is not just the tight labor market here in the US, but many major economies around the world are also working with a very tight labor market. It is part of the reason why Home Depot, which as you mentioned earlier, Richard, said today in its earnings report that it will be adding another billion dollars to wages for both starting wages and people who are currently with the company. Great news for Home Depot workers, maybe not so good news, if you're the Fed, and you're trying to prevent a wage price spiral. So it is still a very tight labor market. It's also part of the reason why we're seeing services inflation, and part of the reason why the Dow is currently off 626 points.",

President Putin spoke first and said Russia is suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US, claiming the West started the war and declared Russia cannot be defeated. And then in Poland, hours later, President Biden said Kyiv stands strong, and the West is more united than it was a year ago.

Everything, everything possible to resolve this problem peacefully, very patient, painstaking negotiations to win this difficult situation now, but a new scenario has been unleashed, and peace initiatives have been completely subverted by lies and hypocrisy.\" Nathan Hodge is with me, former CNN Moscow Bureau Chief. He is in London. Now, how do we -- let's be cynical and skeptical on both sides.

The only difference now being that he has not delivered a short, victorious war; his military has taken a hammering; he claims to have annexed or is trying to annex territories that Russian military doesn't even fully control. So basically, you know, as far as the Russian public is concerned, he is putting lipstick on a pig today with this speech. Now, the Russian people are not the only audience for this. He is also trying to reach out to another key audience in the Global South, for instance. We've seen in recent days, for instance, the Russians, who -- you know, they are very assiduously courting support around the world, and what they want to play on is this idea of, you know, this tradition of Western interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, ergo, you know, look at what's happening in Ukraine.

The second thing is transparency in the subsidies that both Americans and Europeans will be giving for the huge economic transformation that our economies need, the green transition, so that we avoid subsidy wars. The last thing that we need is that. The third thing is the realization that frankly, although we, in Europe, would like to un-source everything that we can, and the US would like to do this as well, the fact of the matter is that we can't and we economically speaking probably shouldn't. So the question really is, in the next few years, who will we be importing from? Who are going to be our supply chains? Who are going to be our allies.

It's a third of our economies, frankly, that is allowing Ukraine today to be able to function as a country, just as Russia is trying to bomb it down.
