      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Donald Trump dodging questions about abortion, on the campaign trail. As a top Democratic governor, who wants President Biden to push the issue more is here. You'll hear from Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, in moments. And at the White House, Biden hosting Muslim American leaders, but only a few of them, after many rejected his invitation, with anger building over the war in Gaza. One Palestinian doctor, who spoke at that meeting, to President Biden, will tell me why he walked out. And Trump has been promising to free January 6 inmates in D.C. jails. Yes, the convicted criminals that he calls hostages, often. But a new report details how almost all of them were charged with assaulting law enforcement. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. But we start with our top story tonight, as Donald Trump is back on the trail, before going on trial, in two weeks from now. The former President was in a pair of states that could make or break his 2024 campaign, Michigan, and Wisconsin. These are states of course that Trump narrowly won in 2016, then narrowly lost four years later. He spent much of today, trying to make people as afraid as possible, it seemed, speaking in pretty ominous terms, and warning about violence, consuming American cities even though of course, as we know, from the data, crime is actually down in major cities. Trump used the phrase bloodbath, once again, but this time talking about the southern border, repeating his baseless claim that other nations are sending quote, yes, I'm quoting him now, \"Prisoners, murderers, drug dealers, mental patients and terrorists\" to the U.S. It's a claim we've heard from him before. And we've asked his campaign, many times for evidence of all of that. They have still yet to this day, to provide any. But there was one topic though, that Trump himself seemed afraid to weigh in on.

We also had that 1931 law that would have made Michigan one of the most restrictive states, in the country, if we hadn't amended our constitution, to protect abortion rights.This law would criminalize anyone who paid for surrogacy. It was something that made sense to get rid of, take it off the books. I don't know why it was put on, in the first place. But when we saw the Alabama court issue their IVF ruling, we heard Republicans, all across the country say, we support IVF, we want families to be able to start, we support the science. And yet, here in Michigan, when we took this surrogacy prohibition off the books? Only two Republicans voted to support that, and IVF. And so, it just tells you, I think, back to my first point is, you can listen to what people say, but you've really got to watch what they do. And in Michigan, we're trying to make this a state, where you are in control of when and whether or not you bear a child, and you've got lots of options, to how you start that family, whether it's surrogacy, or IVF, or protecting it under the law.",

We're a very close state. We go back and forth.And so, right now, in our House, it's a 54-54 tie. You lose one Democrat, you know, you can't get the agenda done, on a party-line vote. So, we're going to continue to work to expand access to abortion rights. But most importantly, I'm going to work my tail off, to make sure that we elect -- reelect Joe Biden, because we know that a second Trump term means all the progress we've made, in Michigan, could be set back, if we have a president, who wants to sign an abortion ban.",

He was there to talk about immigration, which has obviously been an issue that he has used, to his advantage, politically, ever since the 2016 campaign. President Biden told you and other governors, over a month ago, I believe it was February 23rd, that he was considering new executive action on the border. Do you understand why he hasn't taken any of that executive action that he was considering? WHITMER: Well I'll tell you. The former President was in Grand Rapids today. And he was capitalizing on a horrible tragedy that happened here. There is a family that is grieving the loss of Ruby Garcia. And she was a real person with a real story. And it is a horrible story that happened. All of that being said, he came into the, you know, perpetrate the continued storyline that he had done everything to keep us safe, which is baloney. We know that under the Trump administration, he actually called me, the Governor of Michigan, to ask that we send the National Guard to help with surveillance on the southern border. And we helped him out, because he couldn't get it done. He's also the reason that the negotiation, in Washington, D.C., didn't come to fruition. He torpedoed a deal that would have had the strongest border security, in decades, in this country that President Biden put on the table. He had told the Republicans to walk away, and they did. So, I've really, you know, I cannot abide when someone comes in, and just tries to score political points off of someone else's pain, and perpetuates a problem instead of actually trying to solve it.",

And Donald Trump slammed the entire Congress' hand to the car door, and stopped that from getting done. So, you talk about politicizing and that kind of stuff.
