This would all come when the company has shifted from its government contracts to putting the vaccine out on the commercial market. Elizabeth Cohen is joining us now. She has more details on what this could mean for everyone involved. Elizabeth, what's going on here?",

      "sentences": "Kate, this means the most for people who are uninsured or underinsured. If you have insurance, your insurance is going to pay for this vaccine and I guess in the end, we all sort of pay for that but you as a patient won't be paying directly for the vaccine. But for the uninsured, and the underinsured, this is going to be a lot more money.Let's take a look. So, while this has been a vaccine that was purchased by the federal government, the federal government was paying about $26 a dose, now Moderna is saying they're going to raise it once it's a commercial enterprise, and I'll get to that in a second, to between 110 and $130. And Pfizer has also named that price range. Now, there are various programs to help people with those kinds of -- with that kind of, you know, charge for a vaccine. But still, that can be quite a bit. Now, we don't know when this price range will go up. The federal government just now extended the public health emergency for another 90 days. So, it look like -- it looks like it might be a while before those prices go up. And, Kate, the timing on this is really interesting. CNN today has exclusive reporting that shows that this booster, the one that they're going to be raising the prices for, there was data back in June that showed it actually didn't necessarily work as well as the original -- as the original shot that's been on the market, you know, being used for years now that the new one may really not work any better than the one that's out there. And that that data was not presented to vaccine advisors when they met to confer and advise the FDA and the CDC, Kate.",

We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In some cases, 10 times more, the same exact drug is sold in other countries.In terms of Moderna, here's the story. This vaccine was discovered in partnership with the NIH, with a government agency supported by the taxpayers of this country. In addition, the government put $1.9 billion into research and development for Moderna and then guaranteed Moderna billions of dollars in sales. And then, as a thank you to the taxpayers in this country, what Moderna says is after we deplete the government supply of free vaccines, they're going to quadruple the price of that vaccine. And meanwhile, they're going to charge whatever it is 110 bucks a vaccine, it costs about $2 to produce that vaccine. And then on top of all of that, in the last few years, since this vaccine has been on the market, you got the CEO of the company making billions of dollars, becoming a multi-billionaire, as well as other executives. So, the taxpayers of this country who put money into the vaccine in order to protect the health and lives of the American people are now creating billionaires in an industry -- in a company that it's going to quadruple prices for the American people. That is outrageous, that is unacceptable, and we've got to do something about that.",

SANDERSYou know, I think the bottom line here is that we are looking at strategies in how to deal with it. But I think the area we have got to focus on is if the taxpayers of this country put money through the NIH into developing a drug, and it's certainly not just the COVID vaccine, many cancer drugs as well, should they then be forced to pay the highest prices in the world for a drug, which they helped develop? And I think the answer is obviously, no. So, if taxpayers are going to pay for the research and development, they need to make sure that the product being produced is affordable.",

And well, we don't know the full picture yet of how Kevin McCarthy has conference plans to operate.There are promises of budget cuts that could include cuts to defense, to Social Security, and Medicare, as we're discussing here. CNN is reporting that part of the promise that we have heard about is to reject \"any negotiations with the Senate on funding bills if they don't -- if they don't meet the House criteria.\" What do you say to that?",

And if the -- my guess is, Kate, the American people do not think it's a great idea to make massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the needs of ordinary Americans while maintaining for one example, the massive tax breaks that Trump and the Republicans supported when Trump was president, tax breaks that went overwhelmingly to the rich and large corporations. So, if we want to talk about getting a handle on federal spending, I think for a start, we may want to ask ourselves why we have billionaires in this country who in a given year, don't pay a nickel in federal income taxes, why the effective tax rate for the very, very rich is lower than it is for working families?So, let's talk about a fair tax system. Let's talk about why we ended up just recently against my vote, I got to say, increasing military spending by $80 billion in one year. Let's talk about all the corporate welfare that's out there. But bottom line is if the Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education, let them take that case to the American people. They will lose. We will win that debate.
