I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, reporting from Phoenix, Arizona, for you all week long. The U.S. Constitution does not require a president to give this speech. In fact, Article II Section 3 only says, quote, he shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. So the fact that this speech happens every year, that it`s done in person, that it`s televised, and the fact that it`s followed up by a response from the opposing political party -- well, those are all traditions associated with the State of the Union, not requirements by the Constitution itself. Still, the event is an opportunity for the U.S. president to tout what he sees as successes by his administration and it`s an opportunity for the opposing party to lay out a different vision for the country. This was President Biden`s second official State of the Union Address, but it was first given to a divided Congress. After Republicans took control of the House of Representatives following last year`s midterm elections. Have a listen to some of the highlights of what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We`re the only country that has emerged from every crisis we`ve ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that`s what we`re doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight after we`ve created with the help of many people in this room 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president`s created in four years because of you all, because of the American people. (APPLAUSE) Two years ago -- and two years ago, COVID had shut down -- our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much, and today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, democracy faced the greatest threat to the civil war and today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. (APPLAUSE) As we gather here tonight, we`re writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders asked me to define America and they do believe it or not, I try to define it in one word, and I mean this -- possibilities. We don`t think anything is beyond our capacity, everything is a possibility. You know we`re often told that Democrats and Republicans can`t work together, but over the past two years, we`ve proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty and yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together, came together to defend us stronger and safer Europe. It came together to pass one in the -- one in a generation, once in a generation infrastructure law, building bridges connecting our nation and our people. In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming president, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together the last Congress, there`s no reason we can`t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. (APPLAUSE) Well, folks, so let`s look at the results. We`re not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination, but the unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low. A near record -- a near record unemployment, near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We`ve already created your help eight hundred thousand good paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. So, I`ve come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report in the State of the Union and here`s my report, because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.

Last night, the rebuttal came from Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas. Sanders became Arkansas`s first female governor after she was elected in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R), ARKANSAS:  From out-of-control inflation and violent crime, to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China, Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it, and it`s time for a change. Tonight, let us reaffirm our commitment to a timeless American idea, that government exists not to rule the people but to serve the people. Democrats want to rule us with more government control, but that`s not who we are. America is the greatest country the world has ever known because we`re the freest country the world has ever known, with the people who are strong and resilient. President Biden inherited the fastest economic recovery on record, the most secure border in history, cheap, abundant, homegrown energy, fast rising wages, a rebuilt military and a world that was stable and at peace. But over the last two years, Democrats destroyed it all, a new generation of Republican leaders are stepping up not to be caretakers of the status quo but to be change makers for the American people. We know not what the future holds but we know who holds the future in his hands. And with God as our witness, we will show the world that America is still the place where freedom reigns and liberty will never die. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
