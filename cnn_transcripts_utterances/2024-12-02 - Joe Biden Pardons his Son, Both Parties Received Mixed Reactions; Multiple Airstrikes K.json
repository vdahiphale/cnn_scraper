He's issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son Hunter. Now Republicans and Democrats are weighing in on both the immediate and long term ramifications of the president's broken promise. The president issued a statement explaining his reasoning saying in part, no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he's my son and that is wrong. Hunter Biden released his own statement on the pardon. In part it reads, I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction. I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. CNN's Evan Perez has more details on how the president reached his decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter Biden saying that there were signs that his son was being selectively and unfairly prosecuted. Now Hunter Biden was facing the prospect of spending several years in prison after being convicted on gun charges in Delaware and on tax charges in Los Angeles. The president has repeatedly said that he would not pardon his son. Take a listen.

Just tell the American people the truth, they'll be fair minded. And here's the truth. I believe in the justice system. But as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it has led to a miscarriage of justice. Now, Joe Biden took office in 2021 promising to restore faith in the justice system. And this statement on Sunday night indicates that he believes the justice system has failed to treat his son fairly. Now, Hunter Biden will be covered under this pardon for anything that happened between 2014 and 2024. So the question remains whether Republicans in Congress and whether the incoming Trump administration will find new reasons to investigate Hunter Biden and the Biden family as they have said they repeatedly would do.

For President Biden offering a pardon, I think the legal implications are zero. Presidents have very broad pardon power under the Constitution. The political implications might be somewhat different.

And I think when it comes to the gun case, that really is not typically brought as a standalone charge. And so I think we can say with a straight face that it's quite unusual to see that case brought against an individual, again, without other charges. Now, just because something is typically not done doesn't mean it's illegitimate. But when it comes to the tax evasion case, I think the claims of selective prosecution are not quite as strong here. So, you know, is it the case that if Hunter Biden were Hunter Smith, then these cases would not have been brought? I think that is possible.

It's only naval base on the Mediterranean, which are still there.

Our thanks to Ben Wedeman, bring us that live report. I appreciate it. Health officials in northern Gaza say Israeli airstrikes killed at least 200 people over the weekend. The director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital says five buildings in two different areas in the north were hit during attacks on Saturday, leaving many buried under the rubble. Gaza's civil defense says 40 people in the same family were killed in one strike. A deadly Israeli airstrike was also reported in central Gaza at the Nuseirat camp. Video shows the destruction and rubble left behind. One local resident said the strike hit a family home. The daily airstrikes are only adding to the worsening humanitarian crisis in the enclave. And CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments. She joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Nada.

And we've been hearing from the director saying that this scene isbecoming a daily occurrence, that no one is able to prevent the killing of innocent people. And this is yet another example of the devastating impact of Israel's aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, particularly in northern Gaza, where it has proven so difficult to get humanitarian aid and supplies into those civilians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. As you mentioned, some 200 people killed in an airstrike in northern Gaza targeting the areas of Tel al-Zaatar and Beit Lahiya, among them one family, including 40 members of the same family killed in a single strike. So this is a hugely devastating example of the impact that we're seeing on the ground for civilians in Gaza. And again, this is really underscoring the hugely deteriorating and desperate humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza, because, of course, not only are civilians now fleeing the military bombardment, but they are also continuing to struggle with the humanitarian situation, with the lack of aid supplies getting in, with the lack of medical supplies. But also now in the winter months, there is a significant risk of people essentially getting sick or even dying as a result of the cold. And we've been hearing from U.N. officials with regards to the difficulties they're facing in terms of getting aid into the Gaza Strip. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees has said that it is now having to make the difficult decision to stop getting aid in via one of the main land crossings from Israel into Gaza, the Karam Shalom crossing or the Karem Abu Salem crossing, because of looting taking place because of that desperation. [03:24:57] They've also accused the Israeli authorities of placing obstacles in the way of getting enough aid in. They have reiterated that they believe Israel, as an occupying power, has responsibility over ensuring that enough aid is getting in. But clearly that is not the case. And we've also been hearing from the World Health Organization with regard to that humanitarian situation that civilians are facing, particularly when it comes to shelter. Quite staggering data and reflections on the situation on the ground. More than 90 percent of people in Gaza who have been displaced are now taking shelter in temporary tents. A year ago, we would have seen civilians taking shelter in schools, in other U.N. buildings. That is not the case anymore. The vast majority are in these tents, many of them in the coastal area where they have been pushed to and forced to evacuate to by the Israeli military and, of course, facing the very harsh weather conditions of the winter.

No one's shocked, but it does contradict what he said. It would have been politically unwise for him to indicate prior to the election that such a pardon would be forthcoming.

We've seen videos circulating on social media of police really beating protesters. I've seen one video showing a police officer kicking a protester in the head. What we are expecting to see probably for the next couple of nights, including this evening, is these protests to continue to take place. But like you say, the reason for these protests is down to Georgian Dream, which has been the ruling party in Georgia for some time but was re-elected in October. What they have decided is that they want to take Georgia down a different path, which is not to follow E.U. integration and becoming a full member of the bloc. But for Georgian people, that is a major sea change. Georgia has been a country that has wanted to join those Western institutions, including the E.U. and NATO, for some time. This will be a major course correction, which will take it more down a path similar or akin to alignment with the Kremlin. We've seen scenes like this taking place in Georgia, not just in the last few nights but over the last few months, as the governing party has decided that it wants to adopt laws that many in Georgia view as being more Russian or akin to laws passed in Russia. There were skirmishes like we're seeing on the streets of Georgia about a foreign agent's bill, which is very similar to the one passed by the Kremlin. There has also been dissent and crackdown on LGBTQ- plus laws and a law that was also passed by the Georgian Dream. The way that this looks to be unfolding at the moment is also an internal dispute amongst the government. The prime minister of Georgia has said that the Georgian president has to step down. She's mandated to do that on the 31st at the end of the year, but she has said she's not going anywhere for now and she's demanding, as well as the E.U., that there should be a rerun and fairer elections held in order to resolve this impasse.

But after the end of the Angolan civil war, the Angolans turned to China, partly because the West wasn't prepared to put the type of investment the Angolans needed.What the Angolans have realized is they got too close to China. They are still very indebted to China. It's the biggest debt exposure on the African continent for an African country to Beijing. And so the Angolans have decided they want to diversify their partnerships and rebuilding a good, robust partnership with the United States as part of that. I haven't seen Angolan relations with the United States be as good as they are since 1993, which is when the United States recognized the government of Angola for the first time.",

Well, that is the big question.Will Mr. Trump continue to support the investments in Angola, particularly this big Lobito Corridor initiative? Because the reality is that the main beneficiaries in the short term will not be U.S. companies, but actually a Chinese and a Canadian one. They're the ones that have taken out the first contract. Myself, I think that as long as there's effective trade corridors, everyone should be able to use them. And the investment of the United States into infrastructure in partnership with Europeans, the African Development Bank and others is a good thing. But we'll have to see because Mr. Trump can be very focused on what is it just for the United States. And this is a complicated investment. It's not just the United States that is a beneficiary. Potentially adversaries of the United States like China will be beneficiaries too, are in fact, beneficiaries.",
