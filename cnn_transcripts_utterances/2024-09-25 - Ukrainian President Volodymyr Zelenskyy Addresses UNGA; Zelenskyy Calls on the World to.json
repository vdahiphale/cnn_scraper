      "sentences": "It not only ignores reality but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war and pressure theworld to bring more nations under control. Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are in fact efforts to achieve, allow instead of an end to the war as a global initiative. The peace formula has already existed for two years. And maybe somebody wants a Nobel Prize for their political biography for frozen truce instead of real peace. But the only prices Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters. We must restore nuclear safety. Energy must stop being used as a weapon. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians possibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the U.N. Charter and guarantee our right, Ukraine's right to territorial integrity and sovereignty, just as we do for any other nation. We need to withdraw the Russian occupiers, which will bring an end to the hostilities in Ukraine. And we must hold those responsible for war crimes accountable. We need to prevent ecocide and stop the destruction of nature caused by the war. And we must not allow a second or sword face of this Russian invasion, and we need to make it clear the war is over. This is the peace formula. What part of this could be unacceptable to anyone who upholds the U.N. Charter? If someone in the world seeks alternatives to any of these points or tries to ignore any of them, it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing. The point they ignore reveals the desire they're hiding. And when the Chinese-Brazilian duo tries to grow into a choir of voices with someone in Europe, with someone in Africa saying something alternative to a full and just peace, the question arises. What is the true interest? Everyone must understand you will not boost your power at Ukraine's expense. And the world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers and the expense of those who are smaller, every country, including China, Brazil, European nations, African nations, Middle East, all understand why this must remain in the past. And Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past, which suits no one today can be imposed on Ukraine. Now, instead of a normal, peaceful life, I want this for my people real peace and justice. And I'm asking for your support from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you do not divide the world. Be United Nations. And that will bring us peace. Thank you for Ukraine (ph).",

In Europe, he's saying, wehave information that the Russians are planning to attack our nuclear power plant structures. And that is extremely dangerous. The purpose, he would say, cut them off from the energy supply. But what he's saying is if they tried to do that, it could be extremely dangerous for Europe. And then he moves to, as we call it, the developing south. And he says, this is colonialism, that what Russia is doing is colonialism. And for you countries that are on the side who don't think that it applies to you, it does. So I think it's a different purpose here. He's talking to the General Assembly. They are very focused on what's happening in Gaza and Lebanon. And that has taken some attention from Ukraine. But right now he's saying, pay attention. This is really dangerous. And as you said, there can be no peace without Ukraine. So he's saying Ukraine is key to peace literally in the world. Kim, let me bring you in here. What Fred was describing as the sort of wish list for the Ukrainian president and describing very specifically that those on the ground in Ukraine know that this is an extremely important week. It's not a new wish list. It is a list of demands as it were that have been on the table for months and months.

And certainly getting Ukraine into some sort of more sort of robust position to go into negotiation with Russia. What did you make of what you just heard and where Ukraine stands at this point? SHASHANK JOSHI, DEFENSE EDITOR, \"THE ECONOMIST\":  Well, I thought there was nothing new in that speech. And to understand what Zelenskyy is doing, you really have to read between the lines, don't you, because he's doing two things at once. He's indicating to his partners, I am ready to talk. I'm not here to get back every square inch of my territory. I'm ready to do a deal. And we heard that particularly earlier this week, when he told one of your rivals, he said, I think we are closer to peace than we think. At the same time -- and I think this is what he was doing in today's speech -- he's emphasizing, no -- I think he called it a half-baked settlement, no half-baked settlements. In other words, don't do a deal at any price in a way that would make Ukraine so inferior to Russia it would only cause another invasion a little bit down the line.

We have to understand this is an extremely vast country. And, you know, when you're on the Western border of Ukraine, you're about 1,000, maybe 1,200 kilometers away from the actual front line. But one of the things that I've actually done over the years that I've been coming here is, everywhere I go, is asking people, look if, for instance, Ukraine were to be told that it would be taken directly into NATO and directly into the European Union, would you be able, would you be willing? To give up, for instance, eastern parts of the country and possibly Crimea as well. And what I've heard from people again and again is no. So people here say that they want their territories back. But at the same time,, of course, it is also no secret that Ukraine is in a very difficult position right now on the front lines. Ukraine is having a lot of trouble also mobilizing enough people to go to the front lines and fight in the war. Which, of course, also has to do with the fact that, for a very long time, they have been badly outgunned by the Russians. And the Russians, of course, have been escalating in a huge way as well. If you're looking at the front lines now compared to the front lines a year ago, some of the weapons that the Russians are dropping, for instance, from the air, you're talking about bombs that can weigh 1-1.5 tons. That is something that is extremely difficult to deal with. And of course, this war is grinding on. And I think also from that perspective, one of the things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also alluding to was the fact that this could be an extremely difficult winter for the Ukrainians. They understand that their power system is very much under siege and under attack by the Russians. He was saying that they're possibly looking at even attacking the nuclear infrastructure of this country. The Ukrainians, of course, not necessarily talking about attacking nuclear power stations but the transformers that feed large parts of the energy grid here, which would make the winter very difficult. So I do think that the population here obviously has been under strain for an extended period of time. But by and large, the people that you speak to here on the ground believe that this is something where it's a war of existence for Ukraine that they need to see through, Becky.",

I mean, I think he feels at this point there's noway that Putin is going to come to the table unless he's forced to come to the table. So how do you force him to come to the table? Obviously, short-term, he would say the West, especially the United States and Europe, have to provide those weapons and they have to give the green light to use long-range weapons against military sites in Russia. And then long term, he's saying, you have to --  we, Ukraine, have to make sure that we have some type of guarantee or commitments that we are going to be protected and that we just won't be run over by Russia, even if there, let's say, one peace agreement. And then it's broken. And I think he would be convinced Russia would come right back. So he's looking long term to say, if you can put in place a long-term guarantee, then Putin will look at this and say, hey, you know, I should not continue the war. Maybe I come to a deal. But the problem is that you've got two diametrically opposed candidates, Harris and Trump. You just heard Trump and basically he's saying it's over, no more money.

But of course, what we have to remember is this isn't just about Trump's view of the strategic stakes in Ukraine. Ukraine is bound up with so much in his history. It was so central of course, we now, I think, sometimes forget, to his impeachment. Ukraine was at the crux of that. And I think all of those efforts by the Zelenskyy camp to reach out and shape Trump and shape those around him, I think they are now becoming fairly disillusioned. They are losing faith. But the hardest thing here for Zelenskyy is, that where he might have hoped a year ago that European states might fill the gap in the event of a Trump- induced cutoff in aid. Especially when we saw Emmanuel Macron of France making some very hawkish statements, I think European initiative in leadership in the last year or so has stalled and faded. France is distracted domestically. So is Germany. The U.K. has a new government.

But now we see that the shelling is everywhere. And it's important also, from the Lebanese side, to ensure that areas that have been under occupation will return to Lebanon. Also their ground and air violations that we've been witnessing on a daily basis, these are all violations. And there is all part of the resolution that has not been being implemented. So there is a solution. We need the commitment of the parties in order to implement it. At the moment -- (CROSSTALK)",

So it's a very important moment that this is not only confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel but it's much wider. And it needs to stop, not only after 11 months, almost one year, no one can afford it. And we need to go back to the situation we were living before, where we were trying to move forward. Let's not forget that from 2006 until October last year, the south of Lebanon had witnessed one of its quietest period in recent history. We were trying to move forward and maybe more to laugh (ph) deployed to the south working on establishing an area along the line that were agreed by both sides. So there was a work that was about to be done. But everything stopped so that's why it's important to go back to 1701 and to go back to a long term solution for this region that doesn't suffering (ph) not only for 11 months but for a very, very long time.",
