      "sentences": "Well, if you look at those numbers, Erica, Warnock won 95,000 more votes than what Walker has. So, what we saw here in this runoff was Warnock expanding his lead from the 37,000-vote lead that he had in November. Also, the voter turnout was quite impressive. On Election Day itself, yesterday, 1.6 million Georgians turned out to vote, according to the Georgia secretary of state, that's the highest Election Day turnout ever, a total of 3.5 million ballots cast in this runoff.Yes, it is slightly lower than the 3.9 that turned out during Election Day, but it is notable because this was a runoff. And, usually, interest wanes for a runoff. I do also want to point out the historic nature of this, because this was the first time two black candidates competed for a U.S. Senate seat here in Georgia. But as you said, in the end, it was Senator Raphael Warnock who prevailed. And his win really says several things. First off, that Georgia is truly a swing state, this is something that Georgia Democrats were watching closely, and we can expect that they will use the same blueprint when it comes to the 2024 presidential election. We also saw the Democrats really step up their ground game, a ground game that was laid out for us by Stacey Abrams. What the Warnock campaign wanted was their supporters to vote early, and that's exactly what they saw, a huge surge in early voting. Warnock was hoping the early voting numbers would give him a really big cushion on Election Day, and that is exactly what we saw. I want you to listen now to both candidates last night. Here's what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He, of course, was a prominent supporter of Herschel Walker. He said not only do they need to improve their fundraising online, but they also need to not demagogue the idea of early voting, something that Donald Trump has done over and over again, questioning mail-in voting. He says, we need to stop that. Others, including Senator Roy Blunt, who is a member of the Republican leadership told me flatly just a moment ago, quote, we need better candidates. And also one of the questions Republicans will have going forward in the next election cycle is how to get those better candidates. In this election cycle, the Republican Senatorial Committee led by Rick Scott decided not to engage in primaries, allow the primary process to play out themselves. I'm hearing an effort by Republicans to change that strategy, get more involved, get more heavy-handed, select those candidates that they believe will be successful going forward. But there's a problem. Donald Trump got behind several of those key candidates who emerged from the primaries who ultimately lost, like Herschel Walker, like Blake Masters in Arizona. So, just a lot of soul searching, frustration among Republicans about what's next and how to avoid another debacle, because they thought they would not just be in the majority but would have a comfortable one, and now they've lost a seat and are now staring at a 51-49 minority for the next two years, guys.",

He won 68 percent of the vote. Now, Donald Trump did sort of put him up to it, but it was the voters who selected them as their nominee. So, it's going to have to be a broad leadership conversation, but it's also going to have to involve the masses of Republican voters who at least at the primary level seem to be attracted to some of these really flawed candidates who cannot win in general elections.",

Even a Kemp in Georgia, right, who has gone head-to-head with Trump before, he backed Walker with his machine and didn't push him over the line. And there were multiple opportunities in these primary cycles for Republican leaders to say, no, an election denier should not be running, right, for governor in Arizona. They didn't do it.So, I mean, is the question here, do they have the guts, in effect, to contradict the former president when he endorses candidates that they don't think are viable?",

I mean, the platform of the Republican National Committee says what we stand for is whatever Donald Trump says we stand for. And so once you turn over that kind of control to one person, who after all is very popular with the Republican base, you are going to have to take whatever you get. And if he gives you Mehmet Oz and Herschel Walker and Blake Masters and other losing candidates, you are going to have to just suck it up and ride it to the bitter end.One thing worth noting also, though, Jim, is that Herschel Walker almost won. I mean, the Republicans won every statewide office except that one in this last cycle, and they won by an average margin of seven points. So, by no means is the Republican allegiance to Donald Trump always a losing proposition. It's just around the margin where it really counts, like this special election. It's really a problem.",
