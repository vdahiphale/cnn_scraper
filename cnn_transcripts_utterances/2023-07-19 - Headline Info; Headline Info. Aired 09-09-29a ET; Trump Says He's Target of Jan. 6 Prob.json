The major question now is a third indictment coming and will Donald Trump, who predicted his arrest, would come, have to soon give up more time on the campaign trail to go to court?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I didn't know practically what a subpoena was and grand juries and all of this. Now, I'm like becoming an expert. I have no choice because we have to, it's a disgrace. If you say something about an election, they want to put you in jail for the rest of your life. It's a disgrace so they can cheat on an election, but if somebody wants to question the cheating, they want to call you a conspiracy theorist and all these other things. These people are sick.

I am completely innocent.\"And he wrote that in all caps. But we also know, Kate, and I know from speaking with Donald Trump's advisors over the past 24 hours or so, that this is clearly weighing on him. He recognizes the seriousness of these charges and he admitted as much in his interview with Sean Hannity last night. He said that it quote, \"It bothers me.\" He also, I will say, has kept us unusually quiet. After he received that letter on Sunday night, he did not share it widely with members of his inner circle, but he did ultimately end up putting it out on true social and on social media yesterday. In order to get ahead of it, he wanted to control the narrative, and it's the same playbook that we've seen him use around the past two times that he's either received a target letter or was indicted, he's tried to come out ahead of these charges. And so, I think as we look forward to the next few days, we know that Donald Trump is reaching out to allies on Capitol Hill trying to strategize a sort of defense messaging for him.

There is new reporting about what was in the target letter.Joining us now with that former federal prosecutor at the Southern District of New York, Jessica Roth and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig. Thank you both counselors for being here. Again, the reporting is the target letter listed three broad statutes that may have been violated. Number one, conspiracy to defraud the United States. So, what does that mean and what activities might fall under that umbrella? PROF. JESSICA ROTH, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: So, the conspiracy statute covers agreements between two or more people to commit either an offense, a crime against the United States, or to defraud the United States out of the lawful administration of a government function. For example, the administration of a presidential election. And so, that could be written in a way that is very broad and encompasses everything from the scheme to create false slates of electors in the battleground states, to the effort to pressure Vice President Pence, to certify the false electors, to even potentially inciting the riot at the Capitol on January 6th.",

So, okay, what civil right are we talking about? I think the most logical explanation is the right that we all have to cast our votes and to have those votes counted. We do see this statute used a lot in police brutality cases where a police officer is using his official power as a cop, to deprive somebody who has perhaps been the victim of excessive force of their constitutional rights.

Here, I'd be really interested to see if there was a particular statutory, provision, and subdivision cited in the target letter, because there's a broad statute that covers obstruction of official proceedings that's been used to prosecute a number of the insurrectionists in January 6th. With respect to the certification of the electoral votes in Congress, if in fact this is charged, like those cases that would be obstruction of that official proceeding in Congress, there's a different sub- paragraph of that same statute that covers tampering with witnesses. If in fact that subdivision was cited in the target letter, that would suggest an effort to actually interfere with the testimony or the production of evidence by a witness. For example, an official in one of the battleground states, and what they would say or the evidence they would submit to Congress. So, here the particular subdivision really matters.",

The other thing this tells me big picture, is that most of the focus in this charge, and perhaps eventual trial, is going to be on the days and weeks leading up to the actual January 6th Capitol riot. The conspiracy, the schemes that Jessica just laid out. That all happened in November, December and January 2020 into 2021.
