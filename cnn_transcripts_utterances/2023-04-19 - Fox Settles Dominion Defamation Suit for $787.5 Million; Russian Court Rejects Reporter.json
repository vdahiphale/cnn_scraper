I'm Christine Romans.We begin with Fox News settling the huge lawsuit Dominion Voting Systems filed against it at the very last second before trial was set to start in Delaware. The $787 million settlement is by far the largest publicly disclosed media defamation settlement in U.S. history. It's nearly 4.5 times what ABC News paid back in 2017 to a meat processor in the so called pink slime case. The settlement does not require Fox to apologize, correct or retract the many falsehoods and lies that broadcast about Dominion. But Dominion's lawyers say their clients have been traumatized by the experience and the money in court rulings in their favor are enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN SHACKELFORD, ATTORNEY FOR We got into this case with two goals, accountability and justice and we achieved accountability when we exposed everything that had been going on at Fox News through the discovery process and the motion papers we had the last couple of months and we got justice for our client for Dominion today.

In this case, I got to say the dominion attorneys were all smiles today as they left the courthouse and then left the press and they left the press conference, telling us that this was a good day for Dominion and a good day for democracy.Now, this incredibly large settlement of $787 million was actually just less than half of what the meaning was initially asking for, that $1.6 billion figure, but, of course, still a sizable number. And I should say there was a lot of lead up actually to this settlement. The jury was sworn in Tuesday morning, opening statements were ready to go 130 in the afternoon. But then after a mysterious 2-1/2-hour delay, finally, the judge came back and said that there would be a resolution to this case. The parties came together and they settle and the judge even said to the jury. If you weren't there, the party's probably would not have been able to reach a settlement in this case. The judge made that announcement and the Dominion came out. And take a listen to what some of their attorneys had to say.",

This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.So, again, we're still waiting for certain details about the settlement.

A group of anti-abortion doctors asked the court Tuesday to keep in place a Texas appeals judge ruling partially reversing FDA approval of the drug, in effect restricting access to it. At any moment, the Justice Department is expected to file its response, asking the high court to block that appellate decision keeping the abortion pill available until there is a final ruling in this case. All right. A senior U.S. official tells CNN it could take a long time to bring detained \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich home from Moscow. He was arrested last month on espionage charges, which he and \"The Journal\" vehemently deny. On Tuesday, a Russian court rejected Gershkovich's appeal to be released to home detention while this case plays out. CNN's Nada Bashir live in London. It was just so -- such a relief to see him yesterday, at one point with a smile on his face. So you know, we know he has got a long road here. What is the U.S. trying to do to get Gershkovich out, and why might it take such a long time?",

We've heard from a senior administration official telling CNN that the government is looking at creative and potentially quite challenging options on the table to bring Evan Gershkovich back home, that this could take some time, but they are exploring and re-exploring all options on the table.Over the last year, we have seen the U.S. government successfully bring home two wrongfully detained American citizens by a prisoner swaps, and it's unclear whether this is on the table just yet. We have heard from that Biden administration official telling CNN that in the past, Russian officials have preferred to exhaust all legal options to go through the court proceedings, which the U.S. government does not view to be legitimate before broaching any sort of negotiation with the U.S. government on that front. So it could certainly take a long time before those court proceedings are exhausted. Now, of course, we saw Evan Gershkovich, which his appeal for that pre trial detention to be carried out under house arrest was denied by the Russian court, which means he will be remaining at Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison until the 29th of May. He has not met with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, but it is unclear whether further consular access will be permitted before his next hearing -- Rosemary.",

There's no reason to bring this before the jury. The evidence is that strong.So that was a very, very powerful thing for Dominion. The only question, I think for the Dominion attorneys would be and in any civil case, you have to worry about this. You could have win the case. You can lose the war. How much damage is, how much would the jury actually award Dominion was the big question that was left open for both sides. But Dominion had Fox on their back, and that's why the settlement discussions started to take place. And you know what ?

What Dominion did here with that they had, which most people don't have is during the discovery process, that isn't a place where you could take sworn depositions. They had all of these individuals come in. They got damning text, damning emails, and basically, they were allowed to ask any question those depositions. Sometimes you get more information from a deposition because you're allowed to ask anything that a judge would actually allow it to trial.So demeaning already had a tremendous amount of data. In fact, it could maybe have gotten worse at trial, so they both had the ability to go to the court of public opinion and say, look at the something we've been covering this for weeks. Look at all these bad texts. Look at all these bad messages and emails. The only other point at that point was how much money are we going to pay here? I don't think the trial would have made it any better for diminishing in terms of the facts. So yes, there's a level of a counter building that occurred here and occurs in every single case when a whopping amount of money has to be paid in order for Fox, in this instance, they get out from under what was already developed and likely, not much more would have been developed during the trial.",

So I think it's going to send a message to the lawyers for those other individuals and those other companies to say, wow. In fact, Fox had a collapse in the middle of this and pay that kind of money, we're going to have a problem here ourselves, and you know what they have a lot less money to defend themselves than Fox had.
