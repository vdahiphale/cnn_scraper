A defiant Donald Trump has made history as the first former U.S. president to become a convicted felon while raising the possibility he could also become the first convict to win the White House.After two days of deliberation a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election sentencing set for July 11. And he could get up to 20 years behind bars, or perhaps just probation. However, the Trump team is all but certain to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Trump meanwhile will stay out of jail without bond for now, source saying that he's in good spirits and ready to fight. His opponents and supporters have been rallying outside Trump Tower in New York, Trump expected to deliver remarks there in the coming day. But here's some of what he had to say after the verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This was a rigged disgraceful trial, that the real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people. And they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here. You have a source backed DA and the whole thing. We didn't do anything wrong. I'm a very innocent man. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly the fact that he would not allow them to call what they said was an expert on campaign financing. And those are some of the issues they objected a variety of other times they moved for a mistrial during Stormy Daniels testimony. So they've preserved enough errors there.

The contempt or rulings against him shows his disrespect for the law in the system. And that'll factor into punishment.But those other three open cases, he's presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the fact that you have been charged that there's an indictment and charges pending, that doesn't actually factor in what would factor in is a conviction. For example, if this conviction stands on appeal, and then he goes to trial, and one of those three remaining cases, when it comes sentencing time, he will be a convicted felon, and he will now have a prior conviction.

I mean, this is a very clear signal I think, Michael, that if Trump is reelected, there's essentially nothing he can do that will cause Republicans to resist and even as much as they did, in the first term, they are they are all in. But again, that will be his argument that I'm being persecuted on your behalf. I'm not sure that really works with, you know, the voters that he has to worry about the most, which are essentially white collar, Nikki Haley, voters and blue collar younger black and Latino men, I don't see this helping him with them.

Presidents don't run nine, seven, eight, nine, 10 points ahead of their approval rating in the race. And that is a reflection of the fact that there are millions of voters who are saying, as we saw in 2022, that they are dissatisfied with Biden discontented about the economy, and they will still reject Trump or the Trump style alternative because they view those as an unacceptable, you know, alternative.Biden's problem is that there is not an infinite pool of those people.

And as we saw in 2020, and really in the key swing states in 2022, it is not enough by itself to win the electoral college.I mean, the other piece of it are voters who are I think, making a retrospective comparison and basically saying that whatever else they think about Donald Trump life was more affordable. The cost of living was more containable when he was president and, you know, that combination is what is put him in a stronger position. I do think that the hesitation about interesting Trump with power is allowing Biden to stay in a race where his approval rating has meant almost certain doom for previous incumbents who had been in a situation like Jimmy Carter, or George H.W. Bush. The problem is, as I say, there's not an infinite pool of voters who will say that Biden is doing a bad job, but I cannot go to Trump. The analogy I often used, I've used to you is that, you know, Donald Trump's problems are dropping a 17 foot ladder toward Joe Biden, this may make it an 18 or 19 foot ladder toward Joe Biden.
