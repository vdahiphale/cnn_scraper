      "sentences": "It's 9am here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley, and this is Connect the World. At this hour Ukrainianpresident Zelenskyy is meeting with U.S. senators in a desperate plea for more war aid. He says doing nothing is a win for Putin. It's the last day of a critical climate summit in Dubai but talks are now in over time. Climate experts call the draft agreement weak. And Israel will use two crossings to help screen aid for Gaza starting today. We'll have a live report from Kerem Shalom. And a high stakes appeal. But will Ukraine's President feel the winter chill on Capitol Hill? Volodymyr Zelensky just arrived there and will go into a meeting with the U.S. lawmakers as we speak. You can see pictures there of the President Zelenskyy there with the majority leader, Mitch - sorry the Minority Leader Mitch McConnell there on the screen left and Chuck Schumer of course, the majority leader on his left. He's pushing for more money and weapons for his country's nearly two year war against Russia's invasion, but he's facing a markedly different climate with many Republicans now reluctant to give Ukraine any more aid. Indeed, President Zelenskyy will meet the conservative new House speaker before talking with President Biden this afternoon. And there's been no let up on the ground in Russia's campaign. Nick Paton Walsh is on the ground for us from Zaporizhzhia. Nick, a pivotal moment, one perhaps of the most critical moments that President Zelenskyy's faced since the war began. He's now fighting for hopes of $60 billion worth of Ukraine and perhaps determining the future of his nation in this fight. The question is what can he say to convince them?",

That'safter the deadline set by the summit's president came and went with no sign of a deal. Negotiators from the nearly 200 countries in attendance of trying to hammer out a plan of action to tackle global - global climate change. But of course, bitter divisions remain. A draft agreement was unveiled on Monday, but it was quickly slammed by many nations and climate advocates as weak because it dropped previous references to phasing out of fossil fuels. We've got team coverage for you, Eleni Giokos is live in Dubai. And Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir is in New York. Eleni to you first. It comes down to a matter of pragmatism, I think, at this stage and what's feasible, both in terms of the language for reducing fossil fuel, and ultimately, the use of that fossil fuel and whether those nations involved can reduce their consumption.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, look, this has been the big point of contention. It's what is the language going to be? And what arethe implications of this language. We've got to remember that when we're talking about phasing out of fossil fuels, that means big commitment by not only the fossil producers, but also I think globally as well. The draft that we saw was basically a watered down version, and major criticism has come through. Some are saying it's an oiled down version. The only mention of phase down is that of coal, which we've heard that language before. And in terms of fossil fuels, it's almost quite interesting to see a laundry list or sort of a menu of how countries could and it's important, Julia, because they mentioned the word could reduce their emissions. And included in that list is by reducing consumption and production of fossil fuels. It also includes, you know, tripling renewable energy and other things that countries could be using and deploying to try and lower their emissions. But frankly, it'll be even historic, if the words fossil fuels are used in this communique. Isn't that historic in the greater scheme of things? We know that fossil fuels account for most of the global greenhouse gases, we know that it's one of the biggest contributors to climate change. And yet, we're still seeing a debate on this. We also saw that OPEC had sent a letter to its member states saying that they shouldn't support any language that refers to phasing down or even phasing out of fossil fuels. So we know in the backdrop of this, given oil producing countries with their own agenda, and frankly, oil producers, fossil fuel delegates were really large in their numbers at this COP, which was really important. So you understand that the lobbying that perhaps could be happening behind the scenes, but also their voices really very evident here. Important to note, as well and in general - the general scope of things that countries that we've heard from observers that are pushing back in the - on this language in this final agreement, are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, as well as Kuwait. So we know which countries are pushing back. 200 countries, almost 200 countries need to find consensus on this language. The small island nations, Julia had been saying we are going to die if we do not see any real action points. But you know, we have to be pragmatic, as well as realistic. Anything that you and I touched, Julia, anything you buy from the grocery store, has fossil fuel attached to it in some way? Can we really wean ourselves off this? We have to do it, I guess we've got to be realistic about what that would mean and the actions that need to be taken.",

      "sentences": "Exactly Julia, yes. Well, it depends on who you ask. If you ask Al Gore, he says this is an abjectfailure. You know, he was one of the early voices to warn. This is what - what do you expect if a petro state - if the president of one of the dirtiest oil and gas companies in the world is hosting a COP? This is ultimately what - what you're going to end up with it. But then again, humanity gave us the Paris Agreement, which a lot of people never thought could happen. So who knows what will come out of these extra time. This overtime we're in now. The last four COPs have gone into overtime because getting a consensus around this language as Eleni was mentioning there, just using the words, fossil fuels. We haven't even used the F words until after 30 years of these sort of negotiations. But another interesting angle is how big this is now, and it has become sort of a de facto Climate Technology trade show. And I talked to a couple of different CEOs who were there and came back incredibly encouraged by the sideline commitments that are being made by governments, national governments, with entrepreneurs and clean technology, who want to scale down their emissions at a much faster clip than even as it's being talked about here. The tripling of renewables, which was pledged here, that's kind of happening anyway, because the economics of wind and solar, they are so incredibly cheap right now. And now storage for that renewable energy is ramping up as well. There's a lot of optimism that some real progress will be made in decarbonisation, regardless of whatever the final language is, we get in the next couple of days out of Dubai.",

Don't get fixated on the small print here to your point and industry is getting on with it anyway,irrespective of what central governments around the world perhaps are doing or not doing as we've known in the United States for the last several years, in particular. Eleni, Bill, thank you so much for that. Now, battles are blazing across northern Gaza as Israeli forces are engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas. Clashes like this one can be heard in Jabalya as Israel says it destroyed both a rocket launch post and a weapons production facility. The IDF claims the last two Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza and now surround it. And on the humanitarian aid front, Israel sees it would begin inspecting aid trucks waiting at the Kerem Shalom border crossing. After they're cleared, only then will they be allowed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Alex Marquardt joins us now from that point. Alex, I think we should explain to our viewers once again, what is going to be achieved here and what isn't. This is not going to be a crossing point for aid into Gaza, but it is hopefully going to facilitate the speed upon which aid can cross via the Rafah crossing.",

      "sentences": "That's absolutely right, Julia, it's a very important distinction. The good news is that more aid will be approvedby Israel to go into Gaza. Israel estimates double the amount of aid but it does not mean that aid will actually be able to get into Gaza, because of the complications at the Rafah crossing and really the chaos that we're seeing in the southern part of Gaza. Where I'm standing here is really the intersection of where Egypt, Israel and Gaza meet. So what we've seen throughout the course of the day and has slowed down a little bit now, is trucks coming from Egypt, into Israel, where they are inspected, and we've seen security dogs sniffing the goods. We've seen trucks from the World Central Kitchen and cargo from the World Food Program. But then those trucks don't go into Gaza. There's no aid actually going into Gaza from this crossing. Instead, they go back into Egypt, and then from there, they go up to the Rafah crossing. Now, all of the aid that Gaza has seen since the beginning of this war has really gone through that Rafah crossing, but it has - it was not built for such a high volume. And so you have a real bottleneck there. And then you have the heavy fighting, some of which Julia, we've just seen. In the past few moments, we actually heard an airstrike, which appears to have been at the southern tip of Gaza, there was a big plume of black smoke that went up. We've seen hundreds of 1000s if not more than a million people displaced to the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip. And so as that aid goes in, we've seen trucks also being swarmed by people who are so desperate for food, for water, for medicine, for shelter. And so it has made distribution incredibly difficult. When this crossing will actually open for aid? Well, obviously that's something that humanitarian officials hope will happen soon. But for now, I'm told it is a political decision that rests with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, and an IDF official told me yesterday that for now that is not on the table, Julia.",

So there are really two pockets, two strongholds to use the words of the Israelis; Jabalya and Shejaiya that that are - that were the fighting remains where Hamas militants are holding out. And just today, we heard from the IDF that the death toll of Israeli soldiers has climbed to 104. At the same time, the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza says that some 18,000 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of this fighting on October 7.",

TheUkrainian president at this hour is courting lawmakers in America's corridors of power. Later, Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House. This is President Zelenskyy's third U.S. visit since the war began. Now think back to a year ago this month. Remember this? Well, that was when Ukraine's wartime leader received a standing ovation from both houses of Congress. This time around, he's meeting with senators trying to convince them that democracy as well as Ukraine hangs in the balance without new U.S. funding to help Kyiv fight Russia. And that money, of course remains stalled in Congress. And the Biden White House is warning that Moscow is also watching every move on Capitol Hill. Let's head to the White House now where Arlette Saenz joins us live. Arlette, what a difference just over a year makes in terms of reception. Fatigue, I think that with this war is something that he faces but perhaps the even bigger challenges his need for more aid is caught up in domestic politics and the challenges at the border wall.

So and convincing the American public, one could argue to Arlette, great to have you with us. Thank you. Arlette Saenz there at the White House. We'll see what the day brings. For now, the UN General Assembly is expected to vote later today on a draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. This comes as Israel's Defense Minister calls on Hamas fighters to surrender, claiming the last two Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza are now surrounded and Hamas battalions are on the 'verge of dismantling.' A senior Gaza health official also confirmed to CNN that Israel's military has a deep presence in Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp, where heavy fighting and dozens of casualties have been reported. For more on this, let's bring in Jeremy Diamond in Sderot for us. Jeremy, let's talk about the ground offensive. What progress - we were talking about earlier on in the show that despite the focus, having been now pushed more towards the south, it's still not yet in control fully in the north.

You have the city of Beit Hanoun right behind us. And just below that you have Jabalya refugee camp, which has really been one of the main points of the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli military saying that it is one of Hamas' last remaining strongholds in northern Gaza. That as well as the Shejaiya neighborhood in Gaza City. And so what we are witnessing is an attempt by the Israeli military to effectively finish off the fight in northern Gaza as they continue to push into Khan Yunis, the second largest city in Gaza, which is in the southern half of the Gaza Strip. Overnight, the Israeli military announcing that they had taken down a rocket launch post and a weapons factory in northern Gaza. But it is clear that the fight is not done yet. The Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, he, however, said that he believes that Hamas is 'near a breaking point in the northern Gaza Strip.' We have heard similar predictions from Israeli officials in the past though, so take those with a grain of salt, certainly, but there's no question that the fighting has been intense. We have been listening to - and you just heard that very loud explosion in the background. What we're also witnessing in addition to the bombardment is also that Israeli military troops are also detonating a lot of the tunnels that they are discovering. So not clear if that one was a bomb being dropped, or perhaps a detonation, which we have seen at times. We'll have cameraman Lauren (ph) zoom in on that plume of smoke that is emerging from where that explosion just happened. But beyond that, even as the fighting is happening in the north, we know that there is still very intense fighting in southern Gaza. We have watched as Israeli troops, armored vehicles and tanks have been moving into the southern city of Khan Yunis not only trying to dismantle Hamas, but also very much going after Hamas' leadership structure with a keen focus on Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in the Gaza Strip. Amid all of this, of course, the United States continuing to publicly back Israel, but also some warnings, including from the President of the United States just yesterday about the fact that Israel needs to be careful, especially as it relates to civilians.
