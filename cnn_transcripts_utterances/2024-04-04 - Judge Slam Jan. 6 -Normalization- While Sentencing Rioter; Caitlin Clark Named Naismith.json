He was sentencing a defiant rioter to more than seven years in prison and blasted him for downplaying the attack saying, \"We cannot condone the normalization of the January 6 Capitol riot.\" And the judge added that Americans must respect the results of elections.CNN's Marshall Cohen attended the sentencing hearing, and he's joining me right now here in the newsroom. So, what else are you hearing from this judge?",

      "sentences": "Wolf, it was a very serious warning from the judge, and it comes as former President Trump is putting the plight of the January 6 defendants at the front of his campaign. Remember he has promised to pardon the rioters. Trump has claimed that they are being treated unfairly. And he's also called them hostages, which they absolutely are not.So, this was a sentencing for a man named Taylor James Johnatakis. You just saw the footage of him using that metal barricade to overrun the police lines on January 6. And for those actions, he was sentenced to seven years. While handing down the sentence, this judge had a lot to say. I'll read a few quotes for you. It's from Royce Lamberth. He's a veteran jurist. He's put on the bench by Reagan. He's been around. He's seen a lot. He said that this can't be normalized. And he went on to warn of a vicious cycle that could imperil our institutions if there is more vigilantism, lawlessness, and anarchy, like we saw on January 6. Anytime that you don't like the results of an election, you can't do that, he said. And he was very explicit. He said that the January 6 riot was not civil disobedience. And he said there can be no room in our country for this sort of political violence. A very stark warning from this judge.",

In a filing this week, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, pointed out that there had been at least eight attempts to delay this trial. So far, all unsuccessful.The latest was the rejection of claims based on absolute immunity, the same issues that are being litigated at the United States Supreme Court in the Jack Smith D.C. case. But the judge found Trump brought that up too late. So, Trump's own delay victimized his delay attempt. This case is very likely going to trial with jury selection starting on April 15.",

It's Trump sharing the words of others.We'll see if the D.A. has raised an issue. Not everything that happens in court happens publicly. So, there may also have been private letter briefing about these conferences with the judge or other concerns. But if Trump keeps on this course, because of the risk and danger to the judge's daughter, any other individual targeted in this fashion, I do think you're going to see a court response as we've seen in other cases with the gag order.",

In the civil fraud trial where Judge Engoron sat, there was also a gag order, and Trump tested it and tested it. He pushed it. He was sanctioned. He was sanctioned over and over again. He had to pay a money fine. Finally, when he said that he had come to the very edge and the consequences were going to be even more severe, he stopped.In that case, it was attacking the judge's law clerk. Here, it's the judge's daughter. That's Trump's M.O. As I write about in my new book coming out next week trying Trump a guide to this first election interference criminal trial.",

The judge has made a inexplicable and troubling illegal hypothesis that she asked Jack Smith to respond to, saying that simply by Donald Trump -- asking, can Donald Trump, simply by taking classified documents, the definition of an official document, simply by removing them from the White House when he leaves, do they become personal documents? That's nonsensical.Jack Smith filed papers as the judge requested. She wanted his views saying that's nonsense. It's fundamentally unsound. And he did say politely but firmly, I will take you to the 11th circuit if you continue down this path. It's Judge Cannon who is in trouble here not Jack Smith. Donald Trump again, provocation, no legal basis for Smith to be sanctioned.",
