I mean, I think what is most sort of striking about this latest airstrikes, these latest airstrikes by Israel is that this was meant to be a humanitarian area, a safe zone for people inside Gaza where they had essentially been ordered to go to, to avoid combat zones and to avoid exactly this kind of military action. But not for the first time, the Israeli military has carried out strikes on these, on these areas which are filled with people, of course. They are a very crowded, the shelters are very fragile. We are talking about tents and makeshift shelters, and things like that.Back in August, there was something in the region of 90 people that were killed in an Israeli strike on exactly the same location when they said they were targeting Hamas militants. It's exactly the same explanation that's been offered by the Israeli Defense Forces, the Israeli military victory. This time, they say that they were kind of using a precise attacking strategy to target Hamas militants who were operating a Command and Control Center inside this humanitarian area. And Israeli military are condemning Hamas for choosing locations like this, in which to essentially hide and to use ordinary civilians as human shields. But they've also made it pretty clear that that won't stop the Israeli military from carrying out strikes with big weapons, very powerful bombs, like the kind that we used on this occasion, the if they -- if a target presents itself. And unfortunately, it's civilians in Gaza who are continuing to pay the price of that.",

With fewer than two months to Election Day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will face off on the debate stage tonight. Harris is still introducing herself to the American people, so this could be a defining moment. And in a razor-thin race according to the polls, persuading even a tiny sliver of the electorate to pick you could be all that it takes for either candidate to win. Here is what the two players are saying about what to expect tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He played through this really old and tired playbook, right? Where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how well he would go, and we should be prepared for that. And he tends to fight for himself, not for the American people. And I think that's going to come out during the debate. DONALD TRUMP, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Oh, they're waiting for the debate.

Yesterday, Amara, many of Donald Trump's senior advisers, including Jason Miller, but also some people we know who have been helping him prepare behind the scenes. That includes Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic Congresswoman, who actually faced off with Kamala Harris on the debate stage during the Democratic primary in 2020, and also a Republican Congressman, Matt Gaetz. They held a call yesterday to preview some of those attacks and look, I think it was all what we could expect. They talked about wanting to focus on her handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, of her policy record from when she was a Senator, but also some of the tie-breaking vote she cast as the president of the Senate in her role as VP, and also going after her on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.And a key theme that we heard throughout that call was really trying to tie Kamala Harris to Joe Biden and the policies of the Biden Administration. They were calling it the Harris-Biden Administration. Of course, she is vice president. She was not the president, but I do think you're going to hear him try to do that tonight, as well as here, Harris, try to distinguish herself from the current president (inaudible). When I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisers behind the scene, there's one thing, they argue that he's not doing formal preparation. They like to call it a more informal policy discussions. But I can tell you, Amara, of course, Donald Trump has been preparing behind the scenes. He's been meeting with his policy team, with his policy experts, with outside allies and of course, many of his top advisers to really hone his policy and his focus on a key number of issues -- immigration, economy, and crime. Those are all areas that we've talked about for several months now, where they think Donald Trump does better, not only personally in some of his rhetoric, but also in polling against the Democrats. But one thing I've heard consistently as well, is that a bigger concern of theirs is not necessarily how he talks about policy, but how his tone and temperament is. They say that that's even more important now with a candidate like Harris, one, given that she is more popular than Joe Biden was when he faced off with him in June during that CNN debate. But also given the optics of his attacks against her, particularly given she's a woman, we know Donald Trump can be very aggressive, be very personal in his attacks. They want him to stay away from that and really focus on the issues. So, I think we'll all be watching of whether or not Donald Trump can do that this evening. Amara?",

I want to read you a portion of what James Carville, a venerable Democratic strategist, said last week in an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\" about what kind of strategy Harris should employ.

She should let him talk over her, not just let him, but goad him into spouting insane conspiracy theories about the previous election. She should use her sense of humor at key moments to get under his skin and show he's not getting to her, and she should welcome the personal attacks as a badge of honor.

So that's why he's in a stronger position, but he can go too far. He can even Donald Trump can go too far and offend the tiny layer of, if there are any, undecided voters in this race and you don't want to do that. It's probably the only debate they'll have.",

They'll also enter the Van Allen belts. Those are two bands of trapped radiation particles that surround the earth like a doughnut. And if that weren't enough, they're also attempting to reach the highest orbit around earth by humans since 1966. That would be some 1,400 kilometers or 870 miles above earth.

But at the same time, I do know several of the folks -- the senior folks over at SpaceX, and I know they're very much dedicated to safety, so I have confidence that they have properly trained and taken care of -- managed the risks as much as possible.

And then two of them are going to go out and basically, kind of translate around on some handholds and evaluate the performance of the suit, get some spectacular views of the earth. But as far as objectives go, it is really to get outside, get a little bit of experience moving around, and then evaluating the performance of the suits.

Well, it certainly appears to have been a pretty large-scale drone attack that the Ukrainians launched last night and also, seems to fit into a pattern where the Ukrainian certainly are showcasing that they do now have larger, long-distance drone capabilities at their disposal. It was about eight days ago that they also launched an attack of similar size where the Russian said that large parts of their territory were targeted by those Ukrainian UAVs.And if we look at some of the regions that were targeted this time, the Russians are saying that it was nine areas in total, most of them are in the southwest of Russia, in the areas bordering Ukraine. But then of course, you also had a lot of drones being shot down in the Moscow region. And you mentioned that one person was killed on the ground in the Moscow region. That was in a place called Ramenskoye, which is a suburb of Moscow to the southeast of that city. And that area is right by one of the Moscow airports, it's called Zhukovsky Airport and a lot of people actually who live there know it as the Ramenskoye Airport. And it does appear as though possibly airports may have been one of the places that this drone attack wanted to disrupt. That one hit coming close to that airport. And you also mentioned three other airports in the Moscow region, and those are the airports that are sort of to the south and the southwest of Moscow. Those are the ones that had to shut down for several hours, whereas the one airport that's to the north of Moscow, Sheremetyevo appears to have not shut down as that attack was going on. In any case, the Russians are saying that they thwarted that attack, but it certainly seems as though the Ukrainians are making a point that they can also strike very deep into Russian territory with the assets that they already have, showing how far their drones can fly, even towards the Russian capital and beyond. And all this is coming as the Russians, Amara, have also increased their aerial campaign against targets inside Ukraine. In fact, late last night and early in the morning of this morning, there were pretty big drone attacks that also happened onto Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian saying that they detected some 46 of those Shahed head drones flying over Ukrainian territory. They were able to take down 38 of those. So obviously, this drone campaign going into both directions as the Russians really, over the past couple of weeks, have drastically increased their aerial campaign against Ukrainian cities, against Ukrainian critical infrastructure but, of course, against the Ukrainian forces as well, Amara.

She has injected hope into a party that thought it was doomed to lose this election. But all of her efforts so far, including the successful Democratic Convention have only pulled her into a tie with Donald Trump. In fact, if the election were held today, it's slightly more likely I think that Trump would win than Harris would win.That said, there are some voters, about a third of voters in some polls suggest that they want to learn more about Harris before making up their minds. So there's potentially more upside in this debate, I think for the vice president than for Trump because I don't think there can be many people in America and around the world who don't have some opinion of him. So from that sense, I think she has the chance to build a platform to go after those voters.

But, if they're saying she wants to use her prosecutorial skills, courtroom exchanges, and back-and-forth between lawyers all the time. Prosecutors speak to juries, not anybody else. So I think it's a little bit overblown.I think there was an extent to which the Harris campaign was trying to get into Trump's head to make him talk about microphones and arrangements to actually get him off his game, to stop him talking about the issues that could really hurt her in the run-up to the debate -- immigration, the economy, those kinds of issues where he has the advantage in the polls. To that end, the Harris campaign is running adverts on Fox News today which seemed to be specifically targeted at Trump, which feature former President Obama's speech at the convention, which was very critical about him, mocking about his crowd sizes.
