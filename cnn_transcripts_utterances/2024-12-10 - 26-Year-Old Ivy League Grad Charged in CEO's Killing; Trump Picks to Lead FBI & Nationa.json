New details, new images this morning of the suspect accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Twenty-six-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione arrested and charged with second degree murder after a day-long manhunt. Police captured Mangione at a Pennsylvania McDonald's yesterday, over 275 miles away from New York City. Police say an employee tipped them off, calling authorities after recognizing the suspect. When police approached him and asked him if he'd recently been to New York, police say he had a, quote, \"physical reaction.\" He was visibly nervous and began shaking. Police say that Mangione was carrying a backpack at the time of his arrest, and in that backpack, they found a black 3-D printed pistol with a loaded Glock magazine and a 3-D printed black silencer. As police official -- a police official also telling CNN he had a handwritten document that expressed I'll will toward corporate America. But Mangione himself, well, he comes from a wealthy Baltimore family that built a local business empire. He graduated from a prestigious all-boys school in 2016, where he was valedictorian.

Sir, thanks very much for being here this morning. I really appreciate it. Can we talk a little bit about what's going to come next in this investigation, but also this man himself?

Kasie, this is -- this is a day, I think, where New York City and the country, writ large, can breathe a collective sigh of relief.It took the New York City Police Department five days to catch this individual, and it's going to come down to two things. It came down to crowdsourcing, which we see the photos that were taken inside the hostel and inside of cabs. And the fact that, through the media, through networks like CNN, the law enforcement was able to -- to leverage that by crowdsourcing this and if you see something, say something. The second piece of this, I think, is the great detective work. Look, there is an abundance of physical evidence, whether it's probative evidence like latent fingerprints or DNA, this is going to be an air- shut case here. Now, you referenced the individual. You referenced Mr. Mangione, who is a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate. And Kasie, you've reported on and talked about you know, mass shootings around the country. I've done the same thing. The thing about that is these people, people like Mr. Mangione and like mass shooters, they are, in a sense, grievous collectors. And that's what we have here: somebody that was aggrieved or felt they were aggrieved by the healthcare system and decided to take matters into their own hands.",

Like, he's, you know, looked at cameras on Capitol Hill and talked in a way that, you know, other nominees are more deferential to senators.Seems aimed at Donald Trump more than anything else. But maybe it's working for him. ERIC-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, he has kept Donald Trump behind him, and that seems to be the most important thing here. There were a lot of people who, when he was first nominated, thought that this wouldn't go anywhere, not even because of the allegations, but because he didn't have the experience that most defense secretary nominees have. And he made sure to keep Trump in his corner. You saw that interview that Trump did with \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, where he was strongly behind Hegseth. If that remains where it is, what we have seen, I think, through this process of nominating the cabinet is Donald Trump making clear to Republicans in the Senate who he wants in the cabinet, and that he expects them to go along with his choices. And the only one of note that he's really backed off of is Matt Gaetz. And that was because Gaetz couldn't get anywhere. He is staying there with Hegseth, and that -- that's probably enough to get there. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It's also just an indicator of how much of a factor moving forward, as well, pressure from the president-elect and his allies, sort of MAGA world is going to be when it comes to congressional matters. You've also had ads that have been picked up and bought in a place like Joni Ernst's, you know, main district, as well, sort of pushing for this. So, there's also a pressure campaign going on right now, which isn't necessarily new with -- with some of these nominees, with some of these picks. But you are seeing once again just how much that is going to be an influence.",

Steve Bannon was floating, we're going to recruit Kari Lake to primary Joni Ernst. I mean, there was a really targeted campaign in Senator Ernst's backyard to make this politically unpalatable for her. So, you know, in some ways, we're seeing the manifestation of, you know, Trump's victory in November. People say elections have consequences.

And really, I think it takes three more. I think no one wants to be alone in being that deciding vote to sink one of the nominees.And this is not a Donald Trump thing. You go back all the way to the Clinton administration. I think there have been 70-something nominees for -- for cabinet choices, and only, like, two of them have had opposition in their own party.
