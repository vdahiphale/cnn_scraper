And tonight, we're getting answers, with a visual in-depth look, at some of the biggest concerns. We have simulations and first-hand accounts. Pete Muntean, CNN Transportation Correspondent, and certified pilot, even takes us up in a plane. And Captain \"Sully\" Sullenberger takes us inside a flight simulator. First, let's start with all of these near-collisions. We're seeing far too many close calls, on U.S. runways. Near-collision incidents have been reported, at multiple airports, just this year. The hard numbers though, they can be confusing. Over the last two decades, the number of what the FAA calls runway incursions, it has been climbing. But the really close calls have actually come down, from a high, in 2007. And here's one reason. The FAA's data, for these types of incursions, this year, it only goes through January. Yet, the rate that we're seeing this year is concerning. So, to understand what we're talking about, let's examine what they mean by near-miss. On one hand, there's the official aviation definition, of near-miss, but on the other, a near-miss is already way too close for comfort for anyone. Take what happened at New York's JFK Airport, in January. And American Airlines 777 was getting ready to depart for London. At the same time, a Delta 737 was getting ready, to take off, for the Dominican Republic. Now keep in mind this is JFK. There are four runways. On average, this airport handles more than a 1,000 flights every day. So, the American jet was on an active runway, meaning that takeoffs and landings were happening. But over here, the Delta jet is gearing up for takeoff, already going more than 100 miles an hour. That is when the Delta pilots hear this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. Ambassador, first to you, what is going on with these close calls? Just what do you think? CAPTAIN C.B. \"SULLY\" SULLENBERGER, FORMER U.S AMBASSADOR TO INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION: In every system that's complex, we're going to have ups and downs, in outcomes. I'm reminded that even though we've made aviation now ultra-safe, in the United States, we have not had a fatal airline crash, in the United States, over 14 years. But that does not mean that just because we haven't had a crash, we are not doing everything as we should. There are still improvements to be made. And we are way past the time, when we can define safety, solely as the absence of accidents. We have to do a lot more than that. We have to work harder than that, and look more closely at incidents.

But in all my years of flying, there was always this nagging, what can we do to stop this? And first, you ask, before you cross a runway, even though you may have been given the clearance. It's a free call. Make that free call. \"I just want to verify. Am I clear to cross runway?\" so and so. \"Yes, we gave you that clearance.\" \"OK, fine.\" And then, the CRM portion of it, the Cockpit Resource Management, to the co-pilot, \"Did you hear what I heard? Did you hear what I heard?\" if it's a three-man crew, or a two-man crew. That level has to be there. And I think it's there. That's part of the professionalism.

A lot of new people and a lot of old guard leaving the industry all at once. So, there's definitely sort of the complacency element that Sully talked about, and that others have talked about.
