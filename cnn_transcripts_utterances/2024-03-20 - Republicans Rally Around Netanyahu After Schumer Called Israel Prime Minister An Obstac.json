The fact that the Prime Minister will appear in just a few -- a few minutes virtually on Capitol Hill, he'll be speaking to a room, a closed door room of Republican senators only. And it comes at this tense time. This is only notably one week since Senator Schumer made that massive floor speech that caused an uproar in which he called for new elections. He criticized Prime Minister Netanyahu's handling of the threat of Hamas. And we saw an immediate and fierce backlash from many Republicans up here on Capitol Hill, offended by the speech, angered by the speech. Senator Barrasso, notably the person who invited the Prime Minister to speak today, he called that speech by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, deeply offensive to many Americans who are concerned what is happening in Israel. So again, he will be appearing virtually. We will see if there'll be a Q and A. So, every tidbit coming from that meeting, of course, we'll be gathering up here on Capitol Hill.

Of course, this border debate comes as Democrats and Republicans in Congresscontinue to fight over their efforts to boost border security. Joining us live now is Texas Republican Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne. Beth, thank you so much for being with us, Congresswoman. So, it is clear, I think you and I can both agree, that there is a crisis at the U.S. southern border. What is not clear is what exactly is the right solution. There are a lot of people who look at this and say that this goes against over a century of immigration policy in this country. That immigration border security is the purview of the federal government, of the Department of Homeland Security, not state and local officials, and that this could potentially open the way to different states trying to enforce their own border security. Just walk us through your thoughts on that, please. BETH VAN DUYNE, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Yeah, no, I agree. But I think we're in unprecedented times when you have seen the record number of people that are crossing our border illegally. When the federal government fails to act, states shouldn't have to suffer. And Article Four, Section Four of the Constitution clearly says that it's the responsibility, the duty, the obligation of the federal government to protect states from invasion. But then Article One, Section 10 also provides states an ability that if that doesn't happen, that states can actually have the sovereignty to be able to defend themselves from imminent danger and from invasion. So, I think what you're seeing right now happening in the courts is a fight between those two provisions. But the fact is, when I was working, when I was mayor and when I was sitting council in the city of Irving, we had a great partnership with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and we partnered together. And what we found was when laws were enforced, people of all nationalities, people within all of our neighborhoods benefited.",

I think what that did was it normalized the unprecedented number of peoplethat we have crossing our border illegally. It did not -- it did not create asylum claims being taken up at the border. It invited more folks into our country illegally without having the ability to be able to file them through, legally. What we were doing is sending them up to 5000, in some cases 8500 a day, 5000 to 5500 average a week. But that would normalize the unprecedented numbers that we have. That was not a solution. And by the way, that bill never even made it out of the Senate, so it was never even brought over to the House. But the House bill, H.R. Two, that we did send to the Senate, has the provisions in place that would have prevented a number of the deaths that we've seen, the invasion that we've seen. And it would not have forced Texas to have to spend five billion dollars last year of its own dollars on Operation Lone Star to be able to protect its citizens within its own state. It's ridiculous that we're having to do that. It's basically as if the Biden administration is working with the Mexican cartels instead of working to protect American citizens. And Texas should not have to suffer because the federal government fails to act.",

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who are actually here legally, and actually some U.S. citizens ended up being deported, as well. Given that history, given that everything is contextual, how concerned are you about the possibility here of racial profiling and also of the sort of brewing mistrust that SB4 could lead to between migrant communities in Texas, which, by the way, is 40 percent Latino and also state and local officials?",

It's not adding any additional measures otherthan the state being allowed to be able to enforce it, because the federal government is not. But as far as people being, you know, untrustworthy of it, the fact is, I was again, when I started at the local level in Irving, we had a great relationship with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. We actually deported more illegal criminal immigrants from our city per capita than any other city in the country. And as a result, we became the fifth safest city in the country. Crime, amazingly enough, when you actually enforce laws, decreases in all of your neighborhood's benefit. But what we heard from the New York Times --",

VAN DUYNE, Well, so what we heard and what we are threatened with from outside news agencies was that people were not going to want to move into our city, that people, especially Latinos, were not going to feel safe in our city. And the fact is, is that when you think about who is most preyed upon by criminal illegal aliens, it is other folks who are in our country illegally. Those are the people that it's most preyed upon. So, when you actually enforce your laws, they benefit, as well. And instead of our city having decreases in population, instead of businesses moving out of our city, what we found was we're one of the fastest growing cities in the country. People want to live in a safe environment. And they recognize what's happening at our border right now is increasing crime and is creating disastrous results. So, I think that's why you're seeing Biden's poll numbers drop. I think that's why you agree now that it is a crisis at the border. Finally, we have been saying this for the last three years. There are measures that could be taken, an H.R. 2, which was sent over by a House led by Republicans over to the Senate, could have that effect. But the Senate's not picking it up.",

But rising pricesfor everyday goods and services isn't just a U.S. problem. A worldwide surge in inflation began, as I'm sure we all can remember, back in the middle of 2021. It hit record levels one year later, driven, of course, by global factors. Since then, it has slowed sharply. But for many American families, the high cost of necessities is a lingering source of pain and worry as they remain somewhat pessimistic about their own financial situation. A new CNN poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans say things in the country are actually going well, although that's up seven percent since last fall. And to be sure, the U.S. economy has shown solid growth since 2020. The stock market is booming. Just yesterday, the S and P 500 hit a record high. Unemployment is low. Wages are up. And that recession that was predicted, as we just talked about, for so long, well, it never materialized. Well, time now for The Exchange and a look at the disconnect between public perception and the economic reality in the U.S. CNN Global Economic Analyst Rana Foroohar joins us now live from New York. So, Rana, on the one hand, we listed all of the positive signs in the U.S. economy. Yes, inflation was a global problem. And for sure, the U.S. has recovered far better than the rest of the world. Unemployment is near a record low. This is a President that has signed into law historic legislation addressing the economy. He's been touting it and yet his approval rating on his handling of the economy is in the mid 30s. I'm wondering, from your perspective, how do you account for that?

Those are the options they're giving them. CNN's Chief International Investigative Correspondent, Nima Elbagir, has this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Propaganda video from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF. For much of the last year, they have slashed and burned their way through the country. This video shows them triumphant and entrenched in the very heart of Sudan -- Al-Jazeera state. And they are recruiting local men in the hundreds. But it's impossible to tell who here is a willing soldier and who has been forcibly conscripted. Eyewitnesses have told CNN that RSF soldiers are giving civilians an ultimatum. Enlist or starve. Our investigation shows how almost 700 men and 65 children have been forcibly recruited to swell RSF ranks. And that's just what we've been able to verify in Al-Jazeera. Across Sudan, reports and images like this one are emerging. Children in RSF uniform. As across Sudan, millions forced from their homes by violence now face famine. CNN spoke to three dozen eyewitnesses, survivors and the families of victims. The RSF, they say, is weaponizing hunger, denying food to those who won't join. Aid groups say almost four million children in Sudan are already malnourished as the country faces mass starvation. If aid agencies can't get food to those in need, almost a quarter of a million children could die. Jazeera is Sudan's breadbasket. It's heartland. To control this part of Sudan is to exert control over who lives and who dies. The RSF deny they are responsible for the hunger gripping the country. Yet they control every aspect of farming this land. They control the warehouses of food and aid meant to support the most vulnerable. They control the seed supplies, fertilizer, pesticides, agricultural machinery and irrigation channels. And it's not just the infrastructure. Farmers are being targeted, brutalized, degraded and even killed. Not just to control food, but to force allegiance. You hear shots off camera as six of the men are executed, according to survivors who spoke to CNN. Those who were spared say the RSF threatened to starve their families if they didn't join. The RSF sit in the heart of Sudan, hoarding food for men for millions. From here, they can wait out, starve out Sudan's people and its army. Fear, uncertainty, despair cascade as the months of war drag on and the world looks away. Nima Elbagir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They came out with this report this morning, and it alleges that at least one worker tried to view the medical records of the Princess of Wales. As you say, she stayed in the London Clinic Hospital back in January for abdominal surgery, which you knew about. We knew that she stayed there for about 13 nights. Now, this is a hospital that treats a number of high-profile patients, including royals in the past, the Prince Philip and also the Princess Margaret, as well. And I think this will be very damaging for the reputation of the hospital if found true. Now, the ICO, which is the U.K.'s data watchdog, are investigating. They've received a breach report. They say, if true, this could be a criminal offense to access patient data in this way without permission. The hospital in question is, of course, very concerned about all these reports. So, they're looking into it, too. And actually, we had a statement from the CEO of the hospital saying, \"There is no place at our hospital for those who intentionally breached the trust of any of our patients or colleagues.\" And so, one would imagine that all sorts will happen if they discover who this individual was, if the breach did happen. But clearly, the intrigue around the Princess of Wales and the royals more generally has been, well, rife for the last few weeks. And it's taken quite an unpleasant turn at this stage.",
