      "sentences": "On 360, I'm sorry, an apology, from Harvard's president as anger and division over Israel's war against Hamas rages on US college campuses.Also, good news about the US economy, but why so many don't believe it. Elle Reeve is at West Monroe, Louisiana, to understand the disconnect. And a school shooter hears his sentence, an emotional day for the family of four Michigan high school students he gunned down two years ago. We start with breaking news. A short time ago, the united states vetoed a UN Security Council resolution, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, citing no mention in the resolution of the attack by Hamas. Thirteen countries voted in favor; the UK abstained. In Israel, that country's defense minister said he believes there are signs Hamas is, in his words, beginning to break inside Gaza. Today, an Israeli flag was seen raised in the middle of Palestine Square in the heart of Gaza City in the north. Alex Marquardt has more on the scale and intensity of the battle. Alex joins us now. So those comments from the defense minister, what evidence, if any, is there to support what he said?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, no doubt Israel has significantly degraded Hamas' capabilities. They have taken out several thousand of their fighters. They have killed several -- many, in fact -- of their mid and senior level commanders. They have seized a lot of their arsenal.But, Anderson, intense fighting remains, particularly, around the city of Khan Younis. That's where several of Hamas's top leaders are believed to be, including its most senior leader, Yahya Sinwar. Hamas continues to fire rockets. There are at least three barrages aimed at Tel Aviv today. The Iron Dome was deployed. So there is still a lot of concern about what Hamas can do. There's an expectation that this phase -- this high-intensity phase of the campaign is going to continue for at least a couple more weeks. Many, of course, asking, at what cost? Anderson, we have to warn our viewers that some of the images they are about to see are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (voice over): The fight in Gaza's second biggest city intensified. Israel's military claiming today to have killed dozens of Hamas militants in Khan Younis, in what it called tunnel-to-tunnel and house-to-house raids. Khan Younis is a main stronghold of Hamas, Israel believes, where top Hamas leaders may be. Strikes were carried out in Gaza on around 450 targets over the past day, Israel said on Friday, as the Hamas- controlled health ministry reported the death toll in Gaza had climbed to around 17,500. According to the World Health Organization, Khan Younis hospitals are now at the breaking point -- over double capacity. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) MARQUARDT (voice over): This father of a wounded boy says they were in a designated safe zone and the children were playing outside when a deadly strike happened. The health ministry added today that infectious diseases are ripping through the population -- some 300,000 cases of 15 different diseases, which CNN cannot verify. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) MARQUARDT (voice over): \"All this water is salty, it's dirty, it's got diseases in it,\" this woman says. \"We drink it. We wash with it. The children have gotten diarrhea from it.\" Gaza, a UN official said, is on the brink of full-blown collapse, the fighting forcing even greater waves of Palestinians toward the southernmost point of Gaza, where there isn't enough shelter, food, water, or fuel. Israel accused Hamas on Thursday of firing rockets from within humanitarian zones. And today, sirens blared over Tel Aviv twice to warn of incoming rocket fire. The booms of the Iron Dome intercepting the rockets echoing across the city. Hundreds of terror suspects have been arrested in Gaza, the IDF says. And they accuse the men in these photos of being members or suspected members of Hamas, stripped down to make sure they weren't carrying explosives. But one news organization said they spotted one of their journalists, and the relative of two other men told CNN his brother and cousin have no militant ties. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
