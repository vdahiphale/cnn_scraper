The Palestinian Red Crescent Society say there have been 150 trucks total since the truce began. Clare Sebastian is live for us now in London. Clare, good morning to you.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kasie, before this truce, there were only four hostages released. So there has been a lot more information coming out. Certainly this by all accounts, was not a comfortable experience. These hostages, lack of food, weight loss is a common theme. One of the families, the Munder family, a mother, a grandmother, a nine year old boy, they said that the mother and grandmother, according to relatives, lost some 68 kilos each. So, quite a bit of weight over seven weeks, they mostly had rice and bread, and sometimes just bread.The lack of food the elderly felt acutely. Hygiene and other problem, one elderly hostage, Adina Moshe, who's 72, her nephew said that she was not able to shower in seven weeks, and was kept underground. A separate issue, the lack of available medical supplies, lack of medication was a particular issue for Alma Avraham who was 85 who is now in Israel, in ICU, in a life-threatening condition, according to doctors. One of her family members said that they had hoped to get her thyroid medication to her while in captivity via the Red Cross, but we're not able to do so. That led to the conditions she is in now. So, look, in terms of physical recovery, it gives you a sense of why these hostages needed to be transported to hospital. Some have already been discharged, it is clear that there will be a rehabilitation period. And that's even before you start talking about mental recovery. Don't forget, they were in a situation, it seems, of information blackout. And in the case of two teenagers who were released on Saturday, that meant that they had no idea until they were released, that their mother had been killed on October 7th. So, that is the sort of mental trauma, in an extreme case, that they are going to have to deal with.",

How long does this go on? And this is where, I think the Israelis could change the entire narrative if they were to adopt a narrative of -- yes, we will do a two-state solution as soon as all the hostages are released. We will move towards a two-state solution. And we also -- we, Israel will crackdown on these illegal settlements and our own right wing extremists in the West Bank area.

It's allowed aid convoys to scale up delivery Gazans time to stock up on essentials and assess the devastation before Israel's planned assault on the enclave resumes. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Gaza City, they collect the dead, lying in the streets. They load them onto donkey carts. Hundreds, perhaps thousands more remain trapped under the rubble. The fate of so many is still unknown. We can't contact our relatives, says Reda Al-Jamal, we don't know who has died and who is still alive. According to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry, the death toll the day before the truce began reached nearly 15,000, two thirds of whom were women and children. A few days of relative calm have allowed people to emerge and see what this war has wrought, destruction on a scale Gaza, which has been through so much over the decades, as never seen before. According to the U.N., around 1,700,000 Gazans have been displaced, about 80 percent of the population. Many of those crammed into the south. The pause has allowed people to resupply, but so far it has only been a drop in the ocean, says the U.N., all the while, people are hoping, wishing today's calm will not be followed by the storm. We hope, says Abu Odal, the truce continues and holds permanently and the Israelis pull out of the north so that everyone who is forced to flee can return to their homes, even if they are in ruins, even if they have to live in tents. With winter's grip tightening, hundreds wait for a bag of flour from the U.N. More supplies are getting into Gaza, not enough. \"How many days is this bag of flour supposed to last us?\" asks Sabrin Al-Najar. One, two, three days? How many days before this war flares anew?

And then it becomes the soldiers as well, the serving IDF soldiers that they have in captivity. So, at what point do they start releasing them, and at what price?So, one would assume that, you know, if you look back at the release of Gilad Shalit, if you remember that story, 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were released in return for him. At the moment, we are talking about three Palestinian prisoners being released for each Israeli. I imagine Hamas would ask for more as they move on to the men, and on to the IDF soldiers. That's one thing that might change the dynamic a bit. Also, it does depend on Hamas. We've talked about this a bit, haven't we, Kasie, managed to get a hold of all of the hostages. And we know that some are being held by Islamic jihad. Those two groups seem to be working and coordinating well right now. I was speaking to an analyst in Israel earlier on, saying there are other's hostages being held by as he put it, families, other people may call them groups. These are hostages that he says, were taken in during this chaos on October the 7th. Other groups are the families, other individuals even taking hostages. They are with those hostages right now. And the analyst I was speaking to was saying that there is a price for returning the hostages to Hamas so they can become part of this truce agreement. So, there the complexities behind the scenes, and they really define whether or not Hamas is in a strong position to negotiate.",

Obviously not proven, but those allegations are starting to be made. There will be more fractures I think, within the international alliances for Israel. And that's a challenge for America because they are seen as the most closely aligned to Israel. So, perhaps Biden and his administration will become under pressure from countries in Europe, for example, and that does change the dynamic a bit, to put pressure on Israel.",

So, it's this lake effect snow, we are focusing in on it because it is so hazardous across very localized areas from Upstate New York, to parts of Pennsylvania, and into parts of Ohio. This is what it looked like in Hamburg, just outside of Buffalo City region.You can see multiple spin outs. There were car crashes, interstate 90 just piled up with snow. We are talking about wind of two inch snowfall, per hour. Even some reports of some lightning, or thunder snow as I should say. Erie County, Pennsylvania, low visibility because of the intense lake snow effect snow bands will. You've seen a foot of snow in some of these locations, and the radar shows these narrow bands of snow that continue to impact Cleveland, just south of Buffalo. This is interesting, there's Erie, Pennsylvania. These snow bands really are only a couple of miles wide, so you go to the south and you've got, well, let's clear skies overhead. So, very localized, but nonetheless, there are still about 3 million people under the lake effect warning, down wind from Lake Ontario and Lake Erie as well. So, as the cold air that is surging across the northeast moves over the relatively warm lake waters, it draws the air into the atmosphere, cools, condenses and ultimately creates the snow. The point that I'm getting to, once the cold air goes away, like it's forecast to do, we turn the lake effect snow taps off, and this will come to an end by this time tomorrow. So, that's the good news. Here's a quick look at your temperatures, for you, Kasie, 40 degrees in D.C.",
