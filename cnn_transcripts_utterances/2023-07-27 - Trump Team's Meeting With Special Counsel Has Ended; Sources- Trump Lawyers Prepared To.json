      "sentences": "Well, Dana. There is a lot of activity happening today. This meeting that there was a question of whether something like this would happen after Donald Trump received that target letter informing him and his lawyers that he was very likely to be indicted, related to the 2020 election and his behavior leading up to an on January 6.And so, this is the sort of meeting that would often be an opportunity for the defense counsel before an indictment would be presented to a grand jury. And so, we don't have a full readout, at least here at the courthouse get of exactly what's going to emerge there to affect what's going on here. But we have seen activity here too, Dana, at the courthouse. Prosecutors have been arriving throughout the morning. From the special counsel's office, we've counted at least four. That's a fairly large amount of prosecutors to come over here to be working with the grand jury. And the grand jury, they have not been in on their regular day on Tuesday after hearing from several witnesses, last week in this investigation after months and months of taking in testimony and evidence. And now, the grand jury convened this morning, pretty sharply around nine. And then they took a very early lunch break, and we're apparently waiting through the lunch hour that around 11 and now they've reconvened. And so, we just need to wait and see what happens. But there's a lot of a typical patterns that are arising today over here at the federal courthouse and also clearly with the special counsel's team. And so now, it is just a matter of time waiting to see exactly what happens next and what happened at that meeting as well between the special counsel's office and Donald Trump's defense lawyers. BASH: Thank you so much for that reporting, Katelyn. And we have other members of our incredible legal team here at the table. We have former assistant U.S. attorney and senior CNN legal analyst, Elie Honig. He's actually in New York. But we have here CNN's Paula Reid, CNN's Laura Coates, and he is also a former federal prosecutor and CNN's Evan Perez. Evan, in addition to what Katelyn was just reporting about what happened in that meeting, you're getting additional information.",

They were not told that there is going to be an indictment.So, the feeling certainly from the Trump team was at this meeting, likely changed nothing. And so, they went in, obviously, with a couple of expectations, or at least some, some hopes, they were hoping that, you know, they might persuade the special counsel to consider a few more things before making a final decision, perhaps delay an indictment from today, perhaps maybe by the former president a few more weeks. Of course, as you know, his strategy, both legal and political has been delay, delay, delay. It's worked for him in the past. And so, certainly, if you were to delay this a few more weeks, certainly puts the justice department in this sort of uncomfortable position, right, where they're trying to prosecute the former president, you know, as the Republican primary is really getting into full swing. We have a debate coming up, certainly within the next month. We know, certainly that if you do an indictment, now we're talking about a trial, you can try to delay that as much as you can. And then you're putting, you know, the justice department in a position where they're prosecuting former president, sorry, President Biden's chief rival at the same time that voters are having their say.",

      "sentences": "Evan makes a good point. Look, it appears right now the former president is likely to be indicted. We know that because he has received a target letter. He has also received an invitation, which he declined to go before the grand jury. And now his attorneys are having meeting with the special counsel.Oh, the other people who've been under scrutiny in this case, you know, at that level, people like Rudy Giuliani, they're not seeing those same kinds of invitations. And what we will have to do is wait for any possible charges to see how complicated this case is. We know that the Trump team has suggested there were at least three statutes in that letter, because that will impact how well they're going to be able to execute the strategy of delay, delay, delay. [12:05:00] The Mar-a-Lago documents case is complicated and that it involves classified materials. But so far, the potential charges we've seen it's possible that they might be able to do this before the 2024 election. So, it could, depending on what the possible charges are, be harder to implement this strategy. So, we'll be watching. LAURA COATES, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR &amp; CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, it's funny I have on my desk, people who love meetings, never been in-charged with anything and I stand through that. Prosecutors don't like meetings. Meetings are in the form of testimony. Meetings are not in the civil litigation world the same as they would be in a criminal prosecution. In the civil world, you have two parties trying to negotiate to common ground, trying to have their goals met. They're enticed by the thought of having conversations because you can maybe massage the contours of the agreement, you can decide what the penalty will be. It'll be monetary and criminal prosecution. How do you convince prosecutors who have evidence before them. Given to the grand jury subpoena power, who've asked her grand jury potentially to return an indictment. That's not really the same meeting we have in the so-called business world. And so, the idea of a delay tactic of counsel who might be more accustomed to civil litigation world, really seems to be part of this. But if you're Jack Smith, if you're the prosecutors in this case, who are not beholden to a monetary penalty in the long run, but instead, the views of a grand jury, you don't have to give them an opportunity to try to convince you otherwise. The evidence ought to speak for itself.",

They're typically seen as sort of a last gasp effort to try to either slow down and indictment or convince prosecutors not to bring it at all. What's really telling to me though, is the timing here because ordinarily, as a prosecutor, if you get a call from a defense lawyer on, let's say, a Thursday saying we'd like to come in for one of these meetings. Your responses, sure, you want to come in what tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday. The fact that they've already done this meeting, and it's 12:06 pm today, tells me that these prosecutors feel like they are on a very short timeframe and that the next action here is imminent.",

I'm hearing from a number of sources who say, they're still unclear that the team was not given any notification that they were getting an indictment that Trump would be indicted, or that he wouldn't be indicted. And right now, they are just continuing business as usual. Trump himself has several campaign events. They are focusing on that they say there is absolutely no changes to anything Trump is doing in terms of this third presidential bid. He'll be in Iowa tomorrow. If this indictment comes down, or if it doesn't, he'll also be in Pennsylvania on Saturday.

But take us inside the conversations that could be happening right now. HONIGThe other thing that you need to start thinking about and our reporters there at the table have talked about this is potential logistics, because you have to think about, if we walk out of this grand jury room with a signed indictment, the first thing you're going to do is file it under seal with the judge, meaning only the judge and you prosecutors can see it. At what point do we send it over to Donald Trump's team? At what time -- at what point, do we unseal it and make it available to the American public? If you remember the Mar-a-Lago indictment back in June, there was a 24 hour or so lad, when Donald Trump's team knew they were indicted. We knew there was an indictment, but it remained sealed. And then the next day, Jack Smith held the press conference and unsealed that indictment. Then a couple days after that was the arraignment that Evan is talking about. If I'm Jack Smith, I want all of this happening simultaneously. If I had a time in mind, four o'clock, I'm making that up. I would say, press conference at four o'clock. I would send it over email and over to Donald Trump's team at four o'clock and I would unseal it at four o'clock, put everyone on equal footing.",

What we know so far, federal prosecutors did not give the Trump team a heads-up about when an indictment might come down.I want to get straight back to CNN's Kristen Holmes. So, Kristen, what are you hearing from the Trump team, both on the legal and political side? HOLMES: Yes. So, what I'm hearing from both of these advisers, as well as these lawyers is that this meeting was about an hour long that Jack Smith was there. And I am told that it was called to answer some kinds of questions that the legal team wanted to pose a to the special counsel's office. Now I'm not sure exactly what those questions were that hadn't been made clear to me just yet. But we should keep in mind that they were never told in this meeting, whether or not they were going to be indicted. They weren't given any kind of indication and a notification that an indictment was coming. Now, the team does expect an indictment to come down. Of course, as we've been reporting, Trump received this target letter. He's expecting to be indicted as part of why they scheduled this meeting in the first place. But we are still do not have any indication from the team. What they are doing right now is kind of sitting and waiting back, trying to read those tea leaves, trying to get an understanding if this is in fact coming imminently, but they do believe that an indictment is likely to come in this case.

On the other hand, it could make them say, well, they're itching now for accountability, having not had the results of the impeachment in removal of the presidency. And so, if you're a prosecutor, looking at these cases, you are understanding, of course, that you have a very informed and educated jury about a track record of this person, about sort of the legal baggage that others would not necessarily have. But you're also concerned about how you're going to find a jury pool that will be able to be distinct from the court of public opinion and be able to cross that threshold of saying and not only serving but being judged as truly these objective arbiters of the truth. And that's a very difficult hurdle right now. CHALIAN: There's no -- yes, sorry. The idea of objective arbiters of the truth, it doesn't exist in American politics anymore. It just it doesn't exist.
