The mood music, I think, probably changed yesterday.Brett McGurk, President Biden's National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East, was in Cairo yesterday. And we heard yesterday as well that is Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of -- one of the political leaders of Hamas, was also in Cairo. There's absolutely no indication that the pair met. But the fact that Hamas had sent a representative back to Cairo, because the Egyptians have been an intermediary, seem to indicate that Hamas was beginning to come round to perhaps some of the pressure that is Israel has been putting on it. To give in more to Israel's terms of what a temporary ceasefire might look like and what hostages might be released as part of that deal. So that was one indicator. And then today, Brett McGurk was meeting both with the defense minister and with the prime minister. The other indicator that came yesterday, I think, was from a member of the war cabinet here, Benny Gantz, saying that he was just a little bit more optimistic that there was an indication that perhaps things -- perhaps things can happen. And then the defense minister today, after that meeting were Brett McGurk, saying that he thought that the negotiators could be more engaged or more empowered or -- or do more at the next meeting. These are -- these are words, if you will. This is not the ground shifting and a seismic jump to a positive conclusion here. But it does seem to indicate, from where we were a few days ago, which was an impasse, which was really this threat of ground forces will go in if there's no hostages handed over, go into Rafah if no hostages are handed over by Ramadan. Of course, the defense ministers still saying we're preparing for the talks where -- for the torques to progress. But at the same time, we're also preparing for the IDF to go into Rafah if necessary.",

During this proceeding, during this trial, the judge really homed in on the actual language of the Crown Act. Now that is the state law that prohibits hair discrimination. And I want to give you a few examples because it'll tell you -- give you a sense of what happened inside. While one of the witnesses was testifying -- and this is a witness who's also the co-author of the Crown Act, State Representative Ron Reynolds. He was asked by the judge, does the act actually say length? Does it talk about the length of the hair? And he said, no. And then while there was cross-examination, the plaintiffs asked Reynolds if it was possible to wear locs and still be in compliance of the school policy, and his response was, it's possible, but it's not likely. And the judge came back to that specific exchange and asked him later, the judge said, quote, \"You said earlier that it might be impractical, but that you could still do to it, that you could still be in compliance. Reynolds said, I said, \"likely.\" The judge replied, \"but possible.\" Now, later in the preceding, Representative Reynolds went back and said, quote, \"It's impossible to be compliant with the policy and wear that hairstyle. Now, Darryl George, the 18-year-old, who has been suspended for months now because of this whole policy, his attorney argued in court that this policy is unconstitutional on the basis of race and gender.

The Biden's have this German Shepherd. They had another one, Major, who also left the White House. What would you recommend in this situation? BRANDON MCMILLAN, HOST, \"LUCKY DOG\" &amp; AUTHOR: Well, I mean, you have to understand, German Shepherds historically were bred to be one of the best working dogs on the planet. You're talking about an animal that it's mind and body is built solely for work. So when you put the dog in a situation, but it's not working, it's probably going to have behavioral issues.

You always pair the dog with his family according to their lifestyle and what the dog's personality is.In this case, it sounds like it was the wrong situation for the dog because, again, this is a working dog and it was not given a job every day. They tried to put a working dog into a family style, like a pet environment. it's not going to work. If they -- the White House, it's chaotic. There's hundreds of people there all day long. There's no -- there's no consistency. There's no structure. It's the wrong place for a dog like this. And the proof is in the pudding when you have 24 incidences. We have 24 bites. That right there says at all. To put that -- to put this in perspective, any other dog in the country that bit 24 times, they would have been euthanized after the first two bites. This dog was lucky it was owned by the president of United States because that's why it's not euthanized right now. So to Biden's credit, yes, they did the right thing. They re-homed the dog. But the reality is, this dog was in the wrong environment from the get-go, the White House. I mean, everybody wants to have a dog, of course, but it is a chaotic environment and most dogs do not -- are not built that sort of environment.",

We said, now we're going to go to work for eight hours a day, sit there, be quiet and don't move for eight hours. It goes against the laws of nature, what the animal was originally bred for. This dog was not bred to be a pet. It was not bred to sit there in an environment obediently for eight hours a day. It was bred to work. There are two lines of a German Shepherd, OK? There are the working line and the companion line. The working line is what you see the military and police have. The companion line is what typically we have as pets. If I had to guess -- I haven't met this dog. But if I had to guess, this was not a companion line.
