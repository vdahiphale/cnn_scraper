It comes after the Justice department and Trump attorneys spent more than two hours in front of the Supreme Court earlier today. A different legal team for Trump, off course. There they argued whether Trump or any former president could be prosecuted for actions they took while in office. Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Wolf, as the jury gets ready to come back from its lunch break, let's catch up on some important things that happened this morning. First of all, prosecutors are taking the jury through David Pecker, really deep inside this world of catch and kill. And prosecutors are using David Pecker to really tell a three-chapter story. On Tuesday, they told the story of Dino Sajudin, a doorman who claimed he had a story, turned out to be false, about Donald Trump having a child out of wedlock. He was paid for his story, which was then killed, never ran. Today, the primary gist of the testimony has focused on Karen McDougal, who alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump. That's the gist of what David Pecker was talking about. So let's go into that for a moment. So Pecker testified he was asked about why Karen McDougal's story was bought and then killed.Here's the testimony, Steinblast asked whether the reason was so that McDougal's story, her allegation of an affair, did not influence the 2016 election against Donald Trump. David Pecker said Yes, it was. Later, David Pecker testified, We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign. Prosecutors are going to say, look, the motive was campaign. Donald Trump's team is going to say, well, there was also a personal motive here for Donald Trump. So look for that on cross-examination. Now, eventually, they enter into a contract with Karen McDougal. AMI. David Pecker enters into a contract that Donald Trump himself was not part of. And David Pecker said the purpose of that agreement was to disguise the true nature of the contract. They didn't want the public learning about Karen McDougal's allegations. Now that brings us to sort of between chapter two and chapter three. The big thing that happens is the access Hollywood tape came out. No, the jury's not seeing that tape, but they've learned about it. This is where Donald Trump gets caught on camera talking about you can grab them by the blank, etc. We remember that tape. And Pecker said when that tape came out quote It was very embarrassing, very damaging again to the campaign. Important point for the prosecution here. And then where David Pecker's testimony left off, he was starting to talk about Stormy Daniels. Stormy Daniels comes forward. She alleges that she had this sexual dalliance with Donald Trump. They're worried about it and David Pecker decides, we've had enough. He says, I am not paying for this story. I, meaning the National Enquirer, I am not paying for this story. I didn't want to be involved in this from the beginning. I'm not doing it. So where we leave off in the testimony is AMI and David Pecker are about to hand off the Stormy Daniels mess to Michael Cohen and to Donald Trump and their team. And that's where we're going to pick up this afternoon, Wolf, as we sort of head into chapter three of our three-chapter story that prosecutors are trying to tell the jury.",

      "sentences": "And that National Enquirer, sorry, the Access Hollywood tape, that cannot be shown to the jurors. But there was a lot of detail that Pecker did go into about that tape. And then following up with the fact that he said one of his magazine websites, Radar Online, had a article that was posted that was titled Playboy Man, essentially about Trump and immediately how they worked with Michael Cohen to kill that story online as well. So really, it's quite interesting to listen to David Pecker go into all the inner workings of exactly how this catch and kill scheme worked for all those three cases that Ellie laid out for you right there.And I've got to tell you, it was surprising. It was surprising to see Donald Trump sort of sitting in his chair and really just keeping his eyes closed, sometimes moving his head to the side or leaning in to listen, but just keeping his eyes closed, almost as if he was like trying to take it all in at word for word, but not really reacting. And we all kind of looked to see if he would react, of course, to that National, I'm sorry, that Access Hollywood tape description, since that was such a pivotal moment prior to his campaign. Really, the only time that he even gave a smirk was when they were talking about sort of this inner conversation. After he became president-elect at Trump Tower, when Trump made the comment about David Pecker, who was meeting a bunch of his advisors, that David Pecker knew a lot of stories about him. Pecker said no one really laughed in that room, but Trump did smirk at that comment. Listen, he has been on the stand for a total of five hours from Tuesday, rather, into today. And as you heard from Ellie, he's gotten into those two major stories, but not quite yet into the Stormy Daniels story, which is at the heart of this case. And so certainly, we do expect that to happen when it gets picked back up after lunch. BURNETT: All right. Brynn Gingras, thank you very much. Of course, Brynn will be there. Kara Scannell, Phil Mattingly here with me. So, Kara, when she says five hours so far for David Pecker, and I know you anticipate another few hours, so it may be that that does not actually finish until tomorrow morning for the direct.",

And it's interesting that Kara and I think were trying to psychologically figure this out during one of the commercial breaks is, you know, is this because they've got decades of a relationship with the prosecution kind of laid out in detail point by point. Is it because of kind of where they come from in the same running in the same circles over the course of those decades? I don't actually know. I think what's interesting is when you look at what he said about potential witnesses or what he said about the judge or the jury, it's gotten him into some trouble. And I think we're still waiting.And we were wondering if it's going to come this morning, if Judge Mersham would make a decision on whether or not their gag order violations and if there were, what he would actually have to do, would he have to pay money? So the former president was asked about this morning when he did a small gaggle with reporters. But when it comes to David Pecker, who, again, has been testimony testifying for hours over the course of several days and certainly hasn't made the former president look good, given the details he's been able to give into a very seedy world I don't think most normal people know about.

Think back to that trial. He stormed out, he was muttering, he was going back and forth, and while he's got 14 specific issues prosecutors are saying he has with this gag order, he's been very, very different inside this trial.
