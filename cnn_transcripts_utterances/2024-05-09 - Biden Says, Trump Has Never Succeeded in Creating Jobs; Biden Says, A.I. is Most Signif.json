How do you think it plays politically?",

      "sentences": "I think it plays poorly for President Biden. You know, if you look at polling recently, more Americans still believe that Israel is right to respond to the horrific attacks of October 7th. They're actually opposing many of the demonstrations they're seeing on college campuses throughout this country. And not only that, it's not just bad politics, it's bad policy.You know, I served in the State Department. We've seen what happens when you hamstring our allies as they need to respond in these critical times. And, by the way, the worst way to run any sort of conflict is from a capital thousands of miles away dictated by politicians. These decisions are best made by those who are actually in the field, those who actually have the military assessments and capabilities in the field to make those decisions. And at times like this, it's a president's responsibility to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies and their leadership, not try to hamstring them as they try to respond to one of the most brutal attacks that they've ever seen. And that's what I think Speaker Johnson was expressing frustration about and was really speaking for the majority of Americans when he did so.",

You've got Israeli domestic politics, which are driving Bibi Netanyahu's decisions in as much as they're being driven by military considerations.You've got our allies who are trying to negotiate, our allies in the Middle East, who are trying to negotiate a ceasefire with a terrorist government in Hamas. You've got our allies in Western Europe who are increasingly disturbed by the way that Israel is prosecuting its war in Gaza. And so, you know, it's very easy to say we should just give Bibi Netanyahu everything he wants, but there are considerations in both capitals, both in Jerusalem and in Washington, domestically about what that means. And that's something the president has to weigh.",
