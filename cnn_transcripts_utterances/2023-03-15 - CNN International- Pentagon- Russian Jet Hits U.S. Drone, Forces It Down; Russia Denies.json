The latest on the Black Sea incident.Also ahead, shares in Credit Suisse crashed a record low, as worries about the Swiss lender grow. More details on that. And a standoff outside Imran Khan's residence in Lahore, as crowds prevent police from arresting the former prime minister over corruption charges. The Kremlin wants relations with the U.S. are at their lowest level and in a deplorable state following a dramatic instance over the Black Sea. The Pentagon is accusing a Russian fighter jet of hitting an American spy drone's propeller, forcing it to crash into international waters on Tuesday. It's the first known direct physical confrontation between Moscow and Washington since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago. And any moment now, the Ukraine contact group is set to meet at the Pentagon. The U.S. says it's a sensitive situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR: It could lead to miscalculations between, you know, two militaries that are operating not obviously in Ukraine together but certainly in proximity in the region. And we don't want to see this war escalate beyond what it already has done to the Ukrainian people. And so this is clearly, this was inappropriate, unsafe, unprofessional conduct by the Russian pilots. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTERWhat the pilots actually did was they moved very, very close to the drone and they actually began dumping fuel on it before moving around to the back of the drone and actually hitting the propeller, that in turn forced the U.S. military to take the drone down over international waters because it was essentially not able to operate anymore. Now, the White House and the Pentagon are issuing very, very sharp statements this morning saying that this kind of behavior is unacceptable. And we're learning that the White House now is saying that they may never be able to recover the drone. John Kirby, the NSC spokesperson, saying just a short time ago, that the wall they are assessing whether or not that would be feasible, the waters of the Black Sea are very deep, and it's just unclear at this point whether they will actually be able to recover the device. However, they are taking steps according to Kirby to minimize the potential intelligence collection that Russia could glean from potentially seizing that drone themselves. He said that they are taking steps to protect the United States' equity. But look, this is just an unprecedented situation over the course of the war. Two Russian -- a Russian and American aircraft coming into direct contact with one another at a very sensitive moment, when the risk for escalation, potential miscalculation is very high. And we should note that there was no communication between the Russians and the Americans while this confrontation actually took place raising even more questions about whether the lines of communication are effectively open to avoid this kind of confrontation and potential escalation in the future, Max.",

Credit Suisse, as of yesterday, the bank disclosed that it had found, quote, material weaknesses in its financial reporting, it might have to restate financial results.Today, in an interview with Bloomberg, its biggest backer, the Saudi National Bank said it was basically closing its checkbook and won't be putting any more money into the company. That led the share price essentially to fall off a cliff dragging down with it much of the European banking sector. Now this is a bank that has had a lot of concerns around it for some time. It's in the midst of a turnaround. It's been cutting jobs, all kinds of things. You can see there the numbers are pretty stark. And obviously, these are two separate issues, right, with Silicon Valley Bank too. Idiosyncratic issues, Credit Suisse has its own problems. But this is, of course, an interconnected international banking system, Max. Secondly, all of these issues seem to involve some element of internal mismanagement. So that's going to invite scrutiny of other banks. And as we've been discussing, all of these banks are facing the same macro issue, which is this climate of rising interest rates. And now after Silicon Valley Bank renewed scrutiny on how well they've prepared their balance sheets to weather this, that situation could of course get even more difficult in the coming days. We have the ECB set to potentially announce another rate rise tomorrow. The Fed could do the same next week. There's new U.S. data out this hour. So that will be closely scrutinized as well, Max, but a lot of concerns around the banking sector this morning.",

The reason why these arrest warrants are out for him is because he has repeatedly not made any appearances in court ever since those different cases were filed against him since August of last year.Now, Khan said that the reason why the government, according to him, is attempting to arrest him is because they want to incite violence. They want to incite violence amongst his protesters and then put him away and make sure that those elections don't happen. Now, Khan did say that -- I did continuously ask him if he -- why does he need to stop this and go out and just give himself up? And he refused to answer that really. He said that it's beyond the courts. He spoke about police brutality against his supporters. He also spoke about a conspiracy against him in which the government and the military have colluded to get rid of him from power, to get rid of him from the political arena. The Pakistani Information Minister has been making rounds on television and refuting Khan's claims. She said that the arrest warrants have not been put out by the government. They've actually been put out by the courts that Khan really must respect the rule of law. The foreign minister appeared on television earlier today and said that the only thing stopping Khan from a bearing in court is his ego. Khan's lawyers have made the case that ever since there was an assassination attempt against Khan in November last year, so it's not safe for Khan to appear in court. And he's willing to come up there via video link. So the electricity was shot early morning at around four in the morning at Khan's residence. The internet in that area of Zaman Park, a posh neighborhood in the city of Lahore. There is no internet, that jam is everywhere in that area. There is an ongoing situation. It has -- there is a bit of a lull at the moment. So we're waiting to see what the courts decide as an appealing. And we're just going to have to wait and see whether Khan will be behind bars by the end of the day. Max?",

The U.S. military saying that a Russian fighter jet forced down a U.S. Air Force drone on Tuesday in this area after damaging the propeller of the American MQ-9 Reaper. Russia denies it, though, saying their jets were scrambled to, quote, identify the intruder.Adding that the drone went into unguided flights and lost altitude. The Russian ambassador to the U.S. also saying U.S. aircraft have no business being near the Russian border. Chief U.S. Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto joins me now. I mean, the details of this are almost academic to some extent, aren't they, because it wasn't a big incident, but it's very telling. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: No question. Listen, we're more than a year into the largest war in Europe since World War II, with Russia on one side having invaded Ukraine and the U.S. and its allies backing Ukraine in its defense. And both those countries, the U.S. and Russia and their allies, naturally, have taken great pains to avoid a direct conflict between U.S. and Russian or NATO and Russian assets in the region. And there are lots of them flying around there providing intelligence, et cetera. They've avoided it until this point, and now they've come into direct conflict. It's the U.S. position that Russian -- this Russian jet deliberately buzzed the drone, circled it, dumped fuel on it, clipped it, and that's what brought it down. And that is quite a superpower confrontation. And remember, it's not the first time this has happened. Early last month, you had the U.S. shooting down a Chinese surveillance balloon over the U.S. And these are incidents ripe with the potential for escalation.",

China has an enormous number of aircraft flying around U.S. territory, as does Russia. And the U.S. and Russia have an enormous amount of surveillance aircraft flying around Europe, Northern Europe, as well as the area of Ukraine war.And this provides multiple opportunities every day for potential interactions. And perhaps, even as we've seen here, violent interactions to date, both of the aircraft taken down, this one over the Black Sea and of course, that Chinese surveillance balloon. Thankfully, they're unmanned, uncrewed aircraft. Thing is you have a lot of crewed aircraft flying in similar airspace that get buzzed, that gets challenged in the air. The concern is that if you have a violent interaction between those aircraft, the potential for escalation is greater. So you have a very tense time between these powers. And it's -- if it was not intentional, it at least a situation where we have the circumstances around the world for more interactions like this going forward, and there's a great deal of nervousness.",
