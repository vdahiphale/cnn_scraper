And then, in Michigan, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon, clashing there in their debate over a referendum that would amend the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI), MICHIGAN GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: Proposal 3 is absolutely necessary to preserve the rights we've had for 49 years under Roe v. Wade. Now, the other side will say all sorts of wild-eyed things that are not true. Parental rights and consent will still be effective. TUDOR DIXON (R), MICHIGAN GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: The governor has just been dishonest in the very first answer. We know that Proposal 3 does remove parental consent. It also makes it so that you don't have to be a doctor to perform an abortion. So when Governor Whitmer tells you that this is going to be Roe, it's not even close to Roe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, even before the stroke, Oz was so much more polished on television because of his decade -- his, yes, two decades on TV. But then, particularly in the wake of the stroke, do you think it was -- it was the right move to have him debate Oz? AL SCHMIDT, CEO, COMMITTEE OF 70: I think it was really to his credit that he debated. As we've seen in our commonwealth, with our, for example, Republican candidate for governor refusing to debate and any number of candidates, Democratic and Republican, refusing to engage in debates.

So the offer the U.S. put on the table that apparently was set before the Russians in June of this year was to swap Viktor Bout, who is that convicted arms smuggler, prolific arms smuggler, known as the Merchant of Death, who is about halfway through a 25-year sentence in the U.S. that he would be swapped for those two American citizens, right, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.[06:25:09] The Russians clearly did not see that as a big enough offer. It was understood, CNN reported in the end of July, that through a back channel, Russia had asked to add to the deal a convicted murderer who's serving a life sentence in Germany. The U.S. sort of hit back again, saying that was not good faith negotiation. And since then, we haven't heard of any other further names on the list, of any other sort of elements to this negotiation. So it seems that, while discussions are ongoing, there hasn't been any key elements of progress, at least to our knowledge at this stage.",

Now this morning, Russian officials continue to push claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb, which is an explosive device that is laden with radioactive material. Now, these claims have been rejected by Ukrainian and Western allies. It does reflect an increasingly urgent concern that Russia may be searching for a pretext to unleash a dirty weapon of its own. Now, this is prompting President Joe Biden to issue this stern warning to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the last time we spoke was after President Biden's comments about Armageddon. Here we are with another Biden warning, not just talking about tactical nuclear weapons but talking about the prospect of a dirty bomb. Both Ukrainian and Russian sides have been talking about this. So is there a belief among U.S. officials that the likelihood of some kind of nuclear device, whether it's a tactical nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb that has some nuclear material, is more likely?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, it seems like we're on this escalation ladder, and that's the really worrisome thing. If it seems a little bit confusing, it's because people are talking about a lot of different elements of this. So the dirty bomb, as you suggested before, isn't a nuclear weapon. Itdoesn't go off with a nuclear weapons force. It's basically a conventional explosive that's wrapped in hospital waste or a -- waste from an energy plant of some kind. Something that is radioactive and could make blocks or part of a city uninhabitable for some period of time. But it was interesting. The president was asked about a dirty bomb, and the question he answered was about a tactical nuclear weapon. That's where their brains are. It's keeping Putin from breaking the nuclear taboo and actually using a nuclear weapon, even a small one, for the first time since 1945 in a conflict.",

I think there's a bit of a debate on here about what the right response is.This isn't like the old cold war days where, you know, Russia threatens New York, and the United States threatens Moscow. Nobody is talking about using a nuclear weapon in response to a nuclear weapon. But you also can't let the detonation of a nuclear weapon go unresponded to. So you've heard the president say there will be very severe consequences. There are some who believe that needs to be a military response, maybe by the Ukrainians, conventional; maybe against the locations where this was launched from, but something against Russian forces in Ukraine. There are some who argue that, no, the United States and its NATO allies themselves have to make -- be part of that conventional response. There's also a group that says, well, maybe you use the opportunity to bring the Chinese, the Indians, others who are still buying Russian oil and gas; and say this country has to be completely isolated and unplugged from the rest of the world.",
