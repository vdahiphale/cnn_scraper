So it was quite an opportunity to hear what both men had to say about what North Korea is up to.And, of course, a good deal of concern that one of North Korea's very recent missile launches, in the last 24, 36 hours or so, was an attempt to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially, some day, if it worked, reach the United States. Thankfully, it did not work, of course, in this test launch. Listen to some very tough words from Lloyd Austin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We, in our commitment to defending the ROK, is ironclad. We strongly condemn the DPRK's irresponsible and reckless activities. As we said before, these kinds of activities are destabilizing to the region potentially. So we call on them to cease that -- that type of activity and to begin to engage in serious dialogue.

With me now, a frontline Democrat fighting for those suburban votes, Representative Lauren Underwood, from Illinois. She's running for re- election against Republican challenger, Scott Ryder. Congresswoman, thank you so much. You were comfortably running in a reelection. You won that two years ago. There's been redistricting, newly redistricting district. And you are facing a Republican challenger that you, yourself, admit had more name recognition than you do. You said, \"The majority of voters in this district have not seen my name on a ballot before.\" How big a disadvantage is that for you? REP. LAUREN UNDERWOOD (D-IL): The district is 70 percent new, thanks to redistricting. My opponent is very -- someone who's not well known. We have a brand-new congressional district.

And causing American seniors to suffer is unacceptable. That's the choice that we have on our ballots right now.

His parents told him before the game, \"God willing, you'll throw a no hitter.\"  That's exactly what he did. Nine strikeouts, six hitless innings, second longest no-hit in World Series history. Then the bullpen, they came in. And they must have been listening to some Beyonce before the game, Victor. Brian Abreu, Raphael Monterro, Ryan Presley, the Astros were courting just the second no hitter in the 119-year history of the World Series. This series is now tied at two. We have Noah Syndergaard on the mound for the Phillies. Justin Verlander starting for the Astros. Game five is vital, because the winners in the best of seven series in the post season, when it's tied at two, has gone on to win the series more than 70 percent of the time.
