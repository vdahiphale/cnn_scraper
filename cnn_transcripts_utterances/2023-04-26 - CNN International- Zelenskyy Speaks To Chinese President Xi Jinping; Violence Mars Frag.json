      "sentences": "Hello. You're watching CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, as thousands of foreign nationals are escaping the heavy fighting of violence in Sudan, Sudanese civilians are trapped with a lack of vital supplies or access to medical care. Then jailed Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny says Russia is now investigating him on terrorism charges. We'll have the latest about his hearing in Moscow. And former President -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is set to testify before the Federal Police for his alleged role in the January 8 riot. We begin with news just in to CNN though. For the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken with China's leader. The Ukrainian President said, quote, \"I had a long and meaningful phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. I believe that this call, as well as the appointment of Ukraine's ambassador to China, will give a powerful impetus to the development of our bilateral relations.\" Let's get more on the significance of this from our International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson. This is obviously, off the back of Xi's meetings with Putin. Is he acting as some sort of mediator? What do you read into this?",

      "sentences": "Well, he's offered to do that. That was back in March, the 21st of March, when Xi met with President Putin in Moscow. And about a couple of weeks before that, President Putin had met with President Xi's top foreign policy adviser, Wang Yi in Moscow again.So really, on the face of it, strengthening the relationship between Moscow and Beijing, and then just 10 days ago, President Putin met with China's defense minister as well. That relationship looks strong. But what we heard from President Zelenskyy after President Xi's visit to Putin back in March was, you know, his response to President Xi saying he had a peace proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine. And President Zelenskyy at that time was quite public, and other officials were quite public saying, well, you know, let's see President Xi reach out to Ukraine. Let's potentially see President Xi visit Ukraine. If he really wants to understand the conflict and help, then that would be the right way forward. So the fact that these two leaders have now had a call is significant. Both sides are sort of putting this in a very positive light. But if you go back to their sort of both countries two positions over what peace should look like, they're very different. And Ukraine's allies criticized President Xi for his sort of peace proposal that never acknowledged in any place that Russia had illegally invaded Ukraine without, you know, without reason, that Ukraine's position on peace is completely different to that. It's that Russia should withdraw itself from its invasion of Ukraine back to pre-1991 line. So you can see there the two sides, Ukraine and Russia have -- Ukraine and China have very different views on what peace should look like. But what we're hearing from President Xi now is he's saying, well, I'm not going to sort of idly standby and watch this fire from the other side. I'm not going to throw fuel on it, and I'm not going to try to profit from it. So the diplomatic language around this is that the two of them are talking, that President Xi is saying that is not going to make the situation worse and is sort of amplifying what is said before that he would like to be some kind of broker in this. Long and meaningful in the conversation, did it really get into the detail of what these two leaders see as a different, very different part of the peace? This is the beginning, but the Chinese are indicating that they will send an envoy not only to Ukraine, but to other countries in the region, perhaps Ukraine's allies and partners they say, to better understand the political situation, Max.",

And they are facing a very devastating situation right now. And the U.N. is saying that they are staring down an abyss because of the humanitarian crisis that is facing the country. Lack of power, food, water supplies, electricity. It's just a very tough situation right now. And prices are skyrocketing, and people are reporting being asked to pay sums of $20,000 just to get on a bus to head to a neighboring country like Egypt. So the situation is very tough and U.N. reporting that warehouses are being looted and there's just a sense of lawlessness and crime in the country right now. We heard earlier about a U.S. citizen who was stabbed outside his home as he waited for a hospital appointment. So just a real sense of total chaos and looming humanitarian crisis in a country, Max.",

The Kremlin critic says he's being accused of committing terrorist attacks whilst in prison. This comes on the same day Navalny appeared in court via video for a hearing linked to a separate extremism case. His team says the judge has ruled he has 10 days to, quote, familiarize himself with the documents in that case. The sister of Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia for more than four years, is speaking to CNN about her fight to free her brother. CNN asked her whether she's getting the support she needs from the White House. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH WHELAN, PAUL WHELAN'S SISTER: I got a little frustrated a couple of weeks ago when Evan was arrested, we relived Paul's arrest. Our whole family just -- it was like a flashback. And I was very concerned, and I remain concerned that Paul will be left behind a third time. And so, I felt I needed to speak out a little bit about that. Since then, we have had some conversations with the White House that assure me that they continue to be committed to bringing Paul home. But I also am committed to pushing to make sure that he is not left behind again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

While the White House did not specifically name the leader of the so- called ISIS-K group, it described him as the mastermind of the attack.

He has denied any responsibility, arguing he was in self-imposed exile in Florida. On January the 8th, his supporters invaded and vandalized Brazil's Congress, the presidential palace, and the Supreme Court. It happened a week after leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office. Journalist Julia Vargas joins us from Sao Paulo with the very latest on that. He didn't discourage the protest. Is that one of the issues here?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Max. And also the question they're trying to answer authorities in this case here, the Federal Police, is, did he incite them, right? He walked a very thin line between condemning some kinds of violence but not quite saying, step down, come out from outside of the military headquarters, that his supporters have been camped out for months, you know, with t- shirts and flags with his name and his face on it.It's quite clear that these were supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro. So the questions that they're focusing on here, first of them, is a social media post that the president shared on January 10. So a couple of days after the riots, where he very clearly questioned the integrity of voting machines and called into question the results of the election, I say this was a couple of days later, because they're looking at his role holistically. Starting really months before these riots, he was already calling into question the voting machines in Brazil that have been in use here for decades and are considered to be quite safe. He even went as far as asking for an audit. Kind of like in the style of the Arizona audit that happened in 2021. He made that happen here in Brazil, trying to throw out thousands of votes after the first round of the presidential elections. And more importantly, they might ask him about a draft decree that was found in his Justice Minister's house during a raid a few days after the January 8 events, where he kind of laid out this document, the structure for a coup d'etat. Basically, how to get the military again in power in a state of siege in a country that you might recall has a very complicated relationship with the military having coming out of a dictatorship not 40 years ago. So this is another one of the issues that the police might be asking him about. And finally, Max, why did he leave to Florida just days before the inauguration of his opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva? He left about 36 hours before, been in Florida, was in Florida for almost three months. Did he have any knowledge that something might happen or was he just sulking after a lot? So the question here really is, what did he know and what was his role in getting his supporters to come out? Did he have any actual responsibility for the acts that marked Brazilian democracy with this ugly mark? That's what he will be answering for today, Max.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, we've had a bit of a preview from senior administration officials telling CNN that there will unveil a new declaration. They call it the Washington Declaration. And what this is, and it's going to be signed by both leaders in the coming hours. It will be a series of steps for the U.S. to try and reassure South Korea that it will be there in its hour of need if necessary.Seoul has consistently been calling for a strengthened extended deterrence in the face of these increased nuclear threats and testing and launches from North Korea. So what this will be is it will boost the cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea, we're told, for military training, information sharing, and strategic asset movements. Now, we're also being told that there will actually be a U.S. nuclear ballistic submarine that will visit South Korea in the near future. And that hasn't happened since the early 1980s. So what we're likely to see is a very visible show from the U.S. and also showing the North Koreans that they do have a significant deterrent and they will use it for South Korea if necessary. There's also going to be a nuclear consultative group, which will mean that leaders from both of the countries will meet on a regular basis to discuss nuclear and strategic planning. Now, this is something that Seoul has been pushing for for some time. So certainly President Yoon Suk Yeol is likely to be very pleased with it. And what Washington has been concerned about is this growing feeling here in South Korea that there wasn't enough protection from the nuclear umbrella, that maybe there should be U.S. tactical nuclear weapons redeployed to the peninsula, maybe even South Korea should have its own nuclear program. It had even been suggested by President Yoon Suk Yeol himself, although he later walked that back. So what Washington will be hoping is that this lays those increasing calls for South Korea to have its own nuclear program, lays them to rest. So certainly, this is going to be the big headline today. Of course, other things will be likely discussed. The threat, of course, from North Korea also potentially whether or not the South Korea is going to be providing ammunition to the United States, which the United States has said it would like to send to Ukraine. Now, of course, the Pentagon leak just recently gave a remarkable -- remarkably detailed account of senior South Korean officials having deep concerns about that, as their policy is not to send arms to countries which are at war.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's absolutely right, Max. What the lab contains, among other things, is samples of live polio, measles and cholera. Now, polio is all but eradicated in the Horn of Africa and Central Africa, including Sudan, almost entirely, we think.Measles and cholera are endemic. And cholera, in particular, in any case, is a threat in a city like Khartoum, which is riven with violence because the clean water supplies have been disrupted or are non-functioning altogether. The only access to clean water anybody has is through wells. But, of course, sewage systems will be struggling, such as they are. And cholera itself is always going to be a threat under that kind of circumstances, particularly in very hot weather. So if there was a release of a cholera precursor, if you like, a pathogen into the community, if somebody broke in, smashed these things up, then suddenly, they would be infected and they would be spreading these serious infections into the population. This is not a COVID type threat, though. This is not some unknown series of biological viruses or bacterial infections that could be unknown and spread into the communities. There are ways of mitigating these infections, and that is precisely why this laboratory exists. But it is a biohazard and it is an example of how, Max, the state infrastructures, all of these things that people might not think about when you think about what happens when a country is plunged into civil war. We understand water, food, fuel shortages, which are chronic now in Khartoum, but there are other aspects to this as well. Biosecurity is among them. The other, more mundane is the fact that people can't get cash, can't recharge their mobile phones with credit. Therefore, communications are beginning to collapse just at a time when the international community out of Djibouti, out of Cyprus, out of their home countries, is accelerating their efforts during a ceasefire to try to lift their citizens out of the country by air. But, of course, there is a humanitarian crisis that preexists all of this already in Khartoum and more widely across Sudan. And that is now being exacerbated by, among other things, the threat of some kind of biological disaster out of this laboratory. Max?",
