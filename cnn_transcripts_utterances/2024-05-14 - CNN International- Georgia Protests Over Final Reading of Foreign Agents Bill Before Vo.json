Officials say the blast removed a tremendous amount of steel from the huge container ship that slammed into the bridge.The ship has been stuck for seven weeks but could be moving again within days. The controlled explosion was originally planned for Saturday but it was delayed because of bad weather. The ship hit the bridge in the middle of the night in March, causing the span to collapse and killing six construction workers. Now, still to come, ChatGPT is new and improved. We'll show you the amazing new capabilities that some people think are just a little too creepy. And before that, a final reading of Georgia's controversial foreign agents bill underway despite fierce protests by thousands in the capital city. The latest in a live report just ahead.

As the protesters have grown more determined over the recent weeks, the police response has become ever more brutal in the words of the European Union. We've seen opposition leaders beaten, other beatings, multiple arrests, things like that. This is really now a very volatile clash, not only, I would say, between the people, 80 percent of which, at least according to the latest polls, support EU membership and the government, but also between these two sort of world views, the pro-Western, pro-EU integration with the EU and NATO ideas versus Russia. And that is why this is not just about this law. These protesters, they see this foreign agents law as a slippery slope to this sort of Russian influence, the kind of Russian repression that we see in Russia, partly due to their own foreign agents bill and partly for other reasons. But they see this kind of democratic backsliding is what the White House National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, has called it. So, look, the protesters that we've been speaking to, they say that even if this passes, they will continue to turn out. What happens next is that the president has promised that she will veto this. She is pro-European. Parliament then say they can override it. That means there's potentially a couple more weeks of these sort of procedural elements. And the protesters last hope is that the government will see sense at that point and withdraw the bill. They are facing elections in October, so the hope is that that will prove some incentive. But at this point, the Prime Minister is saying on Monday that they will pass this in the third reading.",

They also want the West to know what's going on and to potentially do something to stop it. There are a lot of calls for sanctions.You know, we've had U.S. senators come out and condemn this, but we haven't had any actual sanctions on the Georgian Dream, that's the ruling party elite, which the protesters, civil society, opposition figures that we speak to think would actually make a difference here. And then, of course, you have the wider questions as to how we got here, right? Fifteen years ago, Georgia and Russia were at war. Russia still occupies 20 percent of Georgia's internationally recognized territory. And the Georgian Dream Party, which came in in 2012, did not come in with the promise of sort of rapprochement with Russia. That gradual sort of process has happened since then and exposed even more by the invasion of Ukraine. Georgia did not join Western sanctions, has not roundly condemned Russia. But most people will tell you that Georgia would not have gained EU candidate status if it wasn't going to be wrapped into that along with Ukraine. So that has sort of exposed these divisions. And that is why Georgia, I think, finds itself at this point a real crossroads.",

The trader known as Roaring Kitty helped ignite the so-called meme stock frenzy of 2021, during which troubled stocks went viral due to online chatter and social media activity. Roaring Kitty recently posted this cartoon depicting a man leaning forward in a chair holding a video game controller.That caused GameStop shares to surge more than 110 percent on Monday before settling at 74 percent. To be clear, this huge jump had nothing to do with the company's fundamentals.

And while there isn't much detail on exactly what comes next, whether she will launch a new foundation, it is clear where her focus will be. She said: This is a critical moment for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support. Meanwhile, Bill Gates also took to X, thanking his former wife for her work, adding that he was sorry to see her leave, and assuring followers that he remained committed to the foundation of which he will now be the sole chairman.

The New Jersey Democrat is accused of taking bribes in exchange for lucrative contracts with government officials in Egypt and Qatar. CNN's Jason Carroll has that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, jury selection will now move into Tuesday. Once a jury is seated, then we will move on to opening statements where both sides will present their cases to the jurors. We already know what the prosecution says happened here. The prosecution says that Senator Menendez and his wife Nadine accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for the senator's influence in trying to get influence with the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Those bribes coming in the form of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars and home furnishings. Senator Menendez, for his part, says that the government is overreaching, that the government is out to get him, that he has done nothing wrong. He says that money that was found at his home was money that he had saved over a period of time, other money that came in the form of loans. We also got a clue as to what also might be part of the defense here. That came in a pretrial document. There's a particular statement of note. It reads: Senator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing in part that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife Nadine and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately. Her trial starts in July. Jason Carroll, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
