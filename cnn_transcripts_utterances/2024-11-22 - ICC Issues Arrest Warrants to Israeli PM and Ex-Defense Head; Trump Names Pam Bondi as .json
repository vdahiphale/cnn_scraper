So this is really focused at Washington rather than Kyiv. I think this is why we need to look at this strike as beyond Ukraine or D.C. This is a missile that could hit anywhere in Europe. And in the last six months, we've seen the U.S. and Germany agree to deploy in 2026 long-range missiles that can hit Russia.

The International Criminal Court accused Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare, and murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. Mr. Netanyahu called the warrants absurd and Gallant said they set adangerous precedent. The U.S. president called the arrest warrants outrageous, adding that whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence, none, between Israel and Hamas. Well our Eleni Giokos is covering this live for us from Dubai. Good to have you with us, Eleni. So just give us a sense further about what Netanyahu is saying about this arrest warrant. ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Well, I mean, a very strong condemnation, Lynda, and of course, very much expected. These are very serious international challenges that Benjamin Netanyahu faces, but also his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, as you say, the crimes that they face, crimes against humanity, as well as war crimes, which includes inhumane acts, includes starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution. And all eyes have been on Israel for quite some time. In fact, the ICC had first mentioned the notion of potential arrest warrants in May, which of course was very significant at the time. Israel then challenged the ICC based on jurisdiction. The ICC said that this was a premature response by Israel, but still leaving the door open for potential other challenges from Israel. In the meantime, Netanyahu has said, this is anti-Semitic, it's absurd and of course saying that this of course is not warranted given the brutal attacks by Hamas on October 7th.

And I would have picked Gabbard at the top of that list I mean because she is so manifest, again, and by the same kind of measures that you use from Matt Gaetz by any historic metrics or yard stick, she is so manifestly inappropriate for this job particularly because of all the questions about her sympathy for Russia or Syria. Nikki Haley described her as a Russian, Syrian, Iranian, Chinese sympathizer and said there was no room for someone with those views in this job. Certainly there are other Republican senators who share those views. The question is how many are willing to publicly dissent from Donald Trump on it.

It was meant to be a phase out of coal and at the very last moment it changed to phase down. So I think it's not atypical for there to be a lot of tension in the final moments but I do feel that this time in particular the atmosphere is particularly fraught.",

Delegates are often working until 1I mean yesterday I actually saw a few delegates sleeping on chairs at the conferences. So people are tired, people are frustrated, and people want actually meaningful action. And I think you know unfortunately there's kind of a glacial rate of progress at these COP conferences because you need 198 parties from around the world to agree. And these include parties whose economies are driven by fossil fuels and those whose economies are being destroyed by fossil fuels. So you have all these different priorities and you have two weeks to come together and agree on a consensus. It's quite challenging.",

This place is massive, it is sprawling, floors and floors of Chinese-made merchandise, things like bikes, stuffed animals, hair dryers, as items made in China are often a big part of American lives. As talk of further tariffs on all Chinese goods heats up, as promised by President-elect Trump on the campaign trail, a few things worth remembering. China is the world's top manufacturing country making about 30 percent of all of the stuff used around the world. Electronics like these phone cords top the list. Furniture, toys and clothing aren't far behind. No surprise China is also the world's top exporter shipping almost $3.4 trillion worth of goods globally. But China's strength isn't just about money, including often criticized government subsidies, it's about the ecosystems. Everything that's needed to make anything, the entire supply chain, it's already here. And once things are made, China has the means to move merchandise quickly. A key goal of Trump's threatened tariffs is to bring more jobs and industries back to the U.S. But look at all of this merchandise. China's system has a grip on the world and unseating it as a top maker and seller, it's a task much easier said than done. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
