Hannah Kobayashi flew from Maui to Los Angeles nearly four weeks ago but did not get on her connecting flight to New York. Police say that she hung out in LA for a few days before video captured her walking into Mexico with her luggage. No cell phone, but seemingly unharmed.",

I mean, from the moment she landed in LAX, LAPD has established her whereabouts each day from the 8th to the 12th when she was seen walking into Mexico now.I mean, she was seen all around LA. They have video of her unharmed by herself, seemingly doing the things that a tourist does around LA. She was seen at the Grove, which is a popular outdoor shopping center. She was seen outside a Nike event. She was seen in a bookstore. The LAPD has put her whereabouts all around. I'm seeing terms like vanished or this woman disappeared. She did anything but. I really push back on those assertions. The LAPD has laid out a timeline and you can see her almost each day doing something by herself unharmed around LA. There's no sign of foul play. There's no sign that a crime has taken place.",

      "sentences": "Three days into her trip to LA, she was seen back at the airport at LAX talking to a ticket agent at LAX. They've obviously interviewed that ticket agent to see what her mindset was about. My feeling is she was probably trying to get a cash refund for the portion of the trip from LA to New York that she didn't take because she was going to Mexico the next day.And that was on the 11th of November. And the 12th of November, she's seen walking into Mexico without a cell phone. So she presumably wanted cash for that trip. This is a 30-year-old woman who stopped talking to her family. That's what it is. We don't have any sign of any other crime taking place other than a cryptic text message that the family say they have. But this woman, for whatever reason, there's an old post of hers that said she wanted to disconnect from the modern world or whatever. So she left her cell phone behind. She's on a walkabout maybe. And I know that this is very difficult for families to deal with. But this is a 30-year-old woman. There's no sign of a crime. LAPD has a huge caseload of cases that these detectives have to deal with. And until a crime, you know, there's some semblance of a crime, some evidence of a crime taking place. In this case, I hate to say it, but this is a 30-year-old woman who seemingly just stopped communicating with her family.",

Because it's unusual to spend such a short time looking for your daughter. She hadn't turned up, you know, harmed yet.

And it's really fascinating to see how the relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and President-elect Donald Trump has changed and evolved over the years. Mark Zuckerberg was just actually in Mar-a-Lago to meet with President-elect Trump to have a meal together.And yesterday on a call with reporters, a Facebook executive talked that Mark said that Mark Zuckerberg wants to take an active role in tech policy conversations, especially about maintaining the American advantage in the technological sphere. And they say it's especially important given artificial intelligence in global politics. Keep in mind that just over the summer, President-elect Trump wrote in a book that he will throw Mark Zuckerberg in prison if he, you know, does certain things that he sees as wrong. But now they're warming up. We know that the two had been in touch in leading up to the election and after the attempted assassination attempt on President Trump's life. Mark Zuckerberg called his fist pumping in the air one of the most badass things he had ever seen. Now, all of the tech executives are doing this. They would be doing this with any administration. They'd be trying to, you know, warm up the relationships, get to know the people. And we know that with President Trump, it becomes very personal. So having that personal relationship with the president-elect, especially with somebody like Elon Musk in his ear, and keep in mind Elon Musk has wanted to fight, literally fight Mark Zuckerberg before, will be very important for Mark Zuckerberg, especially because META faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust trial this next year. It's a historic one. It was actually brought by the Trump administration as they're trying to potentially break up META because of their acquisitions of things like WhatsApp and Instagram.",

People are really kind of frustrated with this company right now. And then there's all the competition. There's kind of these fast food value wars right now.
