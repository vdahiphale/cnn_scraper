Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As American voters look ahead to the first Biden-Trump presidential debate on Thursday, along with the rest of the world, coverage is mostly focused on domestic issues. But an array of global challenges could have the greatest impact on Americans daily lives. In Ukraine, American hesitation has already helped Vladimir Putin advance his interests. In the Middle East, progress towards regional peace could be one more casualty of the brutal war in Gaza. And from China, Iran, North Korea, and beyond, the next foreign policy crisis could be just over the horizon. So, Americans face a stark choice, and so does the rest of the world. Between Joe Biden, with his view of a global battle between democracy and autocracy, and Donald Trump's populist, America First isolationism. Until a few weeks ago, David Satterfield was America's special envoy to the Middle East for humanitarian issues. And I had a wide-ranging conversation with the veteran diplomat about these foreign policy flashpoints facing America's next president, whoever he will be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And Putin, you know, is really counting on that and this anti-American axis that he's, you know, gathering together, including China, Iran, et cetera. What do you make of how any president can contain North Korea? Because, again, remember, the Obama administration essentially didn't do hardly any diplomacy with North Korea. And Trump tried, but then, according to the South Koreans, there was no follow up.

And that's the term to use, banditry. This is a regime which engages in behaviors not just at the level of ballistic missile challenges or nuclear programs that go beyond the realm of international conduct. It is a very sad judgment on where Russia now finds itself, that it is turning to Iran, turning to Korea, turning to what are, in a very old phrase, pariah regimes in order to meet its military requirements to conduct this illegitimate war in Ukraine.",

And that's the situation we find ourselves in right now. For Hamas, for Israel and Israelis, and I go far beyond this government of Israel, for Israel itself. These are existential issues. Now, the U.S. has every ability to put forward as clear a vision as possible of what we believe can lead to a sustainable peace, a reduction of the security threats posed to Israel and the Israeli people. But at the end of the day, the decisions being made are in the hands of Israel itself and of Hamas. With respect to the previous administration and presumed encouragement for right-wing activism, look, I think that's overstated. The politics of Israel are just that. They're the politics of Israel. And they have far less to do with external factors than they do with various internal domestic drives, just as is the case with the United States.",

But at the same time, there needs to be a strategic vision for the region as a whole. That is why we are pursuing what is referred to as the Saudi deal, as tirelessly as we are. Because that offers not only strategic benefits for the United States vis-a-vis challenges from Iran, from the PRC to the region, but it also forms an additional stabilization framework for peace in the region. You've got to pursue both, the Palestinian-Israeli course and the broader regional course for stability and peace.",

That death toll is horrendous, and we've spoken to it in quite human personal terms. It is, as Tony Blinken has said, a kick in the gut to see these images of shrouds covering young children prepared for burial. It's terrible. But we should be under no illusion as to who and what is responsible. It is Hamas, it is Yahya Sinwar, it is the consequence of the incredible paroxysm of bestial brutality on October 7th. Hamas could bring this to a close tonight, this hour, if they were to agree to the terms of the ceasefire hostage release deal that we and our partners in the region have advanced on behalf of Israel, it is their proposal.

Now, it's a goal that has to be advanced in two different ways. There's a kinetic military aspect to it, which is absolutely essential. There is a humanitarian aspect that preserves the time, the space, the ability to get to a day before to do the third key element, a plan for the day after. And that plan for the day after has to encompass a political vision as well as a security vision, that's very, very hard to do because Hamas has proven an extraordinarily resilient military force. It is not just a terrorist gang, it has a terrorist army of many tens of thousands. And it is quite able, given its commitment of resources for 16 years to the construction of this tunnel network, over 300 miles of deep bunkered tunnels, it has an ability to continue to exert influence.

GABRIELA COWPERTHWAITE, DIRECTOR, \"THE GRAB\":  Yes, it's pretty labyrinthian. I think that learning about Nate's initial reporting and kind of, you know, he had started reporting out a few of these stories and really like the China Smithfield story, Arizona water story. And those I kind of saw as portals of entry to this much bigger issue which was really essentially that powerful entities are grabbing up the final resources that are left out from underneath us and largely without us knowing it.

It was part of their five-year plan to go overseas and to buy up food and water supplies because China no longer has enough water to grow enough food to meet their growing demand, which is really a demand driven by their growing middle class. You know, people become wealthier. They want to eat more meat, and meat just requires more water to grow more food to produce. And so, we saw this reach by China across the world, including in the United States. And so, after I did that story, I began wondering like, OK, is this just a one office? Is China the sole example of this trend? And it turns out, definitely not. One of the other stories that I found was that the Saudi -- the largest dairy company in the Middle East, which is in Riyadh, had gone into the Arizona desert and bought essentially 15 square miles of, you know, wily coyote kind of saguaro cactus like desert and was pumping the water up to grow hay to send that back to Riyadh to feed the dairy cows there. And it's an unregulated part of Arizona, which meant -- that means that if you buy the land, you effectively can pump up as much of that water as you want. And that's what we were seeing where, you know, people in Arizona, in these local communities, didn't realize that there was this global now grab for their water. What they did see was that their own domestic wells in their homes were beginning to go dry. And that's sort of the trend we're not just seeing in Arizona or in the U.S., but we're beginning to see all around the world.",

And there are states that have some restrictions on how foreign ownership can own land. And for instance, Iowa has some restrictions on it. But also, there is just -- there is a lot of questions around who ultimately owns a company that can make it very difficult to understand, at the end of the day, whose money is it that's buying that farmland?

What does it mean to protect us and think about water in much more of a similar way that China and Russia do, which is, I mean, that you're playing the long game, right? They're in the 21st century, thinking about burgeoning populations and what to do there to feed them. While we and our water laws are 19th century. Some of them are from the 19th century, literally. So, trying to build consensus over what we do with what we have left seems a no brainer, but we are not -- we're not there yet.",
