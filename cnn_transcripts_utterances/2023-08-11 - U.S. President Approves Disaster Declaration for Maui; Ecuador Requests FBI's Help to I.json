Khanun is weakening as it continues over land and into North Korea. According to reports, the military and political ruling party there had been ordered to prepare for the flooding and to salvage crops. Northern China also seeing rain from Khanun, even as it recovers from Typhoon Doksuri that hit about two weeks ago. And in the past couple of hours, China said at least 29 people in Hubei province died because of flooding and heavy rains from Doksuri. Meanwhile, there have been rare protests in China after the government deliberately directed floodwaters towards people's homes in the wake of that typhoon and the record rains that followed. CNN's Ivan Watson with that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A rare moment of defiance in China. Angry residents on the steps of the municipal government building in the city of Bazhou. Their sign says, \"Give me back my home. The flood was caused by floodwater discharge, not by heavy rainfall.\" At some point, men with police shields dispersed the crowd. The incident took place after deadly floods caused by the heaviest rains to hit Northeastern China in 140 years. A typhoon that killed dozens of people in and around the Chinese capital, Beijing, forcing the evacuation of more than a million people from their homes.",

WATSON (voice-over): At two a.m. on August 1st, authorities activated a flood control plan, releasing water from dams into flood storage and detention zones. They then had to evacuate more than 800,000 people living in those zones, which quickly flooded. State TV showed the Communist Party chief of Hubei province touring the disaster area, instructing subordinates to reduce flooding pressure on Beijing, and vowing to resolutely be the capital's moat. In the event of a crisis, experts say countries often plan to redirect rising water, but usually towards flood zones that are unpopulated.",

Japan, the only previous World Cup winners left in this competition, who've really have been picking up a lot of fans over the last couple of weeks because of their style of play. The ease with which they are playing football and scoring goals. The tournament's top scorers so far with 14 goals. One of the fans they've picked up is actually the Sweden captain, Kosovare Asllani. She has been talking about how much she's enjoying watching them play, but she is looking after a side who have won in all sorts of different ways. A late winner against South Africa; set plays against Italy. Of course, that late, late penalty shootout against the USA. It was, interestingly, Sweden who beat Japan the last time these two sides met. So that was in the Olympic quarterfinal on home soil. Sweden well aware that Japan wants something of revenge for that.",
