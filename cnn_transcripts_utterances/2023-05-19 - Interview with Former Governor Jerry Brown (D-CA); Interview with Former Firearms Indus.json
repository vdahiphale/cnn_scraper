Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. It's hard to keep track of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, these days, as he crisscrosses the globe nonstop on a blitz to shore up military and economic support for what could be a defining counteroffensive at home. Today, it was the Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia. Next up, Japan, where Ukraine is top of the agenda at the G7 Summit. The big news there, President Biden has agreed to support a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on modern fighter jets. But, for President Biden and friends, there is another country looming large on the doorstep, and that's China. The dilemma, how to develop a unified response to its increasing assertiveness and how to engage. Former Governor Jerry Brown founded the California-China Climate Institute at Berkeley University, and he tells me it is tricky doing business with Beijing, but he worries that Washington hawks might be going down a dangerous path of no return. Governor Brown, welcome back to our program. FMR. GOV. JERRY BROWN (D-CA):  Thank you. Glad to be here.",

Nevertheless, the imperatives of planetary danger, global danger, the economy, nuclear proliferation, climate change, the advances in artificial intelligence, the threats, bio threats, all these things mean that the U.S. and China must collaborate. It doesn't mean that they're not very different. And the level of negativity coming out of Washington, and then, of course, reciprocating and stimulated in China is alarming, and it's escalating. We have to call a reverse in this trajectory of a very negative relationship. It wasn't true few years ago, it doesn't have to be true now. It's very dangerous.

In China, President Xi is the -- he is the top. He calls the shots and he only wants to talk to President Biden. Of course, they had to bring in their close confidants, but they have to initiate a discussion. It's -- Obama and Xi met down in Palm Springs for over two days. Nothing like that has happened, and yet everything has gotten worse. This is very dangerous. I really think people in Washington don't realize the risk. Yes, the communist party is a problem, but hot war is a thousand times worse as will be climate change in the next 20 to 30 years, as will be artificial intelligence, as will be nuclear blunder that is building up, as well. So, yes, the doomsday clock is a minute and a half before doomsday. So, it's time for Biden, his assistance, the Congress, as well as China and their people, to get together.

Why was that the occasion to cancel a visit by the American secretary state to China? It indicates that it isn't important enough. And yet, I will say, and I've talked a lot of very astute China thinkers, nothing is more important than talking with China, working through our profound differences. It can be done. The communist party under Mao Tse-tung was far more dangerous and hostile than the communist party under President Xi Jinping. So, why aren't we talking? I think there is a miasma in Washington. There is an arrogance, a hubris, that doesn't understand the nation is at threat. This is not a high school football game. This is a global environment where powerful countries can kill hundreds of millions if they get to the point of a war. So, that is the number one thing that must be avoided. I don't hear that.

And if one understands that and sees it, then, without minimizing disagreements or differences and values, there will be ways that people can find the president of China and Biden, president of the United States, can work together, can find areas of cooperation, because we have common interests.

So, we got a crisis, all right, and it's something we got to work out with China and Mexico, but also in the United States. And right now, the opiates are permitted in many of the big cities. So, I think the mayors have to take a more enlightened view, strict, but also compassionate in the sense that treatment is available, shelter is permitted. The specter of people camping out on the streets of San Francisco is not a good one. And I think it should be a call to wake up and take more serious action in stopping the opioid crisis.

And even last year, the federal government passed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was the first federal law in over 30 years. So, things are changing, but I think what we really need is that cultural change at the ground level, where the everyday Americans who care, and they may say, I'm a Republican and I care.

Many states have actually reduced the level of permitting of, you know, the requirement to learn safe storage or to require safe storage.

I think, Nick Burns -- Ambassador Nicholas Burns was recently in China. And there is actually an opening here for the world, and that is in Ukraine. If the Chinese could only persuade Russia to stand down, and if the United States, by the same token, could help Ukraine stand down, we could find a diplomatic ending to a war in which people are otherwise backing themselves into a situation where Putin could use a nuke.

They are not ideological. We did use those weapons but we used them only after we realized that there was no other choice to use them. There's a movie coming out called \"Oppenheimer.\" And there is a scene, which they'll probably have in the movie, where after we dropped the atom bomb, Oppenheimer, the scientist who helped create the atomic bomb, comes into Harry Truman's office, President Truman's office, the Oval Office, saying, I have blood on my hands. And Truman kicks him out. And says, I don't want to see that crybaby ever again. Now, Truman was posturing a little bit when he was doing that.

The fate of Taiwan is bringing the United States and China into a nuclear standoff. If we fight China over Taiwan, there's a very good chance we will use missiles against the Chinese mainland. And China will want to use missiles against our mainland. Once countries -- this is not some nice little 19th century sea battle, this is an intercontinental conflict. And that runs the risk of using nuclear weapons. We've been there in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We need to go back and relive some of that history to remember just how terrible it was, how -- what a close thing it was. That's another thing that people don't quite realize. We almost used a third bomb. In my book I write about Harry Truman told the British ambassador they were running out of time and they were going to use a third bomb on Tokyo. People don't realize that. That's how close it was. There is a coup d'etat attempt in the imperial palace on the last night to try to disrupt that surrender. People forget all about that, but that's how close it came to us using a third weapon. And they were planning for a sixth, seventh. They were planning to drop bombs all fall long.

But he saved millions of lives, because he was a human being, he read -- he was at Japanese who read Goethe (ph), he read German philosophers, and he was a humanist. And he saw that we had to surrender that day, they -- the Japanese had to surrender, and he persuaded the emperor explicitly. He persuaded the emperor ever since. I agree with the foreign minister, and he ends it. But it took that kind of human courage, humanistic courage, from somebody who read history, who was -- he was -- the Japanese foreign minister but he's anti-Nazi, and he wanted to bring back the Germany of the 19th century, he'd read history and he understood humanity.
