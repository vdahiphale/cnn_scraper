And it has become this symbol, as you mentioned, and so politically significant of the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Past presidents and congressional leaders had promised to fix it and haven't been able to get it done.And what President Biden, today, is able to announce is that $2 billion from the infrastructure law that he signed back in 2021 will go towards upgrading this bridge and other significant bridges, including the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. And you're right that a part of this event that is going to be so significant is someone like Mitch McConnell appearing beside the president. There is sort of the literal bridge and then obviously, the metaphorical bridge of the president sort of wanting to send this message that even in the new Congress and even with Republicans taking over the House, that he's sort of willing to reach across the aisle and bridge the divide, and continue working with Republicans. So it's going to be a fascinating scene.",

The right is being intractable, but so is the only-Kevin caucus. I would be asking myself right now how long can they sustain that position. The hostage-takers, as they were -- they're not coming around unless he makes more concessions, and he has given them a lot. I mean, things that will damage the institution, like lowering the threshold for the motion to vacate. I will be curious to see. So, on another network, a cable news host is very close with the Freedom Caucus laid out what demands could look like. And two things he mentioned is standing up a select committee to investigate the Department of Justice for whatever reason you would investigate the Department of Justice. And then, the other was to release the full, unredacted January 6 transcripts, which would expose witnesses -- you know, private citizens who helped that investigation. So if I'm an only-Kevin moderate Republican, I'd ask what damage to the institution and the country am I willing to do to get Kevin McCarthy over a Scalise or an Elise Stefanik, or whoever it could be.",

This is a demonstration, once again, that Golen always turns on its creator. That these extremists on the far right are going to attack anything resembling responsible governance for majority rule. In this case, for all the appeasing that Kevin McCarthy tried to do, and good-faith negotiation, it hasn't resulted in goodwill.

He's in contract negotiations with U.S. Soccer at the moment, right now. It goes back to an incident back in 1991. And Berhalter and his now- wife -- they came out in front of this. They released a statement -- a very lengthy statement, co-signed -- and it basically explained what happened, saying a third party contacted U.S. Soccer during the World Cup -- this most recent World Cup, of course. And he goes into detail about that night when he was 18 years old. He said he and his then-girlfriend were drunk and they got into a fight. Then it got physical and he kicked her. And he goes on and says \"There are zero excuses for my actions that night. It was a shameful moment and one that I regret to this day. At that time, I immediately apologized to Rosalind, but understandably, she wanted nothing to do with me.\" Now, he said they had counseling and he's grown from this. The two have been married now for 25 years. They went on to have a family and so on and so forth. Now, U.S. -- the interesting part is U.S. Soccer is saying that they have hired an outside law firm to conduct an investigation. But this isn't the only allegation that's been to light. They actually said that there's other potential inappropriate behavior toward multiple members of the staff and organization that they're looking into. So there's a lot going on here --",

Anybody that comes up to protest on Capitol Hill, Congress is their target. That's why they're coming up here to protest -- to sway Congress. So the information that was there didn't specially say we're looking -- or indicate that we're looking at a coordinated attack. There could be instances of violence. We expect that.
