The airline says the demand for mechanics and other technicians is so great that they've launched an initiative apprenticeship program to train thousands of new workers.

The latest Boeing forecast, airlines need to hire 610,000 new mechanics globally in total over the next 20 years. United calls its program Calibrate and it does this by having workers apprentice in house. They want to pump up a thousand new mechanics through this by 2026. Another 6,000 on top of that through traditional hiring means.This is so critical because who has not waited on a plane from the airlines because of a mechanical issue and remember that airline fleets got smaller over the pandemic, so the issue is particularly acute. United says that Calibrate is really interesting because typically to train on your own to go to school to become an airline mechanic $50,000 for tuition. If you apprentice for United, you make $24 to $52 an hour, so forget about the tuition, you're getting paid the entire time. There are so many labor shortages right now at the airlines. We've been telling you about pilots. United has its own program to tackle this called the Aviate academy, I've seen it myself. Airlines are really trying to tackle this issue, especially with the holidays on the horizon. We know that staffing issues contributed to a lot of cancellations and delays over the summertime, Bianna.",

I mean, the Federal Reserve is moving with almost unprecedented speed here. They've gone from zero interest rates to 4 percent in about eight months. We really haven't seen anything like that since at least the early 1980s and this is raising some concerns because central bank policy hits the real economy with a lag.It actually takes many months before you actually feel it. It's kind of like if you took pain medicine for a headache, you might not feel it right away. But it doesn't mean it's not working. So the concern is that the Fed may end up going too far and they may raise interest rates so high that they cause a recession and they don't realize they've gone too far. Now, everyone is wondering when the Fed is going to slow the pace of interest rate hikes and Jerome Powell offered some hints about how that could be coming soon. Listen to what he said.

The other question is whether or not the Fed should pause here. Take a minute to look around and see how much damage has been done to the economy and how inflation has cooled off or not.On that point, Powell went on to say that he does not think it's time to pause. He said it is too premature at this point to even start talking or thinking about a pause, which I think is an interesting point there. So Bianna, I think there's a little bit of something for everyone. Maybe the Fed is going to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes, but clearly they are not ready to declare victory anytime soon.",

We're already seeing the impact of this really all across different borrowing classes. So, for example, mortgage rates as we know, they have more than doubled this year.Look at credit card rates. I mean, credit card rates are now at about 18.7 percent, on average. And I talked to an analyst earlier this morning from Bankrate, who suggests that he believes Bankrate credit cards are actually going to be approaching 19 percent as early as next week. That is something we have not seen in about three decades. So that pain that Powell will talk about, some are already feeling that in terms of, one, by the way, these higher costs in terms of inflation, oh, and by the way, also higher borrowing costs, so you're getting hit on both sides and so some are already feeling that.",

Most important issue to your midterm vote 51 percent of likely voters in this poll say it's the economy and inflation.The only other issue, you see there that cracks double digits is abortion and that's way down at 15 percent. So this is an economy election. What I find so interesting is when you look at it by party, you see a different issue matrix, depending on - if you're a likely Democratic voter or Republican voter. Look there, among Democrats, the economy inflation is still important, 27 percent say so. But abortion actually edges that out at 29 percent voting rights, gun policy in double digits. Republican likely voters, there's like nothing going on for them, but the economy, seven out of 10 of them say it is the most important issue to their vote, everything else is single digits.",

If you look at that, compared to his modern era predecessors, he's down in the range of where Donald Trump was in 2018, of where Ronald Reagan was. And you see, he's even ticked down from where he was there in September and October, we had him at 44 percent.

And, of course, there are partisan divides here. When you look at it by party, we see that among Republicans, nearly six in 10, 59 percent are not confident that elections will reflect the will of the people.

So I think that's why I'm not on that final list. This is going to come down to turnout in my district. Again, as I said, the polling here shows a tide race. And where we have a huge advantage is that in this year, unlike 2020, and much like in 2018, we've got our army of volunteers out on the doors again and the Republicans don't have that.",

It's a very, very clear choice for them. And you're right, my opponent is running on personal smears.
