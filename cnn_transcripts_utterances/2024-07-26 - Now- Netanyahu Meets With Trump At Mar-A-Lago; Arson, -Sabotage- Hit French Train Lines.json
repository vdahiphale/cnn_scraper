      "sentences": "All right. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. We begin this hour with breaking news as Kamala Harris is racking up more endorsements.Former President Donald Trump is meeting behind closed doors with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. It's the first time the two have met since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. And a major issue looming over their meeting is Israel's war in Gaza. Trump is also wavering in the meantime and whether he will square off in a debate with the vice president as she is rising in the polls. Lots to get to at this hour. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach for us. Kristen, first, if you can tell us a little bit more about this meeting between the former president and Prime Minister Netanyahu, what can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, so any moment now, we're expecting the Prime Minister to arrive at Mar-a-Lago. They're going to have this sit down meeting. We expect to get photos out of it and a readout.And just to be clear, when it comes to what they can and cannot talk about, or at least what they're going to share, Trump is still technically a civilian. He is not a world leader. So he can't do any sort of negotiating with Netanyahu because of the Logan Act. That is still illegal. But we do expect to see some kind of conversation come out of this. I will remind you about their relationship because it's been somewhat fraught in recent years. The two were incredibly close when Donald Trump was in the White House. They worked together. Then Trump really turned on Netanyahu, particularly after Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on winning the election, something that Donald Trump viewed as disloyal. And I will tell you, Jim, I was here in Palm Beach when Donald Trump was giving a speech just after the October 7th terrorist attack, and he laid into Netanyahu, essentially blamed him for the terror attack, saying that it was his fault, that it was an intelligence failure. And a lot of his supporters, particularly his Jewish supporters, pushed back on him for saying that. Now apparently the ice is softened. They're going to sit down together. Clearly, this is a step forward in that way, particularly if Donald Trump is to be reelected to the White House. His team says he is looking forward to working with Netanyahu if he is in fact reelected. But obviously that is still down the road. Right now, they are just sitting down for a meeting.",

Harris took the lead in addressing what they discussed, saying she, quote, will not be silent about the humanitarian crisis and the suffering in Gaza. I mean, it was definitely a different tone from the Vice President versus what were hearing from President Biden. How might this compare with what we could hear from Donald Trump? I mean, Trump has in the last couple of days also indicated he would like to see Netanyahu wrap up the war in Gaza and so on.",

He's saying it's bad public relations for Netanyahu, that they're losing the PR battle. So just to be clear, there are some differences there. I would not expect him to come out and blame Netanyahu in any way publicly.Remember, Donald Trump has said over and over again that he is the staunchest supporter of Israel. He has a lot of Jewish supporters, Republicans like Miriam Adelson, who he has always tried to please and walk that line with. So I would not see him coming out and saying anything other than he completely stands with Israel.",

So I imagine we'll get there. Yes, this is going to be a series of new negotiations. And a debate about debates is nothing new in presidential politics, of course.And look, I -- I want to give Maria credit for -- for doing her best to, you know, shine everything over there, but I -- I wonder if whatever Snoop Dogg was carrying is being passed around Democratic circles these days. Because, look, Donald Trump knows exactly how to run a race against Kamala Harris. And all he has to do is focus on her voting record when she's a U.S. senator. Focus on the far left thing she said when she was running for president, or focus on the record that the voters of America have shown they disapprove of since she's been vice president alongside Joe Biden. And, you know, we've seen recently, you know, now people say keep the receipts. In this case, we're saying keep the real. You have Kamala Harris saying she wants to take away good quality health insurance from middle class families by abolishing private insurance. That despite the fact that illegal immigration is one of the number one issues to voters right now, she says being in the country is not illegal. And not only that, she wants to use taxpayer dollars, U.S. tax funds to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants. The list goes on and on. And as soon as those clips are replayed for swing voters in all these key states, what you're seeing right now is really, it's going to be a close race. Both sides are energized, both sides are enthused. But at the end of the day, the voters in the middle are not going to vote for someone who's more representative of San Francisco, California, than they are of their everyday concerns.",

Only two of them made it.And when you look at a map of the country and where those coordinated sabotage attacks happened, some cases cables were cut and other arson was used. But they are very strategic, and this was clearly done by someone who had good knowledge of France's railway network. Very carefully prepared, very carefully planned and timed, of course, to cause maximum disruption, even as Paris was preparing to celebrate what is likely to be the most spectacular opening ceremony we've ever seen since it's happening not in a stadium, but on the River Seine, clearly huge security across the French capital has been put in place, Jim. But this was an attack that would have been very difficult for French authorities to foresee. Lots of speculation about who might be responsible. Remember that this is a period of particular political turmoil here in France. We know that the far left are extremely disgruntled about not having been able to name a prime minister as part of the winning coalition on the left that soar off the far right of the last parliamentary elections. Lots of speculation about whether these are the tactics of the far left. We were speaking to a security source who says that is what it looks like, although there's nothing to pin the far left for these attacks so far. Many questions about who might have been responsible. Very few questions, though, about the timing. This was clearly aimed at causing maximum disruption ahead of the summer games when all eyes are very much on Paris, Jim.",

There are a number of artists, of course, involved. There are dancers planned to be dancing on the rooftops of Paris. Clearly, if the rain continues, that will prevent it.
