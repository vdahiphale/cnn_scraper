And I'm Kaitlan Collins.We're expecting Donald Trump to speak at any moment now, not far from where I am, tonight, gathered at a high-powered dinner for the political elite. Right now, you can see the former President sitting with Melania Trump at his side, a rare joint appearance from the two of them, in the closing weeks of this campaign. The Trumps are seated right next to Cardinal Dolan. And right next to Cardinal Dolan is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who, just a few months ago, Trump called Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the United States, I should note, a proud member of Hamas. And yes, if you look at the top left corner of your screen, that is the New York Attorney General, Tish James, sitting over Donald Trump's right shoulder, among a few other notable names. We're going to bring those remarks to you live. Because what all of these people are gathered at is known as the Al Smith Dinner. It happens every year. But also, it gets the most attention just before the election, where typically the two presidential candidates are there, dressed up in their Sunday-best, to make lighthearted speeches, and poke fun at themselves and each other, to benefit Catholic charities. It's usually a rare moment of levity, on the campaign trail. This year, maybe not so much. Vice President Harris decided against attending tonight's dinner. Instead, sending along a videotaped message. She's instead rallying in battleground Wisconsin. And there may not have been much for her to laugh at, if she was there, especially when your opponent is floating the idea of using the U.S. military against his political opponents. The Vice President actually brought that comment up from Donald Trump, tonight, while she was out on the campaign trail in Wisconsin. And she also went after Trump on reproductive rights, playing his own words for the crowd, when doing some roasting of her own.

How it went down is nothing short of extraordinary. Israeli forces were in a firefight with Hamas. They sent a drone into the building that they had just struck. And as that drone entered the second floor, as you are seeing here, there, sitting in that chair, his face covered, is Yahya Sinwar, in his final moments alive. The IDF says that his hand had been shot. He's holding what appears to be a stick, as you can see there. He then throws it at the drone that is staring him down. That would be the last thing that he saw before moments later, the IDF leveled the building, eliminating the leader of Hamas. As proof for the world to see, they released this footage. I must warn you, some may find it disturbing. Showing Sinwar's body in the rubble. Israel says that he was identified by his dental records, his fingerprints and DNA. The most hunted man in Gaza, as you can see here, now gone. My sources tonight are: CNN's Chief Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. Retired Army Major Mike Lyons. And Israeli journalist, Nadav Eyal, who is also professor at Columbia School of International and Public Affairs. I mean, John, the fact that this happened is massive.

They spotted people. They encountered them. Shots were fired. And they sent a -- they sent a tank round into that building. And then, rather than go running in, to see who was there, because of booby traps, and IEDs, and everything else they've experienced on their rounds there, they sent that drone in, and they looked at that subject.

Obviously, just a foundational moment that had such a deep impact, obviously, with so many Israelis brutally killed that day.What does a moment like this just mean? I mean, everyone in Israel, we saw celebrations today, just in this moment. NADAV EYAL, ISRAELI JOURNALIST, AUTHOR, \"REVOLT,\" COLUMNIST, ISRAELI YEDIOT DAILY NEWSPAPER: Well, I think that Americans can relate to this because of the killing of Osama bin Laden. For Israelis, this is a somber moment, but it's a watershed moment. They did not only manage to get to Sinwar. Israeli Air Force got to Hassan Nasrallah, and Fuad Shukr, the Chief of Staff of Hezbollah, and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. And actually, if you look at the so-called Axis of Resistance, or the Axis of Terror, every leader of that axis is now gone, besides the leader of the Houthis, and the Supreme Leader of Iran. And this is for, Israelis, something that is maybe more than Osama bin Laden. Because it was prophesized by many in the West that it would be impossible. You had intelligence reports, saying whatever the IDF is going to do in Gaza, and specifically in Rafah, is going to be immaterial. They're not going to get anywhere. And they got him. And the way that they got him, as John just mentioned, was through going house to house in a specific neighborhood called Tel es-Sultan, which is a stronghold of Hamas, where they thought they might find him, not far from the place in which six hostages, one of them an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin were murdered. And they found DNA evidence that Yahya Sinwar was in that tunnel, in the proximity, in terms of time to the time in which these hostages were murdered. And it's very possible that he was there with them. And because he was running away from the IDF, they were ordered shot and murdered there, and he began his struggle to survive in that neighborhood. And of course, he failed.",

The big question, though, is, what does this mean? What are the next steps in this war? You're hearing from President Biden praising this. But that is the question is, what is the day after? Because this is one of Netanyahu's stated goals in the war that Israel has been conducting in Gaza.MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, Kaitlan, first of all, Israel fights like a superpower. They use incredible intelligence, airstrikes, drone technology. When you look at that video of them taking of Sinwar there. The fact that they wanted to definitely identify him. They don't rush in there. I mean, they've become masters now at urban warfare. I hope the United States Army, and I'm sure we are, we're going to bring these people back to our war colleges, and we study -- we'll study this for years. But what's next? Lot of confusion. There's going to be confusion on, really, three elements. First, Hamas leadership. What does that look like? I mean, that didn't look like a military leader there in that room. There's no radios around him. He's not commanding anything. He's an aspirational leader, and that's about it. So, he was not commanding people on the ground. So anything that's going on in Hamas militarily is very dispersed. There's no -- it's all about intent right now. So that's the first thing. There's going to be chaos there. I think the second thing in there is Israel's not stopping. They're going to continue to put military pressure on, as they should, right now. They'll maybe a short window of, you know, kind of a pausing a little bit. But they're not going to stop. They're going to continue to go after Hamas, go after their capability to wage war.

Version one. Hamas announces a new leader within 72 hours, and says, It is so and so. Questions spill from that. Is it Mohammed Sinwar, or is it somebody from the political side? What does the new leadership signal to what could happen at a table of negotiators, in Qatar? But then, what else do they do? Do they take a stand and send some long-range missiles into Israel that they still have stashed someplace, to say, We have a new leader and we're back in business? Now for Bibi, that means, OK, we're back in the war game. This isn't what it could have been. The flip side of that is, does Bibi say, Sinwar is dead, Hamas is crushed. I have broken Hezbollah on the other side. So Iran, who was 10-feet tall, a month and a half ago, their sword is broken, their proxy is disabled.

She is campaigning from a position of strength, from a position of confidence.I think doing the Fox interview fed into that confidence. She gave it to Bret Baier. She got some really tough questions. She answered them well. And then, she also called him out on something, when he tried to pretend that Donald Trump said something that he didn't. She called him out on it, and he apologized. He realized what he had done. So, I think that what she's doing now, she's going to all of the platforms to speaking to all of the voters, because this is going to be a campaign, and an election that is going to be won on the margins. And there are a lot of Republicans, I think, disaffected Republicans, even people who voted for Trump in 2020, who are now seeing Trump now. And even though people say, Oh, but people know what they're getting with Trump. Trump has been more deranged every time he speaks, and a lot of people are saying it, he is not the same man that he was in 2020. And that, I think, is something that the Kamala Harris campaign is focusing on, message-wise, about how dangerous he is, how unserious he is, but the consequences of him getting into office again will be brutally serious.",
