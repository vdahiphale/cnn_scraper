The other half of the story is playing out here today, that is which Republican will be nominated to challenge him in the fall.And it has been a divisive heated campaign. A three-way contest, as you said. Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running as well as State Senator Matt Dolan, and Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno. Former President Donald Trump has weighed in aggressively in this race. He is backing Bernie Moreno. But the governor of the state, Mike DeWine, he is backing Matt Dolan. Of course, their styles are different. Their substance is different. We caught up with Senator Dolan last night. He had this to say about the importance of this race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, a bit of a not-so-veiled reference, perhaps to former President Donald Trump, who was here in Ohio over the weekend campaigning for Bernie Moreno. He was aggressively going after Matt Dolan, whose family happens to own the Cleveland Guardians, of course, the longtime baseball franchise. Trump was criticizing them for changing the name from the Cleveland Indians.So, that, of course, has nothing to do with this Senate race. But, Wolf, if it just gives you a sense of how expensive and how acrimonious this race has been. Some $40 million was spent in TV ads alone on this. The reason it matters is of course, Sherrod Brown is one of two incumbent Democratic senators, the other being John Tester in Montana, that really are running in red states, in states that Trump won significantly. So, Sherrod Brown for him to win a fourth term, he clearly needs to win over some Trump voters as well. We talked with him yesterday. He said he has run against presidents of both parties. He is a representative of the people. So, this will be a test of his strength. No doubt, Wolf. But first things first, this primary tonight will show who Sherrod Brown is running against, and if Republicans believe they have a strong chance to beat him in November, Wolf.",

At this moment when the Jewish community feels so very much at risk, it is -- it is dangerous and it's divisive to bring the Jewish community in to a debate in a way that tells them what they believe, how they behave as Jews, how they feel about Israel. This is a moment again, where in every part of the country and all around the world, the Jewish community is really facing dramatically increasing antisemitism, and where Israel is fighting for its survival. As this political season moves forward, I hope that both President Trump and President Biden and every political candidate running for office will understand that the Jewish community should not be used in some political purpose.And that in fact, Wolf, the last thing I'll say here is when you suggest that the Jewish people only -- to have felt a certain way about Israel, there are so many unfortunately right now who are at the same time invoking dual loyalty and old antisemitic trope. This is what we're battling. So, let's try to focus on the issues at hand. Let's try to think of ways to actually bring the Jewish community together. That's what -- that's what we do. That's the way we need to focus. And political comments like this make it increasingly more difficult that they're dangerous, and we shouldn't hear them any further.",

And we don't let Hamas drive the narrative coming out of what happens.At this moment, let's respect differences.

So, obviously, we can't have our cameras on the inside. But I do believe, and this was the first time that the victims, Eddie Parker, Michael Jenkins, had a chance to hear from the family and also Hunter himself. And when he turned around and looked directly at him, he actually asked the judge for permission to do this. The entire court stopped. And you can see the tears flowing from their faces. When the victim impact statements were read, and it talked about how they were brutalized over and over, no one could believe some of the things that were read, especially in 2023, to think that not only did they plan this out, they actually had a text message stream that they would coordinate with each other. They showed up to the house, they made sure there were no cameras that would see them, and then they broke into the home and tortured these men for over two hours. And after this was all done and after the gun was placed in the mouth of Mr. Jenkins, and the shot was fired and his tongue was severed, they cleaned everything up, Wolf, to make sure there will be no evidence left behind. And one of the things that we wanted to play in that soundbite, and we didn't get all of it to you was I asked his father, why did he want his son to tell the truth? He looked me in the eye. He said the reason why he wanted his son to tell the truth is there's no way there could be healing, not only for their family, but for the victim's family, and all of Rankin County unless someone stepped forward and told the truth. So, it seems like the family's indicating that it was Elward who helped give the government evidence in all this case. The government, for its part, pointed out very clearly that they believe these are sort of tears of fiction at this point. Because at every step of the way, they went to show a cover-up and to show that these men intended to put harm on these two men for dating a white woman. And they told him to go back across the river to Jackson. These are words that were said in open court. Let's not forget there are more sentencing that's coming ahead. We have five more men who will face charges. And the other victim did come forward and put a victim statement, something that will continue to follow, Wolf.",
