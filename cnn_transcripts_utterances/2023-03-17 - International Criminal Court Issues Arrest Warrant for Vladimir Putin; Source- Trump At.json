The International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin today. The Russian president and another top official are accused of committing war crimes by deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Then, could this be furry mammal be responsible for the COVID pandemic? New data from a wet market in China links the virus to raccoon dogs, raising new questions if animal sold at the market were at the origin of the global pandemic and not a lab leak. Plus, are you sick of getting annoying spam texts? The new rules that will force phone companies to crack down on those robo texts blowing up your phone. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start today with our world lead and an arrest warm issued for Vladimir Putin. This afternoon, the Kremlin is trying to dismiss the warrant for the Russian president, issued by the International Criminal Court. Earlier today, the ICC alleging that Putin and his commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, forcibly detained thousands of Ukrainian kids, and then deported them to Russia. Putin's spokesman called the warrants, quote, outrageous, and unacceptable, and they are, these warrants, likely symbolic, as Putin would either have to be handed over the Kremlin, which he controls with an iron fist, or arrested outside of Russia to face trial. But top Ukrainian officials are applauding the move with one saying, quote, the wheels of justice are turning, unquote. Let's bring in CNN's Matthew Chance and Clarissa Ward. Clarissa is at The Hague in the Netherlands, where the ICC meets. And, Clarissa, you spoke with the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court about these warrants.

In fact, it seems to be proud of the fact that so many children from the war zone in Ukraine have been taken into the Russian federation.It sells it domestically as an act of mercy, to rescue these unwanted orphans, as it characterizes them, who have been abandoned by the authorities in Kyiv, and bring them into the safe, welcoming arms of the Russian federation. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, his children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, have spoken about it on television. They talk about how members of these -- this group of children have been adopted. Lvova-Belova herself has apparently adopted a child from Mariupol. She has spoken in the past about how none of these children were -- had to be re-educated because they were singing the Ukrainian national anthem. But, you know, with re-education, they develop a love for the country. So, it's quite chilling stuff, and all this remember as many of these children still have living parents in Ukraine, who, of course, desperately want them back.",

Certainly, there's no shortage of potential other war crimes that Putin and others could be charged with. WARD: This is something we asked about, why this specific case? Why the deported children? I think, you know, as Matthew just outlined there, it's low hanging fruit, in a sense, because the Russians have not really tried to hide it. But it is by no means the only line of investigation that they're pursuing. Karim Khan has called the whole of Ukraine as basically a crime scene. He's looked into the massacre in Bucha. Obviously, they're looking into things like what happened in Mariupol where the theater where civilians were sheltering were killed in air strikes and many others. The other thing that's interesting is the nature of the charges could change. So, at this point, the arrest warrant is for war crimes, but under the Rome statute under the ICC, that could potentially change, even to something like crimes against humanity, or potentially even genocide because technically, the forced deportation of children falls under the rubric of both of those charges, as well. So this is a way to get your foot in the door and start the investigation and the proceedings.

This is the Rome statue, the founding act of the ICC, and each of those countries is legally bound to arrest people who have been indicted by the organization.But Russia isn't one of them, for instance, so Russia isn't legally bound to send Vladimir Putin to the court. You mentioned the G20. The next one is going to be held in India. India isn't a signatory either. So, possibly, Putin can go there, too. And the U.N. General Assembly, the United States in New York, United States isn't even a signatory of the ICC. And so, while Putin's options are limited, it is possible to navigate this geographically.

There are questions whether all of this intervention, including the 11 banks banding together, as you pointed out, also what we saw on Sunday in terms of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department providing that life line, that backstop there with that line of credit, whether that will ultimately be enough.I mean, even for example with First Republic, despite that cash infusion that it received from those 11 banks, despite the fact that it announced credit's borrowing more than $100 billion from the Federal Reserve, it also announced that it's cutting its dividend, which suggests it's in a position where it still feels like it needs to shore up cash, but it still feels like that it could be having some financial difficulties. So investors don't like that, but it's also the larger confidence that we're dealing with in the banking system, a large erosion of trust as one economist said on our air earlier today. And, Jake, as you know, I mean, you think about erosion of trust even in personal relationships, it takes some time to rebuild that trust. So I think the question now is, how long is this ultimately going to take, and how much damage that lack of trust can really create in the banking system.",

These are major sources of lending.Take a look, this coming from Goldman Sachs, pointing out that these banks, they're responsible for 45 percent of consumer lending, 60 percent of residential real estate lending. So, Jake, in an environment like we find ourselves in now, you have to imagine banks are going to become more risk averse and more careful about lending, that they might tighten standards. And what that means for all of us is that it essentially becomes harder to borrow, maybe harder to get a car loan. If you're a small business, it might be harder to get a loan. So it will have all sorts of implications in terms of the larger economy. Goldman Sachs saying larger banks sitting on deposits that aren't FDIC insured, listen to this, we could see a pullback in lending from 15 percent to 40 percent.

If you've never heard of raccoon dogs, well, they've never heard of you either.But this is it. This is what it is. It's a mammal that aligns more closely with raccoons and with dogs. International scientists examined previously unavailable genetic samples taken from the Wuhan market early in the pandemic where raccoon dogs were known to be traded. The genetic samples were quietly posted on a data sharing platform in January, then taken down earlier this month after international scientists began asking Chinese researchers about it. Let's bring in Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, obviously, it's been difficult to determine COVID's origin, especially because of the lack of transparency from Chinese officials. What can we learn from this new data? And bottom line, are we ever going to know for certain where COVID really came from? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, two questions there. First of all, I think that this new data is really interesting, but it's not conclusive. Can we ever learn? I think what this new data shows us more than anything is that there is data out there that could help answer this question. That data has been very hard to come by because of the opaqueness, the opacity of the Chinese government. Jake, this is like a scientific drama on this story. So these samples taken in March of 2020 that are intermittently made available for researchers to look at. They said yeah, we've looked at these samples taken from the Huanan seafood market, and there's really no evidence of anything other than there was COVID there like there was in a lot of places in Wuhan. [16:30:00] All of a sudden, just this past week, the samples show up on a server again. And you got these researchers around the country who are constantly hitting refresh to see if there's any new data on these servers, and they say, yeah, this new data showed up, so they quickly downloaded it. And what they found was this -- in samples that had previously been positive for COVID-19, they also saw that there was the presence of this animal DNA in those samples as well. That animal, as you pointed out, the raccoon dog. A type of animal that is known to be able to carry coronaviruses and possibly transmit them. So that's what we know now, there was animal DNA, COVID DNA intermixed within the Huanan seafood market in March of 2020. It's not a silver bullet. It doesn't answer us for sure, because what you need to know is in the actual infected animal. You would also need to know a timeline, meaning is it possible humans could have still brought the virus to the market and the raccoon dogs got infected by humans? It's possible. So, it's really interesting but not definitive. And I'll just leave with this as well, Jake, you know, you may say, why is this data so hard to come by? Remember, the sort of narrative from the Chinese government is that COVID, they say it originated in the United States, in Maryland at an army lab. So there is lots of reasons that this data has been hidden or at least suppressed.",

If you look at another map that looks at transition, there is still a lot of COVID out there. There's still a lot of people who are getting exposed to the virus, but seemingly getting more minor illness as a result of the amount of infection acquired immunity out there.

We have known that for some time. I mean, when we were growing up, Jake, there was no devices in social media, but there were magazines, you know, where you had sort of unrealistic models and stuff on the covers. The difference now is the abundance of these images, and the persistence of these images. Kids are carrying these around on their phones all the time. It is teen girls most affected. Filters and those things are not going away, Jake. What I think is interesting is when you talk to the makers of these filters and say what is really going on here? What are those fillers supposed to be doing? Listen to what their concerns are. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KENEISHA SINCLAIR-MCBRIDE, CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST: A lot of the filters kind of have a very Eurocentric lens. So, it would be great if they did not make people's skin colors lighter or change the shape of their noses or change how big their eyes are, or do things that make them more towards a standard of beauty that may not be from the cultural background they are from, right?

It does not have the votes to pass, and so I still have to filibuster it.So I can still go on week four of filibustering, but I did take yesterday morning off of filibustering for an hour and a half. So it was a short pause. I will be back at filibustering next week. It will be four weeks of filibustering. Assuming that the trans bill fails, the anti-affirming care bills on cloture, then hopefully we as a legislature can move forward and stop trying to legislate hate.",

But she introduced a bill and she says, quote, Senator Cavanaugh, that's you, your comments that she doesn't care if nothing gets done, it reflects a disregard for the citizens of Nebraska. By postponing the debate, through the filibuster, Senator Cavanaugh has thrown away our ability to hear many bills on many topics. It's been a selfish calculation to gain attention -- cloaked in the insincere guise of defending gender dysphoric youth -- at the expense of our constituents, unquote.So what is your response to her? CAVANAUGH: What I am doing is not selfish. I'm not doing this for myself. It would be much easier to do anything other than what I'm doing. I'm doing this to protect the children of Nebraska, the most vulnerable children are trans youth who need to have people, especially the adults in the room, standing up for them and standing up for their rights. I would say that what she's doing is completely inappropriate, and outside the scope of what our government should be doing. Our government should not be legislating away parental rights and medical decision making. And as someone who vehemently opposed vaccines, I think that it's really inappropriate for her to be pushing something like this.",

So, when you get a spam text, it can contain a link that if you click on it could lead you to malicious software being downloaded on your device or maybe it takes you to a website that can get your personal information and it get stolen.That's different than a robocall where, you know, there isn't that link that's very easily clickable or tappable. But, you know, speaking of robocalls, the SEC and the state governments have actually made a lot of progress in reducing the volume of robocalls, thanks to law enforcement efforts. Unfortunately, that's lead to a surprising rise in the spam and scam texts which brings us to these rules that the FCC is imposing now. What is the FCC actually doing? Let's take a look. It's saying phone companies have to block text messages from numbers that are, quote, unlikely to transmit text messages, numbers that are invalid, unallocated or unused or numbers that the government says are not used for texting at all. That's basically meant to prevent texts from being spoofed or being sent as impersonations of government agencies. That's not all. The FCC is also considering new rules, future looking rules that would apply do not call protection to these sorts of text messages in the future, but, again, that's just a proposal for now. We'll see how that goes.",
