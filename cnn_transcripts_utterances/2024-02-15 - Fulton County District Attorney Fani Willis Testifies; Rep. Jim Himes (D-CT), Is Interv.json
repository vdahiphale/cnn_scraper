LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: I have been completely riveted all day listening to this. The big question before this judge today was not an episode out of so called real housewives. It was about whether there was a romantic relationship from which finding Willis derived a financial benefit in actually bringing this case. That was what needed to be proven. That is the conflict of interest that could potentially lead to disqualification. And just so you know, Jake, it's not just her who would need to be disqualified, it'd be the entire team. A separate entity would come in, replace that team. They're not beholden to try to follow what she indicted or even continue with the case. But there was never a moment where either Nathan Wade nor Fani Willis actually conceded that their relationship began before he was hired as special counsel and part of the team. There was a witness, a former friend, a former employee of the DA's office in Fulton County, Ms. Yeartie, from whom Fani Willis leased a condo, who said, absolutely, they were romantically involved back in 2019. Now, there was an axe to grind they did bring out. This woman had been a former employee. She resigned on penalty, eventually being fired. There is obviously a contentious relationship now going between her and Fani Willis. And you know what was really surprising, Jake? The attorney asking questions, did not follow up. Did not ask questions like, well, how speedily did you actually see them romantically involved? She mentioned kissing and hugging, didn't say the location or the time frame. That was a point of issue here. But ultimately, the issue is, was there a financial benefit? And they had a very hard time creating that through line from point A to point B.",

But it wasn't until August 2023 where they had what she called the hard conversation and that's when, in her mind, the relationship ended.

Consequences be damned.Now, they have to actually get to the meat of the matter. None of what we've heard today has anything to do with the underlying facts of the actual indictment. And remember, the standard by which you must prove for somebody to get disqualified means that the nature of this relationship would have been such a conflict of interest as to deny Donald Trump or the other, what, 17 defendants, some of whom have already pled guilty of a fair trial. That's the connection that has to be made here. But remember, ultimately, there's also the shame factor here. Can you imagine, Jake, if were sitting here today and watching, say, Jack Smith on the stand, testifying about his sexual relationships, what impact that would have on an overall jury pool, on a credibility assessment, trying to parse through whether he began or ended a relationship, whether he was married, the technicality or not, whether he was paying for trips or somebody was paying him back on Cash App, part of the whole point of this was to really maybe death by a thousand cuts in credibility that we're not talking about. And this court is not talking about the underlying facts here. But they've done themselves no favors here. There is the optics. There are the moments where people are questioning what the motivation may have been. But at the end of the day, they need to establish, to disqualify her that there was a financial benefit such that it would deny Trump a fair trial or any of the other defendants. And so far, this judge does not seem to be particularly persuaded or visibly persuaded in that direction. In fact, I was actually surprised that she took the stand.

You're going to have reporters at your door. And so it probably would have been important to say, look, we're not talking about an imminent threat. We're talking about a dangerous capability that I think the public and the world should know about because it affects more than just us, of course. So, you know, I don't have a lot of criticism for it because I do believe that it should be declassified.",

It's not an imminent threat, and it's something people should know about and they should know who they're dealing with, I think. And I think information is important.",

They make no sense because our argument never relied on whether Russia was a threat with dangerous capabilities. That was never our argument. Our argument is that you can't allow sovereign countries to be invaded because people want to take their stuff.All right, we haven't seen that since the World War II era. And if you go back to that pre-World War II world order where everyone's just invading everyone, well, you're not going to have the lifestyle that you like, right? There's a domino effect there. And so we have an interest in stopping that, to stop a greater war, because if they beat Ukraine, they're on the border of four more NATO countries. That's our argument. Our argument has never been, we're worried that Russia is going to nuke us. You know, they've had nuclear weapons this whole time that can target the U.S. So this isn't like a new thing necessarily. So it's never been our argument. And the accusations that this is some cynical ploy to get more Ukraine aided it doesn't make sense on its face.",
