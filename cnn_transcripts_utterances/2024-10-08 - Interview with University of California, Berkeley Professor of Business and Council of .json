Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It is crunch time for both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, four weeks until Election Day. Americans are on the verge of making one of the most important decisions of theirs and all of our times. And as with most elections, the economy's issue number one for voters, but also in focus like never before are reproductive rights after Roe versus Wade was overturned in 2022. On the surface, these two issues may not seem related, but economist Laura Tyson argues that they are actually linked. Tyson, who advised President Clinton, as the first female head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is now a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, and she's joining me now from there. Laura Tyson, welcome to the program. LAURA D. TYSON, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY AND FORMER CHAIR, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  It's a wonderful pleasure to be with you, Christiane. Thank you.",

And somehow these links, very obvious to women, seem to be totally lost in discussions by a lot of the economic advisers about the economy. So, I decided I wanted to write this piece to really document all of the ways in which reproductive rights, abortion rights, the freedom to choose, freedom to decide what to do with your body really affect the economy. And as I said, there have been numerous studies over many years. In fact, there was a very powerful amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court at the timing of the Dobbs decision, where a lot of these effects were laid out. A lot of the economic implications of taking away the right that was available in Roe. So, I can certainly enumerate them. And --",

So, I guess I want to ask you, are there any examples of states in the United States, since 2022 and the reversal of Roe versus Wade, that show an economic lag or some kind of effect on women, children, and the state of economic health in states that are much more strict on this and restrictive?",

So, basically, I think that, right now, you have a situation. So, the problem here is that this is much more burdensome for poor women. So, a lot of the abortion restrictions occur in the states where the percentage of women in poverty is higher, the percentage of children in poverty is higher, the likelihood that a mother -- a single mother living in poverty, if she cannot get an abortion will have another child living in poverty. Those are the ways it shows up. The incidence of this is quite uneven and it is lower income women in poor states that are the most restrictive that cannot find a way to get an abortion. We have, still in the United States, several states that allow that, but the economic effects there are who can afford to do that, who can even have the knowledge to do that?

But she also, for her economic policy, wants to increase the child tax credit, increase spending on child care and on elder care, and to encourage home ownership and new housing construction.

Apparently, the committee for a response which is a nonpartisan organization says both candidates' policies will increase the federal deficit, which is already quite considerable. They estimate though that Trump's will increase it much more like twice as much as Harris. What do you make of that analysis?

Harris is proposing to try to cover her new programs by a fair higher tax burden on the very wealthy and on corporations. And she actually has a pay for plan for most of the things that she wants to introduce, most of which are care related. OK. They are care related. She wants to expand the earn and income tax credit, which as far as the economy is concerned, that is one thing we know does work at putting people to work.

We did not have that bout of inflation that occurred post-COVID in 2021 and 2022. So, basically, people are mainly responding to higher prices. And related to that, to higher interest rates and the ability to get a home loan or the willingness of people to sell their house if they actually have a real good low interest loan on it. So, I think what Harris has said numerous times is, yes, prices are too high. We want to do what we can to bring them down. So, for example, on prescription drugs, this is really important because the IRA, that Inflation Reduction Act, which was largely a climate act, but it did have the ability of the government to negotiate on drug prices. Do you know how important that is? The government is one of the biggest buyers of drugs in the world. We should be able to negotiate with companies on the price of their drugs. Every other buyer negotiates with drug companies. So, I do think we have to go after each area. Housing, she has said, OK. yes, housing prices are high, interest rates are coming down, but we have to do much more to build additional housing units. She's the only one with a detailed plan that most observers, economists, and people in the business community have said, yes, this is a pretty good plan. With a goal of 3 million additional housing units working with state and local governments. So, I think she -- what she's done is say, OK. Yes, prices are too high. Let's go brew price by price, area by area, what can we do over time to bring prices down? But I think that is probably the main reason why voters they -- when they think back to Trump and they say, well, what was good about that economy versus this economy, I think they would say prices (ph).",

Their bond crossed over from a boss and anemployee into the territory of very gentle, important female friendship. This really happened, this scene. It's something that actually did take place. I met a woman when I was researching the film, who's now in her 90s, who was a 15-year-old secretary at Vogue at the time, and she told me this story. She said, Kate, I will just tell you something that happened that was rather remarkable. Lee came in one day and she was rather drunk. She was in a terrible state and she was furious that more of her photographs hadn't been printed in British Vogue. And she started pulling open drawers and ripping open boxes until she found what she was looking for, her negatives. And she picked up my scissors and she started hacking, hacking into them. She -- as though she was trying to cut them out of herself. That's how I read that. And the only way this young girl could get Lee to stop cutting for fear that she was going to hurt herself, she said, now you look here, Lee Miller, those are my good scissors. You jolly well give them back. And Lee looked her in the eye and was almost startled by this young girl's firmness. And she stopped and she put the scissors down and she left. And I have actually held those cut up negatives myself in my hand. And when I heard that story, I knew it would have to be a part of our film precisely because of that deep metaphor that Lee was so traumatized and so desperately trying to get rid of these things that she had seen like so many people. Lee felt completely betrayed by that. And actually, there was an interview with Audrey that we listened to from the '80s before she died, where she does say that, in fact, it did haunt her for the rest of her life that she hadn't done more. But she did have them printed in American Vogue, in an article entitled \"Believe It.\" They were printed on a much larger scale and across many more pages in the end, and Audrey did fight for that.",
