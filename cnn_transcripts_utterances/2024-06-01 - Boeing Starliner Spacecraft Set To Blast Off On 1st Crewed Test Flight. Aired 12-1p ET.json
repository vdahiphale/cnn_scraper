We have an exciting program for you today, because within the next half an hour, we expect to witness the first ever Boeing Starliner spacecraft launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida to the International Space Station. This is not a practice run. This launch has two American astronauts on board.But officials and spectators are holding their breath a bit because this mission was already postponed a few times. Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are on board. And Boeing is trying with this to compete with its rival, SpaceX, as NASA tries to collaborate with private industry partners. If successful, Suni Williams would become the first woman aboard any crewed test flight like this. Years of work have gone into this moment and it has not been without setbacks as I have mentioned. So, let's bring in space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher. She is live at Kennedy Space Center for us, as well as former NASA administrator, Charles Bolden. OK. So, Kristin, is this going to happen today?",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, with about 24 minutes left on the countdown clock, we are go for launch. We've been watching two things this morning. Two potential problem spots for NASA Boeing and the United Launch Alliance, and that is first, the wind. It's been very gusty here but so far, so good on the weather front. The weather team saying we are go for launch as of now. And then, the other issue we've been watching has been an issue with the Centaur rocket. Let me just show you. This is an older model here. So, it's not perfectly accurate, but I'll give you an idea of what we're talking about.So, this is the both the Boeing Starliner capsule and spacecraft on top. This is where the two NASA astronauts are. What's below it is the Atlas rocket, and this is what's going to propel the Starliner spacecraft into orbit. This right here is called the rockets upper stage, it's the Centaur. And there was an issue here during that first scrub back on May 6th. Now, an issue again, but different. It's an issue with a sensor for a topping valve, essentially a valve that tops up the fuel inside this upper stage of the rocket. They went about through about an hour of checks trying to figure it out, they ended up switching to a backup system. They think they've got it fixed. So, we are now go for launch. And I should just point out, Alisyn. The capsule is made by Boeing. This whole rocket is made by the United Launch Alliance. So, different company. That's what the issue was with, as I mentioned back in May. But now, we're a go for launch. So, what can we expect in about 22 minutes. Hopefully, this spacecraft is going to launch from the Cape Canaveral -- Cape Canaveral Space Force Station up into orbit. And they are going to spend about eight days up at the International Space Station. And the reason this is so important, Alisyn, is because of the fact that NASA wants redundancy. They already have the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which can take NASA astronauts to the ISS. They want a backup alternative. That's what Boeing Starliner is. And Alisyn, you should ask Charlie Bolden about this, because he was the NASA administrator when Suni Williams was initially named to the Starliner crew back in 2015. That's how long she has been waiting to fly today.",

And trust me, they have seen every potential failure that can go with their spacecraft and they are ready to work up, you know, any malfunction that happens to come their way.So, when I say trivial chitchat, it -- I'm probably overestimating it there, but they are not, you know, they are not talking about problems with the vehicle, they are just talking about the things that they are going to have to do once liftoff occurs, because that's when -- that's when their work starts. They are -- hopefully, they are relaxing right now, and going in their heads over the procedures that they are going to have to do once they get lift off because they've got to get 12 minutes -- (CROSSTALK)",

There are some storms back off in the panhandle. Kind of the Big Bend area. Panama City getting some heavy rain, but those storms kind of dissipate before they can get to Cape Canaveral. So, you've got a couple of clouds out there, 84 degrees at that launch time. East winds at 15 miles per hour. Those easterly winds again have been kicking. This is a live update of some of those wind speeds they have been sustained, up around 70 miles per hour. Gusts up to 24 miles per hour.For launches as well, we also need to worry about the wind speeds not just kind of at the surface, but upstairs in the atmosphere as well. So, something to watch again, gusts up to 24 miles per hour right now out of the east. There is a look at some of those storms. The easterly winds will keep the storms kind of out in the Gulf of Mexico. So, not really expected to hit the Florida peninsula, which is good news, keeps the lightning and the heavy rain out of the way. You can see the line of storms kind of dip into the Gulf of Mexico and then continue to kind of dissipate. So, again, staying dry in Cape Canaveral.

The first flight in 2019 was the one where we had some software problems, and we were -- we overuse the propellant allocation, and we were not able to dock with the International Space Station. And then, we came back and flew several months ago, the -- a re-fly of the non-crewed test flights. So, this is -- this is actually test flight number three of a series of test flights.

So, it -- I guess it's potentially likely that we could still see a launch today, but this is looking increasingly, not likely that this launch is going to happen, because I just don't see how, how they can make that instantaneous launch window with a hold that is now this long.

There was an issue with a faulty sensor that's used when fueling this upper stage.And they say that they fix that problem. So, unclear if it's another issue with that faulty sensor, or if it's something else entirely. The other issue we ran into, of course, was with that flashing red light on Butch Wilmore's console, which was an issue with his spacesuit, specifically, the fan inside his suit, it wasn't circulating. And that's a problem because you don't want to overheat when you're inside this rocket. And then, the only other problem that we've really been monitoring, and so far, it hasn't been a problem, has just been the wind speeds. They are -- they are gusting a bit higher than NASA would like for a launch. But still, within the constraint -- when the constraints of what is considered to be acceptable for a launch for the Atlas V and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, just putting that model down there. It's not mine, so, I don't want to break it. But Alisyn, right now, we are just kind of everybody standing around and waiting. I'll tell you one more sign that's not a good sign. All of the NASA press personnel, everybody, they are typically watching this from inside a press office. They walked out to see the actual launch. And I just saw all of them walk back in. So, typically, when the NASA press team is walking back in, they tend to know things that maybe we don't know yet. Which is why, another reason why, I'm so skeptical that this launch is now going to happen, given the fact that it's now -- it's now 12:27. Yes, it's 12:27. We're now two minutes past that instantaneous launch window. I can't officially call it, but I think it's highly unlikely that this -- that this launch happens today, Alisyn, if impossible.

I know nothing about Starliner, but it's a spacecraft, and most spacecraft are similar in nature. Starliner is in many ways very similar to the shuttle in terms of systems, the way the crew interacts. This is a pilot's spacecraft.You know, it's got hand controllers. It's not a push button, do everything on the screen like the crew dragon. So my guess is there are a lot of systems, so they will have to save systems that were set in the position of being ready for a launch. And that's stuff that Butch and Suni have to do in the cockpit, you know, and they'll go through getting there. They'll probably, in fact, it looks like they've actually opened their visors already.

And since then, you know, everybody thought that Boeing, NASA's golden prime contractor for so many years during the shuttle program, was going to beat SpaceX's crew dragon to flying astronauts to the International Space Station. So many NASA astronauts back then wanted to be assigned to Boeing missions, not SpaceX.That clearly turned out to be dead wrong. I mean, since then, SpaceX has flown 13 crewed missions to the International Space Station. Boeing Starliner still has yet to get off the ground. So, yes, not what Boeing wanted, but this could not be a Boeing issue, right? I mean, the rocket itself that propels the Boeing Starliner spacecraft into space is designed by a different company, the United Launch Alliance. And that first scrub back in May was caused by an issue with the rocket, not Boeing Starliner spacecraft. So, yes, it's a setback for Boeing, but it's also potentially not even Boeing's fault here. Now, granted, they've had tons of technical and other issues and engineering problems along the way, but the scrub back in May wasn't their fault. And this one might not be, too. We just don't know yet. Also really important to point out here, Alisyn, that scrubs are really common in space flight. They happen all the time. The current NASA administrator, Bill Nelson's, his mission to space -- back on a space shuttle, it scrubbed four or five times, and that wasn't even a test flight. So these things happen. And there's especially an added layer of scrutiny around a first crewed test flight like this one. And, you know, the ULA, they even said that first scrub back in May, if there hadn't been a crew on board, if there had just been satellites and payloads on board like they normally fly, they would have already been in orbit. But because they were dealing with people on board instead of payloads and satellites, they were taking extra precautions. And so that may be what happened here. But we're now getting official confirmation that they are ready to proceed with the scrub. It's now an official scrub, but still no reason why. Alisyn?",

The two astronauts that we've been watching live on board, that's Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will be staying grounded today. So they were just under four minutes from launch, three minutes and 50 seconds, to be exact, when the automated system caused a hold. And we still don't know exactly why.All sorts of systems were stable and set to launch. But something has scrubbed this takeoff for today. So back with me are space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher at the Kennedy Space center and former NASA administrator Charles Bolden. Charles, disappointing, I'm sure, for you as well as for the astronauts, as well as all the spectators. Any idea of why this would happen?",

How do they come down from this experience?",

And then once I saw the clock go back, that's when my heart started beating because I knew weren't going to launch. And I think, I can't speak for Butch and Suni, but, you know, the potential for a scrub is always in their mind, but that's not something they expect.And when it does occur, it takes us a few seconds, if not minutes, for it to sink in but I'm not going today. And that's an incredible disappointment, you know, especially we went to the vehicle five times, Senator Nelson and I did. And we finally launched on our fifth launch attempt. And the bad part is we got down to T-14, T-31, T-31. If you're going to scrub, you want to go when you're not even close to going. Today is not as bad as it may be for the crew. Not going any day is bad, but at least they didn't get down into the final stages, you know, where they're all set and ready to go, and they're expecting ignition here in just a matter of seconds. So if there's a time to scrub, there is no good time, but it's best to do it a little bit farther out like this.",

You know, you've, as I understand, you've spent 204 days in space on the space station. And so have you had these experiences, these last minute, you know, T-minus four minutes, scrubs like this?O'HARA: I have kind of peripherally on my landing. The launch of my replacement, Tracy Dyson was scrubbed, actually. So I ended up staying on orbit a little bit longer. But astronauts, we train for things like this, and we're always ready if we need, if things don't go as planned. And so we'll reset and hopefully get to try again tomorrow.",
