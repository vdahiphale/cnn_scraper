Will he get cheers or jeers from the American people? Then, more than 12,000 people now have been killed. The death toll from the earthquake in Turkey and Syria continuing to rise to staggering heights as hope fades of finding any survivors left in the rubble. And, a passenger's battery catching on fire mid-flight, forcing a plane to make an emergency landing and sending four people to the hospital.

Right now, President Biden is in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, where he is talking jobs and the economy, echoing a lot of the same messages and themes from last night. Vice President Kamala Harris is in Georgia, another key battleground state, which you might recall the Biden/Harris ticket won by 179,000 votes. Tomorrow, Biden will head to Florida while Harris visits Minnesota. And their cabinet secretaries are also fanning out across the country. Now, yes, this is part of the blitz we've all come to expect after a president's State of the Union Address. But you can also not ignore the White House choices of where they are sending the president and vice president. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is releasing his own response to Biden's speech. Mike Pence is reiterating his calls for new Republican leadership. And Nikki Haley is teasing her expected 2024 campaign announcement. CNN's Phil Mattingly starts off our coverage today with a closer look at how Biden is testing out his message ahead of an expected reelection campaign announcement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, I agree that Twitter should not have suppressed that \"New York Post\" story about the laptop, but where is the evidence that they did it because the FBI told them to do so?

But when Elon Musk released the Twitter files, that allowed folks all around the world to see what was going on and to see different agencies reaching out and urging Twitter and other social media companies, I would gather based on the comments of the CEO of Facebook last year, to censor certain pieces of information, and one of the things that I talked about today, I had less focus on the laptop and more about COVID-19 because there are certain doctor is an epidemiologist that were educated at Harvard and Stanford that had a different take on immunity and vaccination and those voices were silenced, they were censured, blacklisted and shadow banned. And regardless if you're Republican or Democrat, this is a very slippery slope and it's the federal government coming after you vis-a- vis a private company.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over):  It is hard to imagine how this trouble gave anyone hope. Yet, for 50 or so hours after the quake, it almost did. When it stopped, when the chances of surviving ebbed, the bodies so near the epicenter here, kept coming. The paralysis of grief, when these two parents see the 8- year-old daughter's red hair blood-stained. Another 4-year-old girl with no parents here to bury her, and another father, simply walking behind. It's been constant intense activity, trying to save lives. But we are sadly now into the window, where so many of the ambulances that arrive will likely be taking away people who have perished. Up high, hope is strongest, digging furiously by hand here.
