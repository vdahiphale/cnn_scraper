My good friend and co-anchor Brianna Keilar is live for us in Washington, D.C.In just hours from now, Donald Trump will, for the third time in his political career, take the stage and accept the Republican nomination for president. His speech tonight is expected to be very different from what was originally planned before he was nearly killed at a rally on Saturday. We're told the former president is personally writing portions of the speech himself. Let's get the latest from CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, what more are you hearing about how Trump is preparing for this big keynote address?",

I spoke to one person who spoke to him who said that he's going to lean heavily into what happened on Saturday in particular, that this - that he believes that there was divine intervention, that he is lucky to be alive.Remember, Donald Trump is not a religious or spiritual person, but this, according to his senior advisors, this attempted assassination has changed him in that respect. We do know from a number of allies that he has continued to talk about the fact that he think that - he thinks that God was watching over him. Now, when it comes to what exactly he's going to say, one senior campaign advisor said this to our colleague, Alayna Treene. Said, \"He's writing the speech himself. It will be in his words, from his heart. It won't be a typical political speech; it'll be about unity and bringing the country together.\" Now, what Donald Trump's version of unity is remains to be seen. He is someone who has been known in the past for his divisive rhetoric, but he has told those around him that he wants this to be a more upbeat speech, that he wants this to be a symbol of unity. Again, we will wait and see what happens when he takes the stage tonight.",

We appreciate you being with us. What are you expecting from former President Trump tonight, especially as we get this reporting that people close to him see him as being changed by what happened on Saturday? REP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL): Look, I sat with the president, myself, Steve Scalise. We were sitting with him a couple nights ago. And as three survivors, we were having a conversation. And I'm not going to give all the details of that, but he is a person that is forever changed by the fact that he now has an alive day, an attempt, a very serious attempt on his life and that does change you. He will forever have a look in his eye that cannot be taken away because of that experience. And that will be reflected in every speech in every moment of his life from here forward. And as was discussed in the intro, I expect there to be a reflection on that day, how that carries him forward, you know, how that reflects to him on the time that we have and the time that he has to work on this country.",

But the reason that's still so much like an open wound is because of the Biden administration.You have an administration that goes through every day saying, well, the withdrawal was a success. Nothing went wrong. You know, don't believe what you saw with your own eyes. There was nothing that could have been done better. This was, you know, couldn't have been prevented.

The fact is American media gaslit the American people by pretending as though Joe Biden is not in the cognitive state that he is. Anybody that was acting like that was a surprise, wasn't truly reporting to the American people what we could see going on with Joe Biden every day.Now, why I tie this into national security is this, foreign intelligence agencies, they don't have the luxury of gaslighting their leaders that they answer to, whether Chinese intelligence, Russian intelligence, you name it. They tell the - their leaders about what the leader of America is actually doing, what's their state, what's taking place with them. Do they assess that something is going to happen or not? When Donald Trump comes in, they will tell their leaders, Vladimir Putin, whatever Donald Trump says to you is his red line, that is his red line. If he says it's 24, 48 hours, if he says it's 30 days, whatever he says to you, that is a true red line that you can count on, you can roll the dice if you want, but know that he is not bluffing you. That makes a difference in American foreign policy. That's something that we can get behind, is that there's a national security objective versus Biden administration, where the most serious objectives for them are political security objectives, and I could back that up with proof all day.",

If you want America's support, make sure that you put in your support that you committed to so that we can be a stronger organization.But don't go to Russia to get all of your energy if you're saying to the United States of America, we need to use our time, troops, and treasure to protect you from Soviet expansion, which is the purpose of NATO-Russian expansion.

Is it going to be a kind of kinder, gentler, softer Donald Trump, within reason. He's not going to be Mr. Rogers (ph). And then in terms of policy, you know, he loves to draw really sharp, bright lines between his view of the country and Joe Biden and the Democrats' view of the country. He's certainly going to make that contrast. Whether he softens the lines a little bit will be interesting to see in the interest of all this talk about unity.",

Failed both in terms of policy in the haphazard way he got out of Afghanistan and failed in a human way in the fact that these families didn't feel they'd gotten a satisfactory response from him.That was a very strong moment and I think that much more than members of the family gave you a reason or gave undecided voters, and there aren't a lot of them, a reason to feel more kindly towards Donald Trump and less kindly towards Joe Biden.",

I would have thought quicker than it has.And, you know, if you ask me today, I guess I'd say I think he'll still drop out. But, you know, in the end, it's down to one tough 81- year-old guy who's in Delaware with the closest members of his family and his political family. And if he decides he's not going to drop out, I don't think the Democratic Party either can or will force him. If I had to bet your house on it, I'd bet that he's going to drop out though. Just - it's interesting kind of after the shooting and the early parts of the convention, it seemed to die down. But now as the convention's about to end, we're getting in a political vacuum again.
