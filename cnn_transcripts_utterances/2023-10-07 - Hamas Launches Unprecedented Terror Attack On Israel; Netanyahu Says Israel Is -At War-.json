Israel has retaliated with air strikes on Gaza. More than 230 Palestinians, they say, have been killed.We want to warn you that video we are going to show you from Hamas may be disturbing. Fighters are seen storming the main border crossing between the Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fighters have infiltrated Israeli cities and there have been gun battles in the street. CNN teams are deployed around the world to bring you all the latest developments. CNN's Nic Robertson has just landed in Israel. He got off the plane at the main international airport where sirens warned of possible in incoming rockets. And before we get to you, Nic, I want to show our viewers how it unfolded on the tarmac.

Go back 10 years or so, Hamas didn't have rockets that could reach Tel Aviv.The dynamics of the situation here have been evolving. Hamas has been getting longer range weapons systems, they've been trying different techniques to attack Israeli civilians, but what we're seeing today, of course, by breaking out of Gaza and storming military positions, Israeli Defense Force positions, as well as civilians, that is an order of magnitude, a quantum step as we said before, different to what people have experienced here before. So we have seen a couple of vehicles go through that checkpoint, going south that way. They seem to be military vehicles, and there are military on the move here, and if you look at their vehicles, you wouldn't potentially know they were military.",

I mentioned to you earlier that I've been in touch with people who are in and around Tel Aviv, who were hearing the sirens, going up and down from the bomb shelters. For the most part, they have been protected by Israel's famous Iron Dome system, which protects from rockets, but obviously it is not foolproof. And we're seeing that right now in new video that we have from Tel Aviv, which is an important note because yes, what is happening where you are closer to the border with Gaza, Nic, it is sort of where everybody is focused for lots of reasons, first and foremost because that's where the Hamas terrorists physically came in, killed civilians, took civilians across the border into Gaza, but it is not limited to that area.",

I mean, typically in the past when Hamas had shorter range missile systems, they would hit the towns of Ashkelon here and Ashdod just a little bit further north, but now they can reach Tel Aviv. It seems that that is their preferred target. Potentially because it's a greater density of population. Potentially because they know, for Israelis, that's more -- has a greater psychological impact.Literally as we're standing here talking now I can hear explosions in the distance coming from the direction of Gaza. We can't say with certainty what those explosions are, but they feel like quite big detonations that we're hearing from a distance. Gaza, the northern end of Gaza, is about 15 miles in this direction here.",

      "sentences": "It's a huge, huge challenge. Look, Hamas hides out in the civilian population. They live in the same houses civilians live in. They build tunnels under civilian properties. So that presents a military challenge. But I think you've also got to take a step back and analyze this from the new scenario that we've witnessed today, not just the hostage scenario, which is terrible for any government to deal with, but particularly in a pressing situation like this.But the very fact that there appears to be an intelligence deficit on the Israeli side, they didn't know this was coming. What else don't they know? What else don't they know about the terrain that they would have to physically cross on the outskirts of Gaza City to get into Gaza? What awaits them there that they're not aware of that they haven't faced in the past? So all these are going to be calculations and things that the military is trying to determine. Look, we know in the past that Israel has got some super sophisticated equipment that can detect Hamas tunneling going on, but they were unaware of, it seems, that there was going to be a breakout from Gaza by Hamas into the civil communities. So that's going to be on the minds of the military. And typically what we've seen in the past it takes some time to organize the tanks, to get the reservists in place, to bring forward the artillery, to put suppressing fire if you will on Hamas attacking and firing positions. It takes some time. And even when you do that, and you move into an arena that Hamas is able to use as they want, almost effectively freely, this is being inside Gaza, and there are unknown dangers for the Israeli forces. So it is a very dangerous scenario, crossing that open ground, and then where do you go? Which buildings do you target? What happens when you get within the buildings of civilian infrastructure? That is an entirely different fight from a fight that tanks can be useful at. And artillery can be useful at. It becomes infantry. And you'd think that maybe special forces would try to do a rescue and recovery on the hostages. Intelligence is going to be the lead part of that picture. But we're already saying that the intelligence is lacking here. So the challenges are vast at this stage.",

They didn't know what else could potentially be coming.Thank you so much, Nic, for that incredible reporting, to you and your team. We will definitely get back to you.

Some of them, of course, misfire, too, and even kill civilians and others inside the Gaza Strip.But those detonations we've been seeing in the sky are those missiles being shot down by the Iron Dome.

In the car, and it was overtaken by terrorists and then she was taken by terrorists.

And I want to start with something that I heard from somebody about Israel -- in Israel about whether or not the fact that Israeli military forces have been very focused on the West Bank, not on the Gaza border. And we actually saw earlier that there was an example of an Israeli military base being overrun. And is that because -- and we have to be carefully, obviously it's early and we're doing reporting, is it because the focus of the Israeli military was not in Gaza, which is what the Hamas terrorist organization and individuals took advantage of?",

You know, like any other military force, you have a situation where -- what do you focus on first? What is your top priority, what is your top threat? And if the Israelis believed that their top threats came from the West Bank, it's not surprising that they didn't focus as much on Gaza. But having known the history of Gaza and knowing Hamas, it's pretty clear that they, you know, in retrospect, you could say, if this is true, they should have been paying more attention to Gaza and they certainly should have been paying attention to the fact that from an intelligence perspective, their sources were beginning to dry up.

M.J., we heard from President Biden earlier today saying multiple times that the U.S. stands with and stands by Israel. The question, of course, going forward, is, what does that mean, and what the posture of the U.S. is, as Israel undeniably will counterattack? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dana, it was clear that the president wanted to use these brief remarks to, first and foremost, resoundingly show support to the government of Israel and the people of Israel.

And I know that it's -- looking back is going to maybe be a -- something that's important for the future. The question right now is, what's going to happen in the next five minutes? What do they need to know in the next 10 minutes, in the next 24, 48 hours, that is happening? And I want our viewers to understand that you spent a lot of time in this region. You studied this region, particularly wars in Israel. So given that, what are you seeing right now? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, first, Dana, you've been talking about the intelligence failure, and there certainly was that. What we've seen so far is the lack of placement of key military assets near the Gaza in the various areas around there. Just seeing some of the films of the ease of which Hamas came through the walls, came through undetected, got through the gates with a lot of forces, and that there were no military forces. As I think one of your reporters on the scene, I think it was Nic Robertson said, they didn't have the helicopters, they didn't have the helicopters, they didn't have the artillery pieces to counter that -- or at least that's the way it seems initially. Tells me that there weren't as many forces there. And the Gaza Strip is the main effort for the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces. So the fact that they were displaced possibly in other places, investigations will detail that. We'll say, why did this happen, why did the government tell the military to move to the territories in the West Bank? Second thing I'd say is, because of the -- just the carnage that we've been seeing over the last 12 hours, this is going to get very bad very quickly. In fact, I would suggest this is going to be one of the worst reactions by the Israeli Defense Force that we have seen in any of the last wars over the last two decades. The fact that people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, tanks are being destroyed. When the Israeli Defense Forces goes into Gaza -- and I believe they will very soon -- it is going to be, Katie, bar the door. We've seen buildings being destroyed. We don't know how many people have been killed and injured. But they are taking it out against all of the Palestinian citizens in that territory, not just the ones that are terrorists and that are doing this despicable act. So it's going to be very bad on both parts, both casualties on the Palestinian side, but also the Israeli side. We have not seen, I think, the measure of carnage that they've suffered given the amount of rockets -- I mean, the rockets that we've seen over the last 12 hours is more that were fired -- more than were fired by Hamas between 2000 and 2008.",
