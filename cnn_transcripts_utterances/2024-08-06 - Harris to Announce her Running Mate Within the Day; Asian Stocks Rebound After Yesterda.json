Well, we should learn in the coming hours who U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has picked to be her running mate, a key decision that will come just two weeks after she launched her presidential campaign.Harris is expected to announce her choice before she appears with her running mate at a rally in Pennsylvania later today. Multiple sources tell CNN Harris focused on two Democratic governors in the final hours of her search, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota. Harris met both men in separate meetings on Sunday. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighed in on who might be the best to join the Democratic ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER EMERITA: I think they're all great and whoever she picks, I'm for. But Tim Walz is wonderful. He was chair of our Veterans Affairs Committee. Governor of Pennsylvania is remarkable and a real star. It's a question of who she feels the most comfort level with in terms of governance. People say, well, who can help us win? But it's about who can help us govern more than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We are in the very final, final stages of the vice presidential selection process for Vice President Kamala Harris. As of late afternoon on Monday, the Harris campaign had said that she had not yet made a final decision. We, of course, have been discussing three names in particular as being the final contenders. Those names, of course, are Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly and Tim Walz. And what CNN reported Monday evening is that in the final hours of the selection process, the vice president had been training her focus in particular on two of those names, Shapiro and Walz. Now, to be clear, our sources said that Mark Kelly was still in the running in those final hours that his name had not been taken off the table. All three of them, of course, met with the vice president in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. We also know that some of the biggest questions that the vice president has been asking of the advisors around her and probably of herself as she has been deliberating over this process are questions like who can help her win, who can help her govern, who does she have a strong personal chemistry with. Now, Tuesday night here in Philadelphia, Kamala Harris and her future running mate will appear at their first joint campaign rally of the 20 -- 21st first season. And then they are hoping to travel to a number of additional battleground cities and states as they really hope to showcase this joint ticket for the first time. And that, of course, is when we will first see what kind of personal chemistry the two of them actually do have. MJ Lee, CNN, in Philadelphia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And as long as the impact is more than zero, that would seem to be a pretty good argument for picking the guy who has a 65 percent approval rating or favorability rating in a state that you almost certainly have to win. You know, if Democrats don't win Wisconsin, they can replace it with Arizona. If they don't win Michigan, they can replace it with Georgia. If they don't win Pennsylvania, they have to win both Georgia and either Nevada or Arizona. And that's a lot. So, again, on a purely political calculus, I think Shapiro is head and shoulders. Now, there are parts of the party that are more resistant to him for all the reasons we just discussed. And Tim Walz, who is a good campaigner, is probably the path of least resistance. But I would think that much like Hillary Clinton picking Tim Kaine in 2016, Democrats may come to view a Walz election as a safe pick that was an opportunity lost.",

I mean, the point that he's making that has a germ of truth is that if you are picking Shapiro and you win, you are kind of -- you are clearly putting a thumb on the scale in the succession, you know, for the Democratic Party going forward, whereas Barack Obama picked Joe Biden, who was presumed at that point to be someone who did not have ambitions of his own. And that kind of, you know, reassured the -- the Obama team that Biden would not be out kind of freelancing for his own benefit. Walz might fit into that category more than Shapiro in the sense that fewer people can imagine him running for president one day. But, you know, your job is to win as the nominee, particularly if you believe, as Democrats have been saying for several years, that a Trump victory is an existential threat to the future of democracy, to the rule of law in America. It's just hard to see how you don't end up with the person that gives you the best chance of winning.

      "sentences": "Rosemary, stock markets in Asia have recovered somewhat after those massive losses we saw just a day ago.But experts are warning me that we can expect to see much more volatility in markets until September when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to make rate cuts. Now, the reason why Asia stock markets and specifically the Japanese stock market, which was the hardest hit, made such a quick recovery is really twofold. The first reason is because we received better than expected service sector data for the month of July from the United States. That's some concerns about the possibility of a recession in the world's largest economy. Now, the second reason is because the value of the yen has dipped just a little bit. On Monday, we saw the yen surge against the dollar and these massive movements that we've seen in the dollar-yen rate really is largely attributed to the Bank of Japan raising interest rates for the second time in 14 years. Just last week, the interest rates are now at 0.25 percent, which doesn't sound like a lot. But the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates, which is a break from what other countries are doing because they recognize that it needs to raise interest rates and therefore boost the value of its currency. Over the last year or so, the value of the yen has dropped significantly against the greenback, making the cost of imports for things like food and fuel that much more expensive. So the Bank of Japan raised interest rates and therefore boosted the value of its currency. But the sudden surge we saw on Monday really spooked hedge funds and also investors, which is why we saw that sudden panic selling. Now, again, because the value of the yen has dipped a little bit, it's now trading at 146 yen to the dollar. That's eased and soothed some nerves. Now we can expect U.S. and U.K. markets to open higher like Asia markets have done. But experts are warning me that we're not out of the woods just yet and central banks will watch with bated breath what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do come September. Rosemary.",

But that dominance has been dealt a serious blow in a U.S. district court, which ruled Monday that Google has violated antitrust laws acting as a monopoly to stifle competition. The landmark ruling is a stinging rebuke and could reshape how millions of Americans get their information online. Google has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to make itself the world's default search provider. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the ruling, saying quote, \"this victory against Google is an historic win for the American people. No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\" No comment yet from Google, which is expected to appeal any penalties it may face. Large parts of the southeastern U.S., including Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, are facing torrential rain and catastrophic flooding from Tropical Storm Debby.

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, it's really a waiting game at this point to see what Iran will do in its retaliation that it has promised against Israel, what form it will take and also when it will happen. Now, of course, the question is whether it would be Iran alone that will carry out some kind of retaliatory attack or whether they will be using their proxies in the region as well, which would make it potentially a more significant and widespread event.Now, what we have seen, as you mentioned overnight, we did see that there were Iran-aligned militia groups, according to Washington, that did carry out an attack, a strike against the Al Asad air base in Iraq. Now, we have seen since October a number of these attacks in Iraq and also in Syria on U.S. troops that are stationed there, and they have consistently been blamed on these Iranian proxy groups. This one has been no different. The U.S. saying that is who is responsible. But we have been seeing somewhat of a lull in recent months for these attacks, or at least they haven't been publicly acknowledged. Between October and January, we saw more than 150 strikes against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. So that is a reminder to Israel, to the United States, that there are these Iranian proxies that are ready and willing to carry out these attacks. So, of course, the question that the U.S. is trying to figure out now is whether or not these groups will be involved in any kind of retaliation. You did mention there was this Situation Room meeting where they tried to assess and predict what could happen. We have heard, though, from two U.S. officials that many of the Iranian military assets that they would need for this kind of retaliatory attack had been moved back in April. So it has made it far more difficult for U.S. intelligence to follow any kind of movement, any kind of preparations to be able to predict what and where may happen. So this is why we are seeing, certainly on this occasion, there appears to be less predictions and less knowledge of what could happen. Very different to what we saw back in April when Iran carried out that retaliatory attack on Israel, where you saw more than 300 drones and rockets and missiles being fired to Israel, but it was well telegraphed. And there had been good preparations in place, so the U.S. and its allies were able to shoot the vast majority of them out of the sky. Rosemary?",

And that's why the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has repeatedly said that their retaliation will be calculated, will focus on particular targets. It will not basically provide the pretext for Israel to basically go for all-out war. My own reading, and I could be wrong, that Iran will directly involve in retaliation with Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen and Iraqi militiamen. And this particular retaliation will be multi-layered, targeting Israel's strategic positions, airport, what have you, the infrastructure. And I think Iran and its allies will most likely rely on Hezbollah's precision missiles in order to overwhelm Israel's air defense capabilities and the coalition that the United States has been reassembling in the past few days in order to really shoot down most of these missiles or drones that they will be fired at Israel when and if the attack takes place.

Facing his first major crisis since taking office, Keir Starmer chaired his first emergency response meeting known as Cobra on Monday. He says far-right agitators have seized upon the deadly stabbing of three young girls in Southport, England, last week, using their tragedy to spread anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim disinformation. Starmer says it's nothing more than violent organized thuggery. And CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now live from London. Good morning to you, Salma. So what is the latest on these violent protests sweeping the U.K.?",

We've seen these very tense and violent clashes with police in multiple places across the country.And we've seen this very violent rise of hate and anti-immigrant sentiment that Keir Starmer, the country's prime minister, has responded to with what one could call an iron fist. He has said he has no tolerance for the violence that's taking place and that he will crack down. I want you to take a listen to how he laid out his plans to quell the violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So far, 370 people have been arrested but authorities expect that number to go up because as you heard there, the government has promised, has vowed to find every single individual involved in these violent riots and to prosecute them. Keir Starmer has said that he will find extra spaces in prison.He is creating more hours in the court system to prosecute these people more quickly and they're reaching out to technology companies. And this is absolutely key, Rosemary, because the lever for this is on social media where this misinformation and hate spread online, where individuals were able to organize these violent rallies again around the country. The country's technology secretary met with some of the key social media companies, Meta, TikTok, others and began to lay out the need to crack down on this misinformation. But Rosemary, when you have the head of one of these companies, Elon Musk, of course, the head of X himself engaging in a tit-for-tat with Keir Starmer himself, engaging in misinformation and trying to fan the flames by saying there could be a civil war in the U.K. It's hard to imagine. Yes, Keir Starmer could get a grip on the streets, but how does he get a grip online?",
