Three people killed near the University of Virginia. Police say the suspected gunman is a former football player.And crypto crisis. New investigations just opened into the sudden collapse of one of the most powerful players in the field. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans, this is EARLY START. President Biden and China's President Xi Jinping are meeting at this hour on the sidelines of Group of 20 Summit in Indonesia. It is the first time the two leaders have met face-to-face as presidents. Both men have reason to feel energized. Both men -- we've just -- talking to CNN's Kevin Liptak is live in Bali, Indonesia, following this for us. Good morning Kevin, good evening there. There were months of preparations --",

But they held out the possibility that it could go a little longer.Now, it's back in July that these officials -- that these two leaders both decided that they wanted to meet face-to-face after two years in office, President Biden wanted to get into the same room, kind of look Xi in the eye and sort of set a baseline for this relationship that really has deteriorated so rapidly over the last several months. And so, we did see them shake hands. We saw them sit down at the table. And we heard some very brief opening remarks. Listen to a little bit of what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As the leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent, global issues that require our mutual cooperation. And I believe this is critical for the sake of our two countries and the international community. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

White House officials say that they don't expect any kind of joint statement that comes out of this, any kind of list of areas where they are cooperating with China. Instead, they want to do -- they want to, quote, what they call \"build a floor\".Essentially prevent this relationship from deteriorating any further. I mean, want the two leaders to identify areas where each of their staffs can go back, talk to each other and sort of come up to an agreement. Now, I do think that there was actually quite an important thing that President Xi said in his remarks. It seemed very specifically-targeted to President Biden who has this long history on the world stage. He said, a statesman should think about and know where to lead his country. He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world. So, that is the tone for this meeting that is now under way. Certainly, President Xi has a lot of differences with President Biden. Things like Taiwan, things on trade, and so, this could be a contentious meeting. We will know in a few hours when President Biden comes out and gives his characterization of these talks in a press conference from here in Bali.",

      "sentences": "Christine, I think many say Xi wants time so that China could become self-reliant in key technologies to upgrade its economy, but more crucially, to upgrade its military to catch with the U.S. So, he doesn't want a conflict with the U.S. just yet, and obviously he can afford to play the long game here.As you mentioned, having just assumed that precedent-breaking third term, paving the way for him to rule for life. So as you and Kevin were saying earlier, he struck a more conciliatory tone in the opening remarks we just heard. And both leaders refer to their past encounters. But the problem here is, this relationship is in a free fall, not because of a lack of rapport between the two men who have known each other for years. It is this fundamental difference in terms of how they view their own strengths and the other's intentions. Obviously, from Washington's perspective, China under Xi Jinping has become more authoritarian at home and more aggressive abroad. But from Beijing's perspective, the Biden administration has been doubling down on building this anti- China coalition to continue its rise on the global stage. Mr. Biden has not only kept most of Trump-era tariffs on China's imports, he's been ramping up restrictions in terms of export controls, especially on crucial semiconductors, not to mention the president has said more than once that the U.S. is committed to defending Taiwan militarily. So that's why Xi Jinping has been indicating that he is shifting the ruling communist party's top priority from economic growth to national security. That's something he reminded his top generals just a few days ago, that the focus of their training should be fighting and winning wars. So Christine, it is really this kind of rhetoric and policy directions from Beijing made this meeting between the two men so critically important despite the low expectations.",

China is not about to do anything that the United States wants, such as easing up on Taiwan, easing up on Hong Kong, easing up on the Uyghurs or stopping its overall economic or military expansion and aggression.  And the U.S. is not about to give China any of its concessions either,meaning, looking the other way while the Uyghur genocide goes on or abandoning Taiwan or stopping its confronting of China's trade practices. So there's really no room for anything positive on either side. So I guess putting a floor under the relationship is the best we can do. And again, that -- I think Steven was exactly right.

Now, when it comes to cooperation, there are several areas that the Biden administration has tried earnestly to increase cooperation on China including climate change, Iran, things like counter narcotics, counter piracy. The problem is, there's been little to no response on the Chinese side. And you know, it's very easy to say that the U.S. and China should cooperate more, but it takes two to tango, Christine.
