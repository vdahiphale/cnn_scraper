      "sentences": "Yes. Sara, for the last 2.5 months, there's been absolutely no progress in Washington to try to avert the first ever debt default in U.S. history. In February 1st, that's when Joe Biden met with Kevin McCarthy in the White House. There have been no talks ever since, even though the two sides and both say that the debt ceiling must be raised in order to avoid a default as soon as June or potentially as latest September. The exact date is uncertain.The White House has said all along that they don't plan to negotiate with the House Republicans. They want the Republicans to simply raise the debt limit without any conditions, whatsoever. That's the position rejected by Kevin McCarthy, something he will reiterate later this morning. And also behind the scenes, Republicans in the House have been trying to draft their own plan to put together roughly $3 trillion, potentially up to $4 trillion worth of budget cuts as well as revenue raisers, to pair that with a debt limit increase. I'm told behind the scenes this proposal could come to the House floor as soon as May. In this plan, it includes wants to return domestic spending levels to 2022 levels. That would be a significant cut across the board in domestic spending. They do hope to get between $3 to $4 trillion in savings as well as rescinding on COVID-19 money. That's just part of the proposals as well as efforts to try to rein in federal regulations. Now, this is the challenge for Kevin McCarthy. He needs to convince his own Republican conference to vote for this plan because Democrats are expected to vote against it. That means he would need to limit defections to four Republicans at most in order to get this through the House. And it still has no chance of passing the Democrat-led Senate. But McCarthy wants to demonstrate that they have their own plan and try to force the White House to the negotiating table before the potential of rattling Wall Street, the potential of economic, gas -- disastrous economic consequences if the debt ceiling is not raised. So, expect McCarthy to lay out the stakes here in just a matter of moments, Sara.",

And his family, though, is demanding that the homeowner, who has yet to be identified, be arrested and charged. Police say the gunman was taken into custody after the shooting. But according to the Kansas City police chief, Missouri State law only allows a person to be held up to 24 hours for a felony investigation. At that point, they're either required to be charged or released. And the police chief says this -- they still need a statement from the victim and more forensic evidence before an arrest can be made.

But the hearing was delayed or the trial was delayed amid reports that Fox is pursuing a last-minute settlement with Dominion. The first report came in Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal last night, really, at the same time, basically, the judge announced instantly. So, some speculation, some rumors that potentially there could be some settlements announced at the last minute, which would, of course, would avert a very excruciating six-week trial for Fox News. You would see people like Rupert Murdoch have to come before the court to testify about why he allowed election lies on air in the wake of the 2020 contests when he knew those were not true. Of course, it's possible that no settlement will happened and we will be back in court tomorrow. That's what the judge said to basically expect today that it will resume tomorrow, with jury selection being confirmed and then the trial moving forward with opening statements.

Take a look at some of the videos and still pictures that the border patrol chief posted on Twitter. Those are very large groups of migrants that are turning themselves into border authorities.
