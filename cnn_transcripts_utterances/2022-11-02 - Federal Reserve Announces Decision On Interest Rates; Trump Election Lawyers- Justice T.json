Victor is off today.Well, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce their decision on interest rates at any moment. Now, most economists are expecting another major rate hike of 75 basis points, all of this, of course in the Fed's efforts to control the country's historic inflation. The decision will likely produce major ripple effects on your personal finances and the economy in the months to come. CNN's Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, I know we've been awaiting this decision. What is the Fed said?",

      "sentences": "75 basis points, the Fed just delivered another massive interest rate hike designed to put this inflation fire out. That brings interest rates up to the highest level since early 2008. That means higher borrowing costs for all of us.Now, this is the fourth straight interest rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point. This is historic. I mean, we've never seen drastic actions like this under Janet Yellen. We never saw this under Ben Bernanke or even Alan Greenspan. He actually had to go back to the early 1980s under Paul Volcker. And I think this says a lot about not just how high inflation is, but how stubborn it is. I mean, it's been basically stuck at these four-decade highs. Now the Fed's statement, which is watched very closely, is basically identical to last month except for one key part. The Fed reiterated that ongoing interest rate hikes are likely to be appropriate. But they added that this is going to be the case in order to get policy restrictive enough to get inflation down to 2 percent over time. And the Fed also laid out some criteria about what it's going to take for them to slow the pace of these massive interest rate hikes. They laid out three key factors, one, economic and financial developments, two, the cumulative tightening of monetary policy thus far. And this is key, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. And that's important because it takes many months for these rate hikes to actually hit the real economy. And so, there are some fears that the Fed might be overdoing these rate hikes without even knowing it. Maybe, Bianna, the Fed is laying the groundwork here to possibly slow down the pace of rate hikes in the coming months.",

And the University of Michigan economics professor, Justin Wolfers. We'll get to Justin's reaction in just a second. But, Catherine, this was really baked into the cake. We all anticipated a 75 basis point interest rate rise here. But I guess the question is when does the Fed stop and how fast are they willing to go to get to that stopping point?",

What happens next year?There are signs that the economy is slowing, and that there are some growing weaknesses in the U.S. economy, certainly in the global economy at this point. And the Fed operates on a lag. You know, they raise interest rates today. You may not see the effect of that for money -- for many months down the line. So the question is, when do they start slowing? And we'll presumably hear the chairman talk a little bit about that or he'll get asked about it soon. And how do they convince markets that slowing does not mean, you know, maybe 50 point basis hike -- 50 basis point hike, for example, does not necessarily mean that they have taken their eye off the ball on inflation.",

They -- I think have doubled this year, or more or less. However, house prices, which you would think would fall in response, have not come down all that much. And you know, a lot of people are forecasting that they might come down more in the year ahead. But we don't know yet.So, so far, again, the Fed's medicine works with a lag, we've seen some indications that it's affecting prices around the edges. But core inflation, which is the term for when you strip out volatile food and energy prices, still remains uncomfortably high, which is why I think you're going to continue to see the Fed raising rates for quite a while.",

That is what drove markets up last month.We saw this historic gain for the Dow. And I also think that that's what some politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, are hoping for because she's worried the Fed is going to go too far and cause a recession. But I don't know if we're going to definitely hear that from Powell. We've also heard from some famous economists, Larry Summers, for example. He thinks it would be a mistake for the Fed to pause here because inflation is still too high. And there have been some new numbers out just this week that really support the idea that maybe more work is needed from the Fed. We learned that private sector payrolls last month unexpectedly accelerated, job openings in September went up, good news, of course, for job seekers, but that's actually the opposite of what the Fed wants to see. So, you know, this is a very tricky spot, very -- almost an impossible situation facing the Fed here. Because if they don't do enough, then you can see inflation stay high or even go higher. And if they end up doing too much, they could end up causing a recession.",

Everyone does focus on the term transitory in terms of inflation last year, but of course, that suggested that we hadn't really factored in supply chain issues, the pandemic, obviously, the war in Ukraine, there's a potentially a looming rail strike here in the United States.

And so there are some unusual factors raising inflation.Look, I think the big thing for the Fed is you stare -- you drive a car, not by looking at the back window, and the back window shows us we've had a lot of high inflation, but by looking forward. And when we look forward, the Fed's own forecasters are seeing inflation coming down fairly dramatically over the next year or so. Not to rates that they're comfortable with, but the sorts of rates where all of us, hopefully at a year's time will stop talking about inflation so much. And that I think is part of the case for we've raised rates a bit. Let's see how far inflation is going to fall over the next year as factors like Ukraine, like the pandemic, like supply chain disruptions, start to become less of an influence.",

All of the various threads that he feels like are a very real threat to democracy right now. Two real driving components, according to advisors behind the president's decision to do this tonight, were dozens of Republican officials that are currently running for election, not being willing to say they will accept the election results. I think that's a very big concern inside the White House. And the other has been the attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi. Basically, the president is close to the speaker, knows her husband quite well, deeply affected by kind of everybody's greatest fear that this current environment would lead to violence at some point. Both of those will be elements of what the president's going to say tonight. This is as much about the president, his belief, and his overarching concern as it is an electoral political issue, and that's why he's speaking about it.",

And they feel that they are in a personal recession in the everyday things that they have to do when they go to the grocery store, when they buy fundamentals like eggs, like milk, when they go to the gas pump, and then everything in between, it's just so much more expensive.

And, Bianna, the reason we get to see these e-mails that would otherwise potentially be protected by the attorney-client privilege is the fact that a federal judge has said that they likely contain evidence of a possible crime or crimes by Eastman and former President Trump, as it appears that they were not filing these legal challenges in good faith, but it appears they were doing so to obstruct congressional proceedings.",
