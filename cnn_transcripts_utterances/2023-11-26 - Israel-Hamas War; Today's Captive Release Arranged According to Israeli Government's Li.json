I'm Kim Brunhuber with our continuing coverage of the Israel- Hamas war.We're now well into day three of the fragile truce between Hamas and Israel, with Israel preparing to receive another group of hostages today. The Israeli government has their names and has informed their families. 13 Israelis and four Thai nationals were released on Saturday. But only after an hours-long delay threatened to upend the exchange. Following preliminary medical checks, all of the former hostages were taken to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. One doctor said, none of the people examined so far are in need of urgent medical attention, but they do show signs of extended captivity. The deal also called for the release of 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday. Earlier, Hamas had stalled on releasing the hostages in a dispute over which Palestinians the Israelis were willing to release. Aid groups say, 187 trucks made it into Gaza Saturday with food, water, fuel, and medical supplies, though it's only a small fraction of what's needed. 61 of those trucks reached heavily damaged northern Gaza, the most trucks in one day since the war began. Elliott Gotkine is following all this for us and joins us from London. So, Elliot, complications and delays on the hostage release. Take us through what happened and how things were ultimately resolved.",

And also, the seniority of the Palestinian prisoners that Israel was planning to release. Now, Israel says that that wasn't the case. Israel also says that Hamas didn't abide by the agreement by separating one of the mothers from their daughter. We saw Hila Rotem, a13-year-old girl being freed by Hamas, but her mother, Raaya, remains, it's believed, in captivity. Although the Israeli is saying it's unknown where she is and what -- excuse me, and what happened to her. But it's also worth noting, Kim, that we don't actually have the full text of this agreement between Israel and Hamas. So, it's unclear precisely what the terms are, but Israel certainly saying that the terms included the fact that mothers should not be separated from their Children. So, there were several hours of delay. Eventually, it did take place. This truce remains intact. And as we enter day three, there is the hope and expectation that the third batch of Israeli hostages who were abducted as part of Hamas's murderous rampage of October the 7th will be freed. And likewise, there will be another batch of Palestinian prisoners, women and minors, who were being held in Israeli prisons, will also be freed as part of this deal. Of course, this truce is supposed to last for four days, and it can be extended, Israel says, for every 10 hostages that Hamas frees, an additional day of truce will be implemented. Kim.",

Since October 7th, in the last seven weeks, Israel has arrested over 3,000 Palestinians and continue to arrest between 50 to 100 Palestinians every night, including 200 children. And this brings a number of total detainees and prisoners to over 8,300, and I don't believe this even accounts for the number of Palestinians who have been arrested in the ground invasion. So, this is an incredibly emotional moment right now to see the detainees reunited with their families, especially as some of the women who were released today and yesterday have been held in solitary confinement and were completely isolated from the outside world. But we should remember that as we celebrate this release, we must also address the root cause of the mass incarceration of the Palestinians, and that is the continued colonization of Palestinian land and the seizure of Palestinian land, the military occupation, and the denial of Palestinian freedom for the last 75 years.",

And a lot of them work in agriculture in Israel, and you would have found them on that southern flank near Gaza.

That hasn't been a surprise to those who know about that migrant community.There are tens of thousands of them that would ordinarily work in Israel.

It comes after Hamas turned over a second group of hostages Saturday after an hours-long delay. Red Cross buses carried 13 Israeli and four Thai nationals out of Gaza. In exchange, Israel says it released 39 Palestinian prisoners, including six women and 33 male teenagers.So, here's a look at the 13 Israelis Hamas released on Saturday, they include seven children. The youngest is three years old. But mystery surrounds the release of 13-year-old Hila Rotem. This is Hila reunited with her uncle, but her mother wasn't released with her. An Israeli official tells us, under the deal, mothers and children weren't supposed to be separated. So, where her mother is and why she wasn't released isn't known. Each former hostage will have to process what they've been through in their own private way, and that will take as long as it takes. But this much is certain, they won't be alone in their recovery.

And that's why so much care has gone into ensuring that the media is kept at a distance, that there's a degree of privacy, but also that the appropriate staffing and psychiatrists and social workers are in place.And also, a lot of guidelines that were given to the IDF in terms of how they handled the hostages when they first were there during that initial handover from the Red Cross. They did a cursory medical search and checking their identities. They were told not to answer questions such as where is mommy? Where is daddy? To ask permission of any children before trying to pick them up. And so, every possible care has been taken here and also at the Schneider Children's Medical Center where we were last night to try to minimize any sort of re-traumatizing, particularly of these children as they return home.

Axios reported that when Blinken visited Tel Aviv last time, that Blinken had told Netanyahu that they should implement a humanitarian pause. And Netanyahu responded and said, I need to know first that this isn't a plan by Biden. To lure me into a de facto ceasefire.So, I think that when we look at in terms of this hostage deal, I think the reality is that given that now Western allies of Israel, such as David Cameron, the U.K. foreign minister, such as Macron, who's already called for a ceasefire, such as the deputy prime minister of Belgium, who's even called for sanctions on Israel. Given there's a shift in the public opinion, I think that they're the window for opportunity for Netanyahu to continue his military operations is closing. And that suggests that Hamas, although they will be slow in releasing the hostages, they may well believe that now that the pressure is coming to bear on Netanyahu, it's better to uphold this deal so nobody can blame Hamas for any mishap. And rather the greatest threat to any mishap in the truce is actually from Netanyahu who is the one who fears for his political future with talk being mentioned in the U.S. that they might even try to get Benny Gantz to replace him.",

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts in South Korea and Japan are condemning the launch. South Korea calls it a clear violation of a U.N. resolution that prohibits the North from using ballistic missile technology. CNN's Will Ripley is in Taipei with the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  As if the world doesn't have enough to worry about, rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, North Korea claims big progress in its satellite program. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un appearing triumphant in state media, posing for propaganda cameras with a team of North Korean scientists and engineers, celebrating an apparently successful third attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit. Two failed launches earlier this year. Pyongyang promises more satellite launches in the near future. Satellites crucial to improving the accuracy of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile program. A program banned by the United Nations Security Council, possibly perfected with the help of Russian rocket scientists acting on orders from President Vladimir Putin. Kim and Putin's September summit at this Russian space launch complex signaling Moscow's growing support for Pyongyang's space program. A partnership believed to be providing Putin with badly needed North Korean weapons, arming Russian soldiers on the battlefields of Ukraine. Putin told state media reporters at the time Russia would help North Korea launch its own satellites and rockets, saying, that's exactly why we came here. Japanese authorities issued an emergency warning. What they believed to be a satellite carrying ballistic missile soaring over Okinawa. FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Today, North Korea conducted a launch using ballistic missile technology. RIPLEY (voiceover):  The Japanese Prime Minister condemning the launch. Swift reactions from South Korea, Seoul suspending military pacts with the North.

Now, in the meantime, the big question, the unanswered question is whether this satellite is actually able to conduct reconnaissance. We know that it's in orbit, but can it actually surveil U.S. military installations in places like Guam or Hawaii or Japan? That remains the unknown question. Will Ripley, CNN Taipei.

We've had some snow showers in Chicago as we go through the day on Sunday. That will start to kick across the Great Lakes and it kind of meets up with this area of low pressure that developed off the Carolina coast. That starts to meet up and move north, creating some heavier rain from New York up to Boston.Notice the snow showers, too, across the Great Lakes that starts to kick. In the wake of that front, that lake effect snow could dump up to a foot of snow for some communities right off the coast of those lakes like Cleveland. You can see the rain totals from New York to Boston, again, could be on the heftier side up to about two inches. Now, after this, we'll find some Arctic air starts to spill south. First, up into the Great Lakes and then it starts to spread east across the northeast, going into early parts of the week. But by Tuesday and Wednesday, things get pretty chilly. I mean, take a look at some of these high temperatures. These again are the daytime high temperatures barely breaking freezing for cities like Pittsburgh and Syracuse, where average highs are in the middle and upper forties, but again, barely breaking freezing there in New York, an average high of 51 degrees. You're looking at temperatures in the upper 30s all day on Tuesday. Looking at the extended, you'll see that Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, some of the coldest parts of the week. Temperatures do try to rebound, but overall, we're going to find temperatures staying below average through the next couple of days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
