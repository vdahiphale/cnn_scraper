      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Former President Trump's call for protests has law enforcement officials in New York preparing for a week of uncertainty. In a social media post, Trump says he expects to be arrested Tuesday for his alleged role in a hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. In the statement, Trump urged his supporters to, \"protest take our nation back.\" Trump dialed up the rhetoric with a follow up post saying, we just can't allow this anymore. We must save America. Protest, protest, protest. The posts are alarmingly similar to his calls for protests prior to the January 6, 2021 insurrection and has New York police officers and officials bracing for whatever may happen. Joining me to discuss all of this, Ron Brownstein is a CNN Senior Political Analyst and a Senior Editor for The Atlantic. Jonathan Wackrow is a CNN Law Enforcement Analyst and a former Secret Service Agent. Gentlemen, good to see you both. So, Ron, let me begin with you and your reaction to Trump's claim that he will be arrested Tuesday, his calls for protest, and by the way, the Manhattan DA's office still not confirming that there is any imminent arrest or indictment that is scheduled for Tuesday.",

      "sentences": "Right, that's part of the story that he's putting a specific date on it that the DA's office is not. But obviously, the larger point is the one, Fred, that you mentioned. You know, if you are the most sympathetic observer possible to Donald Trump. And you do double backflips, you can find some credence in his argument that on January 6, he did not know that his language would lead to violence.But January 6 has now happened. He knows the effect of the language that he used that day and how it led to violence. And here he is coming very close to that language again. It makes it very hard to avoid the conclusion that he is willing to use the threat of violence as part of his political strategy. And that is just a reminder of the very different era we are in than we have been at any point in American history where you have Trump, the leader of a political movement who is routinely willing to raise the specter of violence as a way of advancing his goals. And so many conservative commentators and members of Congress who have condemned preemptively the possibility of indictment remain silent on his raising this threat of violence. So that, I think, is just enormously significant and a marker of the very different era that we are in politically than we have ever been in before.",

I mean, remaining silent at the same time, there is Republican leadership that's coming to his aid, so to speak, ahead of, you know, this inflammatory language.Also, you know, Jonathan, I want to go to you in a second, but also joining us right now is Norm Eisen. He is a CNN Legal Analyst and a former House Judiciary Special Counsel in Trump's first impeachment trial. And so, Norm, what I want to ask you is, you know, to Ron's point some of the language that the former President is using in this social media, you know, post is very similar to the kind of language we heard from the -- then president just prior to January 6. So there remain investigations that are open as it relates to January 6. So what do you suppose his current language is doing to be in developed potentially into these ongoing investigations aside from what could or couldn't happen on Tuesday?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, unlike January 6, law enforcement is going to be ready for every eventuality that could possibly occur, right? And there's extensive coordination between multiple law enforcement entities, both at the state and federal level.However, it's important to note that these responsibilities of the different law enforcement groups are different. They have a different remit based upon their role. Let me just walk through this real fast. The New York City Police Department, you know, is preparing again for the worst-case scenario, but their role is to maintain civil order, right? They have to protect the area around the courthouse, but also the entire -- the city as a whole. Remember, there could be protests in Times Square, there could be protests at Trump Tower. So they have to be ready to react and respond to protests. You know, again, these are individuals who are trying to or expressing their First Amendment free speech right. But they have to be prepared for acts of violence at the same time. So they have a dual role in maintaining that civil order. The New York State Court officers are there to protect the courthouse itself. The FBI is involved. They're monitoring for any type of domestic acts of terror by extremist groups. And then you have the Secret Service, Fred. And this is a really interesting role for the Secret Service. They're charged with protecting the former president, but they're not a coordinating entity. And what I mean by that is this isn't a speech. This isn't a political rally. It's not a formal event that the president -- I mean the former president is engaging in. This is an action by the court. So from the Secret Service, they want this process to be as administrative as possible. They want to be able to take the president from Point A to Point B and back to Point A again without any issues, right? So they're going to take the president to the courthouse, let him address his business with the court, and get him out. They are not engaging with the security perimeter. They're not engaging with, you know, the overall security plan. They'll be aware of it, but they're not a coordinating entity. I think that's a real interesting aspect of the Secret Service's role and what may happen this week.",

There might even be a certain level of allegiance because of what could or couldn't happen in the week ahead.Would there be a swapping out of detail?

First and foremost, they are federal law enforcement agents, and they will uphold their responsibility to the Constitution. And as law enforcement officials for the United States.They are untainted in the way that they execute their mission. Their mission is twofold. One is, you know, to protect the former President of the United States, but again, also uphold the laws of the land. So while many people may think like, hey, maybe they need to switch agents out.

And that is -- that is something that he is used to energize and solidify his core supporters.But I think the equation is more complicated now in the Republican Party because you have a divide. You know, we saw in that CNN poll last week, 60% of Republicans said it was most important to them to have a nominee who shares their values, and Trump led DeSantis among them. But there's another 40% of the party that said it is most important to have a nominee who has the best chance of beating Joe Biden. And DeSantis led Trump among that half of the part -- or that 40% of the party. And I suspect that the prospect of a succession, potentially of indictments is only going to deepen the concerns among the Republican leaders, strategists, and donors who are worried that identifying too closely with Trump is a losing proposition for '24. The problem is that memo has not clearly not gotten to the Republican leadership in the House. You know, and you see Kevin McCarthy coming out yesterday preemptively dismissing this as a political prosecution, saying that they needed to investigate the investigators. Marjorie Taylor Greene saying anyone who doesn't go full scale defense of Trump should be sort of run out of the party. They are tattooing the stamp of Trump on the Republican Party after a midterm election in which many Republicans felt that was more of an anchor than a lift.",

But then just last weekend, he blasted Trump, saying history would hold him accountable for January 6. So, you know, what is this, I guess, tightrope walk that you see with a Pence.

But Pence is simultaneously doing everything he can to ensure that Trump faces no accountability in the hearing now. You know, he's refused to testify the January 6 Committee. He's refusing to testify to the grand jury.Here he joins Trump in blanket statement. Preemptively by definition. This has to be a politically illegitimate investigation. And you have similar language from Kevin McCarthy and others. That is not the only choice that is available. I mean, it probably wasn't that long ago in American history where you would have seen political leaders in both parties say, no one is above the law. We have to let the legal process play out, and we'll see where it falls. Instead to preemptively argue that any kind of attempts to hold Trump accountable is -- are politically motivated, really underscores the continuing hold that he has on the party and how difficult it will be for Republicans to escape his shadow. Don't forget, in 2022, 75% of Americans said the economy was in bad shape. A majority of Americans said they disapproved of Joe Biden's performance. Historically, that's a recipe for enormous gains for the opposition party. It didn't happen. Republicans underperformed in large measure because too many independent swing voters thought they were extreme. And a big reason for that was their continued ties to Donald Trump. And yet, here we go with Kevin McCarthy lashing the party more tightly to Trump than as ever, as tightly as ever.",

He arrived by helicopter. The Kremlin says. He then was shown driving himself from the airport to the outskirts of the city, being briefed about efforts to rebuild of the city and shown an apartment building and introduced to several residents who'd been put there. All part of an effort to show that Russia, the Russian government, is rebuilding a city that it destroyed in the first place. I spoke with a woman who I met in March of last year, who had just escaped with her family from the Russian siege, from the Russian bombardment who is now living as a refugee in Lithuania. She said that this was like seeing a serial killer return to the scene of a crime, to see the Russian president there in Mariupol, a city that his forces destroyed in the first place. There has been an enormous amount of scorn poured on -- poured on this by Ukrainian officials who point out that Vladimir Putin made the visit under cover of darkness. We've gotten accounts of how difficult it is for the handful of residents still living there with scanty electricity or no heat whatsoever. Russia is keen to show that they're trying to rebuild parts of Ukraine that they destroyed in the first place and that they have also annexed as part of a territory grab which much of the rest of the world views as illegal under international law.

And what it's doing is it's (inaudible) them, it's putting them together, these little bits without really understanding them. Which is why sometimes it does weird things. Like it blamed the Silicon Valley Bank on GPT5, which doesn't even exist, because it doesn't really know how to assemble all these bits of text. So sometimes, it kind of gloms together a whole lot of text and sounds really cool, and sometimes it just makes stuff up.
