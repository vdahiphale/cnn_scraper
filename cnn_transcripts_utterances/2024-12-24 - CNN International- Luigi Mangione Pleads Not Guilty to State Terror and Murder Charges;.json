But, she's doing what she can with the tools that she has to make him look like a real person, that -- someone that should be concerned and cared for, and make sure he gets that fair shake in the courtroom.SARA SIDNER, CNN CO-ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWS CENTRAL\":  Jeremy Saland, thank you so much for your analysis that -- this is a case that's been watched by so many people and there's so much interest. There were even women in the court yesterday, just there to see Mangione. We will see how all of this plays out, both cases as they go along parallel lines. Appreciate you. A new hour of \"CNN News Central\" starts right now. CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN CO-ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\":  Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Christina Macfarlane. This is \"CNN Newsroom\". Just ahead, Russia sentences a U.S. citizen for 15 years jail on charges relating to espionage. We'll take a look at the fallout from the House Ethics investigation into Matt Gaetz, including text messages showing he paid for sex on multiple occasions. And a developing story out of the U.S. on Christmas Eve, American Airlines has grounded all flights due to a technical issue. And we start with news of another long prison sentence handed to U.S. citizen in Russia. Russia's state media reports Gene Spector was sentenced to 15 years in a maximum security penal colony on charges related to espionage. It happened after a secret trial. State media report he had previously pled guilty to mediating bribes given to a former Russian deputy prime minister and was serving a four-year sentence for that offense. Nada Bashir is following the story and joining us here in London. And Nada, so tell us what more do we know about Spector and these charges that have been leveled against him?",

But as you mentioned, Gene Spector who was born in Russia but then later relocated to the U.S. and received citizenship there, has now been sentenced to 15 years in prison according to Russian state media, in relation to charges relating to espionage. As you mentioned, he had previously already been serving jail time in Russia regarding crimes in which he pled guilty to back in 2020, essentially, aiding, mediating bribes to a former deputy Russian prime minister.So there had already been the question of his legal rights in Russia as he continued to serve jail time there. According to an independent journalist who was in the courtroom today representing Mediazona, essentially, Gene Spector has been sentenced to at least 13 years in what is being described as a maximum security penal colony facility. He's also received a fine around more than $140,000 or the equivalent. So this is a significant penalty laid against Gene Spector. And as you mentioned, Christina, this is one of several now U.S. citizens who have received prison sentences in Russia, including in just the last year. We've seen in October, who's originally from Michigan, he was sentenced by Russian court for allegedly serving as a mercenary in Ukraine. That's according to Russian state media. And in July, Robert Woodland, another U.S. citizen, also now of Russian origin, was also sentenced by Russian court to a penal colony in Russia in relation to drug related charges. So, concern there. We are still waiting to hear more from U.S. officials in Washington with regards to the situation that Gene Spector now faces and what his legal rights may be there as well.",

Just last month, he was eyeing a top cabinet position in Donald Trump's second administration. Well, that ship sailed weeks ago, and now a House Ethics investigation has produced a sizable list of alleged misdeeds. The panel saying it has evidence showing Gaetz paid for sex on multiple occasions. He has denied the allegations.CNN's Marshall Cohen is in Washington, following the fallout from this report. And obviously, this report was released in full yesterday, on Monday, Marshall, and it contained some damning evidence within Matt Gaetz's text messages. Just tell us what the Ethics Committee found. MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER:  Yes, that's right, Christina. It was a damning and disturbing report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz. This was the Republican-run House Ethics Committee which said that it found substantial evidence that Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex and drugs, all while he was serving in the U.S. Congress. Most importantly, the panel also found that Gaetz had sex with a 17- year-old high schooler in summer 2017. The report concluded that this violated Florida's state statutory rape laws. Now, over the past few years, as Gaetz has faced all of this legal scrutiny, he has vehemently denied that he ever paid anyone for sex. He also denies any illegal drug use. In a social media post, yesterday, after the report came out, here's how he responded. He said, \"There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve - Eve report, and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.\" But look, Christina, there was a lot of evidence. The committee examined 14,000 pages of documents. The committee interviewed many of the key eyewitnesses. The report even includes texts of Gaetz allegedly asking women for drugs and haggling over payments. There are texts from one of these women telling a friend, you can see it here on the screen, that Matt never paid me. How much did he pay you? WTF. The friend said that she got $400 and offered some advice. Ask him for the money \"before you have sex.\" There's even a detailed ledger of payments in this report between Matt Gaetz and multiple women using Cash App and Venmo. And some of the women later testified that these payments were indeed for sex or drugs. And Christina, I should point out, the Justice Department looked into many of these allegations for potential federal crimes, but never filed any criminal charges against Matt Gaetz.",
