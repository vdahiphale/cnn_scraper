And again, we want to be sensitive to know that five people lost their lives and tragic circumstances at the depths of the Titanic wreck.But when you look at the stills, and you see them coming off the Horizon Arctic, it for investigators will prove that they actually have some investigative material there that is quite significant. In fact, if you look at some of those pieces, you can match them to the body, the outer shell of that Titan submersible. We do have a statement as well from Pelagic Research. They are the company that first was able to deploy their remotely operated vehicle to, as I said, the Titanic wreck more than two miles to the bottom. They say that they are now continuing with what they call their demobilization efforts. From their offshore operations, they say it will take several days. But again, clearly, they must have been satisfied just in the last few days with how they were able to map out the debris, which was apparently in two major locations, and then be able to -- as you can see for yourself, so significantly raise those pieces of debris. I was actually speaking to the crew that were in charge of operating the ROV, and they were also helping with trying to lift those very large pieces from the Horizon Arctic on to the certainly the St. John's harbour front, where now investigators from the Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Coast Guard will be looking over these pieces of debris and deciding where this goes next.

And I have to say there are at least four to five separate investigations, the most significant being the Transportation Safety Board right now, the U.S. Coast Guard, which is basically initiated an investigation at their highest levels, but also, Dana, what is crucial for those pieces of debris is also a criminal examination. They're calling it now the RCMP, the national police here.They're going to decide whether or not to also launch a full-blown investigation. And given their access to what perhaps they may get, whether it's interviews or debris, which is highly controversial, because one is a safety matter, the other is a criminal matter. But given what we are seeing in those pieces of debris, it may give them more clues more quickly as to whether or not a criminal investigation is even needed. And again, Dana, of course, it goes without saying, we are looking at pieces of debris, but those five people lost their lives. And these must be incredibly chilling sites for the family and friends that lost those five on the Titan submersible.",

Let's just look at what he actually said to semaphore for a second. I mean, he's talking, of course, about these documents. He's rustling around, and he said, I would say it was bravado, if you want to know the truth, it was bravado. I was talking and just holding up papers. He goes on to say, I didn't have any documents.So, I think it's not surprising that we're going to see Donald Trump, and frankly, probably his legal team try out a number of defenses when it comes to making arguments against this case. But I do want to point to a line in the indictment. When they talk about this instance, you know that we now have the audio recording of that we've played in the run up to describing that in the indictment, they refer to it as Donald Trump showed classified documents to others. The prosecutors don't write that Donald Trump just described classified documents. We don't know exactly what their evidence is to backup that line of the indictment. But we do know that they've interviewed at least one person who was sitting in that meeting, and you can bet they're asking that person as well as others, you know, what was in that pile of documents? Did you see classified markings on them? What exactly was he waving around, Dana?",

We do know that they've been focused on a lot of things Rudy Giuliani was involved in, including the fake electors' plot. They subpoenaed Giuliani months ago about payments, he got around 2020. And frankly, they've had a lot of questions for witnesses about the lawyers who were working around Donald Trump after 2020, including Giuliani, the folks that were spreading these baseless election lies, Dana.

But the former president and his allies came out with this idea that he had a standing order to declassify everything. So, he didn't actually have anything that was classified.Few weeks later, he said that this was all ridiculous because he could declassify things with his mind. Then the defense evolved to be that he didn't know what was in the boxes. How can you declassify something if you don't know what's in the box? Now we have this tape, right? This is a key piece of evidence from the special counsel. Not only is he the one who says their secret, he and first they're classified, he says he can't declassify them. And one of the new pieces of information we got from CNN attaining this tape is that he says, these are the papers, right? So, it's been these conflicting, contradicting, ever evolving or devolving, depending on how he looked at it, explanations for what happened here.

Every single thing he says, the prosecutors are watching, and they are using and thinking about, can that factor into our case? Is that something that we can show the jury, it's certainly admissible. And it would certainly be the sort of thing where they can play tape after tape. Oh, he says, now they're documents. He says they're not plans, but they are papers. I mean, you stack those up in front of a jury. And it becomes something that is quite notable in telling the story of what Trump knew and what he had and what he was showing. And as much as we want to talk about Trump as a candidate in a campaign, these court appearances are campaign appearances in many ways where he does appearances.

Thank you so much for joining me, sir. The president, as you just heard, he decided to sell his economic plan as Bidenomics. Is it wise for him to tie not just his name, but more importantly, his reelection campaign on something that is very unpredictable, like the performance of the economy, there's 16 months to go until the election?SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D-DE): Well, Dana, as you well know, President Biden has long held beliefs that building our economy from the bottom up in the middle out, focusing on strengthening the middle class, and bringing back strong manufacturing jobs, is the best way for us to rebuild our economy, to strengthen our society, and to be competitive globally. And the record over the last two years shows that it's working, instead of the trickle-down approach of the Republican Party that relies on tax cuts for the very wealthy to ultimately produce better results for working families. President Biden, as you know, signed into law, three major pieces of legislation, to invest in infrastructure, to bring advanced manufacturing plants back to the United States, and to reduce the costs facing working families. And the results show that they're having a real impact. We have the strongest post pandemic recovery of any advanced economy in the world, more than 13 million new jobs created, while President Biden has been in office including more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs. So, I don't think this is a big risk, Dana. I think he's running on his record, and it's a strong one.",

And he's focusing on manufacturing, something that helped build the middle class, and under Republican economics drained out and got shipped overseas. We are seeing the strongest resurgence of manufacturing, which is the foundation of a strong middle class in decades. So, it does mean, Dana, that we need to go on the road and that members of the administration need to go out and show the link between the bills the president has signed into law, the groundbreakings that are happening for new plants all over the country, and the path forward from groundbreaking to ribbon cutting to even better job growth in the future.",
