I'm Jake Tapper.We're going to start with our world lead with five Americans whom the U.S. says have been wrongfully detained in Iran, the longest for almost eight years, headed home. We saw them for the first time today stepping off a plane in Qatar after leaving Iran. Right now, the five are back on a plane headed to the United States. They're expected to arrive at a military installation outside of D.C. around 3:00 a.m. Eastern tonight, tomorrow morning, according to the family of the one of the released Americans. Tomorrow marks the end of a year's long nightmare for these five Americans and their family, 51-year-old Siamak Namazi, 59-year-old Emad Sharghi who's detained in 2018, 69-year-old Morad Tahbaz, also detained in 2018, all three of them facing unsubstantiated charges relating to spying by the Iranian government. The identity of the other two has not been released publicly. They want to remain private. And this is a deal in which the U.S. agrees to dismiss federal charges against five Iranians accused of violating U.S. sanctions and to unfreeze $6 billion of Iranian oil revenue. Iran is only allowed to spend these unfrozen funds on humanitarian purchases. We're told that that will be monitored by the U.S. Treasury. But President Biden is facing criticism from Republicans including from former Vice President Mike Pence who is expected in a speech this hour to say that unfreezing those Iranian funds will, quote, foment terrorism across the Middle East. Given that Iran is a U.S. designated state sponsor of terrorist groups in Gaza, Syria, Bahrain, Iraq, and throughout the Middle East. But President Biden is defending the deal. In a statement, he said, quote, reuniting wrongly detained Americans with their loved ones has a priority for administration since day one and we will continue to impose costs on Iran for their provocative actions in the region. Our coverage starts today with CNN's international anchor Becky Anderson. She's on the ground in Doha, Qatar, with what we know about each of the five Americans now on ther way home. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): smiles, hugs an tears, as five Americans detained inside of Iran for years are finally freed and on their way home. Among them, Siamak Namazi. He was arrested in 2015 while on a business trip to Iran, and charged with having relations with a hostile state. After nearly eight years in prison, Namazi was Iran's longest held American prisoner. Feeling abandoned by the U.S. earlier this year, he appealed directly to President Biden in an unprecedented interview with CNN from inside of the notorious Evin Prison. SIAMAK NAMAZI, AMERICAN RELEASED FROM IRAN (via telephone): Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out, to finally hear our cry for help and bring us home.",

Sharghi, a businessman who moved with his wife to Iran from the U.S. in 2017, was also detained in 2018, on similar charges to that of Namazi.[16:05:03] For years, their fate tied to tensions between the two countries. But with the help of a common friend in Qatar, breakthrough diplomacy brought us to this very moment. Iran freed the dual citizens in a deal to release five Iranians held in U.S. prisons, and to unblock $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds from South Korea. That cash moving from Seoul to Switzerland before being transferred to Doha, after the Biden administration last week issued a sanctions waiver clearing the way for the money to move. The role of Qatar now changing from mediator to guarantor, ensuring Washington's demands that Iran's billions are strictly controlled and spent only on humanitarian goods like food and medicine. But critics worry even with Doha's oversight, the monies could be spent however Tehran decides. There is also concern this latest deal enables what many critics have dubs Tehran's hostage diplomacy. But for the freed Americans, today, at least, politics will likely be a secondary concern as they finally get to go home after years of mental and physical anguish. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (on camera): Well, this, Jake, was a deal 18 months in the making. It started, it was a very much bigger agreement that the U.S. and Iranians were looking at. They were looking at nuclear talks but as things deteriorated and as we got into the protests in Iran and September of 2022, the women's protest, the deadly protest and the deadly crackdown but the Iranians and a number of other issues, this deal became very much more focused as far as the U.S. was concerned around these U.S. detainees. Joe Biden, the president, thanking his partners today, particularly the emir of Qatar and the sultan of Omar for what he described as extremely difficult negotiations. Eight rounds of negotiations culminating just last month in those detainees being released into house arrest and today arriving here on the tarmac in Doha. As you rightly point out, they will be back in the U.S. in the wee hours of the morning -- Jake.",

JARED GENSER, ATTORNEY FOR IRANIAN-AMERICAN FORMER PRISONER: He said, Jared, I'm free. And you know, it was a long time coming to say the least. It was extraordinary for me to see him. On a massive screen, I'm traveling abroad and in a big screen in my hotel room and coming down off the plane on CNN and then moments later for him to call me and it was incredible moving and I'm just so happy for him and the family because it's worth calling it. It wasn't just Siamak, who was a hostage, but his dad who was called back to Iran who was trying to reach his son who had been held incommunicado in an Iranian prison for many, many months was called back with a one-time chance to see his son and then he got taken hostage and spent three years in jail and almost died and was trapped in Iran for several more years and got out a year ago.

He had a bucket to go to the bathroom in, and really nothing else in the cell. No reading materials, no contact with the outside world, primarily incommunicado. He was literally taken out every day to be interrogated relentlessly over and over again. He was beaten. He was tased. He had electrodes connected to his genitals. And, you know, this is all bad enough. But actually the worst thing they did to him over that time was after his dad was detained. They showed him the video of him being detained and Siamak knew his father was clearly in prison somewhere, not far from him as it turned out. And, you know, about a month later, they came to him and said, we have some sad news, your father just died, and we're really sorry but you're not allowed out to go to his funeral.

Keep in mind that every single hostage is a victim of that regime, and deserves to come home and they are innocent and should be reunited with the loved ones. My heart however goes out to Jamshid Sharmahd and Shahad Dalili who are U.S. nationals who have been left behind, and as Jared who I know well and I've worked with, to get to others released knows very well when we fail to bring all hostages home, another deal has to be done down the line to bring other hostages, the ones who are remaining in prison home. So what it does, it incentivized hostage-taking and that's what I'm afraid of. And two days after the one year anniversary of the murder and custody of Mahsa Zhina Amini, what this sends a message of to I think the people in Iran who frankly are more than 80 million hostages taken by this regime, it's 2,500 years civilization that's been hijacked by this 44-year theocracy, frankly, and it doesn't bode well for them. So I think what we have to do is find the policy once and for all that puts an end to hostage diplomacy. I'm very happy that these hostages are coming home. I hope the rest come home soon and I hope the foreign minister has said, which is we won't stop taking Americans prisoner which essentially means hostage is false. But from their track record from the past 44 years, they will continue to do this and they've been incentivized to do so.",

And from there this issue did create a bit more of a problem for Jeffrey Clark moving forward in that his lawyer had tried to submit into this case as evidence, something that Jeffrey Clark had written, essentially what's called a declaration, a sworn statement of what his life was like, what his role was as Justice Department official saying that he hadn't been acting on behalf of Trump.But the prosecutors took issue with that and they said, wait a minute, we don't get the chance to cross-examine Jeffrey Clark's statements here. And so, the judge didn't bring that into evidence which puts him at a disadvantage because today in court, it was Jeffrey Clark's burden to try to show the judge that everything that he was doing after the election was part of his role as a federal official and they were left with very little evidence to be able to show that.

Stellantis is the international company that owns Jeep, Ram and Chrysler. And while bargaining tasks are ongoing, there are no clear signs that the strike will end any time soon.There are currently 12,700 workers across three assembly plants in three states on strikes. The UAW says it could announce walkouts at additional plants soon. And the strikes could soon go international. The union that represents auto workers up north in Canada is preparing to go on strike against Ford as early as midnight this evening. Unifor's president told CNN over the weekend that the two sides are far apart. I want to bring in Tony Totty, president of UAW local 14 in Toledo, Ohio. He represents the GM facility that was on strike in 2019 that could possibly shut down again in a current strike. Thanks so much, Tony. You oversee about 5,000 members, 1,400 of which are active, currently working at this facility and they're on the job right now. How are they feeling right now? Do they want to go on strike? Are they excited? Are they anxious? Are they worried? What's -- what's the emotion there? TONY TOTTY, PRESIDENT, UAW LOCAL 14: Thanks for having me, Jake. We're a little anxious. You know, we've been through this before and we've done it and nobody is excited to go on strike. Once you've been on strike recently. But we're prepared. You know, that's the thing about President Fain's strategy. Every single victory local was prepared to go on strike. We tried to calm them down and let them know that we weren't going to just because when you take us down, you're going to take a lot of General Motors down. So we're waiting to see what next phase looks like. But, you know, we're showing support to our cross town union family over at local 12. We just have a caravan of people go over yesterday to show the support that they showed us back in 2019.",
