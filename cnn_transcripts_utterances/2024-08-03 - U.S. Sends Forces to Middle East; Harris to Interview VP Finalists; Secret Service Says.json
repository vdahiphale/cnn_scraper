Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Haniyeh was buried in Qatar on Friday after a funeral procession attended by thousands. And the White House is now sending a naval strike group to the region, led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. U.S. officials say Iran's retaliation against Israel could be just days away. They also say it could be larger and more complex than what Tehran has done before and may not come only from Iran. Oren Liebermann explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This is arguably the largest movement of U.S. forces to the region, to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea that we have seen since the beginning of the war back in October. At that point, the Defense Departments sent two Carrier Strike Groups.Now so we're seeing almost a similar level of forces heading back once again. According to a statement from the Pentagon released on Friday afternoon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the region. That will replace another strike group that's currently in the Gulf of Oman and has been there for the past several weeks. In addition, Austin also ordered destroyers and cruisers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles, both of the Middle East and to the Mediterranean Sea. And we have seen how critical those can be. When Iran launched a massive attack on Israel back in April, that included ballistic missiles and drones, it was U.S. destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea that intercepted part of that barrage. So they have shown (INAUDIBLE) this as the U.S. braces for what could be a similar attack to what we saw back in mid-April. U.S. officials say it could be even larger, including not only drones and missiles from Iran but also perhaps more dated attack with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies perhaps attacking U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. It's also worth noting that Austin also ordered a fighter squadron to the Middle East and to the region. We have seen U.S. fighter aircraft intercept Houthi launches over the course of the past several months. It is worth noting that the U.S. normally does this fairly quietly. So it is in and of itself a statement that the U.S. is now being very vocal and very loud about what it's calling the defensive forces it's sending to the region. It is intended to send a message of deterrence to Iran and a warning about how it intends to carry out its anticipated attack. We have seen some very forceful and perhaps inflammatory rhetoric coming not only from Iran but also from Hezbollah. The U.S. is watching that very closely as it tries to calibrate its response and send a message of deescalation and a warning to the region not to start the all-out war that so many have feared -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, in the Pentagon.

And how do you contain it, again, when mediation efforts, of course, have stalled? Because the key mediator himself for the Palestinian side, Ismail Haniyeh, is the one whose assassination triggered this current moment of escalation. So real worries about how to bring the temperature down in this context, how far this war could widen and expand pressure on prime minister Netanyahu. I have to note that pressure on him to accept a ceasefire deal. He's made very clear with these recent assassinations on senior Hezbollah, senior Hamas figures, senior Islamic Jihad figure, all of these assassinations within the region that some have been claimed by Israel. To many in the region, that is a clear indication that peace is not on the table for Netanyahu for now. So how do you begin to pull these two sides, who are vowing to get at each other, back from the brink?",

Thank you for having me. I think the scenario we're looking at right now is a direct attack on Israel from Iran itself. But also Hezbollah is going to react as well. Don't forget the assassinations or twin. You had this fascination of Shukr, who's the inner swan of the inner circle of Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah. And Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. So I think we're very likely to see a multi-front attack on Israel to -- in retaliation to these assassinations. And this is very worrisome because if that emerges, if we start seeing rockets raining in on Israel from Lebanon, from Iraq, from Iran, it can escalate much further very quickly.

We haven't seen this followed up with any kind of serious policy repercussions. The only way you can deescalate today is to condition offensive arms transfers to Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza and deescalation in the region. There's no other way to do that.

The southern Indian state was sound asleep on Tuesday when thunderous landslides triggered by heavy rain came crashing at midnight, tearing buildings and shattering homes. \"To escape, we climbed on top of a terrace house and sat down. Around 4:00 in the morning, another huge landslide happened.\" Known as a haven of green hilltops and tea fields, Northern Kerala is now ravaged by its worst disaster in years. Cars are strewn like toys, homes are flattened, roads submerged, hundreds are confirmed dead. But many more are still missing. As bodies surface in these muddy waters, soldiers and rescue workers now sift through uprooted trees and broken buildings, rappelling across bloated rivers with ropes. And airlifting battered villagers with helicopters. The government built a new bridge to reach isolated areas and to dig for survivors. But with days gone since the initial landslides, rescue has turned to recovery. \"I lost my son and my grandchild. The river swept them away and I don't have a life anymore. I lost everything. They've found the body of my son.\" At hospitals, desperate villagers look from bed to bed, hoping to find their loved ones here and not among the rubble. India is also asking questions about why this tragedy occurred amid swirling claims about the timing of official warnings and who received them. But with climate change causing increasingly fatal natural disasters, experts warn this won't be Kerala's last -- Hanako Montgomery, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
