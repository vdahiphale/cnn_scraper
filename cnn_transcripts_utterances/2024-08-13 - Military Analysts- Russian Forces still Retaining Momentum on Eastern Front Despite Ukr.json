Well, our top story Vladimir Putin vows to carry out a strong response to Ukrainian forces, who have carried out the biggest incursion into Russia since the start of the war in 2022. Ukraine's forces control about 1000 square kilometers now of Russian territory in the southwestern Kursk Region, according to a Ukrainian military chief. And their expanding incursion has forced Russian officials to urge even more residents today to evacuate southwest of Kursk. Now this video just into CNN, appears to show how Ukrainian forces are making gains on the battlefield. It shows the Russian military walking past a trail of dead bodies in the Kursk border region. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls the fighting quote, fair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And quite frankly, I think a lot ofpeople in Ukraine, and certainly some of the sources that we've been speaking to, Becky, they're surprised that there hasn't been much more of a tough response from the Russians coming already. Essentially, what the Ukrainians are bracing for is some sort of gargantuan missile attack and rocket attack coming from the Russians. They believe that the Russians might then target government buildings, possibly even in Kyiv, even more so than they have in the past. There was one government official who said that he believes that this would put a big strain on Ukraine's air defenses. But the same time, the Ukrainians believe that their air defenses would be able to handle this. Of course, over the past couple of weeks, we know that the Ukrainians have been getting more munitions for their air defense systems, and there's also been more air defense systems pledged as well. However, of course, there is still that situation on the battlefield where the Russians have also said that there is going to be a tough response to that incursion and that the Russians are going to deploy more forces there, as you mentioned, to quash that incursion that's going on in the Kursk district. Last night, Vladimir Putin met with some of his security officials, and he certainly seemed extremely angry at the situation, and did say that the Russians would, as he put it, squeeze the Ukrainians out.

Vladimir Putin, again last night, said that the Russians want to achieve all of the aims of what they still call their special military operation, which, of course, essentially amounts to a capitulation and a complete surrender of Ukraine, and Ukraine ceding some territory. Nevertheless, what we're seeing on both sides is actually more talk about negotiations going on. We saw some of it from Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address last night, where he said that the Russians need to be forced to the negotiating table, if Vladimir Putin continues to not want to go to the negotiating table. Vladimir Putin, for his part, had said that he believes that one of the reasons why the Ukrainians are doing this offensive now into Russian territory is to improve their position at the negotiating table. When that will be? Is a very difficult question, but certainly, the talk of some sort of, at least negotiated cease fire seems to be gaining a certain amount of steam. When that will be, how that will be on, whose terms that will be? A lot of that is still going to be decided on the battlefield, Becky.",

But for decades now, there has been a status quo agreement there to allow Muslims to go and pray there and to ban non-Muslims from praying at that site. But today, the National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir went to this site accompanied by at least 2000 Jews, some of whom appear to be praying at that site and saying that the policy is to, quote, allow prayer, according to Itamar Ben Gvir. Now that obviously marks a significant breach of that status quo agreement. It was one that was met with swift condemnation, not only by the Palestinian Authority, but also by the Jordanian government, which is involved in maintaining that status quo at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and also by the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office, saying that the policy at the Temple Mount quote has not changed. It will remain what it has been for years now, and arguing that Ben Gvir's visit was a quote deviation from the status quo. There's no question that Itamar Ben Gvir, who has done made similar visits to this site in the past, knows exactly what he's doing, knows exactly how provocative a visit like this could be, and that is obviously how it is being viewed in a region that is already very, very tense, Becky.",

And of course, Musk, someone who recently endorsed him, who Donald Trump has a relationship with. He was a friendly interviewer, and it was a casual conversation. I had some of my sources texting me, people close to the former president, saying this is exactly what Donald Trump sounds like when he's on the phone. And it did. It felt like two hours of them kind of blowing out and just having this casual conversation. But we didn't hear anything new about Donald Trump's views. We did hear him talk about some policy things he mentioned how he wants to disband the Department of Education. That is something he has said before that wasn't new, but he did say he wants that to be a state's issue. At one point, Musk had actually floated the idea of creating some sort of agency to monitor government efficiency said he would run it. Donald Trump said, I love that idea, but we really didn't hear anything new from the former president. It was a lot of the same attacks on Harris and on Biden, and a lot of the same grievances that we've heard him kind of lay out throughout the course of his campaign. Now, when it came to Harris, he attacked her over her handling of the border. She said that she wasn't that smart when it came to Biden, he attacked him for his handling of the war in the Middle East and in Ukraine. And what I actually found was that he spent a good amount of time talking about Joe Biden, even though we know that Biden is no longer his opponent.

But he has offered no details for how to do so when I asked the Trump campaign pushing them about more information on what he exactly means, they say he is not in the business of sharing these types of plans before he is in the position to act on them. But look those comments that you just heard about how it's crazy to him that Jewish people would ever vote for a Democrat. That is not new, either. He has said this repeatedly, even though they are very stereotypical, even though they have angered many people in the Jewish community, Republicans, conservatives and Democrats alike. But this is how Donald Trump views this issue. Remember, in the aftermath of the 2020 election, and when he lost to Biden, his relationship with Netanyahu soured, in large part because he felt that Netanyahu was being disloyal by congratulating Joe Biden on winning and vowing to work with him. Donald Trump, still to this day, when you talk about Israeli politics and politics in the Middle East with him. He argues that he was the most pro-Israel U.S. President in modern history. And he does believe that, and he believes that he is the one who will deliver the most for the Israeli people. I think you know he does conflate the idea of being Jewish, with being pro-Israel and what's happening in the war.

But yes, 7 of the 10 top ones that are getting hotter faster are in Texas, a lot are in Arizona. But let me break it down here. We got a bunch of interesting charts where, Becky, we really took. We added up those days above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, 35 degrees Celsius, from the top 50 biggest cities in the country. And you can see that the length of time the summer is getting longer. Now those scorching hot days are happening in mid-June, where it used to be later in June, they're lasting until the second week of September, so there's more time that's happening. Then as we look at the bar graph across time, going back to the 70s there, as you say, Las Vegas has added an extra 17.5 days there. San Antonio is really staggering. They have an extra 15.5 days. But back in the mid-70s, Becky, in San Antonio get one week of the scorching hot temperatures. Last year, it was 13 weeks, a 1200 percent increase in the scorching hot days as you go down the list, Nashville is getting muggier as well. Washington, D.C. and Baltimore having a scorching summer of 2024 probably going to shatter some records and then is at the bottom of the list, Charlotte adds an extra 16 days as well. Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, the three biggest cities in Arizona, the three hottest, they are already hot, getting much hotter. And this is really playing out as a lesson in real time adaptation in places like Phoenix, where they now have body bags full of ice in every ambulance and fire truck to try to help heat stroke patients, folks who are either on housed, working with addiction, the young, the older, the most vulnerable, outside construction workers. It's affecting building codes in some places in Arizona, they're now trying to build corridors of shade, moving taller buildings closer to the street, breezeways, planting a lot more trees. But these things take time. And in the meantime, when you realize that this generational jump and scorching hot temperatures is really preying on the vulnerabilities of society back here, everywhere around the world. So, looking for the hot places, even in the Middle East, some role models for how to live, how to adapt, how to survive in these triple digits for longer periods of time.",

It delayed the stream, as you said, by about 40 minutes. Musk initially blames that on what's called distributed denial of service, cyber-attack, a DDOS attack, which is where attackers will try to flood a website with junk traffic to try to overwhelm its servers and knock it off line. Tech experts pretty immediately questioned that reasoning. They said the rest of the site was working fine at the time, and it may have just been a matter of too many people trying to join this conversation, real people trying to listen in. And X's servers couldn't handle it, because Musk has pulled back on engineering resources and server resources at the company. Musk did circle back this morning and say that it also was due at least in part to what he called unforced errors on the part of the company, but certainly not a good look, especially, as you said, after that other conversation with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was marred by the same kinds of technical glitches last year, a sign that perhaps this company, which wants to become the everything app, has more work to do on its technical infrastructure, Becky. So that's part one. And then we get to the actual meet of this discussion, which, as you said, went on for more than two hours was frankly, kind of rambly, but Musk lobbed softball questions at Trump, and was, you know, again, they were both sort of praising each other. Trump got to talk about a lot of his sort of core policy issues, things like immigration, and crime, and trying to lower inflation. And really these fits in a larger pattern of Musk trying to use X to directly campaign for Trump. He's also shared misleading information about the election. He shared a manipulated video about Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent. And it's really sort of striking to see the CEO of a social platform seeking to leverage the power of that platform to directly try to influence the outcome of an election. I will say too, Becky, that Musk did say this morning in a post that he would be happy to have Vice President Kamala Harris on one of these events.

And so again, I think it's this pattern where we're increasingly seeing what used to be a really mainstream social media platform where millions of people went to get their news being used to spread election disinformation, and again, to try to directly influence the outcome of this election.",

But the battle for that bronze continues on Sunday, just to recap quickly, for our viewers, the AOC, the games organizers announcing the bronze medal that was given to Jordan Chiles initially would be now ordered to the Romanian teen Ana Barbosu, who the 18-year-old. That news coming after a court of arbitration was fort ruling that determined the initial inquiry made by the Americans over Chiles's scoring was filed after the one-minute deadline.
