The list goes on.It gives you an idea of the work that would need to be done at this point. Last time around, former Governor Christie finished sixth in New Hampshire, in the New Hampshire primary, despite holding dozens of town halls here in the state. By kicking things off with the town hall this time around, it is clear they think that this time will be a different result. And we'll have to see what the process toward that result looks like.",

He actually spent hours on the stand today in this case against a U.K. tabloid group. He was accusing the publisher of hacking phones and other illegalmethods to get some private information. Harry testifying is something that you just don't see. This is extremely rare for a royal. Not since 1891 has a senior royal actually given evidence in a British court. Today, defense lawyers for the Mirror Group Newspapers used Harry's words against him. They were citing excerpts from his blockbuster memoir, \"Spare.\" And they were showing how often -- the memoir actually shows how often the palace cooperates with the media on certain stories. Let's get to CNN anchor and royal correspondent, Max Foster, in London following the case. Max, this was very interesting. What he testified to. Tell us about it. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he is basically highlighting 33 Mirror articles, or parts of articles from different parts of the Mirror Group, and saying that these were a source on information that were obtained illegally. So they're going through each one of the articles. And lots of embarrassing details, about ex-girlfriends, about his time at Eton. So lots of detail in there. The lawyer for the Mirror Group is going through each one of them really grilling Harry on why he thinks they were based on hacking. Actually, undermining that. Harry is not always across the details. His broader point is that the British tabloid media needs reform. And that's his mission. For example, there was a story about Harry and William having an argument really, or a discussion about whether or not they should meet Diana's former butler. There's disagreement about that. There was a story that appeared where Harry called him a two-faced expletive, as is reported -- this is Harry speaking, of course - \"and believes this could have come directly from voicemail that I left.\" He suggested that he might have used that expletive in the voicemail to William. So that's an example is the type of stories we're talking about here. And more broadly, he's very damning about the British government, about the papers. He talks about Piers Morgan, a former \"Daily Mirror\" editor, saying he and his band of journalists got into my mother's private and sensitive messages made him physically sick. Not just hacking Harry's phone but others around him, too, including Diana.",

Let's get some perspective now from an expert, attorney and legal affairs commentator, Areva Martin. Areva, on the issue of there being an arrest, the sheriff of Marion County said, explicitly, quote: \"What a lot of people don't understand is that law has specific instructions for us in law enforcement. Any time that we think or perceive or believe that that might come into play, we cannot make an arrest. The law specifically says that.\" He's talking about the Stand Your Ground law. So what evidence would investigators need to go ahead and arrest this neighbor? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; CNN LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Yes, Boris, this is such a tragic story. A mother trying to protect her children, loses her life to senseless gun violence. And it happens in the presence of her 9-year-old son. My heart just aches for this entire family as a mother of three myself. Florida has this Stand Your Ground law enacted in 2005. And it allows people to meet force with force. Basically, if someone believes, or reasonably believes that his life and/or safety is in danger as a result of an overt or perceived act or threat from someone else, they can use deadly forceful. The question in this case was, what was the perceived threat? We know that miss Owens was not armed with any weapon. She didn't have a knife or a gun. There's no evidence that she had done anything to cross the threshold of the home of the shooter. The door wasn't broken down. The lock wasn't broke. There was nothing to suggest that she had engaged in any kind of conduct that would be a reasonable three to the shooter. Many believe this is racial in many ways. The shooter was a white woman. This is an African-American mother of four. We know that the Stand Your Ground law has a racially disparate impact, in that it is applied and treated differently when the victims are African-Americans.",

And to resort to using violence just seems so extreme in a situation when someone is at your door. [13:45:10] We've seen it all too often when someone is innocently murdered, shot and killed because someone has the unreasonable perception. And again, we know there are these biases that people have as it relates to African-Americans and a belief that we are somehow inherently dangerous. There are so many other outcomes that could have happened with respect to this case. And then there is the question, Boris, if police know that this woman threw an item, whether it's the skate or an iPad and struck a child, why hasn't she been arrested for assaulting the child that was struck by this item? Lots of questions as to why this law enforcement agency is not moving quicker to bring some kind of justice to this family.",

CNN has not been able to confirm reports of any injuries. We're also watching a 14th day of protests across France. Police firing tear gas at demonstrators in Paris. The nationwide marches are a response to President Emmanuel Macron's moving the retirement age from 62 to 64. That is expected to take effect in September. But French union leaders say today is likely one of the last days they will rally ahead of a debate Thursday in the National Assembly. And today marks 79 years since D-Day, the allied invasion of France, the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany. To this day, it remains the largest amphibious invasion in history, with more than 160,000 allied troops crossing the English Channel and storming the beaches of Normandy. More than 13,000 troops parachuted in behind enemy lines. Today, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with veterans in Normandy to mark this solemn occasion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN.
