And according to police, barricaded themselves inside using chairs, tables, and vending machines. Police climbed through a second storey window to enter the hall and use what they call distraction devices including flashbangs but not tear gas. This is the second time in two weeks university officials have invited the NYPD onto campus to clear out pro-Palestinian protesters and a police presence will remain there for the next two and a half weeks. Before hundreds of riot police marched onto campus, the mayor of New York City urged parents of students at Columbia to call their children and urge them to leave the area for their own good.

The facility has to be cleared relatively soon, just to get the graduation set up and stabilized. Lots of parents want to come, most of the students are not involved with any of this whatsoever.And I think that the that -- that at least from Colombia's viewpoint, and I've talked to people at Columbia, I work with people who are working with Colombia, from Columbia's viewpoint, the escalation yesterday unless stopped, in other words, entering the building, unless stopped decisively in their mind would have just continued to other buildings. So the most important part that my take away and my nervousness earlier in the evening was, of course, whatever you think about the politics of this, these are students, they're young people, and that no one got hurt is the most important thing. We can figure out their motivations and whether they are from the university or not. But it seems like the police came in, they first wanted to deescalate, they told people to disperse, they gave students what we would call off ramps to leave without arrest, and then those who want to or to stay or to be arrested were done so. So, I look at it this now then a little bit differently than I did four hours ago. And I think that's important to remember, these are, John, has we live in the world of like, you know, could it have gone? You know, what could have gone horribly wrong?

One is just because of the police activity there two weeks ago, when you really saw not just a response by Columbia students, but it really did launch the nationwide response by students throughout.So I want to be careful here. I mean, one is clearly there are outsiders and schools, all schools and universities that's spent a lot of time advising them, which is you've got to get access control to these universities that they can be controlled access to buildings, access to common areas. On the other hand, just to make clear, we delude ourselves of we think that this is just like outside agitators or naive people that the students are reflecting a very strong sentiment, not just in the United States, but throughout the world. They are they are -- we may not agree with them. They are committed they're allowed to protest, they're not allowed to trespass or to damage property. And I think as we look at the weeks ahead until graduation, which is essentially, you know, colleges and universities just biding time until summer, right, when the students actually have to vacate is to still allow for that peaceful protest. I think what we've seen in the backfire significantly when of -- when you don't give an outlet, an outlet for these protests, whatever your politics are.

BOXALL: No. I mean, it's one of the only real time accounts that we have in terms of they add the numbers on an ongoing basis based on media reporting and things like that.
