A spokesman claims that Israeli troops have breached the defensive lines, what it calls the main stronghold of Hamas.The IDF have released this video of ground troops, describing the combat as house to house, tunnel to tunnel. On Friday, Israel's defense minister told Israeli troops that he sees signs that Hamas was, quote, \"beginning to break.\" The United States vetoed the latest attempt by the U.N. Security Council to call for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The resolution had 13 votes in support, with the U.K. abstaining. The U.S. says it blocked the measure, because it failed to condemn Hamas for attacking Israel on October 7. Israel has now responded to these images of men, wearing just underwear, being rounded up in Gaza. An Israeli government spokesperson says the detained men are suspected terrorists. He said anyone who is not associated with a terrorist group will be released. CNN spoke with people who recognized some of the individuals and said that they were civilians, not militants. CNN's Ivan Watson covering this from Beirut. So the war continues because the veto did not work?",

I think it reveals a failure of diplomacy, Max, as well as the growing international isolation of Israel and its closest ally, the U.S.With the growing chorus of condemnation of the U.S. veto, of this cease-fire resolution, it has created a very unusual situation, where you have Russia echoing the same criticism of the world's largest human rights organizations. The U.S. envoy, to the U.N., defending the U.S. veto of the cease-fire resolution, argued that a cease-fire would be, in his words, \"dangerous.\" It would leave Hamas in power, to regroup and one day carry out future attacks against Israel. The Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Security Council thanked the U.S. for their support. As for criticism of this, take a listen to the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. Security Council.

So the Biden administration in a curious position here. It has argued to continue the fight on the ground in Gaza. The Israeli Defense Force, the military, said it carried more than 450 strikes at different targets in Gaza over the period of some 24 hours. Fierce fighting continuing in the southern part of Gaza in Khan Yunis, house to house fighting reported.

I play with them, I joke with them and distract them from their misery,\" says Ahmad Khaled (ph). \"When they hear the bombing, they're terrified.\" But there is no escape.

Researchers say the spread of these infections is an urgent crisis which must be addressed.They looked at three regional hospitals in November and December last, year speaking to hundreds of patients. The report says this increase can be linked to Ukraine's high prewar rates of drug resistant infections, mixed with a rise of traumatic wounds and the war-related strain on health care facilities. Meanwhile, Ukraine says Russia launched 95 air attacks across the country in the past 24 hours. Several areas in the east were targeted, including Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk. It comes after Russia fired a wave of cruise missiles for the first time in nearly 80 days. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The ground is turning hard, even hostile, as winter sets in. But Ukraine appeared bullish, Friday, releasing these drone images of strikes on Russian positions in the hotly contested eastern town of Avdiivka. The light bravado off the soundtrack belying real Ukrainian anxieties but Russia slow and brutal grind forward in this town and elsewhere, may be what persists in the savage cold of winter. Not Western unity behind Ukraine as U.S. Congress stalls in approving vital aid. Fears echoed in renewed dawn destruction Friday. Kharkiv here hit hardest, perhaps but across Ukraine and old terror returned to the skies. Cruise missiles fired at an array of targets, including the capital. Ukraine said 14 of 19 fired were shot down, only debris hitting Kyiv. But as they surveyed the damage, the White House is warning era defenses will be perhaps the first impacted when U.S. aid ran out, was surely front of mind. Less fracture and debris in Moscow, where in a year of surprises for the Kremlin, Friday had none. Vladimir Putin prompted by a Russian occupying soldiers saying he would run again to be Russian president. Still, after facing down a coup and military setbacks in Ukraine, he said he had thought twice about it. I won't deny it, he said but at different times I had different thoughts. This time, you're right. It is the time to be decisive. Like nearly everything in Russian politics, it was as arranged is the results in the March vote will likely be. Also on hand in Moscow was Iran's president Ibrahim Raisi, one of the few world leaders who will still shake Putin's hand. His drones have aided Russia's bombardment of Ukraine's cities all summer and now winter has left Putin walking surprisingly tall.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the Taiwan Strait to the South China Sea, saber-rattling and rising U.S.-China tensions. Beijing says the U.S. Navy illegally intruded its territorial waters, mobilizing China's military to track an American warship near the hotly contested Spratly Islands, nearly 700 miles from the Chinese coast. A People's Liberation Army statement says the U.S. deliberately disrupted the situation in the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy says the ship was conducting routine operations in international waters, consistent with international law. Taiwan keeping a close eye on that latest regional standoff between two global superpowers. Beijing's expanding military exercises and persistent incursions, setting the stage for a powder keg. Taiwan bracing for potential conflict, developing its first indigenous submarine, hoping to stop China from blockading the island. Taipei says Beijing is bolstering its military might on the sea, beefing up air bases, deploying drones and fighter jets near the island. A new report from Taiwan's defense ministry says the Chinese military uses realistic combat training and exercises to strengthen its preparedness against Taiwan, an island democracy China's Communist rulers claim as their own territory, despite never controlling it, even unveiling a blueprint plan for one day integrating Taiwan. All on the verge of what could be its most crucial presidential election ever. Three political parties battling for the hearts, minds and votes of nearly 24 million Taiwanese. Last month, a nail-biting political showdown, playing out live on screens across Taiwan. Rival leaders storming out, flinging accusations; the clock ticking toward a crucial registration deadline.
