I'm Becky Anderson, this is \"Connect the World\". CNN on the streets of Tehran, along with thousands of mourners for the funeral of an Iranian commander killed in an Israeli airstrike. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump making stops around the battleground states after Trump calls for U.S. troops to quell any election unrest. Our music mogul Sean Diddy Combs accused of sexual assault and six new lawsuits. We are live in Los Angeles. Well, the Stock Market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and futures indicating a flat open investor keeping an eye on earnings from banking giants Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. It's 09:00 a.m., of course, in New York, back at the open. First up though, new fiery threats from the acting leader of Hezbollah just a short time ago, promising to bring pain to Israel. Excuse me, Sheik Naim Qassem said, since no place in Lebanon has been off limits in Israel's bombardment, Hezbollah has the right, he says, to strike anywhere within Israel. This comes after a new vow from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that the attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon will not stop. CNN's Jeremy Diamond staying on top of the very latest developments for us, he is out of Jerusalem today. Jeremy, we just heard from Hezbollah's Deputy Leader. He had some very specific things to say, as Benjamin Netanyahu vows to press on, what more can you tell us at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, the bottom line, Becky, is that neither side, neither Hezbollah nor the Israeli government areintent on backing down as this war continues to escalate between these two sides. We heard Naim Qassem, who has made clear that Hezbollah is going to continue the fight, is going to continue inflicting pain on Israel, citing several recent successes. Notably that drone attack on an Israeli base on Sunday night, and vowing that the resistance, as he terms it will not be defeated. And the Israeli Prime Minister is issuing similarly defiant and belligerent language, vowing in the wake of that strike on that training base, as he was speaking from that base yesterday, saying that Israel will continue striking without mercy everywhere in Lebanon, including in Beirut. We are seeing, of course, that the Israeli military is continuing to expand that ground operation in Southern Lebanon. And there are calls inside of Israel, not only from the right wing, but even from the center, the one member of the opposition, Benny Gantz, a former member of the Israeli war cabinet, saying that he believes this ground operation should not only continue, but should also expand its mission inside of Southern Lebanon. And so, the question is, where is this going to lead us? Because the hope inside of Israel was that this military pressure, through this ground operation, through these air strikes over the course of the last several weeks now, would ultimately put pressure on Hezbollah to lay down its arms and agree to some kind of a long-term ceasefire that would also see them withdraw dozens of kilometers away from the Lebanese border. So that Israeli residents, some 60,000 who have been displaced from the north, can return to their homes. But right now, at least that prospect seems very far away as Hezbollah continues to fire hundreds of rockets and missiles a day on Northern Israel and as the Israeli military, of course, continues not only its ground operation, but its airstrikes across Lebanon that have forced the displacement of about a million Lebanese civilians. And of course, in addition to that, we have seen at least 1300 people who have been killed in Lebanon over the course of the last year.",

We don't know exactly how many troops or how many, what percentage of the components needed for this system are actually here. The Pentagon is saying that the rest of the troops and the components will arrive in Israel in the coming days. As far as when this system could be fully operational, the closest timeline the U.S. would provide is in the near future. They won't get any more specific than that. But obviously the fact that we are seeing not only this THAAD system arriving now in Israel. We are also hearing that Israel has agreed not to strike Iran's nuclear or oil facilities, following a week of intense consultations with the United States. All of this, of course, is an indication that Israel's strike on Iran in retaliation for that barrage of ballistic missiles a couple weeks ago is getting very close, Becky.",

There was definitely, Becky, a lot of people who turned out at this funeral. I would say tens of thousands of people were there in central Tehran. And what was really interesting to us, as well as those large parts of the Iranian leadership also showed up there, as well. The President Masoud Pezeshkian, he was in attendance. But then also, pretty much the entire military leadership as well, the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, and also the head of the Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, which is, of course, the Foreign Operations Wing of the Revolutionary Guard, Esmail Qaani. He was there as well. He'd been out of sight for a couple of days, so this was one of the first times that we had been able to see him again, speaking to people on the ground there, a lot of them extremely angry at the fact that this revolutionary guard commander was killed.

      "sentences": "We've been hearing warnings, Becky, for some time now, from humanitarian organizations on the ground and hearingfrom civilians essentially trapped in Northern Gaza. Many of whom have been warning that the encirclement of the Israeli troops on the ground that the intense bombardment of Northern Gaza has left many civilians there trapped. Aid organizations haven't been able to actually get into a significant part of Northern Gaza in order to deliver vital humanitarian aid, food, medicines, and, of course, medical support for teams on the ground treating patients. And of course, what we've been hearing from civilians, which the U.N. also references, or rather the U.N.'s Human Rights Office references, in this stark statement, is that some civilians have reported being fired at by the Israeli military in their attempt to flee Northern Gaza. Of course, this is important to note, because the Israeli military has for almost two weeks now, been ordering civilians to evacuate Northern Gaza. They have been told to leave and to move to the Al-Mawasi coastal area. This is a designated humanitarian zone. We heard these warnings telling civilians to evacuate there before, multiple times now. But of course, important to remember this humanitarian zone, as it's called, is not guaranteed to be safe. We've seen it targeted in the past, struck in the past by the Israeli military. What we've also seen, according to our own analysis, is that this humanitarian zone has been shrinking since the beginning of the war, since this was designated a safe zone. So, as you can imagine, for many civilians who have been told to flee now time and time again, they are concerned for their safety, not only in this humanitarian zone, but also in terms of actually just getting there, fleeing, worried that they may come under attack by the Israeli military, as some civilians have reported to us, to other news outlets and, of course, to the United Nations. Now there has been some suggestion that the Israeli military is essentially following a surrender or staff strategy that was initially put forward by a retired Israeli general, essentially the motivation there to order all civilians to leave the area, leaving only Hamas militants to remain and essentially staff as a result of this siege on Northern Gaza. Clearly, though, this is impacting civilians who have chosen to stay in Northern Gaza. We've been hearing from some who have said that, essentially, they fear that they will be killed wherever they are, so that they would rather be killed in their homes. Many of these civilians have already been forced to flee to the south and have since come back to Northern Gaza. This is a deeply worrying situation, particularly as communications are so fraught, and as aid organizations and aid workers on the ground aren't actually able to get to this portion of Northern Gaza. So, it is deeply troubling, deeply concerning, as you mentioned, the U.N. Human Rights Office now warning in the statement, this could amount to a war crime. This is not the first time we've heard those kinds of words from the U.N. Human Rights Office. Whether there will be substantial action pressure put on the Israeli military to bring an end to the siege that remains to be seen, Becky.",

And we have seen Trump use cities like Chicago as a backdrop to deliver that message. He had a very similar message just last week at an Economic Club in Detroit, where he actually trashed the City of Detroit while he was speaking there.

These six accusers are being represented by this attorney. So, these are the first to come after that press conference. Now, these allegations are six different individuals from six different instances, occurring from 1995 as recently as 2021. Now both male and female accusers all anonymously, filed under a Jane Doe or John Doe. There are four men and two women. And as you said, Becky, one of these male accusers, alleges that he was a 16-year-old teenage boy at the time that he met Combs at one of his infamous white parties, those lavish parties that he held in the Hamptons that were celebrity filled. He says that is where he was sexually assaulted. Now that is not the only alleged incident that occurred at a white party. Another anonymous male accuser said that in 2006 he was hired to work security at one of the white parties. He says that he was drugged by Combs and then sexually assaulted by him. Now another incident that occurred in 2004 comes from a female accuser who said that she was a 19-year-old college student at the time. She says that she was raped. Both women who have filed lawsuits yesterday, by the way, Becky, say that they were raped. Two of the men alleged that they were sodomized. So, these details are incredibly graphic. Now, I do want to point out that I heard from Combs' attorneys, and they are denying this. Here is what they told me. They say, quote, Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process. In court, the truth will prevail that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone, adult or minor, man or woman. So, you see there, they are not responding to the specific allegations set forth in the six lawsuits. But they are not just saying that he denies these six accusers claims. They are saying that he has never sexually assaulted anyone. Now where this stands in the context of where Combs is. This is now 18 civil lawsuits that he faces, one from his ex-girlfriend, Cassie, has been settled, but 17 are still active. And of course, he is behind bars right now. He has been denied bail numerous times from separate judges as he awaits his criminal trial, which just last week, the judge set a date it will be in early May 2025, he was indicted and faces three criminal charges. So, a big uphill battle for Combs as he continues to deny these allegations, but as the accusers keep coming forward, Becky.",

Other items up for sale included a sword used by Kit Harington's Jon Snow character, and several outfits worn during the series. Well, Manchester United ending its arrangement with legendary manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired 11 years ago. The club has paid him more than 2 million pounds since his 2014 role started as a global club ambassador. I don't suppose he's been buying up \"Games of Thrones\". \"Games of Thrones\", memorabilia -- Amanda Davies joining me now. Look, the end of an era is a real hackneyed phrase, isn't it? But this is truly an end of an era, certainly from Manchester United.

But this, you have to say, is, if not the biggest call, definitely the most symbolic because of what Sir Alex Ferguson means to Manchester United, and the success he has brought to the club in his 40 years there, since he joined in 1986. He has been omnipresent. He has been in charge of transfers even when he hasn't been the man on the touchline. It's a huge call. He's 83 years of age.",
