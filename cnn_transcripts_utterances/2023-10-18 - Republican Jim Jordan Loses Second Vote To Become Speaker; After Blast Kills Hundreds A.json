The Hamas-controlled Palestinian health ministry now says at least 471 people were killed in the blast. One doctor who was on the scene says more than half of the casualties, half are children. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike caused the carnage, but Israel denies that, blaming a failed rocket-launch by Islamic Jihad. And it's important to note that CNN cannot independently verify what caused the explosion nor the extent of the casualties. A spokesman for Gaza Civil Defense told CNN it was, quote, \"a massacre\". And we do have to warn you, his description is graphic and indeed very disturbing. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHMOUD SABER BASAL, SPOKESPERSON, GAZA CIVIL DEFENSE (through translator): We were here in the first moments after the bombing, and honestly, we found this place full of dead, burned bodies and bodies torn to pieces. Bodies without heads, heads over there, hands and legs over here. A massacre that we have never seen in our lives. We started with first aid and removing the bodies from the area. But the event was horrible. Hundreds of civilians were transferred for healing. The ambulance can only handle carrying one person. But this disaster was severe and horrible. We had to put 3 to 4 people in the ambulance. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As we've just laid out there, the U.S. believes that Israel is not responsible for the blast at Al-Ahli Hospital. Has that evidence that the IDF has presented convinced regional leaders that you've been speaking to? BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Well, the short answer, Isa, is no. A heinous massacre committed by Israel against innocent, injured and sick civilians, not mincing his words is how King Abdullah of Jordan described that blast at the Gaza hospital. That statement released in the wake of that blast. I spoke to Jordan's Foreign Minister earlier, and I asked him whether Jordan still believes the Israelis were behind it, given the intelligence the IDF says it refutably shows it wasn't them.

Abbas had decided to leave. We had a thorough long discussion with the Americans, and we came to the conclusion that the presidential card, the office of the president is very important. The U.S. plays a key role, not just in managing and dealing with the current catastrophe, but for later. So I think everybody reached the conclusion that it is better not to have the president under these circumstances. Because what people were expecting was a decision to end the war. That decision was not obviously forthcoming. And again, after consultation and discussion with Egypt and the Palestinians, and after a thorough discussion with the U.S., we made the decision to not to convene the summit.

We will never allow another population transfer.Which by the way is by international law a war crime by the Geneva Convention and its protocol of 1977, a war crime. So that's something that just we will not accept. We will not allow Israel to transfer the crisis to Jordan. If there is any real attempt to do that, Palestinians don't want it, Jordanians don't want it. So what it will do is, let me be honest, it will be just another war in the region. It will be expanding the area of conflict. It will not bring peace. So again, make no mistake, when it comes to that, our position is unwavering. We will never allow a population transfer from Palestine into Jordan, and that would just take the conflict into a whole new dimension that would be dangerous and disastrous for the whole area. So, no, that will not happen. Palestinian homeland is on their national soil. The two-state solution is the only way to go forward. Israel has to understand that. The world has to understand that.

One of which was to try and get that humanitarian corridor open. And President Biden may believe that he's achieved that here. He certainly exerted significant pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to concede to allowing humanitarian aid in through that Rafah Crossing. We know just how important that is and how much aid is built up on the Egypt side of that crossing. But here is the rub. Israel has been absolutely emphatic, saying that no aid will get into Gaza through Israel, through any of the Israeli border around the enclave. And that is until the hostages they say are released. Now, it's important to note that Qatar continues mediating those efforts according to my diplomatic sources, to get those hostages out. They are in touch with Hamas, as we know, the U.S. and Israel. And they have been effectively calling for a temporary ceasefire to try and get those hostages out. Now, it's clearly not something we are hearing, as being signed up to on the part of the Israelis. Not something they will agree to, certainly not in northern Gaza. So you know, your question is, what does this humanitarian aid opportunity now look like? From the south, it is unclear, we understand how much pressure there is for it and how important it is for those who have fled south. We also understand just how important it would be to get humanitarian aid into northern Gaza. And at this point, that would only be through Israeli borders. And that, the Israelis say, is not going to happen unless those hostages are released. Isa?",

He blamed a terrorist group inside of Gaza, said this was based on data provided by the U.S. Department of Defense. The president is now on his way back to Washington, though, we should be clear here, departing earlier than planned. Next leg of his trip or what was meant to be the next leg, including face-to-face meetings with regional leaders, now, the Jordanian leader, the Egyptian leader, that was called off after that hospital blast, dashing hopes of reaching some sort of agreement, in particular on getting that aid into Gaza and quickly. I want to speak now to CNN's MJ Lee at the White House. MJ, this clearly did not go as planned. The president was going to go to Tel Aviv, then he was going to have this summit of sorts in Amman, the Gaza hospital blast caused the cancellation of that Amman leg of the trip.

However, as Becky was talking about earlier, there is a huge caveat. And that caveat is that there is no agreement to allow aid to flow in through any Israeli-Gaza border. That means that we are really probably talking about the Rafah Crossing. And you know better than anyone, Jim, that, that -- the situation on the ground there has been incredibly complicated to the point that even when there were situations and days where people in Gaza believed that the border was supposed to be open, and we are talking about foreigners as well, they would actually go to that border crossing and realize that at that corridor was not open. So needless to say, this has been an incredibly tough situation for the Biden administration to try to navigate. So we'll just have to see whether this actually ends up being fruitful in the sense that we see physically the kind of aid that we have been talking about, food, water, electricity. That aid actually physically begins to move from the Egypt side into Gaza because we know very well that there are so many people in the community that are saying they are really in dire straits, that they really need this help, and so far, that help has not reached them.",

And you are absolutely right to point out, Isa, that aid could not come quickly enough. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice-over): This is where international aid should be flowing into Gaza. But it's been eerily quiet. Vital life-sustaining humanitarian aid has been piling up, stuck in no man's land on the wrong side of the border while agencies sound the alarm on an accelerating humanitarian crisis. Now there are signs of a breakthrough. On Wednesday, hours after a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Biden landed on his wartime visit to Israel, hours later, he delivered these remarks.",

Meanwhile, his own spokesperson Russell Dye says that they absolutely will go forward. So they're not even in agreement. But in this background, there are these conversations among some moderate, more centrist Republicans about just simply giving the temporary Speaker, Patrick McHenry, some additional powers to allow the house do some of its work.

To bring up what's called a privileged resolution to force this vote in order to give Patrick McHenry some more powers to at least put legislation on the floor.

And of course, let's keep in mind, that anger has been mounting since the Israeli attack on Gaza has intensified and the death toll has mounted. So it's not surprising that many people have been coming out into the streets within the last 24 hours in the aftermath of that strike on the hospital in Gaza. And of course, this sense of insecurity is certainly starting to be felt elsewhere in terms of governments. The United States government has informed American citizens not to travel to Lebanon, and is told that family members of embassy staff, as well non-emergency staff, can now leave the country. Saudi Arabia came out and told all of its nationals currently in Lebanon to leave immediately. France and the U.K. are advising against any except the most necessary travel to Lebanon.
