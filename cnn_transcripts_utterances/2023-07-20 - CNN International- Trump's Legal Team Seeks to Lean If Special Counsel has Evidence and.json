Multiple reports say Trump could be facing charges related to these three laws, including conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the United States and tampering with a witness. And Trump is preparing to fight this in court. He's added a new criminal defense attorney to his legal team. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more now from New Jersey. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I spent the day on the phone talking to Trump's advisers, Trump's lawyers and all of them told me that they were trying to figure out if there was any sort of evidence or witnesses that they didn't know about in this case particularly that would boost up Jack Smith's case. Now a lot of this has to do with that target letter and those potential charges. I'm told when they stalled those potential charges, it was much more robust and became much more clear that Jack Smith the special counsel, had a much bigger case he was trying to prosecute against the former president than what Trump's team had believed in the first place. And you have to keep in mind, Trump's team has been watching this investigation very carefully. And on top of that, there are a number of witnesses who have gone before the grand jury in the January 6 investigation whose lawyers were paid for by Trump world. Now that has given them a unique amount of insight into this investigation. Yet still, they were taken by surprise. So clearly here they're trying to figure out if there was any sort of evidence or witness that they didn't know about that has led to this. The other part of this is that they are telling me that this going to be business as usual. If he is indicted, it would be his third indictment and they are just going to continue campaigning. The thing to remember, again, is that he is a candidate for president once more -- this is his third White House bid. And these legal issues have actually been bolstering his campaign, both in fundraising and polling. But I'm told by advisers that they still don't know the long- term effect of these kind of legal issues. Obviously, we are in unprecedented territory. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Bridgewater, New Jersey.

But let me show you some of the temperatures and how hot they have been in places for weeks.Again, more excessive heat watches and warnings all across the South and Southwest. By the end of the weekend, 170 more record highs will be broken and likely no record lows for sure. Heat in Dallas Thursday, 105 this afternoon. Look at what has happened in Phoenix. 20 now consecutive days with temperatures at 110 or more. And that is not likely to change when you see Thursday and Friday at 118. Now, I'm sure, and I know it's supposed to be hot in phoenix, but it's only supposed to be 107. That's your average. You are 11 degrees above normal and not cooling down at night. That's another problem where you are still in the 90s when you wake up. You don't even get outside to do anything in the cool weather because there simply is no cool weather. Vegas in the 114 to 116 range. We already saw Phoenix. Look at Palm Springs running up at 120. And so even if we look ahead to the next week after this, we're still in this above normal to much above normal weather across the South and the Southwest. Even reaching all the way up into the southern provinces there of Canada. Look at Vegas, again 115 on Saturday. You shouldn't be anywhere near that. It is still going to be hot because monsoon hasn't kicked in yet. We are waiting for storms to pop up in places like Phoenix and Tucson and Flagstaff and Vegas. We hope that these things pop up, the showers cool off the afternoon. They can make dust storms and they could make cooler weather and they can do a lot of things, lightning as well. But you need the thunderstorm activity to get these temperatures down. The humidity has to come up unfortunately to make that happen. But you will get some cooldown as soon as monsoon begins. It's already about a month late. And in the heat of the day and in the humidity here across parts of the Midwest and even for the Southeast, there will be the chance of more severe weather during the afternoon -- this afternoon. Heat and humidity, a little bit of lift in the atmosphere, the clouds are going to bubble and even some of these storms could contain a tornado or two. Not too likely. The biggest threats are going to be high winds and large hail. But we have to keep our eyes out, especially in the heat of the day somewhere between three and 5 o'clock. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Authorities say two people were killed and six others wounded by a gunman with a shotgun near the waterfront. He was later found dead. The government quickly determined that the shooting was an isolated incident and unrelated to the World Cup. CNN's Angus Watson joins us live this hour from Sydney, Australia.
