New reporting tonight.Plus, just in, the Georgia D.A. investigating Trump reveals her timeline for possible criminal indictments against Trump and his allies. It is specific, and the reporter who broke that story will be OUTFRONT. And a story that you'll first OUTFRONT tonight. Diamonds, furs, luxurious vacations, the wife of one of the men behind Putin's deadly invasion living it up. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, fired. We are learning new details about how Tucker Carlson's sudden exit from Fox News went down. A source telling CNN that Carlson was not given a heads up, and according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" which is also owned by Fox's parent company, Carlson was also notified 10 minutes before the network publicly announced his part departure. I mean, that is incredible, 10 minutes for their top anchor. It was so abrupt that the network was still promoting his show right as the news broke this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when they admitted the network lied. That is a pretty incredible thing. That just gives you a sense of the importance of Tucker Carlson to Fox News. So the question tonight is an important one. Why was Tucker let go? Was it his baseless claims about the 2020 election, that were at the center of the Dominion defamation lawsuit, you know, the one that cost Fox $787.5 million?

But if you look at the timeline, look at how things have changed or what's happened since she came forward back in late March, she came forward with evidence that Fox hadn't turned over to the court and the Delaware judge got really upset at Fox, almost sanctioned Fox, appointed a special master to look into Fox's misconduct, and even told Fox's lawyers, hey, hold onto your email and communications and pretty harsh things for attorney to do, make sure that their intentions could be revealed. So, soon thereafter, of course, that case settled. Now, whether she was the direct cause of the settlement, we'll never know. But certainly, we'd like to think that the value of the settlement substantially increased to what it was because of Abby's revelations. And fast forward to today, a week after, our case is still pending. We still have a case here in New York. And Tucker Carlson is the primary bad actor in that case. You know, it's his show where our client Abby Grossberg worked, where she suffered rapid misogyny, and, you know, the things that she endured was unbelievable. I haven't seen that in my career in defending employees. So, I think, you know, if you look at the timing, again, she's coming forward, things happen, she's coming forward again, things continue to happen.

So, Governor, why do you think it is worth it to provoke China right now with this trip? GOV.

And these supply chains for critical sectors in semiconductors and pharmaceuticals and automotive supply are at the heart of not just economic activity but of those sectors that we need to make sure that we are re-domiciling the supply chain and centering it on trusted -- on trusted partners. So that's why I'm so excited to be here. I had an extraordinary meeting yesterday with President Tsai.

And we've seen the same movement of politics into the board room.And we should just take a big step back and recognize that not everything needs to be politicized. And when a board room presses into political issues and social issues, it does create a moment for a debate, and there's nothing wrong with the debate, but companies should just recognize that there are ramifications.

Multilateralism when Russia has, in their unilateral, unprovoked action against Ukraine, attacked everything that the U.N. charter stands for, and everything that we value as members of the United Nations.

How does this happen?Our Clarissa Ward has more in this story airing first OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Svetlana Maniovich is a woman of expensive tastes. Diamonds and couture, extravagant parties and European vacations. Just last month, she was seen shopping and dancing in the elite French ski resort of Courchevel. But Maniovich is no ordinary Russian socialite. She is the other half of Russia's deputy minister of defense, Timur Ivanov, one of the most senior architects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And, according to a shocking investigation, Maniovich continues to gallivant around France more than a year into Russia's bloody war, despite the fact that Ivanov was sanctioned by the E.U. in October. The explosive report put out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an investigative outfit funded by Russia's jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny is based, they say, on a leaked archive of more than 8,000 of Maniovich's emails over the last 12 years and has racked up more than 6 million views on YouTube. It claims that on March 25, 2022, as dozens of missiles rained down on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the Place Vendome. How was it possible that she can continue to do this? MARIA PEVCHIKH, HEAD OF INVESTIGATIONS, ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: It's a very simple trick that they've played. Number one, Svetlana has an Israeli passport through her first husband. And, second of all, six months into the war, they have filed for divorce. They haven't split any assets. Nothing has changed in terms of, like, in the daily life. Whatever they owned, they keep owning together. But, technically, they are not legally married anymore. WARD: Equally shocking are the opulent lifestyle and lavish spending that the leaked emails document. According to Russian business publication RBC, Ivanov's official income was once declared to be around 14.2 million rubles, less than $175,000. Yet, the Navalny group's report calculated that the couple spent more than a quarter of a million dollars in just one summer. CNN has not been able to independently verify those numbers. How is he funding this lifestyle?",
