Search crews are scouring the waters offthe coast of Greece after a fishing boat carrying hundreds of migrants sank earlier today. At least 78 people are now confirmed dead. Officials say the boat set off from Libya bound for Italy and that no one on board was wearing a life jacket. More than a hundred people have been rescued so far and brought to the city of Kalamata, Greece. Let's get straight to Barbie Nadeau in Rome with the very latest. Barbie, no one wearing a life vest and also suggestions that there could have been several hundred people aboard this vessel.",

More than twenty thousand people have died trying to cross usually from North Africa into Italy since 2014. You know we're hearing reports that this particular boat could have had as many as seven hundred and fifty people. Of course, we don't know because human smugglers don't keep passenger lists or anything of that nature. One of the things we do know from previous shipwrecks like this is so often, people are locked in the lower levels of the ship, especially when the ship is overcrowded like this. And the reason that is to keep the ship in balance, so that it doesn't tip over, so that it doesn't sink. So, what they don't know, and they haven't been able to ascertain yet, is that there are people at the bottom of the sea locked in this boat. You know, the 104 people who survived were all men. The 78 bodies that we don't know exactly, much of the demographic of those people yet. But you can be sure that those were the people that were on the upper level of the boat. This tragedy is not going to have a happy ending, because even those survivors, those people who have been brought to safety, a lot of them probably won't even qualify for assistance or for protection in Europe and may very well be repatriated back to their country of origin, Julia.",

And so many people who get on these boats, you interview people who survive these crossings, you know, more than 55,000 people have made it to Italy so far this year on these -- on these terribly dangerous boats. A lot of them didn't realize how long the journey was. And so often the traffickers just assure the people who often pay thousands of dollars of their life savings to make this dangerous crossing for hope and safety. A lot of them, you know, are told that they'll be rescued at sea, that someone will come and save them. Of course, that's not the dynamic, you know. A lot of the countries, Italy, Malta, and Greece are on the frontline of this migration issue right now. And, you know, there are lots of NGO rescue boats out there trying to do their work to rescue people. But at the end of the day, Europe doesn't want them to come.

I want to ask you about the comments fromthe U.S. Defense Department, Tuesday, that it's supplying a further 15 Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine. It comes, and you and I have discussed this a number of times, just days after reports that Kyiv had lost a number of vehicles in their offensive. What more can you tell us and how important this will be? SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, I think, Julie, I think this is very important for two things. The first is battlefield replacements are necessary. They are losing and will lose more and more equipment as this counteroffensive grows in strength. And as Fred was saying there, these are the early days of this counteroffensive and there will be more casualties, there will be more loss of vehicles, and therefore they'll need replacing. But also, and it's connected, is that President Zelenskyy here has been very emphatic to the international community, to his allies and donors saying when this counteroffensive gets underway, do not forsake us. We are going to need resupply. Resupply in the form of ammunition, equipment and ultimately the supply he's desperate for is the F-16 air cover because, and again you heard that in Fred's report, the Russians dominate the skies and when you get down to the frontlines, that really is a very significant strategic advantage. There's very little that ground troops can do in the face of fighting, fighter jet, fighter bombers that are bombing and striking from very safe standoff positions well beyond the reach of most of the air defenses that are available to frontline units. So, that is a very key thing. But I think it will be very significant in terms of morale signalling from the Russians that almost an immediate response.

Then, once he has a lawyer, he has to begin to look at the various motions that are available to him. The first one I think would be to get the search warrant and see whether or not they can attack the probable cause, the basis for the search warrant to try to get some of the evidence knocked out. Then, I think because the most serious charges in this indictment are his obstruction of justice, and those come largely from the mouth of his former lawyer. He's going to try to keep that lawyer from testifying at trial. So, he's got to get a lawyer. He's got file motions, and he's got to make sure that his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, does not cooperate with the government, flip and give evidence against him. Those are the priorities.",

That's devastating testimony. The problem here is that Nauta has a loyalty to Trump that is not normal. And whether they can get him to cooperate really depends on whether when he gets a lawyer, because he doesn't have a lawyer either, his lawyer says, look, you're going to go to jail on this thing, you're going to go to jail for five plus years.

As to her, individually, remember, she's the judge who started out with this case and made a ruling that the court of appeals above, reversed resoundingly and really took her to the woodshed as they say for bad legal analysis. So, some say, well you know what, she's been a judge only for two and a half years, better for her to say to the chief judge, I don't want this case, give it to somebody who's more experienced. Others say, this case will allow her the redemption that she lost the credibility of in her first case. As to your final point, I think it is absolutely correct that in some ways, having a Trump-appointed judge in this case gets rid of the argument that the court, if you will, is biased against her. Because we'll hear everybody's a biased against Trump. And if the judge is a Trump judge, that's an argument that doesn't have any legs.",

These are pictures of thefuneral for Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi held just a few hours ago. And a pause from the crowds in Milan as thousands turned out to say goodbye to the controversial billionaire. He died Monday at the age of 86 after battling leukemia. Berlusconi dominated Italian culture and politics for decades. I want to bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman now. Ben, from what I saw, and I saw plenty of it earlier today, a beautiful ceremony for a controversial Italian figure. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Indeed, it was a Catholic funeral for a twice-divorced man who many Italians admired as the embodiment of the Italian dream, so to speak. A man who came from modest middle-class background to become, at one point, the richest man in Italy, the longest-serving prime minister since the end of World War II, but also a man who was dogged by controversy throughout his public life, first as a businessman and entrepreneur and then as a prime minister, as a politician. This was a man who was convicted for tax fraud, for instance, who many Italians saw as something of a national embarrassment because of his bunga bunga parties and whatnot. But today was a day of official national mourning and a state funeral in Milan at the Duomo, the Cathedral of Milan, a very impressive old building. We saw that about 2000 people were inside the Duomo itself. Among the mourners was Sergio Mattarella, the President of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, the Prime Minister, as well as Victor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, and the Amir of Qatar, and the Prime Minister of Iraq. Notably missing among the crowd were people like Tony Blair, the Former British Prime Minister, who at one point vacationed with his wife Sherry in the Sardinian Villa of Silvio Berlusconi. Also missing was George W. Bush who was President while Silvio Berlusconi served his longest time as Prime Minister. Berlusconi was a major supporter of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq so Bush's absence was rather significant. Not all Italians are obviously taking part in this National Day of Mourning. In fact, one university, the Siena University for Foreigners, did not actually lower its Italian flags to half mast because of Berlusconi's controversial and flamboyant past. Julia.",

Just to the point that you're making about fighting for others perhaps and what they've been through is part of the healing process of what you and your family have suffered going on to help others. Do you ever really recover or is that just part of what drives you on to help others around the world?",

You know, we thought the genocide, the Rwandan genocide was the worst thing that could happen to us. And then two years ago, our father was kidnapped, tortured, subjected to a sham trial, and jailed. And so, this also was another crisis. And this is something that we as a family and us as a community and all the Rwandans who were also affected by this experience will have to heal from. And we'll continue on to this journey and we'll continue to share the lessons that we learned as we heal and as we learn. But we are continuing forward.",
