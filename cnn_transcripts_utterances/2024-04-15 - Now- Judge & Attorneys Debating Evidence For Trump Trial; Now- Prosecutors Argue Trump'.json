Donald Trump's hush money cover up trial is now underway, making him the very first president in the history of the United States to face a criminal trial. And right now, the judge and the prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys are debating a number of motions, including scheduling and who will be allowed to testify and what evidence can be presented to the jury. The process for selecting that jury is expected to start in just minutes.CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Paula Reid are both live outside the courthouse in Manhattan. And Kaitlan, you're getting some new details from our teams inside the courtroom about what is unfolding at this exact second.",

Even though technically this hasn't actually started yet because jury selection has not gotten underway, they're still arguing about the other aspects of what is going to be allowed at this case. Key moments that people will obviously remember, the Access Hollywood tape. The judge reiterating that they can't actually play parts of that to the jury, but they will be able to read parts of it.And another effort that the Trump team just tried to make, or that the prosecutors just tried to make, is to introduce evidence of these other allegations against Donald Trump that came out following the Access Hollywood tape and his subsequent denials that we saw on the campaign trail in 2016 in those crucial few days before the actual election got underway. I've got CNN's Paula Reid here with me. And Paula, as we are looking at this, what they're arguing about is they want to be able to play Trump denying this and kind of just get at that. It seems the overall chaos of what was happening after this Access Hollywood tape came out.",

      "sentences": "That's right. The judge just determined that he will not allow them to bring in allegations from three women who came out after the Access Hollywood tape and accused Trump of sexual assault. The judge said those claims are very prejudicial. And at this point, they're just a rumor, meaning they haven't gone to a court of law and been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.None of these are huge rulings in the grand scheme of this. These are all motions that you really have to handle before you go forward to trial. But what they all speak to is what was happening ahead of the election. And remember, the larger theory of this case is that Trump paid this money through Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels to suppress news of their affair in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape to help his chances in the November election. So when we're talking about the access Hollywood tape or we're talking about these allegations of sexual misconduct, the reason prosecutors want to bring that in is because it helps to bolster their case that this was all done in an effort to help Trump in 2016.",

Now prosecutors are talking about the evidence they want to bring in related to the pressure that Cohen was facing not to flip on Trump.Now, our colleagues inside the court, they report that Trump leaned forward to look very closely at his screen as prosecutors read tweets about Cohen from 2018, which the prosecutors say showed Trump telegraphing to Cohen that he needed to stay on message and not cooperate. Now they're going back and forth about this evidence. And our colleagues say that while this is happening, Trump passed a note to his attorney, Todd Blanche, who looked at it, nodded several times. He's now tapping Blanche on the shoulder and they're whispering. So Michael Cohen, this issue, of course, he, again, is at the center of this hush money scheme, he is going to be something that is clearly going to get a reaction out of Trump. This was one of his most loyal advisors and attorneys who has flipped on him and caused him a lot of legal problems. And he will be one of the key witnesses here. A problematic witness, but a witness nonetheless.",

He likes to have a lot of a say, an actual strategy on what's happening inside that courtroom.And so one fascinating thing to watch will be how his dynamic with Todd Blanche plays out, because it's not guaranteed how it will go. He's very happy with him right now. But what does it look like as they're actually arguing this?

It helps the jury decide that whether or not someone is guilty, but the judge has to weigh whether or not it's overly prejudicial. So, for example, one of the things that the judge or that the prosecution wanted to bring in is at the time, they want to take the jury back to 2016 to feel what Donald Trump and his campaign was feeling at the time that they did these catch and kill stories and all that was going on in the background. And so the Access Hollywood tape is part of it. And then there was these accusations of sexual assault that also happened.And it goes towards why Donald Trump wanted this story suppressed so badly. And that's what they're asking for. But the judge ruled regarding the other sexual assault. I'm not going to allow Trump to be prejudiced by rumor. And so that's the judge doing his job, right? He's saying that's overly prejudicial. That crosses the line. And so every time that Donald Trump says that this judge is biased and he hates me and he's not ruling, this judge is going to show you over and over and over again that he's the judge. He is always going to follow the law and call balls and strikes as he sees them. I've been before this judge many times. That's his reputation. That's what he does. He's not overly chatty or friendly with the parties. He keeps a distance, an appropriate distance, because he views himself as the neutral arbiter who doesn't take any side. And so all these accusations that Donald Trump has made against him really is belied by all the experience of people who've been before this judge. This is not that judge.
