Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Democracy is putting up a strong fight in Venezuela, but its sitting strongman, Nicolas Maduro, is cracking down hard. A brutal operation called Knock-Knock has rounded up as many as 2,000 politicians, journalists and activists, and more than 20 have been killed, according to the opposition just weeks after he declared himself the victor of an election that's widely believed to have been stolen. Venezuelans are still protesting against Maduro's reign, and, this Saturday, they're calling for a mass global demonstration of international solidarity. The key figure of this movement is Maria Corina Machado. She was prevented from running for president, but she backed a compromise candidate who rallied voters and was declared the winner by many election observers. The story of how a mobilized force of democracy workers managed to collect evidence that her party had won far more votes than Maduro is extraordinary. I have been speaking to Machado from Venezuela. And, for safety reasons, we are not able to say exactly where. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And we managed to come together around common values, the family, our dignity, our freedom, justice, the fact that we want our kids back home, as I said before. This is -- I would say this is the center desire that unites Venezuelans together today. So, the regime lost total touch with reality and they lost their social base. And we came over with the movement, with no resources, totally censored, persecuted. Our top campaign managers are either in prison or taking asylum in an embassy. And we were able to get this epic journey take place. And, that day, millions of Venezuelans, on July 28, came out courageously, and over a million of them had specific tasks to defend the vote.

It's over 30,000. And we trained them. We worked with all political parties, civil society, volunteers. Everybody was volunteered. And we managed to have people in every single one of them, not only inside as what they call polling monitors or witnesses, but actually to have groups of citizens, volunteers around the center protecting them, bringing them food or water or coffee. And it was an incredible journey. We started monitoring the process in the morning. We realized that there were threats to take our monitors out. So, we had the communities push for them to get back in. And so they did. And, at the end of the day, at 6:00, when the stations start to close, we started receiving information through an application, an app, an app that read the Q.R. codes, the tally sheets that were printed had. So we had the right by law to get a copy, that is, an original copy, an original document, from every single electoral machine. And so we did. Many of our volunteers were persecuted, but we had the support and cooperation of members of the armed forces that were protecting these -- the electoral process. So we were able to gather them to take them to safe places around the country. They were scanned, digitalized, and put into a Web page. This is the first time this has ever happened in Venezuela.

We now have the legitimacy because we won, and the world recognizes that we have won. So, Maduro, I think, right now is not reading correctly his own options.

I mean, it's obvious they're not going to present tally sheets because they prove what we have right now and that what have been scrutinized, I have to say, by scholars, academics, the different institutions, the Carter Center, which made a very clear statement regarding that Maduro's called -- so-called results aren't true. So I think the international community has to increase that pressure, has to increase the cost of repression, Christiane, because what it's going right now is horror. It is horror. We're seeing as young people are took out of their houses. Houses are marked with a cross at their doors. Journalists have been detained. Four of them have been accused of terrorism. This is happening as we speak. But we're not going to stop.

We expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. There is no further time to lose. All parties must live up to their responsibilities. Now, these leaders also-called for unfettered distribution of aid and demanded Iran stand down it's military threats against Israel. But on the eve of this round of talks, Israel public criticism and evidence are directed against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

But the question is, as far as the regional tensions, will we even get to these talks on Thursday? We have been watching over the last few days, as there are growing indications that Iranian retaliation, which has been threatened for nearly two weeks now, in the wake of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, while he was visiting the Iranian capital, we've watched as the U.S. and Israeli assessments indicate that retaliation could come now in the coming days. And should it come before those talks actually materialize on Thursday, depending on the scenarios, depending on exactly what that retaliation is, depending on the scope and scale of it, whether it actually kills any Israeli civilians or soldiers as a result of it, it could determine whether or not those talks actually happen on Thursday. Because if there are civilian casualties in particular, make no mistake that will spiral this region further down the path of escalation, perhaps into all-out war.

Now, that being said, there is a sense that there may be a shift on the horizon. Over the weekend, Netanyahu's allies were signaling to other Israeli government officials as well as to journalists that Netanyahu was finally ready for a deal, and that he will move for a deal regardless of the consequences that it brings to bear on his right-wing governing coalition. But ultimately, this is a question of political will. Does Netanyahu want a deal? Will he move forward with one? And the same question, of course, can be asked of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader, who has now been elevated as the head of Hamas' political bureau as well. Both of these men now hold the cards. It is clear that there are differences, but it is also clear that they are far closer than they have ever been in terms of the proposals on the table.

But people like Thomas Friedman, other friends of Israel are saying that if it is Iran that's the threat, why doesn't Netanyahu actually agree, like all the allies have urged him, including the Arab allies who he wants to, you know, make friends with, to make progress on a two-state solution.

Microsoft was, do the antitrust laws apply to the technology industry? The PC computer industry? And the answer to that question was unequivocally yes. Same kinds of questions came up in U.S. v. Google, do the antitrust laws and can they apply in a world of the internet, a world where products and services are given to consumers for free in exchange for advertising?

And so, this is a really important part of why we have antitrust laws in the first place. And you're absolutely right. US v. Microsoft did not focus on higher prices. It focused on harm to the competitive process because that impeded innovation, it impeded market forces from delivering benefits and results to the broader economy. It's exactly what we had here in the U.S. v. Google. The one exception, though, is we do have a very important part of the U.S. v. Google case that focuses on price, it's advertising. And so, one of the key markets had issue in U.S. v. Google was text-based advertising, which you get people buy on search. And these are not just high-priced advertisers. Virtually, every company, whether it's a virtual storefront or the corner store in your local area buy search ads, and they buy them in large volumes. And when the price of ads go up, the prices of the products being advertised go up. So, this is an issue that not just affects the internet highway, it affects our main streets as well.",

Generally speaking, outside of this case, there are -- there's a rich body of law that explains what we should think about in the context of remedies, and U.S. v. Microsoft is a good example, where, in that case, the court both at the district court level and at an appeals level said that remedies should be forward-looking in nature in the context of an antitrust case involving technology. And so, making sure that the remedies are meaningful, making sure that the remedies reflect the violation, which, in this case, is monopolization and deals with the monopoly, and making sure that remedies reflect the market as it exists today on as it will exist in the foreseeable future are important principles to keep in mind in any case.",

The antitrust laws have maintained these principles. In fact, we blocked a transaction involving book publishers on the basis that authors would be deprived of competition for advances for professional original works of authorship. And so, these are really important principles. Antitrust ultimately focuses on competition. There have been a number of red herrings that put in place about price. Let me be very clear about this. Price matters. Antitrust cares a lot about the welfare of consumers. It cares a lot about making sure that competition can deliver the best lowest prices to consumers.
