We begin in Israel where the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now pushing back against a Gaza ceasefire proposal announced late Friday by President Biden. Now saying it is, quote, not true that Israel agreed to such a ceasefire. An Israeli government spokesman said, president -- it's presented only a partial outline of the deal that Israel offered Hamas. This as we are learning that the IDF has informed the families of four hostages held in Gaza that those hostages sadly, are no longer alive. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been covering this all from Jerusalem. Jeremy, I do want to get to the status of the negotiations and this ceasefire deal, but let's begin with what were learning about these high hostages. And what I imagined were quite sad conversations with their families.",

They have watched as in the case of three of them, these three elderly men in December, Hamas released a video of them which showed them in not great condition, and conditions that left their families worried for the health and the well-being of their loved ones.And today, the Israeli military delivering the absolute worst news that these families could get, informing them that their four loved ones are dead and their bodies still being held hostage by Hamas. I want to read the names of those four individuals. You have Haim Peri, a 79-year-old father and grandfather, Yoram Metzger, 80 years old, whose wife had also been taken hostage and was released during the last deal. Amiram Cooper, 84-years-old, his wife had also been released during the last year deal, and then you have Nadav Popplewell, a 51-year-old British Israeli citizen. Now, the Israeli military said that their loved ones, that these individuals I should say, were killed at, quote, a few months ago during their captivity in Gaza. The Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman saying that the Israeli military assessed that they were, quote, killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during an operation there against Hamas. That doesn't explicitly say that it was an Israeli military operation that resulted in their deaths, but we should say, we should note that Nadav Popplewell, the 51-year-old, last month Hamas, said that he had been seriously wounded in an Israeli airstrike and that key had subsequently died of his injuries due to a lack of medical care -- Jim.",

Jeremy Diamond, thanks so much.Well, Ukraine claims it has successfully now hit a missile system inside Russia using weapons supplied by the West, strike comes just days after U.S. President Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using U.S. weapons, limited strikes inside Russian territory, specifically around the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Several other European nations have also allowed Ukraine to use their weapons on targets inside Russia. A Ukrainian government minister posted this photo of a burning Russian S300 surface-to-air missile system. It is unclear if the weapons used in this attack were specifically from the U.S. as opposed to other Western allies. Now to Wilmington, Delaware, where jury selection is moving quite quickly in the federal trial on gun charges of the president's son, Hunter Biden, on track to potentially seat a full jury by the end of today. It is. We should note the first time in U.S. history that the child of a sitting president is on trial, that the three federal charges brought by the president's own Justice Department under a special counsel. Hunter is accused of illegally purchasing a gun in 2018, while addicted to drugs, which is a federal crime. Hunter has been open about his struggles with addiction. He is pleading not guilty to the charges. At his side today, First Lady Jill Biden who is in the courtroom. The president is in Wilmington and released a statement of support for his son. He is not though present at the court today. CNN's Katelyn Polantz, she's been covering it all. Katelyn, of course, the Bidens have deep roots in Wilmington, a national name. He's the president but they are moving quite quickly to seating a jury, which we should note as in Trump's trial, both the defense and prosecution have a number of objections, unexplained objections to those jury members.",

We don't have a jury yet, or at least we don't have word that we have a jury yet from inside that federal courthouse, but we're quite close to having enough people qualified to serve as potential jurors.The three things the judge was asking a lot about was jurors feelings on gun control on addiction and on politics, of course. And if jurors indicated that they weren't able to be impartial than they were removed from the pool. There was one man who believed that prosecutors in the Trump case were charging based on politics, that was enough to have that man tossed out of the pool. But there were others today that were questioned a lot about their feelings regarding addiction and family members that they might have had who had substance abuse issues that got emotional at times, but many of those people remained in the jury pool. Addiction is going to be a major emphasis of what has happened, what will happen here in the coming days as prosecutors highlight Hunter Biden and his addiction. And that's even what Joe Biden, the presidents spoke about in a statement earlier today, not about the case, but what he said instead was: Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today. As the president, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases. But as a dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength -- Jim.",

The question would be is whether Hunter Biden would be the person to testify to tell this jury what was on his mind when he actually filled out this form, because remember that Hunter Biden had just been released from a dependency center. So, he may have internally believed that he was no longer addicted, that he was no longer taking narcotics.But the question would be when you look at the other evidence that the prosecution has, do they have text messages within a day or so of this form being filled out that they can be able to contradict his testimony or other evidence with. It just goes to show you how difficult it is when we're dealing with narcotics and with drug abuse, how it really affects so many lives and so many different people and so many different ways and how you just cant really just grasp the effect of it.",

So, you know, his mom is there. That's going to have an effect on jurors. Jurors see every little thing that happens in the courtroom.And like we were saying, you know, they have to prove that he knowingly and intentionally lied on that form, even if they prove he was an addict, they still have to prove that he knowingly lied, which is very, very difficult to prove if -- these are not the kinds of cases you typically see. It's very rare to charge something on with lying by being a former addict. That is a very rare charge, Bernarda.",

Of course on the other side, the right says, well, this is a sweetheart deal or was a sweetheart deal and he would have faced, you know, stiffer penalties or maybe swifter justice if he were not the president's son.What does the record show? The legal records show for a case like this? Is it unusually aggressive or unusually timid, this prosecution? VILLALONA: Jim, as a former prosecutor, and I was are prosecuted for prosecuted for 16 years, three years in Philadelphia, which has the highest amount of drug -- of people that are suffering from drug addiction, and 13 years in a New York. As a former prosecutor, I could tell you that a case like this, I would not have been looking to take this case to trial because in sounds of a prosecutor, the goal is to seek justice and not a mere conviction. And in a case like this was very deserving as a drug program because what causes crime was a drug addiction. So no one benefits out of sending Joe -- Hunter Biden to jail. So the most prolific type of disposition in this case would have been at differed prosecution where he would have been able to get the drug treatment that he needed and guess what? If he would have messed up, then the law would it dealt with him and dealt with them in a sense of whether it needed for him to go to jail or be -- for the monitored or go into inpatient treatment.

This all comes just days after Beijing stage major military exercises around the island, after the inauguration of its new president last month.

But we as Americans so the United States have been in a relationship with Taiwan since 1979, defined by the Taiwan Relations Act. We're actually celebrating its 45th anniversary where were committed to making sure that we have an economic and cultural and vibrant diplomatic relationship with the island of Taiwan and the Taiwanese, and that, that area remains peaceful, not just for the Taiwanese people, but also for the entire region.

This was the first public time he has testified since leaving NIAID at the end of 2022.

Dr. Fauci saying that he the jury is still out on the origins of the virus, also questioned a lot about the vaccine in a vaccine mandates policies made at the beginning of the pandemic.

The polls has shown that he was a little bit surprising, the large margin of victory. In fact, she got more votes that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador gut six years ago.So she's been taking it easy today. We haven't heard from her. She's been receiving a lot of messages from world leaders. So now the expectation from the Mexican sees what kind of president is she going to be? You heard that she's pledging to continue the policies of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the people obviously want to see that continue, otherwise, they wouldn't vote for her. But they also want her -- for her to be her own person. They don't want Andres Manuel behind the scenes being the one pulling any strings they want Claudia Sheinbaum, who to be the one who really leads the country the next six years. Lopez Obrador this morning, he said that he's not going to interfere. He might talk about a position, make some suggestions to continue the projects that he started, but he said that he wants Claudia Sheinbaum to be her own person. So now, come October 1st, were going to see she's going to have a chance to show who she really is.",

He pulled back the army and the police forces from going after the cartels and many think that that is a reason Mexico has fallen into this level of violence. So she's going to have to establish some kind of policy to show the people who voted for her and said that that was their number one issue to show that she's really going to do something about violence.And then is a relationship with the United States. Even though there's no public friction between the two nations, people in Washington have said, according to analysts, people I've talked to in law enforcement that they have not received the cooperation that they've had in past years with the Mexican police especially in violence in dealing with drug cartels, that drug trafficking. So this is going to be a challenge for the U.S. if Claudia Sheinbaum continues that policy of Manuel Lopez Obrador, they might not see the results they want. The first challenge might be tomorrow or this week whenever the White House announces this new plan on immigration we're hearing they're prepared to announce, and how Sheinbaum is going to take it. Obviously, Lopez Obrador is the one dealing with it, at least until October, right before the U.S. election. And then she's going to have something to say about it.",

Well, north of the border, U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce as Gustavo saying there, a long-awaited executive order addressing immigration and border security. The executive action would allow authorities to quickly deport migrants who enter the U.S. illegally without processing their asylum claims once crossings exceed 2,500 people per day. Immigration, of course, a major election issue heading into November's election. Polls show a majority of Americans do not approve of Biden's current handling of the issue. CNN's MJ Lee joins me now from the White House. So, MJ, I wondered, this is expected for the president to sign this is as early as tomorrow. What more do we know about the order? And is the administration expecting legal challenges here? I mean, do they even expect this order to be implemented because of those challenges?",

Meanwhile, here in New Delhi, the authorities have had to ration delivery of water to neighborhoods, and CNN, we visited a hospital and heat stroke treatment center and their doctors warned us about how dangerous it can be once a patient succumbs to heat stroke. DR. AJAY SHUKLA, RAM MANOHAR LOHIYA HOSPITAL: Mortality rate of heat stroke is very, very high. Here is close to 60 to 80 percent.
