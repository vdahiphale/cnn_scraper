We can talk about it. It is the issue it's an issue that's been plaguing our country for 30 years because leaders have not -- on both sides of the party, quite honestly -- have yet to find a common ground.

Look at where we are now in September of 2024.Republicans have closed that gap significantly. That lead that Democrats have, it's still an advantage, but it's down by -- down to only 200,000 voters, 3.5 million to 3.3 million. Republicans have closed that gap by 400,000 voters. So the bottom line is the electorate that Joe Biden won with four years ago is not the same electorate that Kamala Harris is going to have to win with in November if she wants to win in Pennsylvania. It's a significantly more Republican electorate, Anderson.",

It's Donald Trump with 281 electoral votes. The bottom line is Kamala Harris was in Pennsylvania today. She'll be going back over and over and over again, and she'll be joined by Donald Trump because the bottom line is whoever wins Pennsylvania is most likely going to win the presidency.",

And I've been consistently saying that the Vice President is going to win in Pennsylvania and ultimately become our next president. But I've been saying the same thing since 2016, that this is going to be incredibly close and it's going to come down in many sense, like a coin toss at this point. And the polls and some of the other different kinds of factors, it's going to be very close. And that's what I've been consistently saying. And I feel really good about it.

At least two Hall of Fame players and a current head coach have suggested the star quarterback, the Miami Dolphins, should consider retiring after his third diagnosed concussion.Tua Tagovailoa struggled to get up after this collision with a Buffalo defender late in the game last night. And this is not the first time this has happened. During the 2022 season, he was brutally thrown down, his head hit the ground. That game, he was carried off the field in a stretcher. It was his first of two diagnosed concussions in just that season. It came about four days after a controversial decision to let him continue to play after he was seen stumbling and shaking his head following a hit. Now, the NFL and the Players Association updated its concussion protocol because of that incident. Incidentally, the Bills defender involved in last night's hit was safety Damar Hamlin. You may remember that name. He collapsed last year during nationally televised Monday night game after taking a shot to the chest during a tackle. CPR was performed on the field after he lost his pulse. He needed resuscitation and defibrillation and later a ventilator. Early this morning, he wrote on X, \"My love and prayers with Tau fasho,\" slang for sure. \"Sending you strength and healing for a speedy recovery. Much love broski.\" Our Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us. So what is your reaction when you see this hit, Sanjay? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's brutal. I mean, it's just, I think for anybody, it looks brutal. I think for a neurosurgeon like myself, it's particularly horrifying. If we can show that again, you showed some of this already. And I just want to point out a couple of things when you actually see what happens to Tau. So this is just normal speed, what people saw, but this is slowing it down. Now watch as he lowers his shoulder and the amount of force, you can actually see his head and his cervical spine, on top of his spine actually sort of be pushed back as a result of that. And then after that, there's a significant rotation as well to his neck, and then he falls to the ground. We subsequently learned that he was on the ground for a couple of minutes. But look what happens with his right hand over here, Anderson, that's called a fencing position. It's a fencing position like that. And that's something that's involuntary. It's a reflex that occurs and it's happening because of this injury to the area between the brain and the spinal cord, an area known as the brain stem. So let me just show you here quickly. This is the brain. We saw that significant force on the top of the head here and then the rotation. These pathways between the brain and the spinal cord down here have to run through the brain stem and those areas are disrupted. So this is a significant traumatic brain injury. It's a traumatic brain injury. That's what it is. That's what you have to call it. And as you pointed out when you're talking about this, there are different criteria that are the sort of sort of no-go criteria. I mean, someone is absolutely not returning to the field. As a result of what's happened Tua in the past, they actually revise some of that criteria. So in addition to loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia and seizure, there's also the fencing position. And something known as ataxia, which is basically stumbling, unable to get your balance. So he, you know, he met a lot of criteria for that and it was really scary to watch, Anderson.",

You have to sort of work through all the stages that you're looking there on the screen before you can actually return to play. There's no definitive timeline.
