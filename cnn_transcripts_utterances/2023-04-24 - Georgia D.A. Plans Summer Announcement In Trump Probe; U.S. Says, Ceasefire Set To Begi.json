Now, we know what she means. In this letter that she wrote to the Fulton County sheriff and to local law enforcement there in Atlanta, she's warning essentially that her timeline is looking somewhere between July 11th and September 1st. That is when this grand jury will be seated and will be hearing perhaps evidence to, again, with a decision on whether to bring charges against the former president and his allies for their role in trying to overturn the Georgia election in the 2020 presidential election.I'll read you just a part of the letter that she sent to the Fulton County sheriff. She says, in the near future, I will announce charging decisions resulting from the investigations my office has been conducted into possible criminal interference in the administration of Georgia's 2020 general election. I am providing this letter to bring your attention the need for heightened security and preparedness in the coming months due to this pending announcement. Wolf, again, a clear indication that a decision is imminent, possibly against a former -- charges possibly against a former president as well as some of his allies who were involved. Of course, to remind people of what this is all about, we'll take you back to the days after the 2020 election and the former president's effort to try to pressure people in Georgia to produce votes that he did not get. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (voice over): So, look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What she has done in the letter is put local law enforcement, sheriffs and others on high alert. She tells them, I'm going to need you to be ready to respond to potential demonstrations and maybe worse starting on July 11th.

That is a possibility.I think what Elie just described is a probability that that is more of her calculation. But I think just from where I sit on the politics of it, this is what we have been looking at. It is one thing for the Republicans to defend Donald Trump in what we saw in New York, having to do with his business affairs, having to do with an alleged affair and trying to give hush money to an ex-porn star. It is a whole different thing in this case. [18:05:00] Because this is the fundamental question, the first time we are going to see the fundamental question go through the courts of his actions with regard to trying to overturn the 2020 election.

That investigation seems to have certainly taken on a new timeline, a much faster timeline as far as the federal -- the Justice Department investigations are concerned.Of course, there is a second one also into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That one appears to be a little bit more in the offing. But, certainly, the idea that now we have, from this letter that Fani Willis has sent to local law enforcement, at least a timeline, it really does tell you that the former president's legal troubles are front and center as he launches his campaign. Wolf, this is an unusual letter simply because, obviously, the district attorney would normally have a meeting with local law enforcement and perhaps try to get them prepared for something like this. For them to publish a letter -- I'm sorry, send a letter to the sheriff with the seeming expectation that it is going to become public, it really -- you could see what you see here is the district attorney is trying to prepare the public, perhaps, for her coming decision.",

The tape that we just heard of Donald Trump calling Brad Raffensperger, that call actually happened the very next day and then became public within hours of that. And yet here we are, now we're now looking at an indictment, if this timeline holds, at the earliest two-and-a-half-plus years after the effect. I know investigations take time. This should not have taken two-and-a-half-plus years.And now as a result of that, Wolf, Donald Trump supporters are going to say, first of all, we didn't see an indictment for two and a half years until after Donald Trump, A, announced candidacy and, B, is emerging as a frontrunner. And second of all, if you look at this realistically, they're not going to get to a trial until the middle of 2024 at the earliest if we see a charge this summer. There is going to be discovery, appeals, motions and is a state judge really going to hold a trial of a potential Republican frontrunner or nominee that close to an election?

But, I mean, for quite some time he was given such a long leash from Fox News executives, whether it was spreading pro-Putin propaganda or spreading lies about the January 6th events. So, I'm not sure yet what to make of it.There are some reporting out there that suggests that this may be that there is further, you know, information that's come out in these series of lawsuits that paints him in a damaging light. I'm not sure that I expect to see Fox to go editorially and majorly different way but what I will say is this is sending shockwaves through the Republican Party. I cannot think of a more prominent media figure in the conservative movement in my lifetime than Tucker Carlson. This is someone who every presidential candidate on the GOP side was trying to cozy up to. They were giving answers on policy decisions to. He speaks to members on Capitol Hill. He was really seen as untouchable. So, to see him go is truly stunning.",

His former booker, she's been now let go by Fox News, but she has a lawsuit and pending against the network where she accuses Tucker Carlson of running a show basically behind the scenes that is full of sexism and anti-Semitism, a number of things that are potentially troublesome for Fox News legally. And so there is a lot potential reasons why the network could have decided to let him go. It is possible, too, that a lot of this is just a number of things that just played into this decision, like he was just causing too much trouble on a number of different fronts and they just thought he had too much baggage. But it is stunning, as Alyssa said, given his prominence in the Republican Party, this is someone that lawmakers, Republican lawmakers, senators, they grovel to his feet. They were afraid of him lashing out on his prime time perch over at Fox News. So, to see him go is just really stunning.",

The other thing that was really true and apparent in his statements and also Vice President Harris' was that we have to continue to fight to preserve our democracy.

It is not really about being a Republican or a Democrat. It is about whether or not we're going to protect kids over guns. And that issue stretches across our country but also across party lines and that is what is so important in this moment, in this movement for justice for us to realize that we have to and we can act now to do something different than the status quo.

      "sentences": "You know, Wolf, the launch has long been a very closely held secret by the president's closest advisers. But with that has come an era of inevitability that it is eventually coming, and now it appears to likely come tomorrow. Clear efforts underway over the course of the last days by the president's close advisers and outside allies to lay the groundwork for a video announcement tomorrow morning on the four-year anniversary of the moment he announced his 2020 campaign.Now, during that campaign, he defeated incumbent President Donald Trump, now currently the frontrunner for the Republican side as well. And that underscores some of the realities you laid out of the challenges the current president will have to face in a reelection campaign. If you look at recent polling, it makes very clear Americans aren't exactly enthused about a rematch. Americans aren't exactly enthused about an 80-year-old president running for re-election again. In fact, the NBC news poll that came out this weekend, only 26 percent of Americans say they want to see president Biden run for re-election. For president Trump, it's 35 percent. However, in those numbers, there is a clear opportunity Biden advisers see to gain ground very quickly, in part, because of the legislative agenda that the president has been able to pass and their ability to sell that in the months and -- 19 months or so ahead before election day. Most importantly though, the contrast between President Biden and whoever his Republican challenger is, especially, when you talk to advisers, if it's the former President Donald Trump, will be very clear-cut and something the president will focus on intensively over the course of the coming months. Now, while it has been a closely held secret, the fact that some of the personnel decisions appear to be coming out of this moment underscores just how rapidly things are starting to move. Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who's a senior adviser to the president likely to be the campaign manager. Other senior aides with close connections, the Senate Democrats who won tough re-election battles in 2022, they are likely to be slotted in as senior staffers as well. As you know quite well though, Wolf, his core group of close advisers from the White House will continue to drive things. What we don't know is if it's a certainty. What we do know is that an announcement will be made, when he was asked about this, it will be coming, quote, really soon.",
