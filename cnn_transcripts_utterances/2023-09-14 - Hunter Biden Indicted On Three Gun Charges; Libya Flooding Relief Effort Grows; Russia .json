And, of course, we're talking about a country that depends on Russian oil and a patronage that has increased since the war in Ukraine. And Cuban authorities parroting Russian propaganda about how the war started. They seemed to break with Russia last week without ever directly pointing the finger at them and saying, it's against our laws to have Cubans fight in conflicts overseas, to be mercenaries, to be going to a battlefield strictly for the pay on their own. And in fact, we've arrested some of the recruiters and soldiers who are trying to do that. And now they are backtracking. There's no other way to say it. And by saying there's a legal contract, somehow it's different. There are perhaps hundreds of Cubans in this situation right now, where they are on the battlefield. Some say they did not realize that they were enlisting to go fight. They thought they would be working as cooks or repairing infrastructure damage by the war. And earlier this week I had the opportunity to sit down with the mother of one of these very young men, who says her son is trapped in Ukraine, fighting for Russia. And he's seen the horrors of that war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OPPMANN (voice-over): \"He said, 'Mama, I'm on the front line in Ukraine.' \"He's there where it's dangerous,\" she says. \"They are there to shield the Russian troops, they are cannon fodder. He has seen what you see in a war,\" she says. \"He said he has seen the wounded. At the hospital, people arrived missing arms and legs. He isn't used to seeing that.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's really not clear. It's only for some of the people that say that they have been tricked into fighting for Russia. What happens to them? They are really ending up as people without a country because they have been told, if they come back here, they will be charged as being mercenaries. And that's what happened, we understand, as several Cubans were attempting to leave to go fight for Russia. Certainly they have no interest in staying and continuing to serve in the Russian military. And if there's now \"a legal way,\" quote-unquote, for Cubans to go and serve in the Russian army, fighting against Ukraine, that will certainly be an escalation.

Well, have human actions made Earth unsafe for people? A new study says, yes, they have. A group of 29 scientists from around the world describe Earth as moving outside a safe operating space for humanity. The group looked at climate change, biodiversity, fresh water as well as land use.

So there's just a certain mixture that makes Earth the most only livable place that we know about there. And so these group of scientists, this is 29 folks from about eight countries, they tried to set sort of parameters. This is going back a few years to measure how far we're slipping away from a livable planet. And the biggest -- this is a kind of a hard graph to read. But the circle in the center is the safe spot. And each of these sort of slices of pie radiating out from the middle are deeper into the danger zones. The biggest one there, at about 11:00 on the clock position, is the genetic biodiversity, that's a result of, out of 81 million known species, a million are in danger of going extinct. So we really overshot living within the balance of the healthy planet there. Some of the other bigger ones are novel entities, that's nuclear fission for example or genetic modifications to change the Earth systems. That's way out of bounds. Climate change at the top is out of bounds. There are some good ones; there is one here that was in the danger zone. That is ozone depletion. But humanity has fixed that. It's gone in the right direction. So that's the one sort of ray of hope that we can find in this but when it comes to how we use forests or mangroves or interact with the air and water around us, humanity is pushing our spaceship to the brink, into the red.",
