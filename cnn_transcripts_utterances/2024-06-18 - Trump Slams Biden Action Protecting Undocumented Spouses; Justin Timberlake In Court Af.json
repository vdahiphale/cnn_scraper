      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Today, President Biden is set to take executive action to protect about half a million undocumented immigrants from being deported. This sweeping immigration policy will allow certain undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to apply for permanent residency without having to leave the country. It's one of the federal government's biggest relief initiatives since DACA. That's the program that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation and lets them work in the U.S. CNN's Arlette Saenz is live at the White House for us. Arlette, what more can you tell us about this executive action by the President? We're expecting an announcement this afternoon.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. This really marks a sweeping plan offering relief to undocumented immigrants in this country as President Biden is trying to tackle one of the thorniest political issues border security and immigration that has really vexed this country for decades.Now, this plan would essentially allow certain undocumented spouses married to U.S. citizens to and their children to remain in the country as they apply for permanent residence. That's a change of the current policy, which requires that they leave the country to do so really raising questions about whether they would be apprehended upon their return. They will now be able to stay here without fear of deportation. Now, this would apply to undocumented individuals who have been living in the U.S. for 10 years and married to a U.S. citizen as of yesterday, they would be allowed to work permanently or illegally here in the U.S. And it's estimated this could impact about 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens and then 50,000 children. Now this comes just a few weeks after President Biden announced that major crackdown at the U.S. southern border, shutting off the ability of migrants crossing illegally to seek asylum when a certain threshold is met. That is something that polling has shown. A majority of Americans have agreed with. You take a look at a poll released a bit earlier this month, it was 70 percent approve of that action, 30 percent did not. But the move really frustrated a lot of immigration advocates and progressives in the President's party. So part of what Biden's trying to do here is appeal to some of those groups, deal with some of their concerns. And also it's a move that could appeal to Latino voters in key states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.",

And of course, former President Donald Trump has been offering a much more draconian vision for his immigration policy promising mass deportations and detention camps for undocumented migrants blasting those who cross the border illegally as, quote, poisoning the blood of this country.Let's discuss with CNN political commentators, Maria Cardona and Scott Jennings. Maria, you're with me here in the studio. Let me go to you first. You were telling me you might be over there at the White House later today for this announcement? What do you think? Obviously this is going to be welcomed by progressives, Latinos in this country, because just recently, the President announced a pretty tough policy, cracking down on asylum at the border.

I mean, if you're worried about reliving the past, why didn't Joe Biden do this on his first day in office, as opposed to doing it today here in the shadow of a presidential campaign?I mean, the reality is, he's governing by political panic. If this is such a great idea, why didn't he do this on day one? Why didn't he do last week's executive order on day one? Why did he cancel all of Trump's immigration orders? I agree with Maria people are tired of chaos. And they believe the chaos has been caused by Joe Biden in the way he's handled this for the last three and a half years. The polling is clear. By the way politically, I don't think the American people are in a pro amnesty mood right now. You look at what Trump is proposing. There's a lot of polling that shows majority support for what Trump is saying, including among Hispanics in the United States of America.",

But then guess what, congressional Republicans slam the door on any opportunity that would expand any legal pathways. And what we know from what happened under four years of President Trump and this is something that Republicans lie over and over about is that he eviscerated all of the legal pathways, including our asylum system, and he did nothing to eradicate illegal immigration. His numbers on illegal crossings went up his last year in office. So when President Trump was in office, he did nothing to fix this, he made it worse. And now, it's actually kind of rich, because what this also does, Scott and Jim, this keeps American families together, when Republicans scream that kids need a father and a mother. Well, guess what, then join us because this is exactly what this executive action is doing. And again, the vast majority of Americans and I will send you the polling on this, Scott, from pollsters who know how to poll on this, absolutely agree with this. It is upwards of three-fourths of the American people support a balanced approach of strong border security, which I know you agree with, but also expanding legal pathways, especially for the long settled immigrants that have been here who have contributed more than $7 trillion to our economy.",
