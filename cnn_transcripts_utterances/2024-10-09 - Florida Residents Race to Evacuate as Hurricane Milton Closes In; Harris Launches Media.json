This is one of the giant piles that we've seen in Pinellas County. This thing is about 20 to 25 feet high, a couple hundred feet long, and it is full of just random stuff. There's a bag of golf clubs. There's a ton of pieces of wood just like this. Imagine this thing coming toward you at 120 miles an hour. On top of that, you've got space heaters, you've got all kinds of scrap metal. The other issue with this barrier island, like so many others, on the other side of the ocean, there's a bay. So you're talking about a 10 to 15-foot storm surge coming in here with a foot of rain, more or less, estimated to be on top of that. Where is this stuff going to go? So when speaking to neighbors that live in the community that have debris lined up outside of their homes, and by the way, we've been seeing this block to block to block across Treasure Island, that's one of their chief concerns. I spoke to a couple of different residents today, one of them a gentleman named Matt who lives in a condo. He lives on the first floor of a condo, and he road out, Helene here, he said the water got up to his chest, and he panicked and he got out. He was fortunate to get out. This time he wasn't taking any chances. He saw all this stuff and thought that this would essentially turn into projectiles headed his way. There was another lady who lived in a building next to his. She had some mobility issues. She was contemplating trying to ride out the storm. Fortunately, earlier this afternoon, I saw her family come and asked them, and she decided that it was the right decision to leave. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He was supposed to meet with his counterpart Lloyd Austin on Wednesday but the Israeli Prime Minister has postponed that trip. We believe from this Israeli official that Netanyahu wants to speak with Biden first. There will obviously be a lot to speak about. They haven't spoken we understand from U.S. officials since August which is quite remarkable given the fact that the U.S. is the biggest ally and supporter of Israel when it comes to the number of fronts that they are fighting on. Now clearly one of the issues they will be talking about is what Israel's response to Iran will be after Tehran fired some 200 ballistic missiles they say at Israel. The U.S. helped with shooting some of those down but the U.S. is at pains to make sure that the already really widening conflict does not widen any further. Although U.S. officials have told us he's unlikely to be trying to convince Mr. Netanyahu not to have a significant response as we saw back in April -- Max.",

It does not appear as though Israel is ready for any kind of ceasefire. We've seen an intensification if anything of what they are doing in Lebanon. We heard just yesterday that they were expanding their operations in southwest Lebanon claiming they're still limited but they've added another division to that.Now this is a 21 day ceasefire plan that President Biden had pitched believing that both sides had given the green light to at least discussing it. But Israel was very clear in the fact that this was not what they were looking for at this point. We have heard the Hezbollah number two, well potentially could be number one, Naim Qassem in a speech saying that they supported the speaker Nabih Berri's efforts to try and secure a ceasefire. Hezbollah had tied any kind of ceasefire or ending of hostilities against Israel to a ceasefire in Gaza. That doesn't appear to be the case at least from what he was saying in that speech. But it was also a very defiant speech against Israel and against what the troops are doing in Lebanon. But it does need two sides to be signing up to this ceasefire. We may hear more about Israel's feeling on this after that phone call with the U.S. President -- Max, Christina. MACFARLANE: All right, Paula Hancock there live from Abu Dhabi. Thanks, Paula. Now top U.N. officials are raising concerns that Lebanon could become another Gaza. A spokesperson for the Human Rights Commissioner says civilians are paying the ultimate price with destruction everywhere. A million people displaced and hospitals and schools closed. He also says Israel is using the same means and methods of warfare in both conflicts. And when we come back, social media giant TikTok is being taken to court over allegations its features are designed to hook children.",
