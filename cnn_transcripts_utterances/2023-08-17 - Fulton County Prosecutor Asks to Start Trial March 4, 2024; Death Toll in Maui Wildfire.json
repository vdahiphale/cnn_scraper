And already, there's a significant conflict with the political calendar. Willis has asked a judge to start the trial on March 4th, 2024, just one day before Trump would compete in the Super Tuesday primary contest. Now, that's when more than one dozen states, including California and Texas go to the polls. As you see right there, the former president will also have to prepare for the trial, in the midst of four early state nominating contest in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

Now, of course, earlier this month, we did hear from officials, familiar with this matter in the U.S. There has been some holdup when it came to the training program. They are waiting for exact details to be put forward by E.U. partners, all to be authorized and pull ahead. But, of course, we hear some positive indications.

They are pushing forward with these plans for a training program and they are expecting a group of Ukrainian pilots to be trained on these F-16s in the coming months.
