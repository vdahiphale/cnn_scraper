But in the meanwhile, my lead source, tonight, is the former presidential candidate, and the former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, who I should note is here in his personal capacity, not as the Transportation Secretary.

And I think the most important thing about it was that, if you watched the debate, he really talked about three things. He talked about himself, most of all. He talked about her quite a bit. And he talked about Joe Biden quite a bit. She, as much as possible, was talking about you, about the American voter, about the American people. And that's the most important difference, in this whole campaign, that he is focused on himself, and to some extent, still, even now focused on Joe Biden. And she is focused on the big question the voters are asking, which is, how's my life going to be different under a Kamala Harris presidency, where she's focused on things like affordability, a fairer tax code, protecting a woman's right to choose, versus if he becomes president again, and we are thrown back to the kind of chaos that we experienced with him the first time around.",

I remember, early on, when she came out of the gate so well, people said, Well, yes, she's doing great now. But after the honeymoon week ends, then it won't go so well. And yet, she did. And they said, Well, it's going well for her now, but once she sits down for a big interview, things will change. Sat down for a big interview, went great. Same thing with the debate. But again, she'll be the first to say that this is going to be a roller coaster. Look, eight weeks is, in one sense, it's the blink of an eye. In another sense, it's a political eternity. And every campaign will have good days and bad days, advances and setbacks. And I think she's done a good job of preparing her supporters and her campaign for that. But again, the most important thing is that every day she's talking about the American people, about what she's going to do, to continue to create jobs, what she's going to do to grow small businesses in this country, what she's going to do to help with child care. Something that Donald Trump seems literally, almost physically incapable of talking about. Every time he gets a question about it, you get a strange ramble that raises the question of whether he's ever actually considered child care policy seriously. And she's very sensitive (ph) about it. Wants to expand the Child Tax Credit. Wants to make sure that we have paid parental leave, in this country. So that's going to continue, and I think that's how she's going to win.",

She's reminding people that she's not the caricature that they would portray, as they always do, of any Democrat, that they're going to come take all your guns away. That's just not true. And I think it's especially notable, matter of fact, I think, unprecedented, that so many people from his party are going out there and saying, vote for her. I mean, the idea that you would have a coalition, in this country, that includes people from, people like Bernie Sanders, to people like me, to people like Dick Cheney, all saying, for different reasons, but all saying Donald Trump has no business being president, you got to elect Kamala Harris, is important. But the other thing is, it's not just Republicans, who have worked for George Bush, who are saying you should vote for Kamala Harris. A shockingly large proportion of Republicans, who worked for Donald Trump, people he picked, are turning around and saying -- either not saying anything, withholding their endorsement, which itself is very telling, or saying that you really shouldn't be voting for him.

Which makes me wonder, what country does J.D. Vance think is the most prosperous country in the world, since he doesn't think it's America. And also, does he really think that immigration has nothing to do with American prosperity? Most Americans disagree. By the way, most Americans also disagree with Donald Trump's decision to kill the bipartisan border bill that Kamala Harris has pledged that she would sign, if it came to her. So, rather than have us talking about that, he wants us talking about people allegedly eating cats, which is not happening. And then, the other thing they'll do, of course, is, because this is a country of 300 million people, they'll probably, sooner or later, find some case, where somebody somewhere did something weird (ph) to a cat, and try to make that into a reason to prolong this debate, so that we could be talking about anything but Donald Trump's track record of destroying jobs in this country, and destroying the right to choose, and the fact that, if given the chance to do so again, that's what he would double down on.",

It was what was behind it. And they specifically targeted internal Trump campaign emails and documents, all in an attempt to influence the 2024 election. We are told tonight these charges could come as soon as next week. My source, tonight, is Chris Krebs, who served as the nation's top election security official before he was fired by Donald Trump for saying that the 2020 election was safe and secure. On these charges that we're told they're imminent. First, what do you make of the impact, and are they actually followed by arrests, indictments? I mean, what does this look like? CHRIS KREBS, FORMER SENIOR OFFICIAL, DHS, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE &amp; PUBLIC POLICY OFFICER, SENTINELONE: Well, that tends to be the challenge. Because these hackers, whether they're Iranian, or the Russian hackers we heard about last week, out of the SVR, the Military Intelligence Unit, they stay in safe havens, safe harbors. There is no extradition treaty with Russia or with Iran. So, they tend to be beyond the arm's length of American law enforcement. However, they are constrained to Iran or Russia, and they will not be leaving. Because if they do touch ground in France, for instance, or somewhere else, they will get swooped up. But there are a couple other elements of these indictments. They are very clear messaging and signaling tools. They say, Hey, we know who you are. We are seeing inside your infrastructure. We know how you're operating. And the fact that they can pull together an indictment so quickly? Yes, they may have been starting -- they may have started the investigation, back in June. But the fact they're able to pull together an indictment, potentially for unsealing, next week, shows that law enforcement, and the intelligence community are poised, they're ready to go, and they are taking it very seriously, in what is a very serious election.",

They sent intimidating emails out to voters in several states. They found confidential data. That, again, that was exposed in about 72 hours. We were, I was at the Department of Justice, alongside FBI Director Wray, and the Director of National Intelligence Ratcliffe. And we said, These are Iranians. They are doing this. Americans, take this seriously, but also we are looking out for it. Though -- there were subsequent indictments there. We are seeing an even faster unveiling now. And so that, in my view, is good, that we're deep -- that we're investigating, we're on top of it, and we're declassifying rapidly, to call out bad actors. But also, convey to the American people that we are taking this seriously, we are ready to go, and we're going to protect this election.",
