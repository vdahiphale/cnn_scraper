      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.A call to lower the temperature after an assassination attempt against Former President Donald Trump. Tonight, we focus on all angles. First the Republican reaction just as they opened their national convention. And later, an expert on political violence. Is there really no room for this in America? Plus, today's other bombshell, a judge dismisses the classified documents case against Trump. I'm joined by former acting solicitor general, Neal Katyal. And, the international perspective with Iceland's president-elect. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It is time to lower the temperature in our politics, that is what President Joe Biden told the nation in a primetime address last night, following the attempted assassination of the Former President Donald Trump at an election rally on Saturday. The FBI is still trying to determine the motivation of the shooter, a 20- year-old white man armed with an AR-15 automatic rifle, who was also a registered Republican. Regardless, the attack is a testament to the increasingly fractious, furious, and now fatal state of this race. Trump says that he has completely rewritten his acceptance speech to reflect that at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin. But he's since told \"The New York Post,\" I want to try to unite our country, but I don't know if that's possible. People are very divided. So, joining me now from Milwaukee is Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, welcome to the program. Let me first ask you the traditional question, which is super relevant today, what actually is the mood amongst Republicans after this violence on Saturday? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Christiane, the mood is one of relief. It's also one of excitement. Donald Trump would have been welcomed here to Milwaukee as a hero, but it is something far more than that, given the events of Saturday. Talking to Republican delegates, they, you know, first and foremost, are grateful that he is OK, and they are more committed than ever to his campaign. Of course, here in Wisconsin, the convention was chosen here. Donald Trump chose this for a reason because Wisconsin is a key battleground. This is one of the pieces of the blue wall, if you will, that he won in 2016, he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. So, that is really at the heart of the matter here. So, as the former president makes his way to the convention floor, we're expected to see a bit of him throughout this week, of course, culminating in his marquee speech on Thursday. He's talking of unity. There is no doubt about that. A couple questions. Will that pledge for unity remain after this convention? And will other Republicans also uphold that pledge? And is it what the base wants to hear? This is a time when you sort of throw red meat out to your supporters. So, it's a tricky balance. But, of course, he controls the message, and he is saying that he wants to talk about unity, of course, there's a lot to unpack in all of that.",

Idon't know, I mean, clearly, world leaders, elected leaders have a responsibility for that division. So, it will be interesting to see if he actually throws himself into trying to do what he says he wants to do. But in the meantime, I want to ask you, Jeff, because obviously in many of these conventions they have a platform, it's their manifesto. And we hear that this one is going to be, you know, very, very much trimmed down. And according to reports, that it will really reflect a sort of allegiance to Trump rather than usual policy statements and goals. Is that what you're hearing?",

We're learning more about that phone call that they had just one on one on Sunday morning, that both sides expressed as a good and respectful call. So, I think without question, it provides a moment for the Trump campaign and for Donald Trump. And they're signaling, at least, that he is eager to seize upon this political moment. And does it create an opening for him to do something he's never really done, and that's expanding his base. There's a lot of, you know, anger and dissatisfaction with Joe Biden. So, can Donald Trump, sort of, you know, win people over? One thing I'm Looking at, this is very interesting. The schedule really doesn't usually matter that much, but this case it does. Nikki Haley, she received an invitation just on Sunday. Of course, the former South Carolina governor, the last standing rival to Donald Trump. She was not invited last week, now she is.

But fortunately, he survived. With Trump, I think we had the same bewilderment or same lack of information, but that only lasted 10 or 20 minutes. So, we said, actually, President Trump, thankfully, is in good shape. He was nicked. It was a serious assassination attempt, but his health was really not impaired, and he gave that really impressive fist pump at the end of that before he was escorted off the stage, which sort of did reassure the public that he seemed to be OK.

So, I think his core message was absolutely the right one, and it does help him politically to act presidential. I think your broader comment is also correct, Christiane, which I say is very unfortunate, but it is a sad fact that the United States does have an element of violence to it that we see, and whether it's mental problems or access to firearms or other kind of phenomenon, but, boy, it's an ugly side of America.",

He has combative personality. He's a theatrical personality and he frequently doesn't rise to the moment. So, this is an opportunity for him to show his best side, if you will. The fact that he took the phone call from President Biden, I think was a welcome development that the two of them had were told a civil discourse, the fact that he invited his previous opponents, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, to speak is also assigned to say he respects honest disagreements. So, those are both nice indicators, but the real test will come Thursday to see if he rises to the moment.",

So, to say someone else could have an indiscreet moment or say something or do something that changes the numbers. There could be an international incident that changes the numbers. So, there's still -- it's not going to be a straight-line narrative, if I may use sort of a Hollywood phraseology, something else is going to happen in these final few months. But, boy, Biden -- you're right, Biden kind of perversely got a bit of a break because of this, because it changes the subject.

First,the Supreme Court agrees that his presidential acts makes him mostly immune from prosecution. And now, the judge he appointed, Aileen Cannon, has dismissed the classified documents case against him. Joining me now is Neal Katyal, a law professor at Georgetown University and the former acting U.S. solicitor general to President Barack Obama. Neal Katyal, just give me your first reaction to the judge's dismissal, were you surprised? NEIL KATYAL, FORMER U.S. ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL:  Yes, I was surprised. I think, Christiane, this decision is cuckoo for Cocopuffs, and it's not going to stand be upheld by the Court of Appeals in the United States Supreme Court. It's certainly going to delay things in this case and certainly pass the election because appeals take time. But basically, just to recap our viewers, Donald Trump was accused of taking highly classified and sensitive information without permission, keeping it at his golf club, Mar-a-Lago. And then most importantly, lying about it to federal investigators after he was asked about these documents. And that's what he's indicted for. And one of my jobs at the Justice Department was to serve as national security adviser, where we, of course, indicted cases like this every day of the week, every time they happened. They didn't happen that much, fortunately, because people know who handle classified information just how serious that material is and how it getting out can endanger sources and methods and the like. But that's what he's accused of. And now, the judge comes along and tries to invalidate the prosecutor on a cuckoo theory.",

And I think the most important point about this, Christiane, is eight different judges, over the last many years, have rejected this exact argument. And the special counsel regulations that Jack Smith is appointed under, I should say, by way of disclosure to all of our viewers, I drafted those back in 1999 when I was a young Justice Department staffer in connection with the entire Justice Department. And what we did after we drafted them, I went with Ms. Reno, the attorney general, to the Hill. We briefed the House Senate leadership, both the Republicans and Democrats on a bipartisan basis, we briefed all of their counsel, we briefed the heads of the Senate and House Judiciary Committee, not a single person from either political party said a word about this kind of idea that the special counsel wasn't authorized. And that's so because we've had special counsels for over a century, since the time of President Ulysses Grant.

      "sentences": "I love your question. And sure, the Trump administration did as well and others did, but I think the most important point about the 1990sis, absolutely, there was something called the Independent Counsel Act, which is a kind of supercharged special prosecutor created in 1978 after Watergate and what the experience with Clinton showed to both political parties was that that was too aggressive, and it didn't strike the right balance. And so, Republicans and Democrats together came and said, let's throw out this Independent Counsel Act, even though it was upheld by the Supreme Court in a seven to one decision. But it's not good policy. And indeed, the independent prosecutor, Ken Starr, who was investigating Bill Clinton at the very time, Christiane, he testified in the Hill on these hearings about the special counsel regulations and said that was the way to do it, the special counsel regulations, which were just invalidated today by Judge Cannon, not the Independent Counsel Act. So, even he thought that what he was doing didn't strike the right balance, but that the special counsel regulations did, because -- and this is what we tried to do, we tried to balance all the competing considerations, political and accountable and the need for independence. But most importantly, the need to give the American people a guarantee that there wasn't going to be some sort of cover up or nefarious system of justice. You need to have some sort of independence, and that's what the special counsel did. I mean, a different way of putting this is to just think about the real- world implication of what Judge Cannon did today. What she's saying is that Attorney General Merrick Garland was the one who had to prosecute Donald Trump and investigate Donald Trump. But of course, Garland was appointed by President Biden, who is Trump's political rival. So, if Garland did that, he would open himself up to all sorts of accusations. That's why he gave it to an independent, nonpolitical prosecutor. And the flip side is even scarier, because if you imagine some future president that's accused of serious wrongdoing, could he put his own attorney general in to investigate and potentially cover up potential crimes? That's what Judge Cannon is saying. That can't possibly be the law of the United States.",

This all happened pretty much in the last year or so. From everything you study, do you think it was a matter of time before it reached this terrible level? MILLER-IDRISS:  I absolutely think it was a matter of time before we got to political assassinations. I mean, that has been sort of written on the wall for the last couple of years. We've been in a situation like this before, in the 1960s. This is the kind of violence we were seeing. And not only the escalations that preceded this in terms of the threats that Biden just laid out, but also the fact that we've had political assassinations in Germany and the U.K. in recent years. You know, there's a global kind of uptick in this with the rising temperature and likelihood to use and willingness to use political violence.",

      "sentences": "Can you walk us through, from all your research and studies, what is the path towards this violence? Why is there this massive upticknow? MILLER-IDRISS:  Well, there's sort of -- there's several different root causes that lead to increasing willingness to support and engage in political violence. One of those is an environment or a climate where there's a lot of us versus them rhetoric happening. So, a kind of sense that there's an existential threat coming from the other side that has to be met with violence. And sometimes people even think that's heroic violence. So, we have seen that a lot of times around conspiracy theories related to the Great Replacement, but also in terms of political violence and people thinking that this is what you have to do to save democracy. We saw that on January 6th, for example. But I will also say that in national survey after national survey, over the last couple of years, the single biggest predictor or among the top three predictors of support for political violence and willingness to engage in it is hostile sexism or misogyny. And that's something we really don't talk about very often in these conversations, is what does it mean to have rising online misogyny and hostile sexism, the kind of dehumanization that goes with that, and then willingness to engage in political violence.",

I mean, not talking about individual motivations of a single actor in that case, but talking about the population level willingness to support political violence, which hovers now between 10 and 20 percent in the U.S., that's what I'm talking about when I'm saying that tied to other types of misogyny and hostile sexism. In this case, we still don't know the shooter's individual motivations. And I would just say, remember that in the Ronald Reagan case, you know, we saw someone who thought he was impressing a movie star, right? So, I think we have to be careful about attributing motivations yet.",

President Biden has said lower the temperature. Former President Trump has said that he's changing his speech to reflect a new call for unity. In your research, how much does the intervention of leaders, one way or another, affect the grassroots, one in five, 20 percent, 40 percent, as you just said, those who might have tendencies towards violence? MILLER-IDRISS:  Well, it does help. It helps a lot to see the temperature get lowered from political elites, from elected officials. We definitely want to see that, the language of unity and the rejection of violence. The question is, what you're asking is like, can you put the genie back in the bottle and how quickly can you do that? And there, I'm a little more skeptical. I think we do see that among ordinary citizens who are, you know, either justifying this violence or calling for similar reprisal attacks that, you know, they're not necessarily listening right now to what two candidates are saying, they have already made up their mind. And that's where, I think, we have to see some vigilance and some real de-escalation happening within communities, not just among political elites and elected officials.",

      "sentences": "And when you think about this, where do you think that this -- I mean, the genie back in the bottle is one way of saying it and of course,one can't in general. But there are methods of bridging, of making connections as opposed to just constantly pulling back into silos and tribes and convinced partisan, political and social, religious, I mean, all those positions that people now hold and treat the opposition as enemy rather than just a political opponent. MILLER-IDRISS:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, the first thing to say about that is that there's really good evidence that you can prevent people from believing harmful information that persuades them to take violence as the solution, or to see violence as the solution to their political problems or to the problems that they see in the world. It just has to be done before they believe it, right? There's a kind of preventative work very upstream that is extremely effective evidence-based that people reject propaganda, harmful online content, conspiracy theories, if they're warned about them before they encounter them. Once they already believe them, once they already believe that an election is invalid, once they believe that there's an orchestrated attempt to disrupt an election or something, that's much harder to come back from. It's not to say that it can't be done, but it's much more like a therapeutic intervention and not a large-scale kind of media literacy intervention. So, we do need those types of things to happen, and it happens across the dinner table as much as it happens on the campaign trail. And that's what I would sort of urge people to think about is what are they saying in their own home environments, in their communities in terms of supporting violence and what are they saying to de-escalate or build bridges across those divides in their own neighborhoods?",

The Argentinian president, the libertarian, Javier Milei, blames the \"international left,\" while the Slovenian prime minister, Robert Fico, who survived his own assassination attempt in May, pointed the finger at Trump's political opponents, also, at his press corps.

I'm not going to tell you that I think it's as easy in the United States as it is in Iceland, nor am I going to tell you that I think it's easy in Iceland. But we need bridging leadership. We need more humanity and more humility, and we need to think about leadership, not necessarily as coming from any single leader or any one political party or any one sector of society, we need -- and this is very much something I emphasized in my campaign, we need to start bringing people together across the different groups and opinions, different genders and generations, because in a low trust environment, we cannot go forward in a better way without learning to breathe again, to listen to each other, to be willing to learn and even change our opinions. And I think this is going to require, I guess, a very different leadership model. And I hope that this tragedy is a warning and a wakeup call where Americans, every American thinks hard about how will I choose to react to this? How will I choose my -- can I lay down the weapons, whether I use them through my words or actual physical weapons? And can I start to choose my words and my actions more carefully? Because I really believe that a collective shift in behavior is possible at this moment. And I hope the United States will choose a different path forward. It starts with leaders, but I think every single person has a role to play now. And I hope not just for America's sake, but for the world's sake that this is a moment we will emerge from with a different mindset about what matters and life matters.",

And I am proud of the fact that we had over 80 percent of voter turnout in Iceland, which is the best in three decades. So, quite remarkable. And 75 percent of the vote went to women candidates. So, Iceland really does pounce above its weight and -- when it comes to gender equality. But I believe -- I think people are actually suffering right now, Christiane, and I think they're looking for a more positive approach to the future, and they are looking for a sense of belonging. And I'm afraid that politicians and maybe even business leaders alike are not necessarily always offering people that. And to me, the silk scarf became a community- based campaign. It wasn't just about me, but it was about a vision of bringing all of us together to craft a better way forward for Iceland. It's a way forward that doesn't use violence as a way to settle disagreements, but by a log and design. Because we're at transformational times, Christiane. We cannot deliver a better future for the next generation that increasingly has lost hope without inviting them to be active participants in shaping that future.",
