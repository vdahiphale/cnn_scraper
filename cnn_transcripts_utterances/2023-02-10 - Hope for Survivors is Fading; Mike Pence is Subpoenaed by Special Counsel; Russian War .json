We did see yesterday the very first U.N. aid convoy able to cross into rebel-held Northern Syria. We do have some images to show you of what that place looks like. It is this tiny enclave right in the north Idlib Province, really a community of people that has had to rely on nothing but themselves. It has been absolutely devastated by this earthquake. It is relying on this volunteer group, White Helmets, the White Helmets who have been working more than 90 hours, since the disaster began, nonstop, 24 hours, trying to pull people out from the rubble of their homes. We understand, according to the White Helmets, again, that tens of thousands of Syrians have been made homeless by this tragedy. We have pictures to show as well of people simply living on the streets. The sidewalks now are their beds. The vehicles or whatever shelter they have, they are huddling in olive gloves in freezing cold temperatures. They are absolutely in dire need of aid. Whereas, of course, we have seen the search and rescue operations happening and able to pull people alive out of the rubble. We have this one image of this very adorable little boy who was found alive, pulled out by these White Helmets a day and a half or so ago. Now, many days into this tragedy, there are fears that no one will be found alive. That is a very similar story to what is happening here in Turkey. Of course, these rescue operations are soon going to turn into recovery operations.

Special Counsel Jack Smith has issued a subpoena to former Vice President Mike Pence, seeking documents and testimony in the January 6th investigation.Prosecutors want the former vice president to testify about his interactions with Trump leading up to and after the 2020 election and the crucial days before rioters, who believe Trump's claims of vote fraud, attacked the U.S. Capitol. This all follows months of negotiations between the Justice Department and lawyers for the former vice president. Among the issues that we expect to come up, Donald Trump's claim of executive privilege for conversations with his vice president. Pence, who is considering a run for president, published a memoir in November in which he described some of his interactions with Trump as a former president sought to overturn the results of his election loss to President Joe Biden. Pence's team knew that the book's publication raised the prospect that the Justice Department would likely seek information about those same interactions as part of his criminal investigation. It's also notable that two of Pence's former aides have already testified to the grand jury, going in twice, after a judge compelled additional testimony overriding Trump's claim of executive privilege.

More importantly, there are some speculations that Mike Pence, even though there's reporting that his team has been in long negotiation with the Department of Justice, some experts opine that maybe this is cover for Mike Pence, that Mike Pence wants to give testimony about what happened leading up to the January 6th insurrection, and that having to do so, under oath, before a grand jury, gives him some cover because he is running for president. He does need Trump's base to support him if he's going to be successful in his bid for president. And we shouldn't forget, Mike Pence was a public servant. He wants to be again a public servant. He wants to be president of the United States. If you want to be president of the United States, you have information about someone who was committing criminal acts and trying to overthrow the legitimate votes of the people, you should want to give that testimony, you should have wanted to give it to the January 6 Committee and should definitely want to come forward and give it to the Department of Justice.",

They are warning about a potentially widespread Russian missile attack in the country. There have already been explosions reported in the city of Kharkiv and also in Zaporizhzhia.Remember, these are not places that are on the frontlines, but they are cities that Ukraine's top national security official warned earlier this week could be part of a renewed Russian offensive. These are cities that the Russians have never held before. Of course, during these types of missile attacks, the Russians are typically going after energy infrastructure, though, we've also seen them hit very clearly civilian targets as well. In anticipation of these potential strikes on energy infrastructure, there have already been preemptive power cuts in the Kyiv region to take into an account for that. In Zaporizhzhia region, the local city officials there say that there were 17 strikes in the space of just one hour. That is the most that they have seen since this full-scale invasion actually began. They're just trying to assess at this point what kind of damage they're actually looking at. Yesterday, there were sort of sporadic missile attacks, there were attacks incoming with the Iranian-made drones, potentially a Russian tactic to sort of wear out the air defense system in anticipation of something a little bit more substantial today. That, I think, is what the Ukrainians are concerned about. This seems to make the point for the Ukrainians that they need more in the way of their own long-range missiles, their own fighter jets, and that's what President Zelenskyy, who was in Europe yesterday, try to get. And while his chief of staff said that the issue of fighter jets and long-range missiles was resolved, based on what the European leaders actually said, it is difficult to see how anything has actually been resolved. Of course, he has managed to chip away a little bit. He managed to get the Brits earlier this week to commit to training Ukrainian pilots on NATO standard fighter jets. But beyond that, no one is promising any actual jets. The polls have gone for this saying that, look, if they were deciding on behalf of NATO that they would provide them yesterday, you had the Polish ambassador to the U.S. saying that it would be a turning point even if Europe and NATO just decided to send them, even though it would be months and months before they could potentially actually reach the front lines. Beyond that, you are seeing plenty in the way of broad gestures of support for Ukraine, Kim, but you weren't seeing a lot in terms of specific promises. There were some hopeful signs, though. For instance, the Portuguese prime minister saying that, look, there is no red lines around sending jets. But, frankly, they just don't have any to send. And obviously, European leaders made clear as well that they are discussing continually this issue of fighter jets. But obviously, the Russians, they are listening as well. President Zelenskyy said that, look, we need to do this faster than the Russians. Well, the Russians announced that they'll be stepping up their production of their own weapons in response to this tour of Zelenskyy, in their words, begging for weapons from the west. Kim?",

CNN's Stephanie Elam looks back his life and his career.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Legendary Tunesmith Burt Bacharach was one of the 20th century's most accomplished composers. His music spanned generations providing signature hits for acts like the Carpenters, Dusty Springfield, Luther Vandross, Tom Jones, and Dionne Warwick. Bacharach collaborated with other songwriters including Carole Bayer Sager, the third of his four wives. His second wife was actress Angie Dickinson. Their high-profile marriage lasted 15 years. Bacharach was born on May 12, 1928, in Kansas City, Missouri. As a young man, he won a scholarship to the Music Academy of the West and had a short stint in the army before becoming the music director for actress Marlene Dietrich, a prophetic sign for his career, where music and movies would intertwine. Bacharach won an Oscar for Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head, the theme song from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and another for the movie Score. He took home his third Oscar for the theme song from the film, Arthur. He also won six Grammys.",
