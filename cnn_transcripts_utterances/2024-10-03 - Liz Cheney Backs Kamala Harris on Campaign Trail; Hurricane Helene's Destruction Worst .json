And in the coming hours, we're going to see an unlikely pair come together, Vice President Kamala Harris and former House Republican Liz Cheney, side by side in battleground Wisconsin. And the location carries added significance. They're going to be appearing together at a schoolhouse known as the birthplace of the Republican Party.Meantime, in about two hours, Donald Trump will speak to voters in the key state of Michigan. It's the first time we're seeing him on the campaign trail since stunning new details dropped in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference case against him. Let's take you now live to Michigan with CNN's Alayna Treene. Alayna, what can we expect from this event with Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, when I talked to Donald Trump's advisers about today's event, they argue it's a traditional political rally for Donald Trump in a crucial swing state that you're likely to see him visit at least every week, if not more, between now and Election Day. But to your point, I do think you can expect Donald Trump to talk about these two major storylines.One, of course, the sweeping new details that Jack Smith released yesterday, but also Liz Cheney appearing with Kamala Harris later today. I can tell you that these are both at the forefront of Donald Trump's mind. So, I think it's likely he will address them on stage. I do want to talk about the Smith brief first, because, as you said, these new details are sweeping about his role in the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. And there's a few ways I know that the Trump campaign is viewing this. One is that given we are so close to Election Day, they think it only bolsters their argument that Jack Smith specifically, but also the Justice Department, are trying to interfere in the election, a claim we have heard them made repeatedly. Of course, no evidence that that is true, but that is something they're arguing that maybe will resonate with voters, and they'll see this as such. However, they also recognize that the key voters that they are targeting, unlike before in his past indictments, when you did see Donald Trump enjoy somewhat of a boost among his core base, now they're really targeting more independent leaning and moderate leaning conservatives, and they act differently than Donald Trump's base. So, there's questions about how this could resonate with those crucial voters. And then the other part of this, of course, is that they recognize, given we are only 33 days away from November 5, a lot of people in this country are maybe only starting to tune in now. And they may be learning of these details for the first time, despite a lot of this being uncovered over the last two years. So, that's also, I think, a point of concern for the Trump campaign. As for Liz Cheney, look, I mean, she has always been ripe for Donald Trump's attack. She's always been in his line of fire. And I think the fact that she is actually, she's not only endorsed Kamala Harris, but that she's actually going to go to Wisconsin and appear alongside her to campaign for her is definitely bothering Donald Trump. Now, I did ask the Trump campaign about this. This is what a Trump campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, told me. [13:05] She pointed me to an August 2020 tweet that Cheney had previously posted that read, quote, Kamala Harris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views, raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer money for abortion, and illegal immigrant healthcare, it goes on to say would be devastating for America. So, this is clearly how the Trump campaign is trying to frame this. That Cheney once attacked Harris' positions and now she's moving away from them. Again though, I do think it's very likely Donald Trump will bring these up. We know that these are the type of attacks that he just cannot resist. So, I do anticipate you'll hear about this. And I think this is in line with exactly the type of rhetoric you can expect from him.",

The message quite clear that a Harris administration would be principally concerned with the rule of law upholding the Constitution, Democracy.And it is those fundamentals that are most important. Even if these Republican and Independent voters disagree with her on a host of other policy matters, she'll be bolstered in part by former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. They will be standing before signs that say country over party. So, she is a key ambassador for the Harris-Walz campaign in making this argument. The campaign also investing in this argument as well.

But listen, some Democrats that I speak to, they're not so crazy about this strategy. They believe that the campaign should instead be investing in the base of the party and not be trying so hard to court Republican voters.But Wisconsin Democrats, they tell me that they like the strategy, that in a state that's like 50-50, like this one, this is actually a strategy that they employ cycle after cycle, not only during presidential years. They are depending on Democrats in Republican counties like this one to be in constant conversation with their neighbors to persuade them, Brianna.",

Yesterday, we had Congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the program, and she was saying that Harris needs to be getting into union halls. She needs to be talking to, I mean, really white male union voters.

I think most Americans probably generally think that Trump had something to do with it.The question now is that for those folks who believe that, who probably don't want to vote for him, you've got to convince them to show up and vote for Kamala Harris. At the same time, you've got to convince these voters who are inside many of the communities, inside of the cities like Detroit and Atlanta, African Americans, Latinos, young people to show up and vote. [13:10] Also, they've got to participate. There are very, very, very few people who are going to still change their minds. Right now, this is about the voting booth or the couch.",

But this is as purpley a state as it can get, right? 2010, it elected Senator Ron Johnson. 2012, it went for Barack Obama and elected Tammy Baldwin.So, this was a state where you actually saw Nikki Haley make a lot of overtures to the independent voters because it is an open primary state. This is a state where, at that point, anybody could vote. So, this is a state where Democrats do make overtures to Republicans, and Republicans go after Democrats because the margins are so tight. So, if there were any of those independent voters who maybe were still on the fence about even participating at this point, maybe they did consider a Nikki Haley in the primary. Having someone like a Liz Cheney in the state with Kamala Harris could be a persuadable argument for that small sect. And with an election this close, every margin counts.",

Donald Trump is the one who appointed the Supreme Court Justices that got rid of Roe v. Wade, got rid of the right to abortion access around the country. So, I think that's an important thing to remember. You know, we were talking about the ad a second ago. I just want to jump in here on one thing. We're talking about the different communities that we're talking to.There's another ad that I saw today that I think came from the Lincoln Project that's targeting African American men, because we are seeing that Donald Trump is making some inroads with African American men. The tail end of that ad, the very last thing they say is, be a man, vote for a woman. I think that's an incredibly important thing to remember, that moving voters, this election has got a lot of voters in unlikely places. So, we're talking to all of them.
