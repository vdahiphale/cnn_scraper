Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.U.S. President Biden's stern message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is unacceptable. And now more routes to allow aid are opening up. CNN exclusive reporting on the U.S.'s chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan. What we're learning about the pullout and the planning. And high-level trade talks in China, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen presses Beijing on what the U.S. calls unfair trade practices. Those details in a live report. It's 10:00 a.m. in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is apparently ready to make some adjustments to ensure the safety of aid workers in Gaza. A U.S. official says Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen workers on Monday were Israel's fault. The Prime Minister says he will improve the tracking of aid workers in Gaza to prevent a similar mistake from happening again. The White House says President Biden insisted that Israel allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Well after that phone call, the Israeli Security Cabinet approved plans to reopen the Erez border crossing for aid shipments from Israel into northern Gaza. It's also allowing the port of Ashdod to be used for bringing in more humanitarian assistance. A U.N. spokesperson called it positive news, but said a ceasefire and a massive influx of aid are necessary. The White House praised the decision but warned its policy on Gaza could still change based on Israel's immediate actions. Well CNN's Paula Hancocks is following developments and joins us now from Abu Dhabi. Paula, I would say that suddenly aid routes have opened up into Gaza after that tensed phone call between Biden and Netanyahu. Tell us more.",

This is the Erez crossing, that's always been the passenger crossing, it's where we go into Gaza over the years, and then Kerem Shalom in the south is where the goods go in. But this is now according to the Israeli security cabinet approving its reopening, going to be an area where humanitarian aid can get into northern Gaza.And that's crucial because northern Gaza, of course, is the area where a U.N.-backed report said that half of the population there is on the brink of famine. Famine could happen anytime from mid-March to May. We're now in early April. So this is an area where the humanitarian aid is desperately needed. This is what humanitarian aid groups have been calling for for months now to have another crossing open specifically to that area where aid has not been able to get to. And it's what we've heard as well from Biden administration officials from other world leaders. But now just hours after Biden has given this ultimatum, if you like to the Israeli Prime Minister saying things have to change or the Israeli policy within the Biden administration may change, we are seeing that this is now going to happen. Now, we don't have details. We don't have a timing. We don't have clarification on how much aid we'll be able to get through within this crossing itself. But the U.N. has welcomed it as a positive move, saying that they are waiting to see the implementation, of course, and also the port of Ashdod being allowed to get more aid through a maritime corridor. I mean, we have seen maritime corridors in the past. Of course, the World Central Kitchen was the ultimate maritime corridor that was trying to get aid into Gaza itself. But of course, this does beg the question that if Israel was able to so quickly decide and approve with its security cabinet to open this crossing, why was it unable to do so for many months as humanitarian aid groups and world leaders have been calling for more land crossings to be opened?

And it's certainly welcomed by humanitarian aid groups, would be welcomed by the Biden administration, who said that simply not enough is able to get in, that Israel is not doing enough to try and stave off this humanitarian crisis that we're seeing in the Gaza Strip at this point.Now, President Biden was said to be outraged and heartbroken after the deaths of those seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen. And within this phone call, according to a senior official within the Biden administration, those frustrations were passed on. And we are told that the US president was very clear with the Israeli prime minister that things had to change or US policy could potentially change. Now, it's the first time that we've heard this kind of pushback from the Biden administration in the past, even when they were criticizing Israel for the high civilian death toll in Gaza. They also said almost within the same sentence that the military support would continue. Now, it was vague what the policy change may be. There were certainly no specifics that were passed on publicly as to what might change. But of course, it also comes at a time when there's an imminent approval potentially from the Biden administration of up to 50 F-15 fighter jets from the U.S. to Israel, worth some $18 billion. So at the same time as the U.S. administration is taking a harder line, potentially, we're also hearing that there are weapons deals in the offing. Anna.",

All three suspects are reportedly immigrants from Central Asia. So far, at least 13 people have been detained in connection to the deadly incident, which happened two weeks ago. Russia says more than 550 people were injured. We're learning more about the chaotic U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan back in August 2021. The U.S. scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands of civilians after the capital, Kabul, fell to the Taliban. CNN has exclusively obtained congressional testimony that shows there was no clear plan on the table and many decisions had to be made on the fly as the situation sometimes changed minute-by-minute. CNN's Kylie Atwood has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New transcripts exclusively obtained by CNN show the chaos on the ground as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan mirrored the chaos behind the scenes at the State Department. The department had no working emergency evacuation plan. That is the stark testimony from three State Department officials to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And those three officials were rushed into Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban takeover with virtually no time to prepare. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX), HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The Biden administration's failure to plan for their withdrawal threatened the safety and security of U.S. personnel and country. ATWOOD (voice-over): The interviews are part of an ongoing investigation led by the Committee's Republican Chairman Mike McCaul into the chaotic evacuation that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members in a terrorist attack outside of the Kabul airport. One official testifying quote, \"we had to create from scratch tactical operations that would get our priority people into the airport\". He added we were roughly as effective as we could be under the circumstances. Another saying he was never briefed on an established evacuation plan because quote, \"we were already in the midst of executing an evacuation that substantially exceeded the scope and scale of what had been contemplated\". The top U.S. military generals suggested that the damage could have been mitigated if the State Department had called for an earlier noncombatant evacuation. GEN. MARK MILEY (RET.), FORMER JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN: It is my assessment that that decision came too late. GEN. KENNETH MCKENZIE (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: We struggled to gain access to that plan and work with them over the months of July until we finally got a decision to execute. ATWOOD (voice-over): Those accusations have been disputed by the State Department. VEDANT PATEL, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: The U.S. did not want to publicly announce planning for or the start of a neo so as to not weaken the position of the then-Afghan government, potentially signaling a potential lack of faith. ATWOOD (voice-over): Another state official testified to the setbacks on the ground due to a bleak reality. The Taliban were largely in control. Quote, \"it was what will the Taliban allow? Will they let people move through? And how will they do it? And as someone who's worked in Afghanistan for 19 years, it's a little bit wild to tell people that you can trust the Taliban, hold up your American passport. But it did kind of work\". Those descriptions a far cry from what the department said at the time. NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: My understanding is that things are moving quite efficiently at this hour at the airport at the airport now.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: This was something that should have been foreseeable and should have been planned for. One should always go with a worst case scenario when it comes to planning for things like noncombatant evacuations, which is the type of evacuation planning that should have been used in this particular case. And when you look at the different agencies involved, the U.S. State Department, the Defense Department, and some of the other agencies, it was very clear that they needed to work together at not only at the tactical level, but at the more strategic level to plan this type of an event, regardless of what we might have thought was the viability of the Afghan government. And it was pretty clear to anybody who was paying attention in Afghanistan that this government in Afghanistan, the one that existed at that particular moment in time, was not going to last a very long time. And that became really clear by July of 2021 and certainly was clear to me before that.

In fact, we heard from Li Qiang when he delivered his work report at the beginning of the National People's Congress last month. He said overcapacity must be addressed. Now, this current trip that's underway by the U.S. Treasury Secretary is a follow up trip to the visit she made last year in July to Beijing that resulted in talks with senior economic leaders that were, quote, \"productive and direct\".

A worker was killed in Fort Lauderdale,Florida yesterday when part of a steel crane plunged from a high rise building under construction. Local officials say the fell along with the crane section, which landed on a bridge, damaging two cars. Three people on the ground sustained non-life threatening injuries. Crew members were raising the height of the crane when the accident happened. The bridge has been closed for repairs while an investigation is underway. President Biden will meet today with families of the six construction workers who died in the Baltimore bridge collapse. The White House previously announced he would be viewing the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed last week after a massive cargo ship hit one of its support pillars. White House aide Tom Perez visited with some of the victim's families last week, saying their deaths were a gut punch both for the president and for the families.

The visibility only down to about three quarters of a mile, according to air traffic control audio.This flight went around once, aborted its landing there on runway four at LaGuardia. The pilots said they had a bit of a tailwind and were too fast and too high. They came back around for something called the ILS, the instrument landing system. That's a radio beam that beams out of the runway, gets the airplane on the glide path and lined up with the center of the runway. And the flight got down to about 300 feet above the ground, according to data from flight radar 24. And this is the alarm that came across the radio from air traffic controllers. Listen.",
