They're just playing weird, as former President Donald Trump scrambles for new attack lines against his new opponent who's surging in the polls and raising tons of cash.Plus, I've got nothing against cats. That's how J. D. Vance is attempting to tamp down the backlash of comments he made about childless cat ladies back in 2021. We'll bring you new reporting on how the drama surrounding Trump's VP pic may impact who Harris, ultimately chooses as her running mate. And supreme demands. Joe Biden is pushing for sweeping changes to the highest court in the land. With the details on something no president has done in nearly one hundred years. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. It has been 21 years since noted Brooklyn scholar Jay-Z noticed he had 99 problems. The Harris campaign, the Trump campaign got 99 days, which will likely include quite a few problems. Team Trump's issue today, though, how to attack the presumptive Democratic nominee. The former president trying out lots of different options. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum. A failed vice president and a failed administration. But if radical, liberal Kamala Harris gets in, and by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. She made Bernie Sanders look like a moderate. We have a man that can't put two sentences together. And now we're replacing him with worse than he is, a dangerous person who's not smart.

I mean, I think this has been a really good reminder that sometimes the best political messaging is not the one that is like pool tested to death audience -- test it to death. It is just one that gives voice to something that a lot of people seem to be thinking already, right.Tim Walz was on this weekend with Jake. And he was sort of explaining. I think he was the one that actually started this whole weird thing, the messaging. And he said, look, everything that we have been talking about as a party. The threat to democracy, the reproductive rights, all of those things are still true. But he also just wanted to give voice to something that he thinks a lot of people are just thinking when they watch Donald Trump or J. D. Vance. And that is like, what's up with these guys, right? And I do think it is sticking in a way in part perhaps, because there's also just been so much darkness where we've been talking about a lot of weighty serious things. And I have wondered -- are a lot of people just looking for a little bit of a reprieve and break from that. They would rather just take a moment to talk about cat ladies than democracy, perhaps. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: But it also speaks to what a difference it makes with the candidates at the top of the ticket, right? Joe Biden got into this year, making a big speech about democracy at Valley Forge. He really want to talk about that as this battle. But look, Kamala Harris, this is who she is. Yes. Tim Walz was the one who injected this word -- this week again. But in 2018, Harris -- I've reported about this in the past. She had a meeting with her aides about getting into the race that year. And they asked her then, what she would do if she were in a debate with Trump and he stopped behind her on stage, like Trump did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. And she told them that her response would be that you turn around and say, why are you being so weird, right? This is really about how Kamala Harris is trying to be down in -- on the ground, sort of as a more normal person, and not in the abstract way that politics have gotten to.",

And they're kind of flipping the script a little bit redefining Trump on some level.At the same time, if you look at favourability numbers, we've got a rash of new polling, which tells us very clearly about the euphoria and sugar high with Democrats. But you know, Harris's favourability in the ABC/Ipsos poll over the weekend, it was 28 percent in July, in 22 and 23rd, now it's at 44 percent. If you look at the Wall Street Journal poll, about Democrats who are enthusiastic about their candidate. Before Biden dropped out at the end of June, it was 37 percent, now it's 81 percent. There's an opportunity here. It's very clear for Harris and her team. It's not just about how they frame Trump's and windmills and sharks being executed things like that. Tells about her on as well (Ph). LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, THE WASHINGTON POST \"EARLY BRIEF\" CO-AUTHOR: Absolutely. And it brings us back to before those three weeks between the debate and when Biden dropped out, where there was a lot of skepticism that Harris would be able to win an election. And it came down to what many people cautioned is, it's just so hard to pull a hypothetical because she wasn't doing as well back then. Now she's in the race. She has proven herself to be a much different candidate than she was in 2020. Much more evolved and experienced as a politician, and as a campaigner, as well. But what's also super fascinating to watch is that Donald Trump, who is a master messenger is struggling in this moment. The fact that he who is able to pin something on everyone has not been able to pin something on Kamala Harris. He might get there eventually. But it's just been fascinating to watch this person who seems to nail every single messaging thing, and for the past eight years has not been able to do it.",
