A wedding guest says the bride and groom are devastated but are doing fine.Firefighters are looking through the burned out building for survivors and the prime minister says officials will, quote, \"Do everything they can to help those affected by the sad incident.\" Well authorities say the fire was caused by candles and fireworks used during the wedding ceremony, and that the situation was made worse by, quote, \"The use of highly flammable, low-cost building materials that collapsed within minutes when the fire broke out.\" Now, to Armenia, where there is a growing humanitarian crisis and influx of refugees, after neighboring Azerbaijan defeated separatists in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. The Armenian government says more than 28 thousand of what it calls forcibly displaced persons from the enclave have arrived in the country as of Tuesday. Well the mass exodus has led to this scene, the only road connecting the region to Armenia, packed full of cars as people try to flee. Well the International Committee of the Red Cross tells CNN it is working with officials to open more aid routes into the enclave. Doctors say many of the new arrivals suffer from malnutrition. Well Nagorno-Karabakh has been under blockade since December of last year, which prevented the delivery of food, fuel and medicine.

The judge noting in his paperwork in his decision that he over inflated his home by three times in size, over evaluating it by $114 to $207 million saying that he is living in a fantasy world, not a real world. This also, the judge, giving a real blow to Trump  who essentially rejected all of his arguments that he made in a deposition that his financial statements weren't fraudulent, and that they contained disclaimers. My colleague Kara Scannell getting reaction from Trump's attorneys regarding this decision. And Trump's attorney saying this was an outrageous decision, and that they do plan to appeal. Now there is an appeal currently in front of the courts right now. We are expecting a decision on that appeal sometime this week.

The human rights and Jewish organizations pointed out that the man actually served in a Nazi military unit. The recognition came during a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the incident deeply embarrassing. A senior U.S. defense official says it has not seen a withdrawal of Wagner forces from Africa in any substantial or meaningful numbers, after former Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash last month. But as the Kremlin tries to get its arms around Wagner's sprawling commercial network on the continent. It's still unclear who is heading the operations there. CNN's Clarissa Ward explains reports on the man who may be the new Wagner leader in the Central African Republic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Behind this door, we are expecting to find Dmitry Syty, one of Wagner's bosses in the Central African Republic. \"Access strictly forbidden to all people who don't work here,\" the sign warns. Our knock goes unanswered, and shortly after, we are told to leave the building. We came back to the heart of Yevgeny Prigozhin's empire in Africa to see how his death had changed things, and found two of his lieutenants still running the show. Vitali Perfilev is in charge of the security piece, while Syty runs the commercial side. Syty likes to keep a low profile these days, which is not surprising, given that he's survived a mail bomb attack here in December, 2022. After the attack, locals began to wear T-shirts in support of him, a sign of Wagner's entrenched popularity here. We first met Syty back in 2019. Officially, he was acting as a translator. But documents showed he was the head of a now-defunct Wagner-owned company called Lobaye Invest, and that he had started working with Prigozhin to influence U.S. elections in the so-called troll factory back in 2016. Educated in Paris and fluent in French, English, and Spanish, Syty later created the Russian cultural center in Bongi (Ph), which investigative group The Sentry says Wagner uses as a front to sell its gold and diamonds to VIPs and manage its timber and alcohol operations. The center is one of the last places Prigozhin was photographed alive, seen here with Syty standing by him. We filmed covertly at the cultural center, where a woman who called herself Nafisa Kiriyanova told us that Prigozhin's death has not changed the status quo.",
