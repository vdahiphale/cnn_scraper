      "sentences": "Well, the U.S. Constitution means different things to different judges, which is why we have a Supreme Court to be the final word on what exactly that document means, but we're not there quite yet. Right now we have this question of ballot eligibility litigated through several different states. And here in Michigan, this is more of a procedural decision, how they came to decide that he can remain on the ballot, at least for the primaries. But last week, the Colorado Supreme Court really surprised a lot of people when they said he can be removed from the ballot. And that was a surprise because lower courts in that same state had ruled, look, even though we had a trial, we found that he did engage in an insurrection, this particular portion of the 14th Amendment that we're talking about doesn't specifically say that this applies to presidents. So we can't keep him off. That's why that Colorado decision was such a surprise and that's the big question here. It's a constitutional question.The 14th Amendment says that officials who engage in an insurrection should be banned from holding office going forward. And it lists several specific offices, but it omits the president or the presidency. Now, the former president, he is expected to appeal that Colorado decision to the Supreme Court, and if they don't weigh in, it's possible we're going to see this whole issue bubble up again, even in states like Michigan or Minnesota, where they've already decided he can't be kept out for the primaries because they left the door open to litigate all of this again in the general election. Now, we're also waiting for decisions on this issue in states like Oregon and Maine. And we just saw the former president's legal team weigh in trying to get the secretary of state of Maine to recuse herself from that case. Maine is unique for many amazing reasons, probably my favorite state. But legally speaking, the secretary of state is actually the first person to hear arguments in an issue like this. So now it's a little late stage to make this request, but they're saying they've only recently found some comments that she made about January 6th and they'd like her to recuse herself. It's unclear that's going to happen, though.",

An issue of what they would call an issue of first impression for these judges.And here in Michigan, you have the judge basically say this is a political question. There's actually a doctrine where courts can say, hey, if this is a political issue, this is better left for the political branches, they can essentially punt and that's really what the lower court judge did here and that's why we have that decision in Michigan.

My suspicion is that Judge Chutkan is going to try very hard to shut down these irrelevant arguments and assertions that have nothing to do with the facts of the case, specifically in whether or not he's guilty as charged.

You'll see a bridge to my left. Now, if you're an American who simply wants to cross back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico, traffic is snarled it'll take you about 15 hours that's according to wait times. Now if you look on the other side over my shoulder on my right you'll see this open field. This is where migrants wait if there is a backup. You can see that it's empty. So you're - if you're a migrant who crossed illegally into the United States, Border Patrol is moving these individuals very quickly out. They're being transported for processing. This as we learn from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that they are monitoring the situation in southern Mexico, that caravan that we've been talking about that had thousands of individuals from Central and South America. The agency warning that usually these large groups splinter before they get here to the US southern border and that's exactly what we're seeing. At last check, that caravan was about you at 3,000 people. Now, another 11,000 we've learned - 11,000 migrants - are in camps and in shelters in northern Mexican cities. Now those shelter directors tell me that many of these individuals want to do it the right way. They want to enter the United States legally by using some of the legal pathways that have been established by the Biden administration but some of them are losing patience and have decided to enter the U.S. illegally. Now, again the numbers of apprehensions have dropped but Border Patrol is still stretched very thin and American trade and travel is still being impacted. The Biden administration has closed several ports of entry including one here in Eagle Pass, Texas and it's impacting Americans, it's impacting trade and travel.

And what I've asked for is to surge immigration judges to the border, get cases heard in days not years and if folks do not qualify for asylum which nine out of ten people do not because there's - they're fleeing economic persecution that you return them back to their country of origin via these deportation flights.

One of the things that I've been telling - urging my colleagues is yes we've passed HR2 and there are a lot of border security measures in there. But let's take a down payment on border security now and then let's come back for the rest when we win in 2025, we win the next election. But the key is this, the key is America deserves to be safe in our own country. There are some threats along the border that are there, not only people coming on the terrorist watch list but just people that live along the border. Our lives are turned upside down. So some of the things that I do think make a lot of sense is raising the credible fear standard, increasing the number of deportation flights, adding Border Patrol agents to the equation.

Just a couple of days ago, Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, announced they would once again resume going through the Red Sea. But that's clearly not a unanimous decision.So, again, we'll have to see whether Maersk pulls companies with them through the Red Sea or whether many shipping companies choose to go the long way around Africa. That can have a tremendous impact on supply chains and costs that would ripple across the global economy. Part of the reason that countries have continued - companies, I should say, have continued to avoid the Red Sea is because of the barrage we saw yesterday from Houthi rebels in Yemen. That barrage included 12 one-way attack drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles and two land-attack cruise missiles. That barrage intercepted and shot down by the USS Laboon, a destroyer on the Red Sea, as well as U.S. F-18 fighter jets. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces says they were targeting a ship that was not responsive and carrying out this attack in solidarity with Palestinian people. It is Iran that the U.S. sees as behind this. Largely, Houthis are an Iranian proxy that operates in Yemen. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said Iranian support throughout the Gaza crisis has enabled the Houthis to launch attacks against Israel and maritime targets, though Iran has often deferred operational decision-making authority to the Houthis. It was not long ago that the U.S. unveiled evidence and intelligence showing that the - that Iran was providing support to these. And even if it wasn't the final decision, it was Iranian support that largely allowed these to happen. At the same time, we just saw an Iranian one- way attack drone target a ship in the Indian Ocean. So, this is clearly still a major concern for the United States as they're trying to calibrate their response to continue to try to keep the Gaza war from spreading more than it already has.",

Iran has spent years seeding the region, countries like Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, with proxy groups that it can use to push forward its foreign policy goals, increase pressure, increase the pain for the United States and Israel. So, this is a war that could expand in the way it is right now without a great deal of cost to Iran.
