The Ukrainian military says the attacks are tied to Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain deal in our attempt to destroy Ukraine's ability to export food.

That, there is retribution, that Putin still intends to exact against Prigozhin. He is biding his time, he doesn't want to do anything too quickly to appear to rash or to appear that Prigozhin got the best of him with that really remarkable insurrection that was carried out on June 24th.

Well, a datehas now been set for trial never seen before in the United States, a former president as criminal defendant. Today, a federal judge scheduled May 20th of next year as the start date for Donald Trump's trial involving the mishandling of classified government documents. He's been indicted on 37 counts and could face years in prison. Trump has pleaded not guilty. This is just one, of course, of several legal cases threatening to overshadow his campaign for the 2024 presidential election. Officials are warning that the heat waves ripping Europe have only just begun. High temperatures are expected to persist throughout August. And it's not the reprieve Italy, Spain and Greece really are hoping for as they continue to face unrelenting heat. Temperatures in Rome reached a record high of nearly, get this, 42 degrees Celsius, prompting officials to work on protocols for workers spending hours, of course, in the sweltering heat. In Greece, workers at the Acropolis are striking, protesting, having to work in the baking sun, and temperatures are expected to reach 44 degrees Celsius. This weekend, it is expected to get higher next week. Well, with heat waves becoming really the new normal, the question remains, what changes can we as a society, implement to combat the rising temperatures?

So, we -- because we need to manage energy demand.

A cooling center might be a gymnasium of a school, it might be a church basement, but somewhere where people can get out of the cold. We're going to have to change labor laws, and we're beginning to see that happen now. You can't be out working in the fields in this kind of temperature.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Anger in the north eastern state of Manipur and across the country. In Delhi, huge crowds gathered protesting after graphic videos showing two women being sexually assaulted circulated online. In the 26-second horrific clip that's gone viral on social media, two women were forced to walk naked on a road with a mob of at least three dozen men surrounding them. The women were groped and sexually assaulted. They were terrified crying out for help covering their bare bodies with their hands. They were let her feel where they were allegedly gang raped. The horrific incident took place on May 4th, but police only made arrests after the video surfaced. A massive manhunt is underway for potential other suspects. The sexual assault has renewed attention in Manipur and money for which has been grappling with ethnic clashes since May. More than a hundred people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced during violent clashes between two communities. The Kukis, a tribal group in the state and the majority Meitei population, they're fighting over access to government benefits. As national outrage over the video spreads, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally made his first public statement. NARENDRA MODI, INDIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): And I want to assure the countrymen that no culprit will be spared. The law, with all its might and strictness, will take steps one by one. Whatever has happened with the daughters of Manipur will never be forgiven. SUD (voice-over): But the opposition wants more from the prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

MSF didn't indicate if the attackers were from Sudan's military or the rival paramilitary group, Rapid Support Forces. The fighting in Sudan began in April, escalating quickly into a civil war.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In El Geneina, the survivors have fled, but the bodies remain. The city came under coordinated attack by the Rapid Support Forces and Arab militia, witnesses tell CNN. This, the awful consequence of Sudan's civil war and decades of ethnic hatred in Darfur.
