      "sentences": "Affirmative action on life support. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.Monday, America celebrates the third ever federal holiday of Juneteenth, commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. And as we do, the consensus among legal scholars is that the Supreme Court will soon be ending affirmative action, at least in the context of college admissions. Now, does that mean that it achieved its purpose or that we're abandoning the underlying premise? A pair of cases have been argued we will soon know the results. One involves Harvard, the other the University of North Carolina, the conventional wisdom is that race conscious admissions will end. Currently, race is permitted to be a factor in the admissions calculus, meaning one factor among many to be considered as schools seek to create a diverse student body for everybody's benefit. Quotas, on the other hand, are unconstitutional. That's the bottom line, after the Supreme Court has taken up several major cases involving affirmative action over the years, and one of those cases was in 2003, it was Grutter v. Bollinger. It involved the University of Michigan Law School. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor famously wrote, then, \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.\" Well, it's been 20 years, is it still needed and legally defensible? Opponents of race conscious admissions argue that at schools like Harvard, Asian Americans are being discriminated against where despite excelling academically, they often are scored lower on subjective personality traits. All sides seem to agree that without race as a factor in admissions, the percentage of black and Hispanic students admitted will drop, white and Asian American admissions will rise. That's what happened in California after proposition 209 was passed in 1996, which prohibited state governmental institutions from considering race or sex or ethnicity in the areas of public employment, public contracting and public education. At the University of California schools, the percentage of underrepresented groups declined, and it remains to be seen just how expansive the reasoning of an opinion banning affirmative action in college admissions might be, it could well very extend into the workforce. Schools will likely respond with race neutral alternatives, such as admissions guarantees based on class rank or focus on socio economic diversity. The current debate has largely been driven by one man and affirmative action opponent named Edward Blum. He has a group called Students for Fair Admissions. In the 2013 case of Shelby County v. Holder, he was behind the successful challenge to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. There, the Court struck down as unconstitutional the formula about laws needing preclearance based on state's histories of discrimination in voting. The Supreme Court said that it was based on data over 40 years old, making it no longer responsive to the current needs. Voting rights and affirmative action, well, they sprung from the same era. Two months before he signed the Voting Rights Act on June 4, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson delivered the commencement address at Howard University. It was an important speech, one remembered as establishing the intellectual framework for affirmative action. President Johnson acknowledged the treatment of blacks from slavery to Jim Crow, and he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNDON JOHNSON, 36TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying now, you are free to go where you want to do as you desire and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and liberating bringing up to the starting line of a race and then say, you are free to compete with all the others and still justly believe that you have them completely fair. Thus, it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "There are many statistics about African Americans that confirm President Obama's feelings that things are not equal. Looking at education first, in 2021 24.7 percent of blacks had a bachelor's degree or higher as compared with 38.3 percent of whites. As for quality of life figures, median income for the average black household was $48,297. For white households, nearly $78,000, 19.5 percent of blacks living at poverty level compared with 10 percent of whites. The life expectancies at birth for blacks, 70.8 years, 76.4 for whites.And homicide, the leading cause of death among black males 15 to 34, 20 times higher than their white counterparts. By those measures, we've still not wiped away the scars of centuries. As President Johnson would have said, the gates of freedom have been open, but some among us, namely many African Americans still not walking through those gates at the same pace as others. Not all of the disparity attributable to the unforgivable crime against humanity represented by slavery, but surely remnants remain. And there's the challenge to simultaneously salute the opportunity afforded to Tim Scott and Barack Obama, while not losing sight of others who look like them, but are still behind. As I noted, this discussion happening just as we celebrate the recently instated federal holiday of Juneteenth, the whole country taking a pause to honor the significance of the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. That's all well and good, but as President Obama put it, how do we still address crippling generational poverty that is the result of years of racism in our society? Which brings me to this, I want to know what you think, go to smerconish.com this hour and answer this week's poll question, is affirmative action necessary? Joining me now, Renu Mukherjee, a policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute. She's getting her PhD at Boston College where her dissertation is on affirmative action. She wrote this piece in \"The New York Times,\" \"Affirmative action is wrong. There's a better way to make campuses diverse.\" Renu, thank you for being here. You heard the tape and you're familiar with the speech, President Johnson said in 1965. It's not enough to open the gates of freedom. Was he right then?",

But that purpose is not necessarily being fulfilled today, when you look at majority of black students at Harvard, for example, they're largely the children of immigrants, and they are also typically middle and upper middle class. And so, the purpose of affirmative action isn't really being solved any more by an explicit preference based on race.",

If they can, then I anticipate a lot of colleges and universities in America are going to turn to the race neutral alternative of an admissions tip based on low income status.

And I'll also point out that the Supreme Court has held, you know, remedying societal discrimination isn't actually a proper legal justification currently for affirmative action, it's really to increase diversity. So the way in which you can help disadvantage black children and also help disadvantaged children of all races is to maybe measure -- provide a more accurate measure of disadvantage, which would probably be some sort of admissions to face on income status or to do something like, you know, a top 10 percent plan where you admit at a public State University the top 10 percent of students in their graduating high school class. That would provide remedies for low income disadvantaged children, not just who are black but of all races and alleviate the discrimination that Asian American children are now subjected to in the admissions process.",

But we wrote a 38 page brief, we gave the government and advanced telling them why their theory of the case were wrong. We had amicus briefs filed by people like the former White House Counsel for five U.S. presidents from Reagan to Obama, 83 former attorneys general saying why this was wrong, and yet, you know, they persisted.
