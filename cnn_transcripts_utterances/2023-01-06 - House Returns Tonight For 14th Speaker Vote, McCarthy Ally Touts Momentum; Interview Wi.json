We know some of the proposed concessions and at least one he made has many Democrats concerned it could lead to a government default, we are in territory unchartered since the 1850s.This is also taking place on the second anniversary of the attack on Congress, with President Biden honoring defenders of democracy in both parties and the law enforcement heroes of that day and remembering those whose lives were lost. At the same time, Kevin McCarthy was courting the support of lawmakers some of whom denied the outcome of the election. Many who voted as hours after the attack against certifying election results or downplayed what happened. Some notably McCarthy holdouts, Andy Biggs, have even openly sympathize with the members of the mob now facing trial or some members. Again, it is not just McCarthy opponents in this group, two years ago tonight, 139 Republican House members voted to overturn the election results, and nearly all of them are back in office, back on Kevin McCarthy's side, a reminder, if nothing else, the connections between the slow motion dysfunction we have seen this week and the brutal version two years ago. So with the next vote just a couple of hours away, our correspondents have been working their sources. Before we go to CNN's Manu Raju, I just want to put on the screen the six remaining Republicans who voted no, in the last go round -- Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Bob Good, and Matt Rosendale. So Manu, what is the latest?",

How do they do that? By convincing some of them to vote \"present.\" Now this is the math, 214 members voted for Kevin McCarthy in the last ballot. If all members are present in attendance, and they're voting for a specific candidate, that means 218 votes need to get there. Now, he will get to 216, we know that because two of his supporters have been out of town for various family and medical issues. Now, they're coming back into town tonight, so that will get him up to 216. So where do the other two votes come from? It could come from some of those members who are flipping. If not, if we have a couple of them, three of them vote \"present,\" it would bring him down to 216 votes, or if he is able to flip one of those members and a couple of those vote present, he could win with 217 votes. If he is lucky and able to flip two of them, then he would get the magic 218 votes without having to flip any of them to \"present.\" All of those discussions have been taking place behind the scenes over the last several hours. But already Anderson, they are preparing for a very late night. They're preparing for victory and after victory, expecting McCarthy's speech on the House floor and then following that, they will have to adopt a rules package that will govern exactly how the House will operate. That rules package has been part of the negotiations for the past several days and includes some major concessions that McCarthy had to make in order to potentially win tonight, one of which would give any single Member of the House the ability to vote to oust a sitting Speaker, somebody that could put his Speakership in jeopardy if he strays from the party line or strays from what some of the hard right members have asked him to do. So a lot of issues here are still at play, Anderson, but nevertheless, McCarthy's team confident that they will get there tonight in just a matter of hours to be the next Speaker of the House.",

Coming up next, right now, let's go to CNN's Melanie Zanona, also on Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Yes, Lauren Boebert is definitely one of his staunchest critics. She has been one of the people that's been getting up and nominating other people for Speaker besides Kevin McCarthy. She complained even about Donald Trump calling some of these members and trying to get them to flip their votes and said he needs to stop calling, he needs to call on McCarthy to drop out of the race.She also, during a heated conference meeting earlier this week, stood up and dropped a swear word because she was so frustrated. But now, we are hearing that she might be in the mix to vote present, and that is key because it could give Kevin McCarthy the votes he needs to become Speaker because it would lower the threshold overall that he needs. So that is a significant development because previously, we were only hearing two other names, Eli Crane and Matt Rosendale, who were potentially willing to vote \"present.\" Two present votes wouldn't have been enough for him to get there, so if he can get three members to vote present, he will clinch the Speakership. And so, this just offers a window into the pressure campaign that is building on the remaining holdouts. That was part of the Kevin McCarthy strategy all along. They were going to pick off as many as they could with the concessions and rules changes, and then work one by one to win over the holdouts by getting them to vote yes or to vote present.",

Democrats have been doing everything they can to make sure all of their members are here and present and voting against McCarthy and McCarthy has been doing everything he can to ensure all his supporters are there, present and voting for him.But there was a number of absences. Wesley Hunt just had a baby a few days ago who had to spend time in the NICU. He went back to be with his wife and newborn, but he had to fly back tonight so he could be there for the vote. Ken Buck, he also had a medical emergency or medical procedure that was pre-planned, he flew back to Colorado. Now, he is also on his way back for the vote tonight. And then there was also a Democrat who got surgery literally this morning, Anderson, came straight to the Capitol afterwards and was still wearing hospital slippers. So I think it just really offers a glimpse into the personal toll that this drawn-out fight has taken on these members, and just how extraordinary this once in a century Speaker's fight has really been. COOPER: Yes, Melanie Zanona, appreciate it. Thank you. A lot to watch for over the next several hours. Joining us now is South Dakota Republican Congressman, Dusty Johnson. Congressman, I appreciate you being with us. You had been aligned with Kevin McCarthy from the beginning, you voted for him 13 times. How confident are you that when the House reconvenes at 10, he will be the Speaker of the House tonight? REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Well, I've been telling people for three days that we were making progress with negotiations. I've been in those rooms. I felt, Anderson, that there were people of good faith sitting at the table trying to get to yes. Now a lot of people said, oh, Kevin McCarthy is never going to get there. You guys are wasting your time. But we are close. I wouldn't want to speculate on a timeline other than to tell you, I continue to feel that we're making progress.

The changes come in three ways. Number one, to increase transparency and accountability, a lot of members are supportive of those. I'll give you one example. A bill should not be voted on before there has been 72 hours for members and the public to review it. That makes a lot of sense to me. Number two, an understanding that the House is stronger if you have all the views on all Committees, that is going to give House Freedom Caucus members more of an opportunity to serve on Committees where they've been underrepresented in the past. And then number three, a return to fiscal sanity. That has gotten a lot of attention today. But the reality is we are $33 trillion in debt.

No member that I'm talking to feels like we are going to be able to make drastic changes overnight. We didn't get into this country's problems overnight. It's going to take us some time. But I think what conservatives like myself want to see is movement in the right direction. We want to bend some of these curves in a way that doesn't continue to put us so much deeper in debt.

So, you don't necessarily have to have an encounter at a pub or at a restaurant, you can just casually see someone along the street and then follow them and they would never know.
