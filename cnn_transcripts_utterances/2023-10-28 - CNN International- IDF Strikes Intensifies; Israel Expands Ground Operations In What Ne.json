Gaza virtually cut off now from the outside world, in the dark and in desperate need of help. Israel also expanding ground operations in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls the second stage of the war. He says it will not be quick, but it will be decisive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The war inside the Strip is going to be long, and we are ready for it. This is our second independence war. We are going to fight for the homeland, and we won't withdraw. We are going to fight on the ground, at sea, and in the air. We will destroy our enemy above and below the ground. We are going to fight and win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But if this is, as Netanyahu says, stage two, and if there is a stage three to come soon thereafter, then it would appear that Joe Biden has not been successful beyond the point. If the United States can't restrain Israel, then nobody can.And you have to understand, of course, that this is different from previous incursions, mostly because the nature of the events on the 7th of October, the terrorist attack on Southern Israel was on a much larger scale. Lots of Israelis want to see retribution, wants their government to strike Hamas very hard. So, the government is under quite a lot of pressure from within. And it has to balance that out against the pressure from without. And it would appear that a decision has been made to at least ratchet up the attacks on Gaza. We'll see over the next few hours and days whether this represents finally the total ground invasion that we were thinking of and that we've been expecting or whether this is in the nature of a -- sort of an escalation that will lead to, again, sort of calming down over the next few days.",

That's very stark terms, and in some ways, I don't want to diminish what's happening in Gaza right now, but if there is a much bigger threat facing Israel, you know, a dormant threat at the moment, is what's up north with Hezbollah, with thousands of rockets pointing towards Israel.It just seems that, you know, there is a much bigger threat to the north.

This is a politician who has a long career history of wild exaggeration, and I suppose this is another example of it.It is clearly a much larger operation than before because, as I said, the nature of the terrorist attack and the casualties that it inflected were much greater than before. So, we knew Israel would strike back harder than it has over the last 20 odd years. But to characterize this as some sort of an existential fight for Israel, and the notion that this is a second independence fight, I wonder who that is directed at. I can't imagine that most Israelis, certainly, none of the Israelis that I've been speaking to over several weeks now, thinks of it in that manner, even those who are in favor of a ground invasion don't seem to think of it in that way. So, yes, I think this is Benjamin Netanyahu does doing what Benjamin Netanyahu does, which is overstating the facts and trying to draw on emotions rather than cold reality.",

Those are some of the mistakes that Israel seemed to be making. And the Biden administration has been pressing -- the Israelis have been pressing Netanyahu very hard to show a plan, to show some sense that they are not repeating the same mistakes. We've heard the president use this analogy, don't make the same mistakes that we did. It doesn't appear that Netanyahu is any mood to listen. VAUSE: Yes.

I'm not sure a lot of Israelis would be looking forward to a long fight. They want retribution, but if this is going to go on for a very long time.

So, I'm not sure the people of Gaza, would be -- you know, although they may not like Hamas very much, I'm not sure they would think of the Palestinian Authority as a big step up.So, that's a big challenge. And perhaps it would take something of the order of an international Arab-led transitional government.

But CNN reporting from Gaza says it does not appear as though any major ground offensive aimed at seizing and holding significant amounts of the territory is yet underway. In a fresh call for Gazans to move south, the IDF spoke of an impending operation. Sir, what's your take on what's happening right now as far as these ground operations by the Israelis?

They don't seem to be withdrawing.Now, how much they're going to do at this point inside Gaza? We don't know. But operation like this would, if it is launched, with the intent to finish the job, move in and seize key terrain, whatever that is, it might be a power plant, it might be a plaza under which the tunnels all come together. We don't know that here at this point. But they would then expand outward. Close off an area and completely clear it. Now, how that -- how they deal with the people there, that's a problem. And so, they've got to take it step by step. They've got to try to encourage the Gazans to leave Northern Gaza. That's what they're trying to do. Get out of the way. Let them deal with the tunnels and the Hamas people. And then, from there, they might expand it further, and step by step gradually move through Gaza.

It's an effort to extract the maximum concessions from Israel and also to make Israel look as bad as possible in world affairs.This ground incursion will stir things up. It'll get the Hamas chain of command talking, information will be collected. And because of the movement, the information that's collected, there's a greater chance that Israel will have more information about the hostages. In addition, the ground incursion, as it moves forward, is going to give Hamas a choice because it is, according to the prime minister, going to destroy Hamas. Keeping those hostages alive and safe is the best exit strategy for Hamas if its leadership wants to survive. So, there's a certain logic in what the Israeli defense minister saying.",

Netanyahu said that the second stage of a war against Hamas has begun.The goal of this phase, he said, is destroying the group's armed wing and government and returning home all the hostages held in Gaza. Netanyahu said, \"The war inside Gaza is going to be long. This is our second independence war. We're going to save our country.\" We were in Ashkelon Thursday and noticed airstrikes on Gaza have intensified. We have also noticed just hours ago here in Tel Aviv how Hamas is still launching rocket attacks from Gaza. At least one of those rockets got through on Friday and hit a residential building, leaving several people injured. Netanyahu also spoke about the situation of the hostages, confirming he spoke with their families and vowed to them that he would exhaust all options to return their loved ones home. And during the same media briefing, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, the intensifying assault will increase the chances Hamas will return hostages. It is holding in Gaza. Regarding a ceasefire, there are several countries demanding one, including the UAE and Norway, as well as organizations like the U.N. And the World Health Organization, all asking for at least a pause in the hostilities to allow for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called on the leaders of Arab nations to convene an emergency Arab League summit in response to Israel's operation in Gaza.
