      "sentences": "Hello and welcome. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London. And welcome back to our continuing coverage of the Israel Hamas war which could be on the cusp of its next stages. That's as we get word of Hamas fighters clashing with Israeli troops inside Gaza now.It appears to be one of the first ground battles in the territory since war broke out earlier on this month, Hamas claims its fighters ambushed two Israeli military bulldozers and a tank forcing Israeli troops to retreat without their vehicles. A major Israeli ground incursion into Gaza could now be imminent. The IDF says one Israeli soldier was killed during operations to prepare for that. And from the ground to the skies, Israel has been ramping up its aerial bombardment. Officials at several hospitals in Gaza say they've been overwhelmed with casualties today, with one calling it a \"Bloody Day.\" The Hamas controlled health ministry says more than 4,600 people have been killed in Gaza since October the 7th. Some much-needed respite though for civilians in Gaza who've been waiting on food and water. In the past hour, at least 14 aid trucks made it into Gaza from Egypt via the Rafah Crossing which reopened this weekend, but obviously, that is nowhere near enough. As Israel steps up its military activity in Gaza, hospitals there say crucial treatments like dialysis are having to be scaled back because of electricity and fuel shortages. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Central Gaza has been overwhelmed with casualties, with the doctor calling the situation catastrophic. A warning now that Scott McLean's report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Those who arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Central Gaza alive are the lucky ones. There were five airstrikes this morning near the hospital. This video shows the smoke from one rising nearby. Some 110 bodies were brought here overnight and this morning, one medical source tells CNN. The morgue is now full. The rest of the bodies, wrapped in white sheets, now lay outside in the heat of the day. Relatives try to identify their loved ones. Finding them confirms their worst fears. Inside the hospital, children, including a toddler, are among the dead. Several of these victims were found with their names written in Arabic on their legs, an increasingly common marking as parents try to make identification easier if they or their kids are killed. This hospital is located outside of the area of Northern Gaza that Israel has been trying to get civilians to evacuate. On Saturday, the IDF dropped leaflets telling people that everyone who chose to not evacuate from the north of the Strip to the south of Wadi Gaza might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization. In a statement, the IDF confirmed it dropped the leaflets, but said it has no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting as a member of the terrorist group. Even those who have managed to avoid the bombs are not out of danger. A trickle of aid, 20 trucks, were allowed to cross the Rafah Border Crossing from Egypt on Saturday. But that's a tiny fraction of what is needed.",

I want to begin here, sir. Dozens of trucks are at the border waiting with humanitarian aid, according to satellite images that we have seen, what, if anything, is being done to try and get those trucks into Gaza and to the people who need it most?

As you said in your report, there are 2.3 million people who are lacking basic life support, including food, water, medicine and medical supplies for the hospitals. And above all, the fuel which runs the water and runs the hospital machines to keep people alive and to treat the wounded.I just came back from Egypt. I was on the other side of the Rafah border to coordinate the entry of the aid with our colleagues from the Egyptian Red Crescent. We saw a trickle coming in with, you know, two days ago, 20 trucks. Today, just about an hour ago, we managed to get another 15 trucks in. And they've been received by Palestine Red Crescent, by our colleagues, and moved into UNRWA, United Nations Refugee storehouses. So, this is really a drop in the ocean. It's not enough. The hospitals are running on a day-by-day basis in terms of fuel. It was good news to see today that there has been about five, six trucks of fuel -- tanks of fuel that came in. This will be distributed to hospitals and we'll give them another maybe -- another two days, each hospital, to be able to run and care for their patients, the wounded and those who are at the hospital. So, it is a catastrophe. It is -- now, it is really -- it is a catastrophe. It is not a catastrophe that we will see in a few days, no. Today it is a catastrophe. More than 1 million people are displaced, more than 6,400 people are killed and more than -- almost 15,000 have been injured. And there are no safe places in Gaza. People don't know where to go. And they are sheltering, including in hospitals. Our hospital in Gaza City has 12,000 people who are seeking safe place to stay there. They are sheltering in our hospital, sleeping in -- on the corridors of operation rooms and in the basement and in other rooms, and this situation really cannot go on for much, much longer. SIDNER: Mr. Jilani, you talked about, you know, just being there and what you have been able to help get into Gaza. Can you give me a number now? Because five trucks filled with fuel, you're saying those will go to the hospitals, which are in dire need of fuel, they -- without electricity, their work is made almost impossible. Can you give us a sense of just how many trucks have now gone in? We've heard the number 14. We've heard the number 20. Curious as to how many are actually have been allowed in.",

The responsibility falls whoever is going to take action against a hospital or a civilian population. So, how we treating them? We are doing our best. We are operating our hospitals, our intensive care units day by day and hour by hour. A few days ago, we didn't have food for our medical teams in the north. So, we had to bring in our colleagues, risk their lives, moving from Khan Yunis in the south to Gaza City, some bread in order for us to feed the medical teams, who, by the way, have been for the past two weeks working around the hour. They don't have shifts. There are no extra teams in order to -- for some of them to take a rest. And of course, the number of injuries are huge. So, those people are exhausted, are stressed out.

Israeli forces conducted an airstrike on a compound underneath a mosque in the West Bank. Israel says the compound was being used by Hamas and Islamic jihad to plan terror attacks.Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited with troops in the north near the border with Lebanon and he had a stark warning for Hezbollah fighters who've been skirmishing with the Israelis in recent days.

Now, on the ground, what we also see are the signs of a potentially imminent ground invasion as well. As we were driving along the Gaza Strip today, within about eight kilometers or so of the Gaza Strip, what we found was not one, not two, but four different groupings of dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers, as well as these D9 bulldozers, which the Israeli military uses ahead of ground troops to try and dig up and set off any potential IEDs, as well as any other obstacles that may be in the way of those forces. Now, put together, these four groupings that we saw in just about one square mile of an area represented hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers. as well as those bulldozers, and there were also infantry troops, positioned along the way. Now, the only question appears to be exactly when the Israeli military will move forward with this invasion. Certainly, Hamas seems to continue to be dangling the possibility of additional hostages being released as one way to try and delay this ground invasion, but Israel's military continues to insist that it will move forward at a time and place of its choosing. And in line with that, Israeli military officials now say that they are increasing their strikes, that they are intensifying those strikes in order to try and minimize the risk to their own troops when they move in on the ground. But the question of what the impact will be on Gaza's civilians, who have already suffered so much in two weeks of bombardment by Israeli forces, more than 1,600 children are believed to have died, according to, the Palestinian Ministry of Health, that question of civilian casualties still remains going forward. Israel's military has directed civilians to move out of the northern part of the Gaza Strip and to move south. And when I spoke with a special forces commander just the other day, this commander said that, civilians have been directed out of those areas, and he said, \"Anyone who has chosen to stay there has chosen a side,\" indicating to his troops that any person who remains in that area could potentially be an enemy and could potentially be a target. Now, at the same time, that commander said that his troops will still try and avoid civilian casualties, but those comments and the broader specter of this war and how it has already impacted civilians inside of Gaza certainly raises the possibility of a very bloody time, bloody days, bloody weeks ahead.

Positioning two carrier strike groups with maybe a couple hundred aircrafts and support vessels in the event that Israel and Hezbollah literally get into a major confrontation, not talking about what they've been doing over the last week. And should Iran enter, the U.S. would be prepared to respond. He's had some effect, I think, on the timing of the Israeli ground campaign, large part, I think, is, Bianca, we really don't know, and I suspect there is an enormous amount going on below the surface with respect the efforts to free hostages. And I think he's bought time and space from the Israelis in an effort to do that. But on balance, I guess I would say, and I'm not sure it's a criticism, I think that events, frankly, are driving this, and we're drifting. And it's very unlikely that we're going to be able to prevent an escalation. Certainly. I don't think the administration will prevent an Israeli ground campaign.

It's been building up since early this evening, really the most sustained and heavy bombardment that we've seen sustained because there are explosions and detonations by the minute, perhaps several a minute. And the heaviest because they are reverberating through where we are, which is a mile away from the border fence with Gaza. So, that gives you some sense of how big the detonations must be if you're standing inside of Gaza. If they shake this house, then presumably it's doing the same to buildings inside of Gaza as well.So, this is the most amount of airstrikes, the most sustained artillery strikes, and it does seem to be concentrated in this northern area of Gaza. You're probably seeing flashes over my shoulder here. We're getting big detonations associated with those flashes. They seem to be -- that was one detonation, a bit more in the distance. Another flash there. John, our cameraman, is telling me here at the moment. This is now at a tempo that we really haven't witnessed before. Is this what the idea has said that they would do ahead of a ground incursion? Another flash, John is telling me. Is this the buildup before ground incursion that the IDF was speaking about? We don't know. We've been along the front lines today, looking at some of the military buildup, the armored personnel carriers, the tanks, the heavy bulldozers, they're all there in multiple locations. The locations we were looking at was still a few miles away from Gaza. We know that the prime minister has been meeting with his war cabinet in the last few hours or so. It does feel at the moment as if the tempo is building up for something. That said, we've seen the tempo build up before and fall away. But I think this expectation that something is going to happen, the fact that the troops have been ready for a while, they feel that they've been stood up and then stood down and stood back up again and stood down again, it's been the narrative over the past few days. I've been talking with analysts here as well, military analysts, who say, look, both Washington and Prime Minister Netanyahu are aware that the window for an incursion is narrowing and it's narrowing because of the high civilian toll inside of Gaza, and this is something that also will be affecting the political calculus here at the moment, Sara.",

In Ukraine, search and rescue crews are trying to find survivors in the devastation wrought by a Russian missile strike that hit the Kharkiv region late Saturday. Ukrainian officials say at least six people were killed and 14 more injured when the missiles hit a building, housing a logistics company. Meanwhile, Ukrainian special forces are launching raids on Russian occupied Crimea. They're using unconventional methods in hopes of throwing Moscow off its guard in order to boost morale during Ukraine's slowed counteroffensive. Fred Pleitgen shows us how. FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A brazen attack from the sea. Ukrainian forces using jet skis to land in Russian occupied Crimea. The fighter speaking goes by the call sign Musician. He tells me the operation was successful, but tough. While we were landing, the sea was stormy, he says. The waves were up to two meters high. Plus, Russian warships were patrolling, the Raptors. The Ukrainians say they also managed to destroy Russian military gear before racing off across the Black Sea, using larger boats to carry fuel for the jet skis on the long journey back to Ukrainian held territory. Musician says these missions are militarily essential. It helps our forces in the trenches, he says. We distract the enemy's attention towards us, and the enemy is forced to relocate their personnel and vehicles to the Crimean seaside. Ukraine has started a major campaign against Russian military targets in and around Crimea, hitting the HQ of Moscow's Black Sea Fleet, damaging a submarine and a Russian landing ship as well as hitting an airbase. The Ukrainians use drones and cruise missiles for some of the attacks, but rely on a network of undercover partisan groups inside Crimea for information and targeting. One of the groups agreed to answer our questions but only in writing for security reasons. We constantly monitor all military facilities on the territory of the Crimean Autonomous Region with the help of our agents and residents of Crimea who constantly inform us the ATESH Group Rights, a wide and developed system of agents allows you to make a choice. One of the key targets Ukraine has hit several times, the Kerch Bridge linking occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland. The attacks have led to severe disruptions. Russian leader Vladimir Putin, vowing revenge. There will definitely be a response from Russia, he said. The Ministry of Defense is preparing proposals. For the Ukrainians, missions like these are also psychologically important, one of the planners of the jet ski raid tells me. We are fighting a trench war on the front lines, and the armed forces success is not so obvious, he says. And special operations of this kind in the rear or in the sea, they inspire and give energy to keep fighting. And the fighters in the Bratstva unit say their next infiltrations are already in the works, but they won't say when, where, or how. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
