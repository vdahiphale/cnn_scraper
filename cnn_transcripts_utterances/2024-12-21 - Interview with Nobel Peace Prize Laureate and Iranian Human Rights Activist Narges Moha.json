The women have been trying to keep the flames of this hope alive, at least in their hearts, even if they've been unable to express it.

It was there that misogyny and sexual abuse were completely normalized. Pelicot would then move the discussion to Skype. He traded videos of his wife being raped for intimate images of the men's own partners, according to the police report. Over time, he built a network of men. He told the men what drugs to buy and how to use them. This all went undetected for 10 years. Dominique Pelicot never thought his text messages or his alleged crimes would see the light of day. And they probably wouldn't have if it weren't for the events that took place right here on September 12th when a security guard caught him red-handed filming up the skirts of several women. He received the maximum sentence of 20 years. In the wake of Coco's shutdown, more Web sites have gained in popularity in France. There are some Web sites that could be the new Coco.

Every day, 41-year-old Mile Plakalovic leaves his house and walks through the rubble-strewn streets of Sarajevo to begin a frenzy of activity.He's a taxi driver who uses his beaten-up car to ferry help all around this city. He delivers bread to some of the poorest people who get no handouts from the U.N. He's still working even after dark, bringing his delivery service to the hospital. He rushes through the doors of the emergency room to take newspapers to the wounded and to the doctors and nurses who toiled tirelessly day and night. Everywhere he goes, he spreads a little joy and happiness in a city where both are in short supply. \"I've done a lot of things for this city, and I'm proud of all that I've done,\" he says. \"From the first day of the war back in April, I've worked as hard as I could. From the very beginning, I took the side of the poor and the honest people.\" Mile is a Serb, but he refuses to escape the Serb siege of Sarajevo. \"I am disgusted by what's going on,\" he says. \"I hate politics and nationalism. People used to live together for 50 years, and I can't believe their hatred now.\" Mile won't give in to those hatreds. Indeed, he's taken a family of eight Muslim refugees into his own two small rooms. By the light of a bulb hooked up to a car battery, they listened to the latest war dispatches on the radio. And when Mile the Serb, comes home each night, his Muslim houseguests serve dinner on the floor. They all eat together, sharing whatever food they've managed to scrape up, often even sharing a bowl. After the meal, the dining room turns back into a bedroom, and all nine of them climb in together. Mila sleeps with the youngest, eight- year-old Artis (ph). They laugh and chat, a new family that has been thrown into each other's arms by circumstance, a new family that defies the notion that Muslims and Serbs can no longer live together in Bosnia.
