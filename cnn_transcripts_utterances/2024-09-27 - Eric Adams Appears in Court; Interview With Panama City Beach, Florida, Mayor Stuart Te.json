Even though it's a little dark here in the video, you can still see all the damage. Joining us now is Keith Turi from FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery. We're just getting these remarkable images. How dangerous has Helene been and continues to be at this hour, Keith?",

Help us better understand why that is.",

      "speaker": "TURI",
      "sentences": "Yes, there's a range of reasons why, and many people think that, as the storm passes, the hazards will decrease. It's not necessarily true. A lot of the fatalities and injuries that happen from these types ofstorms happen after the storm passes, and that can be from -- in North Carolina, from riverine flooding. That water still has to move downstream. Some areas where it didn't rain as much could flood as the water moves downstream. But you also have risks associated with downed power lines, with floodwaters and what -- people are walking through or driving through floodwaters or even operating a generator and making sure that you do that safely and keep that away from your home. So there's definitely a number of hazards that are going to remain from the storm. And, again, the rainfall is going to continue tomorrow into Tennessee and Kentucky. So we still have some ways to go with this one.",

And as she was there, there was like a -- all kinds of debris floating by, including what looked like a downed power line.And you have to ask the question about the concern of possible electrocution for residents in these circumstances.",

And so really need to stay out of those floodwaters, make sure you get to a safe place. Local officials will help you understand what those safe locations are. But also check on your neighbors and loved ones. This is a time where we all need to stick together. And so really safety and being really, really diligent is the message here for today and into tomorrow.",

      "timeStamp": "11:35:08",
      "speaker": "TURI",
      "sentences": "I think that the size of the storm was one of the most unique things for this particular hurricane, as it was so large, the wind field, the tropical-storm-force winds went 150 miles from the center.And that meant that, even though landfall was going to be in the Big Bend, you also had that wind pushing water up into the into the Western coast of Florida. And so the size of the storm surge, the range in which we saw the winds in the hazards and, of course, the number of states that are going to be impacted, this is going to be one that we will be working on and recovering from for some time. And it definitely has some unique characteristics to it.",

Make sure you check on your neighbors.If you have damage, you want to make sure you document that damage, make sure you under -- that you take pictures of what has occurred. If you have an insurance claim, of course, that's going to (AUDIO GAP) as we continue to do assessments. So, we have emergency declarations that have been declared in all of those states by the president. Additional types of assistance may be turned on here in the coming days as we continue to work with our state and local partners. So, if you keep that documentation, you might be able to be able to benefit from some additional type of assistance. So -- but also it's going to be a long road. I mean, this is a difficult time. As you mentioned, some of these areas have had multiple storms over the last number of years, and so making sure that we just really stay with these folks and help them through what's going to be a long road of recovery.",

The storm surge of one to three feet pushed and compacted some sand. So there is some work to clear stormwater outfalls. Other than that, we're good. We're moving into an assistance role here.",

      "sentences": "That's right Pam.And the mayor is now sitting inside that courtroom. My colleague Kara Scannell is in there watching it all play out. The mayor is going to be arraigned any minute now. And, as you said, he will be processed, put through the federal system. They will take his mug shot. He will be told of what the charges are. And I just want to take a moment to really think and take in the enormity of what's happening right now, right? This has never happened in the city's modern history. We have never had a sitting mayor arraigned on criminal charges, never mind the charges that he's being accused of, right, corruption, bribery, soliciting donations from foreign nationals, and defrauding the city's taxpayer-funded matching funds system, a system that is set up so that politicians don't feel the need to raise thousands and thousands of dollars from compromised donors in order to finance their campaign. Federal prosecutors say that that's exactly what Adams did, that he took that money, and then he traded it in for favors for these donors. Now, we know that the mayor is currently inside the courtroom. He is seated beside his lawyer, Alex Spiro, and he's staring straight ahead, taking in the bench. This is what my colleague Kara is describing. He appears to be looking in the direction of the jury box, which right now is filled in by the press. There is no jury that's been seated yet, of course. And he's also looking at the sketch artists. They're going to give us the only images that we are going to have from this proceeding, federal court, no cameras allowed inside. So, just describing, talking about the enormity and the significance of this moment, because even though the mayor has said that he's going to fight these charges -- and, as you said, he has been defiant. He has declared his innocence. He has said that he is going to put up a case and lay out his case to New Yorkers. There is a lot of pressure that's coming down on the mayor, his administration, and the people who are trying to run the city.",
