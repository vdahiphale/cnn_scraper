It's Thursday, November 16th.President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping putting their tensions aside to agree on a series of issues after talking for the first time in a year. The two leaders spent four hours together at a secluded California location with relations between the two world's -- the world's two biggest economies near a low point. Biden and Xi agreed to take steps to curb fentanyl production, restore military communications and work together on artificial intelligence. And perhaps, their most important commitment was to pick up the phone and call in times of crisis. But not all differences were resolved. Biden said there was no agreement after raising the issue of detained Americans in China. The issue of Taiwan came up, too, and Xi firmly said the U.S. must stop arming the island. Still, Xi told Biden planet earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed. As for the U.S. President Biden, here is how he summed up his approach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These are two nations with profound differences on how they handle the domestic policies, as well as their view of the world. But for the most part, the response that we had been seeing thus far has been very encouraging. In fact, if we look at some of the reporting and some of the statements we're hearing from government officials, we're hearing words like positive and comprehensive. In fact, there is almost a portrayal of warmth during these meetings. CCTV, which is the state broadcaster, is really showcasing the moment when after the meeting, President Biden and President Xi took a walk around the grounds at the location where this was taken. President Biden walking President Xi to his car to give him a personal good-bye. These are moments that are being highlighted. While there is certainly some agreement as you mentioned on the fentanyl question, on the fact that military response communications that is -- will be restored, that there will be an ongoing relationship, there are also moments that are being highlighted here by the fact that the United States in many ways, for lack of a better word, should maintain its own business, stick to itself. Among the headlines that we have seen today, Xi stressed to Biden that the U.S. should not interfere in China's internal affairs, and as you mentioned the whole notion that the world is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States. This also has been an opportunity for President Xi to meet directly with American business leaders. There was a dinner last night. Apple CEO Tim Cook was there. Elon Musk was there. And his message is that China is a partner and friend of the United States, part of his attempt to bring in more foreign investment here to mainland China, Kasie.",

It's really interesting that this kind of popped up again.So I'm interested in your thoughts about that, but I also, you know, I think that we should underscore yes, this American woman from Iowa was at this dinner, but these tickets reportedly cost $40,000 and business leaders like Elon Musk and Tim Cook were also there. And we have a bit from Xi about what is going on here. Take a look at what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator):  It is reaching out to reach out there, allow peoples, that has time and again brought Chinese relations from a low ebb back onto the right track.

The Chinese being very careful about where he appears, not necessarily at the White House, that would say one thing, but amongst the Chinese community, an area known for Chinese residents, certainly played into the optics of why he was appearing in particular places I think in the Biden meeting as well.In terms of the dinner, I think it was successful diplomatically because we've just heard that Xi was actually promised or suggested that pandas could be coming back to the United States. And there is no greater signal of touring tensions between China and the U.S. than pandas being sent over. But I have to say on this meal, one thing that's undeniable, the one thing that holds China and America together is the economic relationship, isn't it? America needs China to make things for its economy and China needs to sell thing to the American economy. So when it comes to these big dinners, and a lot of it was tech, this was about something which is sort of nonnegotiable, discussing how the two countries can trade with each other. So it wasn't necessarily a political move. So when it's criticized for being political, maybe that's the case. You know, these big business leaders who weigh into politics like Elon Musk does occasionally. But I think of premise of it of having a dinner celebrating the economic ties wasn't meant to be political at all.",
