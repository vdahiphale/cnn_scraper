Regardless, it's moving forward and we expect to see that play out. At least as far as we understand now, there have been no major roadblocks. We haven't seen any reports of exchanges of fire in Northern Gaza like we saw yesterday. So, that's the first element we're looking at, and that will then soon be followed by the release of Palestinian prisoners, women and children, from Israeli prisons The bigger question, though, is what happens after that, a truce that has lasted for five days and today expected to expire early tomorrow morning if there's not some sort of agreement to continue it.

The first is, of course, getting the hostages home. Secretary Blinken talking about trying to extend that truce, at the same time surging humanitarian aid. They are very aware of the criticism. They're also very aware of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, trying to really almost double, triple, quadruple how much aid is going in, and then maintain that even when combat operations continue. What comes next? Those combat operations, they know there will be an end the truce. Those near-term intensive and officials say blunt, candid discussions about that next phase of Israel's combat operations, that's critical, but so too the longer term efforts that have been more quiet but also intensive in the region to lay the groundwork for what a post-conflict Gaza will look like. That has been underway. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he just talked about that last point moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But when you talk to administration officials, they say behind the scenes in trips to the region talking about specifically the normalization efforts with Saudi Arabia and why that they believe could set some type of groundwork. They think there are options there. Now, Israel has not laid out what it wants to see next.

Meantime, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says the idea is ridiculous. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  I think it's ridiculous. Our relationship with Israel is the closest national security relationship we have with any country in the world.

You have people like Peter Welch, senators like Chris Murphy, and of course, independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who are calling for more conditions on Israel. And they all have different ideas about what the scope of those conditions should be, if it has to do with the direct fighting in the wake of any continued ceasefire in Israel. There's also sort of this pause question of how long that is going to go on. You have a lot of Democrats who are arguing that that should continue. So, there's really a vast variety of views right now, but there's also many senators who say there shouldn't be any conditions. Here are two of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD):  I don't think it's necessary. I think that President Biden's been very influential in Israel's policies during this conflict. So I don't -- Israel's an ally, a friend, so, no. SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  We should stand behind Israel. I don't think we should second guess them. I don't think we should set timelines or parameters on how they go about addressing the murders, the rapes, the beheadings, the torture that I observed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And you saw there Senator Tillis saying he always thought that more aid should be provided to Israel without conditions, but especially after watching that footage, he said that really sort of cemented his view of the issue.So, it's a broader debate within the Democratic Party. It's also clear that many Republicans are not going to support it. And it's always important to keep in mind that any aid package is going to have to pass out of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives as well. So, while Democrats want to have this debate, while they're going to continue to have conversations with the White House about this, it's important to keep in mind that Republican dynamic in the House of Representatives.",
