I might have some questions of my own.In the audience tonight are voters who say they plan to participate in the New Hampshire Republican primary, both registered Republicans and undeclared or independent voters who are not registered with either major party, but are still allowed to participate in the primary elections here in New Hampshire. To find tonight's questioners, we cast a wide net, soliciting help from various organizations, including universities, business groups, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups and conservative advocacy organizations. Guests of the Haley campaign and New England College are also in the audience tonight, but they will not be asking questions. We have asked everyone here to be respectful to each other and to Governor Haley, so that voters in the room and voters at home, you, have a chance to hear from the candidate herself. So, now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome former Governor Nikki Haley. (APPLAUSE)",

We were very pleased coming out of Iowa, because we were strong. We started at 2 percent. We ended up with almost 20 percent. That was a good win for us.

I've said this over and over again.You look at the fact that we're $34 trillion in debt. We're having to borrow money just to make our interest payments. China owns some of that debt. But when you look at what the average American is having to go through, it's not just at the grocery store. It's not just at the gas station. Mortgage payments have gone up. Insurance payments have gone up. Everything that we have to spend, it's all gone up. And so Americans are feeling that squeeze. And so what we have to do is, first of all, acknowledge the fact that Republicans and Democrats both did this to us. There are no saints in D.C. when it comes to spending. And so what we have to make sure we do is we stop the spending, stop the borrowing, eliminate the pet projects and earmarks that they open back up. And I'll veto any spending bill that doesn't take us back to pre-COVID levels. The second thing we want to do is take as many federal programs as we can and send them down to the states. That will reduce the size of the federal government. But it will empower people on the ground. Think education, think health care, think welfare, think mental health, if all of those resources were down on the ground. And then we want to open up the middleclass. We want to make sure we eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country. Let's cut taxes on the middleclass and simplify the brackets. And let's make small business tax cuts permanent. They made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of our economy. We need to start acting like it. And then we'll focus on the actual spending of each agency. Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never intended to be all things to all people. And these agencies are way too bloated. What I will tell you is, Americans are tired of working for government. It is now time that government starts serving the people again. That will happen when we get our fiscal House back in order. And that will be a priority from the very beginning when I first get into office. Governor, on the topic that Lindsey raised about assisting those in need, there's a bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to expand child tax credits for low-income families. Your political group, Stand for America, called the previous version of the child tax credit, which helped cut child poverty in half. They called it, No Strings Attached Welfare Handouts. Are you against expanding child tax credits to help more low-income families?",

You can't have safe havens for all of this lawlessness that's happening. It's not just illegal immigrants. It creates lawlessness throughout the city.The second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized, not just because you have this, you know, defund the police situation, but because they go and sacrifice their lives to keep us all safe. And do you know how frustrating it is for them to arrest someone who committed a crime and have them just let back out of jail the very next day? We need to make prosecutors prosecute according to the crime. You have to hold people accountable. Until they start to pay a price for committing a crime, they're going to continue to do it. And in the meantime, that way we can start to get stolen guns off the street. We can start to get drug dealers off the street. We can start to clean up our cities because people will know they're not going to get away with it anymore. That is happening throughout our country. I was in California several months back. And it was shocking, if you went into a drugstore, you had a security officer there, but people were literally just throwing things in a bag and walking out because they knew there was no price to pay. We are a country of laws. The second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on. We've got to get back to where we were.",

As a college student and a young American, a key priority of mine in this election is the free expression of ideas and bridging the political divide in this country. You've campaigned on being a president for all Americans. Now it seems that in the past two decades, as college campuses have become increasingly left-leaning, Republicans were the voice of centering the dialogue and inviting disagreement.I'm concerned, however, by the rhetoric that's come from Republicans like yourself since October 7, that we should vet and shut down ideas that we deem harmful. You floated the idea of social media companies verifying all users by name. And one of your opponents, Governor DeSantis, has sanctioned pro-Palestine student groups on public university campuses in the state of Florida.

And, again, I'm not trying to exempt them from the withdrawal, but Trump played a role here too. What did you think of that?So I think that there's a little bit of fault to go around to all sides. The first thing is, I think that, you know, this pressure by the American public to get out of wars was important. We had been in Afghanistan way too long. I mean, as my husband served in Afghanistan. I mean, they will tell you, you can't go and recreate a culture. You can't go and build a new country. You should never try and turn a country into something it's not. And I think that was a terrible mistake. What we should be doing is always just making sure we're protecting Americans. So Afghanistan went too far. But when you know you want to pull back, you do it in a way that's smart and sensible. And I think, you know, what Trump did, we never want to see Taliban on U.S. soil ever. No agreement, no anything. I don't want them at Camp David anywhere. I think it was a mistake to even try and negotiate with the Taliban because this is a group that you can't negotiate with. Biden wanted to play politics and hit it by a certain date. He wanted to do it by September 11. And so he rushed. And I know what happened then, because I was in the same room when Trump wanted to do that. And we were sitting in the National Security Council. And when that happened, his general said to him, if you want to get out of Afghanistan, you can do it. But you got to send 5,000 more troops over there to do it the right way. And what happened is Biden didn't want to do it the right way. And look at what happened. I mean, if you look at the cash that they left, the equipment that they left. What was heartbreaking for me is I watched my husband watch the news that day. And he saw them driving in the Jeeps and he goes, those are our vehicles. And then he saw them and they were waving like flags and all those things. So you're already feeling demoralized. But then he saw them wearing the American uniforms and making fun of our American soldiers. Like, I mean, think about from everyone over 20 years that served in Afghanistan to see the image of that. And for me, who I went to Afghanistan, while I was at the United Nations, the level of improvement of the quality of life for the women there, was you had women working for the first time. You had them where they didn't have to be draped. You had them to where they could actually go to school. All of that's gone. For what? To hit a political deadline? That's what we have to stop. It's not about theatrics at Camp David. It's not about a political deadline with Trump or Biden. What it's about doing it is, are you keeping Americans safe? And are you looking at the best interests of our national security? And that didn't happen from either side.",

The Palestinians always rejected the two-state solution. And the reason they rejected the two-state solution is because they want a one-state solution. The Palestinians don't want Israel to exist.We saw that over and over again. Any discussions we had with them, the Palestinian Authority doesn't want to negotiate with Israel. So all the heat always goes to Israel and people always forgive the fact that the Palestinians are saying no at every breath. Israel is a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They are the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel. And what we have to remember is on that horrific day of October 7th, when they beheaded those people and burned those babies alive and took those girls from the concert and raped them and dragged their naked bodies through the streets of Gaza, what did they say? Death to Israel, death to America. That's what we have to remember. So when the Palestinians demand anything, Israel has every right to demand security. Israel has every right to say we don't want terrorists on our border. And so will there ever be a two-state solution? Maybe. But Israel has to defend themselves first. And as long as there are terrorists off of their border, I totally understand why they don't trust the Palestinian Authority and why they know they have to protect their people.",

That was what we all knew.But what I look at it as, is I was a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town. We had plenty of racism that we had to deal with. But my parents never said we lived in a racist country. And I'm so thankful they didn't. Because, for every brown and black child out there, if you tell them they live or were born in a racist country, you're immediately telling them they don't have a chance. And my parents would always say, \"You may have challenges and, yes, there will be people who are racist, but that doesn't define what you can do in this country.\" And so I think it's important that we tell all kids that, \"Look, America is not perfect. We have our stains. We know that. But our goal should always be to make today better than yesterday.\" It's hugely important. And that's the problem I have, is we have too many people with this national self-loathing. It is killing our country. We have got to go back to loving America. We are blessed. Because that little brown girl in that small rural town in South Carolina, she grew up to become the first female minority governor in history. She then went on to be a U.N. Ambassador. And now she's running for president of the United States. I want every brown and black child to see that and say, \"No, I don't live in a country that was formed on racism. I live in a country where they wanted all people to be equal, and to make sure that they had life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"",

And then we see others who say, like Biden, we have to have as many electric cars -- everybody's got to drive an electric car by 2033. That's not -- you don't live in extremes. Instead, yes, we acknowledge that China and India are a massive emitter when it comes to that and that we need to call them out on it. But you also look at, what's the transition? Rather than demonizing producers, partner with the producers, because you will find a lot of the energy producers want to do innovation. We see this nuclear fusion that's happening now. There's some real opportunities there to go and look with that. But you -- if you go and partner with them, that's when it happens. You look at what Biden did. And by passing all of that stimulus money to go get everybody into an electric car, what did he do? It didn't even make sense. We don't even have the infrastructure -- bless you -- if everybody went to electric car. And I'm not talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy.

It doesn't need to be tied up with D.C. bureaucrats. It needs to be on the ground, where we can lift people up, because we're losing so many Americans to mental health issues, to fentanyl issues, the economy. We can get them back on track, but we have got to get them well first, and then we get them trained, like what I said we did with our welfare recipients, what I said we did with our prison inmates, is getting them trained. But we need to start bringing these resources down, because what you're seeing is, the federal government is assuming that one size fits all for all the states, and that's not true. I would much rather have those resources go to Governor Sununu and him say, this is where we need this mental health facility. This is where we need this addiction center. That's what I want to do. And presidents typically meet with governors once a year. I will meet with our governors once a quarter, Republican and Democrat, with the sole purpose of, when we move those programs down, showing them the best ways that they can go about serving their people, so that they're more empowered by that process.",

So I knew something was wrong. And she came up to me and she said: \"I saw you last week at X-town.\" And she said: \"This is a picture.\" And she showed me a picture, and she was in the audience, and she had herself circled. And I said: \"Oh, how nice.\" And she said: \"At the moment that I was sitting in that town hall, my son died of fentanyl.\" And she said: \"I need to know that that was -- that meant something. I need to know that me being there is OK.\" You don't forget things like that. That sits with you in a way that nothing else can. I mean, talking to that person, talking to a veteran that comes and says, everything you're saying about how veterans need telehealth and mental health care, or a veteran's military spouse, when you hear those things, it makes it very real. What I have found out from New Hampshire is, we don't talk enough about the northern border. The southern border is in terrible shape, but 500 people on the terrorist list, terrorist watch list, have come through the northern border. [23:10:03] You look at the fentanyl and all that. I learned that from you, because you have been affected by it every day. When I look at how New Hampshire really focuses on single moms, we were at a great center that helps single moms that go and get -- that have babies to get back on track. Learning about the addictions that New Hampshire has had, learning about the veterans issues that New Hampshire has had, listening to the story of that mom, where she dealt with a fentanyl issue, talking about the importance of school choice and why parents want that so much, or the fact that they want to know that the economy continues to squeeze them. No matter how much Joe Biden says the economy is good, nobody in New Hampshire feels that. But those are the things I will take away with me, because those stories and those faces and those people, that is what makes you a good leader, because you can read all the books that you want, and you can watch all the news that you want, but if you don't hear what real people are saying and what real people care about, you will never truly lead in a way that lifts up everybody.",
