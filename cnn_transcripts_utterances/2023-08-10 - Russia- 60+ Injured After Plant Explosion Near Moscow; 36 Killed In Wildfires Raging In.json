The closely- watched report will give key insights on the progress the U.S. is making in fighting inflation.Let's bring in Jeanna Smialek, a Federal Reserve and economy reporter at The New York Times. Jeanna, great to see you. So look, we're expecting modest increases with inflation. If, in fact, we see that in line with expectations, is that good news for the Fed? What do you think? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE AND ECONOMY REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, this is going to be a complicated report to read for the Fed but I think overall, the takeaway is going to be good news. So we're likely to see the headline inflation number -- the one that sort of makes all the headlines every month actually tick up a little bit, which would be the first time it's done that in 13 months. But that's really sort of a mechanical effect because we had a low inflation reading last July. We had a strong one last June and the one last July, so last month's looked a little softer. This month will look a little stronger.",

So that is a thing to watch.I think that used cars are actually really interesting right now. They've been really cooling inflation down for a while. If you talk to dealers and you talk to people in the industry they're not sure how long that can last.

John Williams, who is the president of the New York Fed, very important on the committee, is saying that he thinks that it's likely that the debate is really about one rate increase from here. So they're not talking about potentially doing a ton more; they're talking about should we do another one or should we be done now.

He didn't exactly say that they were planning on cutting in early '24 but he didn't rule it out entirely.And so, it does seem like we could be talking about sort of a pretty imminent set of rate cuts if it is the case that inflation continues to moderate.",
