But even though he knows he is being recorded, you hear him sort of casually discussing classified documents, admitting that he cannot declassify these. And then just a few moments later, calling to someone to bring them some Coke. It's very conversational. It is one of the things that really sticks out to me and I think it's important for people to really hear exactly what this sounds like. There is a lot of laughter in that recording as well. One of the other things that stands out to me is the fact that he and the people around him in that room were joking about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server. That is something we previously didn't know about, because it was not included in the indictment. Now, from a legal standpoint, it makes sense that prosecutors wouldn't include that, right? Because it's not incriminating. It's not really relevant to their case. But in the court of public opinion, the fact that he is making jokes about Hillary Clinton, other people in the room making jokes about Anthony Weiner as well, that I think really comes off as some hubris.

This is the nation's secrets, which don't just change on a daily basis. You don't just come up with a new attack plan for Iran, that he is just brandishing proudly to random people in the room. These are random autobiographers who are working for Mark Meadows that are in the room. They don't have security clearances that he is showing this to.

They told me, and Paula and I, our other colleague, Kayla, we have been covering this for months, we had heard they weren't worried about this investigation, that they had this argument that he just took what he had with him.

So it's been three days that he's been silent, and that was being, yes, that was being noticed, you know, kind of around the country and around the world.He came out, though, on Russian television looking visibly, I think, very angry. He didn't look like somebody who was prepared to forgive. And he, you know, he talked about how the people who led this uprising and he was referring, obviously, to Yevgeny Prigozhin, who didn't mention him by name, were traitors. He talked about how they'd played into the hands of Russia's enemies. And he did what he could to reclaim what authority that he certainly lost over the course of the past several days over that weekend of mayhem by saying that it was down to him, basically, that there wasn't more bloodshed than he personally ordered for, you know, the authorities to make sure that there was as little bloodshed as possible. He also restated an offer he's made to the Wagner fighters that took part in this mutiny to either sign contracts with the Russian military or to leave the country and go and live in Belarus, where it's believed that Yevgeny Prigozhin, their leader, is also heading as well.",

And so, that was something he was referring to.But, you know, Belarussian officials, who I've spoken to repeatedly over the course of the past couple of days, refusing to confirm or deny that Prigozhin is already there, and there are some reports that he might be.

In other words, to basically take them away from this private military company status and make them officially under the sway of the Russian military. And that was something that, you know, Yevgeny Prigozhin just didn't like.
