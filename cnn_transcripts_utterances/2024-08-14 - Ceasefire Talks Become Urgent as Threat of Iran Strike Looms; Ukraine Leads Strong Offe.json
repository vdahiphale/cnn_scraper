On Thursday, negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza are expected to resume in Qatar's capital, Doha. But according to U.S. intelligence, those talks are not expected to prevent Iran from moving forward with a direct strike on Israel, retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Mediators are expected to meet separately with Israeli and Hamas officials, briefing each side with a possible deal based on previous negotiations. Among the possible deal breakers, last minute demands by Israel's Prime Minister. But Benjamin Netanyahu insists his terms for a ceasefire have not changed. He accuses Hamas of adding unrealistic demands. And still unanswered is what U.S. President Joe Biden is doing to pressure Israel to make a deal. The president has spoken about his concerns over those talks continuing in the wake of an Iranian strike on Israel.",

There are differences of opinion now in Tehran between various factions in the government. There is a new president. The president has a relationship with a leader, the National Leader, which is a very, very keen one, and a very, very viable one.

It is something that I called initially a demonstration, which has a doctrinal definition. That is a force that is going into an area where a decision is not sought but it's perceived by the enemy to be a threat. They have exceeded what I think are many people's suggestions of what they could succeed in this area. Now, the question is, how long can they hold that ground, and what kind of risk are they taking on an extended front inside of a salient? It's very good that they did what they did.

In fact, some of the airfields, they've been able to pull air defense forward in a very good combined arms operation.So, they are threatening the Russian forces and they are causing Russian forces to be pulled off. I'd agree with the Foreign Minister when he says we're not there to seize territory. They're not. They're going to eventually go back to their front lines into the territory of Ukraine. But what they have proven is they can go there, not that they want to, but that they can. And they can threaten the Russian forces and cause Russia to look at the disposition of their forces. Are they in the right places? Have they defended in the correct locations? Are they going to prevent these kind of incursions by the Ukrainians in the future?

Now, after this assassination, the Japanese government launched an investigation and found that several key political leaders within the ruling party actually had ties to this religious organization and were receiving funds. Now, this very much angered the Japanese people. And afterwards, Kishida said that the party The religious organization would be dissolved, and it would effectively be shut down. But as we're seeing, that hasn't happened yet. It's still operating as a religious organization, even though it's been stripped of its name. So, these two political scandals has really led to, just dissatisfaction, and really low approval ratings for Kishida. He's also, of course, battling with a very poor economic outlook for the country as the GDP slips to fourth place. We're also seeing the yen at historic lows against the greenback. And even though the Japanese central bank raised interest rates for the second time in 14 years just last week, it led to a market crash. So, for all these reasons, Kishida said that it's time for him to step down and give his party a better chance of winning the general elections come October 2025. John.",

Mediators are making a last-ditch effort to revive the stalled negotiations made a potential Iranian attack on Israel. Two sources telling CNN, the renewed diplomatic efforts are not expected to stop Iran from retaliating for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Last week, the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, the key mediators in these talks said they will use the meeting to present a quote, final bridging proposal. Israel is sending a delegation to the talks. Hamas has indicated it's still interested in making a deal. U.S. President Joe Biden, though, says he's concerned about the prospects of the Gaza ceasefire talks amid the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. More now from CNN's MJ Lee. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: A ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war that has been elusive for so many months has clearly become more complicated after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. President Biden, who until quite recently, had expressed real optimism about those talks, told reporters Tuesday afternoon that those talks had, in fact, become more difficult. Take a listen. LEE (voice-over): Do you think you can still get to a ceasefire deal, or is that starting to be a distant -- a distant possibility? JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: It's getting hard. We'll see what (INAUDIBLE), we'll see what Iran does, and we'll see what happens if there are any attacks. But I'm not giving up. LEE (voice-over): Are those two things tied together? Do you have the understanding that Iran could cease or stop doing an action if a ceasefire deal was possible?",

The Ministry of Health estimates nearly 40, 000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. And in the past 24 hours alone, the ministry says more than 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes, including three-day old twins and their mother.CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): How do you console a man whose whole world has been shattered. A man who hours earlier was locked in the warm embrace of his wife and newborn babies? But now cries out in agony, begging to see them one last time. His new horrific reality is too much to bear. His wife and twin babies are dead, killed in an Israeli strike on their apartment in central Gaza, according to hospital officials. Aysal and her brother Aser were just three days old. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says they are among 115 infants born and killed during the war in Gaza. Hours earlier, their mother, Jumana, a pharmacist, was blissfully responding to congratulations and well wishes on Facebook. I feel like it was a miracle. Alhamdulillah, sister, everything is going well. Jumana, Aysal, and Aser now lie here, in a room consumed with Mohammed's inconsolable grief. These are the birth certificates, he says. While I was getting them, I received a phone call telling me our apartment was targeted and that my wife and children were at Al Aqsa Hospital. Neighbors are still sifting through the aftermath of that strike. Hospital officials say an Israeli shell hit the building. The Israeli military did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The victims of several other strikes in central Gaza also pour into Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Or more parents grieve the deaths of their children. How can I live after you, my son? This mother cries. Amid the grief, there is also anger and exasperation, including from the dead man's father. The entire unjust world does not care about this. That's all I can say, Hassan says. Just numbers. We are just numbers. But for God, we are martyrs. One by one, their bodies are brought out of the morgue so the living can pray for the dead, including nine-month-old Jamal and his father Uday (ph). Mohammad is performing the same rituals for his wife and twin babies. But prayers offer little comfort for a man who has lost everything, for a new father with no children to raise.
