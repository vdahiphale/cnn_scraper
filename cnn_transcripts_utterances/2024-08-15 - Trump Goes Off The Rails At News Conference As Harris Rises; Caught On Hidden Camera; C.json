(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I say wouldn't it be terrible to put the wife of the president, former president of the United States, into a prison. Now, think of that. Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. We got millions of more from 10 to 12, 10 to 12 million votes more. Think of that. I did nothing wrong. It's all crooked politics and really crooked judges. You'll want to see a bird cemetery, just go under a windmill. You see thousands of birds dead. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. She actually called me weird. He's weird. We have tapes of her laughing. She's grossly incompetent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Most Americans are used to that. But there were some substantive things that he said that I think were noteworthy. A reporter asked him about price control, Vice President Harris essentially saying she's got to use the FTC to control prices. What about supply and demand economics? I guess we're sort throwing that out of the window, I don't think most Americans would actually like that when they realized what the implications are, not only on food, but a whole host of other goods that enter and exit the country. He talked about the vice president and her position on fracking, being against it, now being for it, and the implications for Pennsylvania workers, the implication on energy, as we look more towards A.I. computing. You need energy in order to expand there. He talked a little bit about workers without college degrees. Reporter asked him a question there about firing folks. He said, look, companies want to hire the people who work well and workers should also have a good relationship with their company. He gave some credit to Sean O'Brien. So there were good moments if you're looking for substance that if we're being objective here and that's not to I guess ignore some of the interesting commentary that we typically see from him.

He's added Taylor Budowich, longtime adviser prior to this presidential campaign and Corey Lewandowski is a long ago campaign manager. But both of them are going to function as people who know only advise president -- former President Trump and have a good relationship with them, but also can work with his current existing campaign managers and senior advisors.One of the things that you're seeing with Trump at these events is that he doesn't stay on script and there are those who have worked for him in the past, who still advise him today, so that when he diverts from the script too much, it's because he's not fully embracing it. He's not fully feeling it. And so they're bringing in these other people to kind of help bridge that divide. One of the reasons there's that divide is that the candidate is not calm. He's not very happy with the current position he's in. There was a very telling comment at the very beginning of this press conference he made off the top of his head and he's made before which is something the effect of, my God.

The prescription drug cost reduction that Kamala Harris and the president and the Congress enacted is the most popular thing I've seen in polling this year. You know, I do advise a bunch of super PACs. We've done a lot of polling. It's the most popular and, you know, this, Sara, but it's the ten most expensive drugs for seniors and because Medicare has now negotiated, the cost is coming down 50 to 75 percent. It's going to save the taxpayers over $6 billion, save consumers over $1.5 billion. It's actually reducing your cost. And Democrats need to engage this instead of running away from it. But they used to say is, well, we did such a great job. We have the lowest inflation of any OECD nation and people out there say, well, I can't feed my kids, eggs are up 40 percent.

But he was behind by five points to Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, three points in Michigan, three points in Wisconsin. He wasn't anywhere close. Now, however, let's look at what the current polling data looks like. My goodness, gracious, Sara Sidner, what a flipped that we see here. This is Harris versus Trump. All that red has been replaced by blue. Now, look, it's still a close margin, right, within the margin of error. But instead of trailing in Pennsylvania by five, as Joe Biden was, Harris is up by two. How about in Michigan, we see Harris up by three. How about in Wisconsin? Harris again up by three based upon the recent polling data and modeling. So, basically, we have seen a complete switcheroo. So we see he this in the Great Lakes. But there's something else cooking here. Let's go down to the Sun Belt, right? We're talking about states that Joe Biden wants to be competitive in. He last time around won in Georgia, won in Arizona, won Nevada, came pretty gosh, darn close winning in North Carolina. But when he dropped out of the race, these states weren't even close. Look at Nevada, a six-point lead for Donald Trump. Arizona, seven point lead for Donald Trump. Look at Georgia, a six point lead for Donald Trump. Look at North Carolina, a seven point lead for Donald Trump. But once again, let's look at where the racist today. Even in North Carolina, Sara, look at that, it's now just a one-point lead for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris, Georgia, one-point lead, and an Arizona and Nevada, look at that, one point advantages for Kamala Harris.

Now, I'm going to give you the bullets of what his campaigns said about that. They the campaign setting Walz claimed that he had not been drinking and driving. They attributed his failed field sobriety test to hearing loss from his time in the night National Guard, not alcohol that came campaign falsely said that he drove himself to the station, that he was allowed to drive home. They said they said the DUI charges were dropped because they were unfounded and the campaign even faulted this trooper for it saying that he didn't realize that Walz had hearing impairment they claimed a judge actually chastised the state trooper for it. Now, take a look at just one statement that his campaign put out. They said, he, quote, couldn't understand what the trooper was telling him during the field sobriety test and the trooper refused to speak up. The DUI charges were dropped for a reason, the judge would not have dismissed them if there were anything to them. Tim drove to the station that night and drove home afterwards. I don't think the trooper would have allowed that if there had been a problem. So none of what they said in that 2006 race was true at all.
