KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): It is absolutely dangerous for anyone to be on the roads and that includes our emergency vehicles.

It gets kicked around and also all the vehicles, hundreds of vehicles that are still stranded. It's nearly impossible to pull those vehicles out because as soon as you can shovel that snow from under the vehicle, well guess what, the wind is going to just blow that snow back into position here in Buffalo.

And the line really began in the morning. But as you can see from this one location, it's pretty much empty, folks have been showing up the entire day, making sure their bags get onto their flight.Just on the other side of this location is a security checkpoint, where just a few minutes ago, I was able to talk to an agent who told me that right now, the wait time to clear security, at least at that location was anywhere between half an hour to 45 minutes which really isn't bad. The one part of this airport that does have a pretty significant amount of folks, at least that are trying to make do with the circumstances is the rebooking counter at this one Delta terminal out here rather. The folks in this line are most likely not going to make it to home to the holidays, or at least the expectation is a bit low. At last check, 171 flights out of Hartsfield Jackson International Airport had been canceled because of the arctic weather across the U.S. Now when you take a look at the numbers across the country, while you can imagine those numbers are significantly higher. At this hour, we're talking about well over 2100 flights across the U.S. that have been canceled, and nearly 5000 other flights we're told had been delayed going into Christmas Eve. And of course, Christmas day on Sunday. We talked to a number of passengers in that rebooking line who told us they're just trying to make do, they still have some hope that they can get home in time.

Here's a look though, for today still expecting those frigid temperatures across the northern tier of the U.S. We do still have lake effect snow, really for much of the rest of today. And even into the very early hours of Sunday as well.The heaviest bands right now coming down across portions of Michigan, northeastern Ohio, as well as Upstate New York. Here's a live look at Watertown, New York, there's one of the plows again. We've been seeing them kind of come through, some emergency vehicles there as well. They're trying to clear the roads. The problem is they no sooner clear them that more snow comes right back down. So, it's that never-ending process really. Now, once we get into tomorrow, a lot of that lake effect is going to come back down. However, then we have this next system that will be sliding down and diving through portions of the Midwest and into the Mississippi Valley region. That's going to be very fast. So, we're not expecting a tremendously high amount of rain and snow with it. But still, it'll be on top of what's already fallen. Widespread likely, two to six inches of additional snowfall. The exception to that will be across areas of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where as much as one to two feet of extra snow is expected to fall in the next 24 hours. Now we talked about hope. Let's get to that. Take, for example, Denver, Dallas in New Orleans, all finally expected to rebound today with temperatures back above the freezing mark. But for some other cities, again, you're talking about New York, D.C., Louisville, even around Cincinnati and St. Louis, it's likely going to be at least Monday before the temperatures rebound there to get back above the freezing mark. But they'll jump up above the freezing mark. And then really by the time we get to Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week, it's not that we're just above freezing, but we finally actually get those temperatures above normal for a change. So, if there's any precipitation that comes through, it'll actually be in the form of rain rather than snow. But as for Christmas day itself, several areas likely going to have that white Christmas there, Sara, but including those areas of the Midwest or that next system will be sliding back in as well.",

So, let's take a look at what flu is looking like in the United States. All of these states and red and orange and purple. That means flu is at very high or high levels. There are only five states where flu is not at a very high or a high level. So far this season, there have been at least 150,000 hospitalizations with the flu and at least 9300 deaths. Not only has the flu season been severe, but it's been very early. The numbers were very, very high in November and continue to be high in December.

Let's bring in Dr. Anand Swaminathan. He is an emergency medicine physician. Thank you for being here on this Christmas Eve.What can you tell us about what the CDC is saying about this strep throat? DR. ANAND SWAMINATHAN, EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: I think it's really important for us to be following these strep A cases. But right now, it's actually pretty rare to see invasive forms of strep A, even with the warnings that are coming right now. Some of this increase in cases might be due to the fact that we have been a little bit more lacks with our public health kind of mitigation strategies. So, things like really good hand hygiene can help to prevent this. Masks can help as well, especially in public settings, like in school. And I think if we bring those back, we can actually stem this tide. So, if parents out there are worried about group A invasive strep. The first thing to know is that this is pretty rare.

We see RSV really picking up a couple of months ago, flu came much earlier than we've seen in the past. The good news is that RSV is really starting to precipitously decline and even influenza while it's at high numbers, right now, we're seeing a drop over the last two weeks. That's reassuring.We may see though another peak in January, we don't know about that yet, which makes it really important to go out and get flu shots. Flu Shots have been pretty good amongst the pediatric age groups, not as good amongst adults. So, it's going to be important for people to get those flu shots. I think that what we're seeing with the shortage in medications is similar to what we're seeing in hospitals. And it's interesting because the data, the numbers tell us that the flu surge, if we don't have a second peak in January, actually looks pretty similar to years prior to COVID. And so, what we're really seeing in terms of the medications and in terms of hospitals, is the impact of respiratory infection season on a broken healthcare system. A system that's really been breaking for the last couple of decades, but it's been really expedited over the last three years with COVID. Unless we fix that broken system, all of these problems are going to recur every year as respiratory infections surge. So, every winter we're going to see similar shortages, similar shortages and beds and nurses and doctors, unless we start to really address and fix the problem.",

And there's still things that we can do. So, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, it is still extremely beneficial, extremely protective against the bad outcomes for COVID, for getting hospitalized, for having death. And if you're vaccinated, getting boosted is critically important.And those booster numbers are really lagging across the country. That's particularly important to older age groups. But it's important for everybody, because if we get boosted of those who are very young who are healthy get boosted, it makes it less likely that we can track and then less likely that we pass it to somebody else. And it also helps to take the strain off of the healthcare system. So, getting boosted is really important. If you are gathering, it's not too late, test before you gather. That markedly reduces the risk of infecting others. If you can improve ventilation in your house, that's great. That probably were a little too late to start adding in ventilation, but testing and then if you're going out in public, put on a mask. Honestly, the masking that we saw a couple of years ago really should be making a comeback now to protect ourselves and then just as important, protect us from giving it to others.

What they don't really visit, even though they think we should make that last point, three percent of diagnoses, they don't talk about the harms of trying to make those diagnoses of the cost. Not just in terms of dollars and resources. But in terms for the patient, overdiagnosis, which leads to worse outcomes. And so, this report really has -- is problematic. And when you look, the authors either they don't really have the critical thinking to understand these problems or they really were blatantly seeking to undermine public confidence in emergency clinicians, which is very problematic, especially as you said, we are being stretched so thin in the hospitals.
