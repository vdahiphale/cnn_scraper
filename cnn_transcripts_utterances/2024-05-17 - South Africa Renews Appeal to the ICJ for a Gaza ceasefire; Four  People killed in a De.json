But they've certainly already given a rebuttal on the social media platform X. We saw a tweet from the foreign ministry spokesperson effectively saying that South Africa is the legal arm of Hamas, saying, quote, \"It is an upside down world. The terrorists of Hamas are using South Africa in their attempt to exploit the ICJ. Those who represent the attackers are seeking aid from the court\".So they're blaming South Africa for -- for being the legal arm of Hamas. What we know within this court itself, though, the ICJ back in January, they did tell Israel that they have to do all in their power to try and prevent genocidal acts and also to enable humanitarian aid. So what South Africa has said is that what is happening in Rafah has been the impetus for them to call this two day hearing. But really what is happening across Gaza itself is why they're taking this back to the court. But Israel is also accusing South Africa of wasting the court's time, of abusing the ICJ itself in calling for this hearing. But we will be hearing from the Israeli side later this Friday.

LECTURER, VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON: I think so but what's been quite surprising and quite shocking is just how long these riots have continued. They've been going on for three nights and it looks like they're set to continue. I would estimate for at least a few more days until the situation is under control.",

The 71-year-old suspect, they say, unhappy, among other things, with the Russia-friendly Fico government's decision to cut off military aid to Ukraine. The country's interior minister stressing, though, the assailant was not part of a wider network.

PLEITGEN (voice-over): Dismay and disbelief in the suspect's neighborhood. I was very surprised by what he did, this neighbor says. I don't understand how it happened. Something must have clicked. Robert Fico is often viewed as pro-Russian and critical of the European Union. Slovakia's society deeply divided.

Researchers say they used satellite imaging and analysis of core samples to locate a dried up ancient branch of the Nile. It stretches for about 40 miles or 64 kilometers beneath farmland and desert west of the modern Nile and the ancient waterway also lays nearly a dozen -- near dozens of pyramids and researchers believe it could have played a key role in the construction before it went dry. They say ancient Egyptians may have used the waterway to transport heavy building materials and laborers. Well questions are swirling around a newly discovered planet that's being compared to cotton candy. Scientists say this is an illustration of planet Wasp 193b. The unusual planet that's about 1,200 light years from earth is about 50 percent bigger than Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet but it is the second lightest planet ever found. Scientists point to its composition, comparing it to cotton candy because it's mostly made of light gasses. They believe this discovery could help with studying atmospheric events and a typical planetary formation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
