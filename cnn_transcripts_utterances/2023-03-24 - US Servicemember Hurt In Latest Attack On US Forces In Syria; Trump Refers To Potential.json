Five of those are US servicemembers. They are in stable condition at this point. Then later on in the evening, there were 10 rockets fired at a green village site in Central or Eastern Syria, right about in that part, that led to no injuries. But when the US retaliated, we saw two more attacks over the course of the past several hours, a rocket attack at nearby Conoco Field again in Central or Eastern Syria, that left one US servicemember injured in stable condition, and another drone attack, two of which were intercepted -- two of those drones intercepted, one got through and damaged the facility there.

My boundary of my divisional headquarters was on the border of Iran and they were constantly pushing things across the border into their militia groups.Now they have plausible deniability done by the Iranian government, but it is certainly being done by people who are supported by the Iranian government, both with weapons and other kinds of equipment. You can't pinpoint it, but certainly they are connected, and when you're talking about the fight in northern Syria, and the fight against the Kurds, these provincial militia or these popular front militia groups are certainly wanting to continue that fight against the Kurdish forces and of course, against the US.   BERMAN:   General, what's your main takeaway from President Biden's really two-pronged response here. On the one, he did order the retaliatory strike, on the other hand, at the press conference, he emphasized that he does not seek conflict with Iran.

He was talking about the militias.So yes, it's not going to be a state versus state, even though we're going to probably continue to de-marsh and send warning signals to Iran, as the President did today, but I certainly believe that there will be proportional responses against the militia forces, and those are easy to attack. We have had less forces in Northern Syria over the last couple of years. I think we're going to probably see more activity against the militia forces that are fighting against the Kurds.",

No, this time, he was up at 1What does that suggest about how he sees his situation in the larger legal storm he is facing? Some clues to be found in what he posted at one this morning on his social network about Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg and potential charges in the Stormy Daniels hush money investigation. He asks how it can happen when: \"It is known by all that no crime has been committed and also known that potential death and destruction in such a false charge could be catastrophic for our country. Why and who would do such a thing?\" His conclusion: \"Only a degenerate psychopath that truly hates the USA.\" Now this comes a day after he called Bragg an animal and posted this photo of himself getting ready to swing a baseball bat next to a photo of Bragg. And just today, Bragg's office received a package containing white powder and a threatening note. Now, the powder thankfully proved to be harmless. Certainly, less toxic than some on both sides of the aisle say the rhetoric is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

You saw people like Speaker Kevin McCarthy later saying that Trump wasn't calling for protests, even though he very explicitly did so on his own website, Truth Social. And so this is definitely an escalation saying that there could potentially be death or destruction if he is indicted, as we know, is pretty widely expected at this point, even though it's the timing of that that's unclear.   And so this is certainly a cause for concern. I mean, it's been over aweek now that I've been hearing from his allies who are saying they did not want to see anything that anywhere close resembled a January 6th playing out on the streets of Manhattan, because it was a major concern of theirs, given how damaging it has been for the former President. And so this just shows though, I think that also his post, you know, almost a week ago now, when he said he was going to be arrested on Tuesday, which obviously was not borne out, and there was no indication that that was actually ever anything that was conveyed to his campaign or to his to his world, that just shows that he is allowing it to build. He is calling for protests. He's even kind of mocking Republicans who are saying that protest should be peaceful. He's saying they're trying to destroy our country if people are calling for these peaceful protests in the wake of that.",

He is a one-note orchestra. Donald Trump appeals to the lowest common denominator, the most baser, violent instincts of his most extreme supporters. He did it on January 6th. He summoned that mob to DC that tried to, you know, obstruct the peaceful transfer of power and he is doing it now to try to get himself out of trouble. And to be clear, he is in a lot of trouble. We all watched this morning, while his attorney in the documents investigation entered the grand jury to testify against him. I mean, that is an unprecedented thing that we're seeing, and Evan Corcoran is in a position to provide unbelievably damaging testimony against him. Presumably, that happened today. And now, eight of his closest advisers have been told they cannot rely on executive privilege and must appear as well. So it's a very, very bad week for Trump.

So if we think about everything we learned from the search the affidavit supporting the search warrant last summer, and then what's taken place largely in sealed court hearings over the last couple of months. What we learned in this effort to pierce the attorney-client privilege between Trump and Evan Corcoran is according to Judge Howell, the Department of Justice presented enough evidence to convince her that Donald Trump had actually committed a crime or attempted to conceal a crime in his interactions with his attorney, Evan Corcoran.So having made that sort of an evidentiary presentation to a District Court Judge, and having had her decision approved by the Circuit Court, it is almost impossible to imagine that Jack Smith's team will not indict Donald Trump, at least on the documents case. They've already presented compelling evidence in the course of this motion hearing. So we're definitely past I think, a critical stage in that investigation. Now with the new folks, those eight close advisers who have been -- whose claims of executive privilege have been wiped aside, at least by the Trial Court level, the January 6 investigation is ready to get a surge of adrenaline as well.",
