      "sentences": "Today on INSIDE POLITICS, democracies on the line. That's President Biden's message as he kicks off his 2024 campaign using the third anniversary of the Capitol insurrection to warn what's at stake if Donald Trump wins another term.Plus, blasting the frontrunner, Ron DeSantis, escalated his attacks on Trump over both policy and personality with just days left to close the huge gap with the former president. And don't sit back, the former president needs his supporters to show up on caucus night to win the dominating victory he says he's expecting. It's why he's headed back to Iowa today to try to get out the vote. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and inside politics. We start near historic Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the George Washington troops were there for a very long time. And he was leading, of course, during the Revolutionary War, fighting against British tyranny. Today, it is where Joe Biden will make his re-election pitch that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to U.S. democracy. CNN's Arlette Saenz is there. Arlette, what are you hearing from your sources inside the campaign about what we expect to hear from the president?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, President Biden's advisers really view this speech as an opportunity to lay out the foundational arguments of his campaign. President Biden is set to warn that democracy is under threat, and Former President Donald Trump is the major reason why.They chose the anniversary of the January 6th insurrection because they believe that that was an event that continues to resonate with voters with one adviser telling us that they believe in the end voters will render judgment on January 6th when they head to the ballot box in November. The president is expected to speak in very blunt terms about the insurrection as well as what he views as Former President Trump's role in that event. He is also expected to call out political violence in this country, saying that any candidate running for president should be able to say that political violence should not be tolerated. The president is also expected to draw on the symbolism of the area. We're just a few miles away from Valley Forge, where George Washington and his troops prepared during a very long winter for a time of fighting. And the president will draw specifically from some of the words that Washington used himself to describe the mission and resolve of his troops. The president will say that the fundamental question of this election is whether democracy is still a \"sacred cause\" for this country. He's also expected to draw a contrast between Washington, who willingly gave up power after two terms as president with Former President Donald Trump, who was refused to accept the results of the 2020 election. But this all comes as the Biden campaign has really been quite eager to start ramping up their contrast with the former president at a time when the Iowa caucuses, the Republican primary campaign is set to kick off formally in the coming weeks. In the end, the campaign does believe that democracy is not a sideline issue, it is a central issue of the campaign. But one thing going forward is whether any other types of issues will really resonate and dominate voters' attention. But the president has argued that democracy, everything else flows from it, when you think about the economy and also abortion, and they are hoping that this speech today will really serve as the opening salvo of the campaign.",

I think it would be a mistake to take that and say, voters don't ever want to I'm not sure if I want to respond to questions about American democracy again.The issue is that they don't only want Joe Biden focused on January 6 when they want to know that he's doing something on the economy. Having said that, it would be like political malpractice for Joe Biden to stop talking about this thing that happened, which is the biggest -- forget about political, the biggest, a political argument against Donald Trump is that he refused to acknowledge the election results. He got a lot of Americans misinformed and whipped up. Some of them acted violently that day, and there were multiple efforts on the ground as well as beforehand to block or overturn the election results. So, that is a core to Joe Biden's argument. Not only for why he should be re-elected, but for why Donald Trump shouldn't serve as president again. So, of course, he's going to talk about it. The trick for him beyond today is how he balances that with showing Americans that he's focused on the economy, that he's focused on protecting the border, that he's dealing with crime and all these other issues.",

This the Wall Street Journal in December. And I mean, look. Historically, if you're a political strategist and you see that, you say, uh-oh, this really bad news for Joe Biden.

And now, you're starting to -- the beginning of the ramping up of the attacks on Donald Trump, it's very interesting.But I will say this, Iowa caucuses are different than primaries in other places.

Then in any other kind of contest and that people are persuadable right up until the moment when they have chosen which part of the room they want to stand in, basically.
