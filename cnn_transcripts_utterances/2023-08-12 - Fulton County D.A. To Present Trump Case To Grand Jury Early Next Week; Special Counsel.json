Jim Acosta has the day off.And we are following a major development in what could become the fourth indictment of former president Donald Trump. The strongest indication yet coming from former lieutenant governor of Georgia and CNN contributor Geoff Duncan. He revealed to CNN today a new subpoena from the Fulton County district attorney asking him to testify about efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEOFF DUNCAN (R), FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, GEORGIA: I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury, and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting the facts. I have no expectation as to the questions, and I'll certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation. But look, for me this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear, Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions and the surrounding cast of characters around him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So as we've previously reported, the prosecutors down there led by district attorney Fani Willis, an elected Democrat, they are expected to give a probably two-day presentation.

You have to show that it's a criminal enterprise, engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. What is a pattern? You need two or more qualified offenses. Not every offense qualifies under RICO. But if you try to influence witnesses, that's a qualifying offense. If you have computer trespass, which apparently happened here with Sidney Powell, that's a qualifying offense.

And that's why I think this is the second strongest case against Donald Trump of the four criminal cases. I think the strongest is the documents case at Mar-a-Lago. They got him dead rights on that one. But here you've got Donald Trump on tape and that's the difference, and that's why I think they've got a really strong case, not just for RICO but other potential charges like trying to improperly influence an election official.

So I expect that he will be indicted as well.And then there's the others like Sidney Powell who were part of this scheme. Because if you're going to charge RICO, it's an enterprise.

There was a fellow named Curly (ph) in Boston and he was -- his first time out, people loved him. He was the mayor of the poor. And he went to jail, and the election was held while Curley was in jail, and guess what, Curly won by 20 points. So it's not impossible, and we may see it more than once. Eugene Debs (ph) was another person that was a candidate, and he was an activist in the 1920s. He went to jail (INAUDIBLE) but he was still very, very popular. So we have to say there are occasionally moments, but this one is, I think, particularly charged because it is so dangerous. It's so dangerous to our democracy, and so dangerous to our place in the world. If we're seen as slipping as we are, all the nations are going to try to take advantage of us in all sorts of ways we can't even imagine at this point.

And the question CNN was phrasing was what do Republican voters -- MAGA voters want? Do they want a brawler, someone who's going to get in a fight and go for the knockout or do they want a unifier? Scott is clearly the unifier, Trump is the brawler. So far despite the polls that say people want a unifier more than they've gotten, so far though, the brawler is just carrying forth. Just this last week, you know, where Scott was calling for compassion in various issues, on the same issues DeSantis was saying about the immigration of illegal immigrants that if they try to do it when he gets into the presidency, they will be stone cold dead. He said they're going to be stone cold dead and he has vowed to take people out by violence.

And that's why it's even more critical that while we have funds from the federal government, that the private sector also stepped up and helped with these efforts. Because we can't even start keeping track or counting how much of economic loss is, but we will eventually, and so we want to be prepared for that.",

And we know that it's been estimated just now at this point that rebuilding is going to cost in the neighborhood of $5.5 billion, which is a very significant sum of money.You mentioned the private sector stepping up in addition to what's coming from the government. What does that look like for you? How do you see that partnership moving through the next weeks and months and probably even years to come? MENOR-MCNAMARA: That's one of the reasons why we launched the business relief fund is to ensure that we can build that fund. So when businesses are able to assess the damage that was done that we will have the resources available to provide to them so that they can get the ground running again and start to rebuild their business. Again, we are at the emergency relief stage, so businesses had not been able to enter the area to assess the damage and what the needs are. But that will come. And we know it will be significant. And the $5.5 billion, that's just capital loss. We're looking at economic loss and the lives and livelihoods of so many that were impacted by this disaster. So that is why it's critical that we build up this fund so that we are ready to deploy those funds when that time comes.",

Right now, they are assessing and investigating what happened and why the sirens did not go off. Until we know what happened, we can't respond to that or we can respond and learn from those what happened. And so you know, could we have done better? I believe so.

It's part of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's investigation into the former president. We know she's moving forward with a grand jury presentation where she's expected to seek charges against more than a dozen people, stemming from the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. We're continuing to follow this. We'll, of course, bring you the very latest on this fast-moving story as we get it. [17:40:02] Meantime, Russian authorities report another Ukrainian missile was shot down over the Black Sea's Kerch Strait. Earlier today, they say two other missiles were taken down in the same area near the bridge connecting annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland. The Black Sea has become a flash point in this war with attacks from both sides disrupting shipping. Earlier this month, Ukrainian sea drones attacked and damaged a Russian warship. A Russian oil tanker was also hit. Retired major general, James \"Spider\" Marks, is joining us now. It's great to see you. Thanks so much for making time. We know that -- MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Good to be here. DEAN: We know that that bridge is not only strategic, it also holds a symbolic value to Russia's Vladimir Putin. Why is that?",

Number one, a very practical reason it's held in such high regard is that it provides the only linkage prior to the war, the only linkage from the Russian mainland to Crimea. That's significant.I would say the second thing is they look at this as a piece of Russian technology and engineering that is quite comfortable. I think there's another piece to it as well is that, militarily, if Russia's going to be successful in terms of their desire to hold Crimea, they have to be able to have multiple accesses into Crimea. If they lose the Kerch Bridge, they've not got a single route in, and that's the land bridge. That becomes very vulnerable based on the military operations the Ukrainians are conducting right now. I think that's why they hold this as a key piece of terrain that needs to be maintained.",

Andthey've done some tremendous fighting against the Russians. But they've not been able to isolate, penetrate, force the Russians off Ukrainian soil. We're seeing the beginning of that right now we hope. So the creation of drones and the use of drones certainly is not new. This is just an acknowledgment that this type of technology, this type of enabler is one that they will continue to use. And it's a wise decision on their part, certainly on the part of Ukrainians.

That's the last thing you want to be in combat. You don't want to be isolated. You have to have access in. You've got to have a logistic supply coming in as well. You've got to be able to get out if necessary. If Kharkiv were to fall, then there would be a pretty straight shot south from Kharkiv that would isolate and put at risk those Ukrainian soldiers.

And everybody's kind of wearing it down in terms of, what is the desired outcome? What is the strategic outcome. And as we've seen, President Zelenskyy has established a very high bar. He has said Russians off Ukrainian soil. Yet, what is happening in terms of support does not provide that full desired objective. It's not going to get there from here. And we're seeing that play out right now. That doesn't mean they're not fighting hard. And Ukrainians are an incredible people. And they're led by a Churchillian-type leader. The challenge is, is there an actual anticipated outcome where the Russians are going to be forced out of Ukraine entirely? I think what you're seeing is probably -- I can't speak to the narrative of the polls. But I think what we're seeing is America's tiring of this. And they're saying, look, we don't know that this is really going to happen. I don't know that Ukraine is going to be able to push Russia on Ukrainian soil. We don't know that that's going to happen. So what is the end goal? Can President Zelenskyy sign up for a negotiated settlement that would acknowledge, look, Russia has successfully taken over a part of Ukraine, it's criminal, it's illegal, it's brutal. It's horrible, I got it. But we're not going to be able to force them off unless we decide to put American boots and NATO on the ground to confront Russia directly.

I use the word \"remarkable\" as well because, to me, it is just that, absolutely amazing to see what has happened here, Hamlin coming back from suffering that cardiac arrest on the field. That was back seven months ago in Cincinnati and now back on an NFL field this weekend. The 25-year-old making his pre-season debut for Buffalo, being greeted, you can see here, by his teammates before the game with the Indianapolis Colts. Hamlin played on special teams and defense, as well. He made three tackles, including this stop on a fourth down in the first quarter. This in the Bills' 23-19 victory on Saturday. Afterwards, the 25-year-old calling it a great experience and another milestone in getting back to myself, as he put it. His coach, Sean McDermott, calling it a remarkable display of courage, strength, and faith. It is all so very, very inspiring. Hamlin, just to reset here, cleared to resume football activities back in April. He's been a full participant in the Bills off-season program. Hamlin entered the season as a backup now in Buffalo, a really strong secondary. But he should get opportunities to expand his role as the season progresses. Buffalo has two more pre-season games before the regular season begins on September the 11th, Jessica. That against the New York Jets. Certainly wish him all the very best moving forward.
