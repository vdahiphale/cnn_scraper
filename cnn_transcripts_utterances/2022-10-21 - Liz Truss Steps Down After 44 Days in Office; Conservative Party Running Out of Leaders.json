      "sentences": "Absolutely. Let's start with those sanctions because that's something that President Zelenskyy has been requesting for some time now. These kamikaze drones have, of course led to devastating loss of life on the ground. It was last week in Kyiv, or just a few days ago, rather, in Kyiv that one of the victims of these kamikaze drone attacks was a pregnant woman and her husband.So absolutely horrific attacks, particularly on civilians caused by these Iranian made drones. And these sanctions, of course, trying to limit the impact of that. The E.U. and the U.K. imposing these sanctions on three top Iranian generals and a business that they say are involved in providing these drones to the Kremlin. And now Iran for its part has repeatedly denied despite the evidence that exists. Iran has repeatedly denied providing any weapons to the Kremlin saying it's not party to the conflict. But we also understand from U.S. officials that not only are drones being provided, training is being provided on the ground in Russian occupied Crimea as well by Iranian forces. So, a significant move there to try to limit that impact of these kamikaze drones that we've seen really over the last couple of weeks. The other thing that President Zelenskyy is of course asking for is help with energy infrastructure. As you mentioned there, up to 40 percent of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed in Russian missile attacks, in Russian attacks just in the last couple of weeks. That's forced Ukrainian officials to impose rolling blackouts. Those started yesterday, Kim. Up to four-hour long blackouts in cities and towns across Ukraine where officials simply do not have the electricity. They do not have the power grid to meet the demands of the local population. And we could see more of that through the winter, and you can expect how concerning that is as temperatures drop, of course, for families to be left without power for many hours. So, that's an important issue. Of course, President Zelenskyy appealing to his partners appealing to the E.U. and NATO for emergency assistance. We understand some of that assistance will be arriving as early as next week. Kim?",

Let's get to some of the other news from around the world.A legal victory for actor Kevin Spacey as a New York jury finds him not liable for battery in a civil trial. Spacey was accused of touching fellow actor Anthony Rapp inappropriately in 1986 when Rapp was 14 years old. The jury deliberated for about an hour before deciding Rapp failed to prove the allegations. Spacey still has legal trouble in the U.K., including four charges of sexual assault. He has pleaded not guilty. The wife of a U.S. diplomat has pleaded guilty to causing the death of British teenager by careless driving. Harry Dunn was struck and killed in a 2019 collision that happened when Anne Sacoolas drove on the wrong side of the road. Prosecutors say they will not pursue more serious charges against her. The careless driving charge can we punish by up -- by up to five years in prison. But Sacoolas remains in the U.S. and any sentence will likely be unenforceable. Brazilian voters head back to the polls in little more than a week for a runoff vote in the country's presidential election. New polling shows that current right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, is closing the gap between himself and his rival former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula has a slight lead, but the race is effectively a statistical tie. The government of Chad has imposed an overnight curfew as deadly clashes rage between police and anti-government protestors.
