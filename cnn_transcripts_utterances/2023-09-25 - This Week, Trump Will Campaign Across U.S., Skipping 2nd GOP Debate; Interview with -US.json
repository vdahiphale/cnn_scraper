Also, we know from the history of shutdowns that the House Republicans are going to get blamed, take the political blame for the repercussions of a shutdown which can be serious. Serious for federal workers. Serious for Americans who want to get their passport renewed.And we saw with the Trump shutdown, the longest shutdown in our history, the big political cost he paid for that. So, the White House is, of course, warning about the reasons not to have a shutdown. Politically speaking, it could be a good thing for them.",

He no longer holds the, kind of, commanding lead among Republicans in those early states that he had.Nikki Haley did well in that first presidential debate. Maybe she could emerge as a number two. I mean, if you'd look at a state like New Hampshire, if the anti-Trump or the non-Trump vote in the Republican Party, in the Republican primary got together in one piece, they could defeat Donald Trump. But there is no signs that any of these candidates, except maybe Asa Hutchison, are ready to drop out of the race at this point. Maybe the second debate will have the effect of clearing and defining the field. But man, it is going to be hard to deny Donald Trump this nomination.",

And on the issue of the national debt, that was a surprise, her first point out of the box in that debate was to criticize Republicans for increasing the national debt. That was interesting. She also offered a kind of more moderate or nuanced position on abortion.And the thing that I -- one of the things I'm really watching for this debate is whether other Republican candidates try to move a little on the abortion. The issue that has really defined the Republican Party since Ronald Reagan for its presidential nominees. Donald Trump opened that door in his comments on abortion.

It has the capability of high speed, great deal of armor protection, tremendous firepower from the 120-millimeter gun. It has the ability to range very far. It also has great crew protection. It can hit targets that aims at close to 3,000 meters plus, which is tremendously important, but it also has machine guns, several machine guns on the vehicle that can engage troop targets.So, what you're talking about is a very capable armored system. It is tough to train on. The Ukrainians had been doing that for the last several months as promised. Secretary of Defense Austin said the Ukraine forces are going to get 31 of these tanks, which is the equivalent of a Ukrainian armored battalion. And it will contribute to the ground warfare, especially in the ongoing offensive that Ukraine is conducting.",

I would wait for the counteroffensive that's ongoing now in several different directions to show strength some strengths and breakthrough operations. Then you use these tanks as part of a combined arms team of infantry and artillery and air defense and engineers to continue to assault to the key positions or the key objectives that Ukraine has determined that are the final point of this. Breaking supply lines, going after troop forces.But in my view, these are best used as part of a mass of a combined arms team with a mobile armored punch. Once you find out where you want to go, once you find out the areas have been cleared of mines which have been plaguing the Ukrainian forces over the last several months, you would throw these in in a combined arms team and have that kind of armored punch that is needed to breakthrough and continue the assault, because they can move very quickly if they're supplied and maintained over an attack route.",

In 1988 saltwater got in to the New Orleans drinking supply for a couple of days and they had to, sort of, fight it back.So, they came up with this idea, the Army Corps of Engineers, that they would have to build sills now, this is just like a speed bump of sand on the bottom to stop the saltwater which is denser than fresh from coming upstream there. Well, now, for the first time ever, they've had to rebuild that sill twice and back-to-back years. The initial projection was we do this every five years, we can manage it. Now, but now the drought is so bad that army corps of says they need 10 inches of rain in the entire Mississippi River Valley to fix this problem and beat back that saltwater.",

A price of shipping, one, you know, bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent. So, you see it in your grocery bills as well.
