Beijing is easing some lockdowns and testing requirements in what the top COVID official calls a new stage and mission in controlling the pandemic.The man who recorded this video is yelling unsealed as workers remove orange barricades from the streets of Hangzhou. The city has now lifted lockdown in several areas and called an end to district-wide mass testing. And some people who have been in close contact with COVID patients will now be allowed to isolate at home instead of in government quarantine facilities. There are reports of similar moves in Shanghai. Reuters obtained video from that city showing people pushing and shoving police in HAZMAT suits. Although it's not clear when their footage was recorded. CNN has been able to verify at least 20 protests and 15 different cities across China since the weekend. So, let's bring in CNN's Anna Coren. She is tracking developments from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Anna. So, China is easing some COVID restrictions in response to these protests across the country. What is the latest on this? And what additional changes might be planned do you think?",

Many thanks.Ukraine is stepping up security at its embassies worldwide for a letter bomb exploded Wednesday at its embassy in Madrid. Spanish officials say a Ukrainian employee was slightly injured. The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. That device was safely deactivated. A Spanish official says the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters have the same return address. Well, meanwhile on the frontlines, Russia claims its forces have captured another town in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry says the newly sees town is south of Bakhmut where some of the heaviest fighting has raged for months. Moscow has focused considerable effort on encircling the city. The Ukrainian government denies claims Bakhmut is surrounded and has not confirmed the loss of any territory as Russia ramped up its offensive in recent days. Meanwhile, Ukraine is calling on NATO to supply the country with everything needed to defeat Russia's invasion as fast as possible. The Ukrainian foreign minister delivered the message in person Wednesday on the second day of talks between NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest. NATO secretary general gave this update on the fighting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been working with the Ukrainians to get them what they need to defend themselves and to push back the Russian aggression. And every step along the way, in consultation with them, in consultation with allies and partners. We've adjusted as the nature of the aggression has shifted to make sure that they were getting into their hands as quickly as possible, exactly what they needed to deal with Putin's war.And that process continues. We're now very focused on-air defense systems. And not just us, many other countries. And we're working to make sure that the Ukrainians get those systems as quickly as possible, but also as effectively as possible. Making sure that they're trained on them, making sure that they have the ability to maintain them. And all of that has to come together and it is. We have a very deliberate process established by the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in Ramstein, Germany, that meets regularly to make sure that the Ukrainians are getting what they need when they need it. AMANPOUR: So, let me ask you then about the somewhat confusion from the Pentagon and from you all at NATO regarding American patriots. As you say they definitely need anti-air defense systems. And clearly, you must think that they need more as Putin ratchets up his missile attack and his missile wars against cities. So, will the United States give patriot systems? And if not, why not?",

Before that, of course, we had the HIMARS which they use to great effect, both in in southern and eastern Ukraine.So, virtually every single day, Cristiane, the Pentagon is looking at this, listening to the Ukrainians, consulting with allies and partners and if we don't have something, trying to find it elsewhere, that's part of this entire coordination process.

Well, the U.S. women's national team won the last two World Cups, but they're actually making more money from the U.S. Men's Team reaching the knockout stages in Qatar. That's because of the equal pay agreement forged earlier this year, which requires the women's and men's teams to split off World Cup earnings. The American men will get at least 13 million for reaching the knockout. So, half of that will now go to the women.Their own World Cup championships only netted six million, two million in 2015 and four million in 2019. The equal pay deal also means the U.S. men's team will get half of the women's prize money in the future. Well, today's Germany versus Costa Rica match will feature a first for the Men's World Cup which is an all women team of referees. The head ref will be France's Stephanie Frappart who was the first woman to officiate a UEFA men's champions league match two years ago. She will be joined by assistants from Brazil and Mexico. Frappart previously told CNN she doesn't think about breaking barriers or making history and he's just focused on doing her job.

I think it's also a very smart move because to grow the game, you want more women to play it around the world.It's a real message that women can have various roles in soccer, not just as players. Of course, the Women's World Cup is a perfect example of the success of a women's soccer, women's football around the world. But also, you could, you know, you can coach, you can referee you, you can have a long career in the sport. And that's just a really smart move business wise to grow your game and to continue to encourage not only men but women, boys and girls to be able to play this sport. And I remember a generation or so ago when Sepp Blatter then the president of FIFA said that the future of football is feminine. And it's taken a long time and there's a lot of misogyny, a lot of sexism to cut through for sure. But a day like this with this refereeing team, I think Rosemary, it does show us that change is possible.

That is of course in contrast to those videos you just showed of some people across the country celebrating the team's loss against the United States.We saw many taking to the streets in Tehran, particularly also in the northwestern Kurdish cities, honking their car horns, cheering, singing some dancing in the street in celebration of that loss. Because of course, this has been tied somewhat to the political climate in Iran to the ongoing protest movement. The team perhaps seen as a public facing representation of the regime and its institutions. But of course, the team itself has also faced pressure from the Iranian regime as we've learned from a source working closely on the security of the games. The team members as well as their family members and loved ones back at home in Iran faced threats from the Iranian regime against any signs of protest or dissent shown during the games, because of course, we did see the players and their first opening match against England, declining to sing the national anthem, that changed their second and third match where they did sing the national anthem. This, reportedly according to the source after meetings with officials and representatives from Iran security apparatus, essentially warning them not to misbehave, not to refuse to sing the national anthem and not to take part in any action that could be seen as a sign of solidarity with protesters at home in Iran. And we have seen other athletes who have competed overseas facing pressure from the regime in the past. The question now is how these players will be treated by the regime, by the security forces and also, of course, how they'll be received by the Iranian people. Rosemary?",
