So far, hundreds more suspects have been questioned. Well, the fighting continues. America's top diplomat is on another tour of the Middle East. Secretary of state Antony Blinken, arriving in Saudi Arabia moments ago and will later head to Egypt. He is said to meet with senior leaders to discuss what he calls the, quote, \"right, architecture\" for lasting regional peace. And he's also expected to visit Israel this week. The stop was not initially on his schedule. Our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward is following all these developments from London. Kylie Atwood is at the State Department tracking these latest efforts at diplomacy by the secretary of state. Kylie, I'm going to bring you in first on this.

Of course, the ongoing efforts to release those hostages. And also to discuss the defeat of Hamas and, of course, lasting peace in the region. That is the focal point for the secretary in his conversations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and he will, of course, bring those conversations, what he learned in those conversations, developments from those conversations with him to Israel. But notably, he's also stopping in Israel just a few days before a group of Israeli officials are expected to come to Washington. And that is the result of an invitation for President Biden in a conversation with Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, earlier this week, because they are going to be discussing a potential operation in Rafah. Of course, Israel has been saying for some time now that they're going to go ahead with that operation. But the national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said very clearly this week that there should not be a ground operation in Rafah. The Israelis should not put civilians at risk. And what they want to do in this meeting with Israelis next week is discuss what the options could look like for carrying out an operation that the U.S. would effectively sign off on. Now, the problem here is that it doesn't seem like the Israelis are walking into this meeting, ready to actually look at a whole host of options, because we heard from prime minister Netanyahu after that phone call with President Biden, saying that an operation in Rafah would require a ground operation. So will have to watch and see how those conversations go. But secretary Blinken sort of laying the foundation for continued engagement with Israel next week in this visit on Friday.",

Overnight, Ukraine's drones attacking the Russian town of Engels, the area which is in the Saratov region. It's home to a key aviation base for the Russian armed forces. No casualties have been reported. Seven crew members rescued from a capsized South Korean flagged tanker have now died. Two others were rescued from the stricken vessel. One is alive. The condition of the other remains unknown. A search for two missing crew members continues off the coast of Japan's Matsuri (ph) Island. A new study is predicting the global fertility rate will decline in the decades ahead and that will make the population shift dramatically. The new study in the journal, \"The Lancet,\" predicts that, by 2050, more than three-quarters of countries just won't be able to keep a population over size and over time. In the year 2100, they say 97 percent of countries will face this drop in population. Researchers say it is because of better access to contraceptives and also female education to reduce the birth rates.

If you consider just in 2022 there were $91 billion worth of metals in theseelectronics that instead of being recycled and resold and reuse, were just being thrown away --  $91 billion. And that includes $15 billion worth of gold. So if proper recycling regulations were put in place -- they do not exist in the United States; only about 80 countries or so have e-waste recycling regulations. India and the European Union are among those as well. But just giving people an incentive to tap into these things, realizing the value that's being tossed into the waste bin as these devices, everything from e-cigarettes to laptops to cell phones, to vacuum cleaners. There's value in these. And it takes just a mindset shift among consumers and manufacturers. But unlike, say, single-use plastics, which there's no real market for and it's going to take a global treaty to really crack down on, this is a place where it can make sense and get us closer to a circular economy where less mining is needed.
