And what you want to remind the jury is, remember what we said in our opening, and remember what the burden we embraced. We're now here to say we've met our burden.Here's what I would focus on. Circumstantial evidence. If they rely on Michael Cohen's credibility, or Michael Cohen period, they're going to lose the case. They have to use Michael Cohen as sort of affirmation of what the circumstantial evidence entails. And it's very simple. They wanted a catch and kill of Karen McDougal and specifically Stormy Daniels. And that was going to destroy their campaign if it came out, Stormy Daniels. They have to connect those false invoices to that act of catching and killing the Stormy Daniels story. I represented Keith Davidson, her old attorney. So I am very familiar with the timeline from October 24th to October 28th. It's actually very devastating, the calls, the texts and all that. So they have to remind the jury that yes, Michael Cohen was important, but we could prove our case or come close if you will, without him because of circumstantial evidence and common sense. Last thing I want to say is this, the defense did not have to put on a case. They did not, but that they did. And they ended with a categorically horrible witness, Mr. Costello, that corroborated Michael Cohen. That was very bad for the defense. And I would remind them of that in my rebuttal, not in my initial closing.",

Who picked that surgeon for 10 years? Who chose Michael Cohen? Members of the jury, when we have a conspiracy, we don't get to pick angels, nuns, priests, rabbis.We pick the people whom the defendant picked, and he chose Michael Cohen to do the surgery on his Stormy Daniels deal. He chose Michael Cohen to do the HELOC, the fake bank loan. He chose to give Michael Cohen hand deliver in the Oval Office $235, 000 checks. We're not here because of our choice. We're here because of Donald Trump's choice. That is beyond a reasonable doubt.",

TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA: When Joe Biden comes to Minnesota, he brings jobs, money, investments, and a positive message. When Donald Trump comes, it's grievances and revenge. So I think the issues will start to clarify themselves.

But when I'm at these rallies and talking to people, I mean, person after person after person tells me that they wish that groceries were cheaper, that they wish that gas was cheaper, that they feel like their lives were better. And I know again, that these polls are showing that people -- some people in these swing states are feeling like their personal, you know, economics are better, but the people I'm talking to don't feel that way.

It was only in February that the president traveled to Dover Air Force Base to be with grieving families as their loved ones remain were returned after being killed in a drone strike in Jordan.
