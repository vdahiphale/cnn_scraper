In exchange, Israel would free about 150 Palestinians in Israeli custody. Earlier today, President Biden sounded confident this deal would get done.",

Lee at the White House.M.J., you have been doing some remarkable reporting on the contours of this deal, including just in the past couple of hours what we're hearing from inside the administration as they are waiting for this deal to be finalized, hoping, of course, that that happens. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and Dana, keep in mind there's no playbook for how everything would unfold once a deal is agreed upon. There's no precedent for how everything would unfold. But the White House has laid out some of the broad strokes of how they be believe things would unfold once the hostages are released. First and foremost, there would need to be safe passages that are established so that people can physically get out safely. You can see how a pause in the fighting would have everything to do with that. And then the hostages would need to get medical attention. That goes without saying that we cannot imagine the conditions that these people have been under for many weeks now. We don't know about the status updates, the status of their health updates. We've just gotten very little information about any of that. And for any of the dual citizens in the mix, they would be repatriated to their home countries, if that's what they wanted, so they could finally be reunited with their families. Then for any U.S. citizens that are in the mix, of course, the State Department would be very closely engaged and making sure that they get the help that they need, they get to where they want to go in terms of being reunited with families and potentially returning back to the states. On that point, we still just have very little information. We don't know exactly what to expect about how many Americans may be in the mix in that initial 50 hostages that are expected to be released. This is a question that I posed to President Biden directly several hours ago. He really didn't want to get into the details. All we know right now, is that U.S. officials are feeling hopeful that 3-year-old Abigail Hassan (ph) will be in the mix of the 50 hostages. Again, beyond the 3-year-old toddler, we don't know. Officials here are saying that as far as the release is concerned, this is a process that is going to be incredibly complex and it could take hours if not days for all of that to unfold.",

It's been increasing from within his own party. The pressure is coming from various sides and various angles. There are some, who really since the beginning of the Israel retaliation, have been calling for a ceasefire. Initially the president said we're not even going to do that. In fact, not initially, even to this minute, he's saying no ceasefire. Then the question is, if there's a pause, how long is the pause? Then there's also a question that he's fielding from Congress, which they'll be dealing with next week when they come back. Which is, will there any aid to Israel, which, not that long ago, was a given that how do you bring aid to Israel, which would be -- not unanimous but certain bipartisan and not with strings attached. And you're hearing more and more of a call for that. So, it is incredibly complicated. But everybody I speak with inside the White House say that the person who is the most steadfast on supporting Israel. And supporting whatever Israel thinks that it needs for nothing short of its existence, which, if Hamas stays in place and is successful, it would mean the eradication of Israel. Not to sound too dramatic, but that's what we're talking about -- (CROSSTALK)",

And the conversations that are happening, and where Becky is in Qatar, is so key. They are the linchpin not just for the critical conversations and negotiations to get civilian hostages who are being held and have been for 45 days, including a toddler who is an American citizen.
