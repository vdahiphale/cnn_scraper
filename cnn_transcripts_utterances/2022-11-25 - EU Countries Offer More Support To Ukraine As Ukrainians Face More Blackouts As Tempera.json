We are live for you in Zaporizhzhia with the very latest. Then, another dramatic day at the football World Cup as Iran beats Wales and the host nation, Qatar, is eliminated. Now, all eyes turn to England versus the United States. Plus, I'll be speaking to a former Kurdish freedom fighter as angry protesters continue to swirl across Iran. But first, Ukraine's European allies are trying to prevent Russia from using Winter as a weapon of war.   EU countries are pledging hundreds of transformers, generators and other equipment to help restore power as well as heat in Ukraine. Millions of people there are still shivering in the dark after Russian missile strikes devastated critical infrastructure this very week. But officials have been racing to restore power, and say Kyiv should have normal electricity coverage by this time roughly tomorrow. The Winter, of course, is just beginning. And these types of attacks almost certainly won't be the last. NATO Secretary-General is slamming Russia's tactics. This is what he said earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  Is that President Putin is trying to weaponize Winter and by indiscriminate and deliberate attacks on cities, on civilian infrastructure. He tries to deprive the Ukrainians of gas, heating, water. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Although, frankly, the population here has got used to the fact that this power station is under Russian control is in a state of permanent threat. But more widely, what they are enduring here and everywhere else in the country is this Putin attack on the critical national infrastructure, namely the energy capabilities of the country, not to just to generate the energy, but to distribute the energy overwhelmingly, that's electrical energy. But also gas installations have been attacked. Now, the NATO Secretary- General there talks about weaponizing war. Well, that's exactly what you would expect anybody involved in a war to do. The weather, you must try to play to your best advantage. So, it shouldn't surprise anybody that the Russians are going after this critical infrastructure. What is surprising to the Ukrainians, in their view, is that they haven't been given the sophisticated weaponry that they need to defend themselves against these attacks. They are saying, they want patriot missiles. They want the various Israeli anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems have been so effective, particularly around Gaza but elsewhere. They want the latest technology to balance out this overwhelming power that the Russians are able to bring in these repeated swarm attacks either with the Iranian-made low tech drones or with their own very high tech cruise missiles. The hope, though, is that in the end, the Russians might run out certainly of the cruise missiles. They're expensive bits of equipment, and Russia, of course, is under sanctions and may not be able to replace them. But this is a key aspects of the war, and from the Ukrainian perspective, some were eye-rolling response from Europe, sending generators rather than the capacity to actually stop these aircraft and missiles getting through and doing the damage in the first place.

Even -- and I am talking about, force, they threw acid on women's face when they were not in hijab, when the hijab were loose, they'd pin women's hijab on their forehead. They cut lips -- their lips when they were using makeup or lipstick, and they slash them in the streets. They were not allowed to go out, they had to have a company by a very close family or husband. So this was the situation for women. But especially in Kurdistan, when the government did a referendum, say yes or no to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Kurdish people, everyone say no. And it was a reason for government to attack Kurdistan.

Over 10 million people are living without power, water, they're in a complete blackout. The biggest issue, which has been ongoing, is the devastating damage that the -- these airstrikes have caused to the medical infrastructure. They're not really attacking military outposts, they're attacking civilian infrastructure and medical infrastructure. So, the problem that we're dealing with are medics, and doctors, and people like this who are working literally in the dark without heat or electricity. So, we've started a fundraiser for the President's Fund, which is UNITED24 in collaboration with my organization, BlueCheck, to raise money to buy generators so these doctors can continue their surgeries. One story that I heard recently from the field is these guys were operating on an infant girl by flashlight. They performed the first heart -- open- heart surgery in 35 years by flashlight. So, these are incredibly competent professionals. But we just need to make their jobs easier and give them some generators that they can run the machinery that they need to run and have light.",

And for the secondstraight day, China reported its highest number of new COVID cases since the start of the pandemic, reporting more than 30,000 new cases and authorities are responding with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people here are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to that anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building. Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos, which have now been censored in China, show that COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building. However, videos show fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents, and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The video shows smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building, but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. This tragedy really struck a chord with the public here because the scenes of suffering and tragedy have played out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. So many stories of people struggling to get enough food, necessities, and emergency care and locked down. Three years into these harsh policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into protests, which are normally rare in authoritarian China. So last week in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. Then there were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there is no end in sight to zero-COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
