Phil, good morning.You know, this snow is going to drastically change the landscape here in New York City where I'm standing, but also in places along the New England coastline, because we're getting walloped with these really big snowflakes at the moment. And it's almost getting the feeling -- you're talking to some of the locals within Manhattan -- that this is a snowstorm they almost yearned for, because it has been so long since they have seen snow on the ground. It has to go back to January of 2022 when the last time a winter storm warning was issued for this city. And we actually may receive so much snow today that it will be more than what we've received in the past couple of years. In fact, we may see so much snow in just one hour's time, coinciding with rush hour traffic this morning, than what we've seen in any given day within the past couple of years. So it's going to change drastically changed the landscape. We've got a temperature right now. You can see just underneath the Nordstrom sign there, 33 degrees big fat snowflakes. There have been over 700 salt trucks already deployed across the city before the first flake even fell. And I want to show you the graphics, because this is really important. The snow actually came earlier than anticipated. The National Weather Service had thought that there would be more rain associated with the system on the early onset of the storm. That's not the case. So that could potentially up our snow totals here in New York City, for instance. This snowstorm, as we zoom in a little bit closer towards New York, having a tough time seeing that transition in Philadelphia. So there's rain right now. But do anticipate that, to change the snowfall by later this morning, you'll get a couple of inches of snowfall there, as well. The winds, the other factor. Heavy wet snow. We call this heart attacks snow because of that moisture content. You can almost squeeze out the water from this. It is very heavy. It is very dense, very wet. So be careful if you have to get outside and shovel it, because it is very, very difficult and could be very, very strenuous, as well. Water temperatures just off the coast here, a major factor in what type of weather we're getting. So the coastal areas maybe not as much snow, but as you just work your way inland by a couple of miles, you get that heavy wet snowfall here. So we're dealing with one of the warmest winters on record across many Northeastern cities. This is going to change the landscape, perhaps welcome for some.",

More Senate Republicans seem like they're going to reject this, Phil.It includes 60 billion to Ukraine, 14 billion to Israel, 9 billion in humanitarian assistance, 4 billion to the Indo Pacific. Now, as for the House. In telegraphing his next moves, Mike Johnson. He's already signaling that this is dead on arrival in the lower chamber. He said he won't put this foreign aid supplemental on the floor, because it is silent -- Those are his words -- on provisions on the Southern border. He again repeated that America has to secure its own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world. But as you all know, he rejected a bipartisan bill where Democrats made significant concessions on immigration. So all this to say right now, despite what is happening in the Senate, more than $95 billion in foreign aid, it remains uncertain. What we saw in the last few days is a number of Trump allies, really forcefully pushed back against their leader, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the passage of this bill. Among the loudest voices in Congress opposing this foreign aid, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Let's listen to his objections here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH): The United States Senate has deprived them of the debate and why. You know, I don't know why. I think maybe the reason why we are pushing this so quickly is because a few of my colleagues are desperate. They are desperate to get to Munich next weekend and tell the leaders of the world that, yes, they did not secure their own Southern border, but they did the most important thing they got the $61 billion to Ukraine.

He's done what he needs to do to not have his case get back onto the path to trial. But what is happening before the Supreme Court right now, Phil and Poppy, is that Trump is waiting and hoping that this will delay, delay, delay further so that he doesn't get back on the path to trial with this federal case, January 6, related to his actions after the election before Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C. But it's all going to be up to the Supreme Court and how fast they want to look at this application to keep his case on hold if they want to address the bigger questions of presidential immunity and if they resolve this quickly.
