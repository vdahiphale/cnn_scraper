A resident was able to capture this as tornado sirens began to blare.The destruction here is widespread. Emergency services say up to 100 homes were damaged as winds whipped through the area, tearing down trees, collapsing roofs as well. Several schools were forced to close today as emergency crews begin their cleanup efforts. We have CNN meteorologist, Chad Myers, here with more. This was extraordinary, something you do not really see in this area.",

Roofs completely destroyed. Three tornadoes over the weekend. Two in Florida and one in Virginia Beach. Here comes the storm. There goes the weather, across Virginia Beach, moving from the southwest to the northeast. This is what happened. Temperatures were very, very warm. Humidity was warm. All of a sudden, a cold front came through and spun these tornadoes up. This one here in particular. There's only been four tornadoes in Virginia Beach since 1900. The biggest being an EF-2 or F-2 at the time. And this was a three. So the largest since 1900 or at least equal to it. Because remember, we changed the scales from \"F\" to \"EF\" scales. But we're in the middle now. We're in the middle of tornado season. Right there. That's the peak coming up here. And we will see more weather coming up. But not this week. Just cold weather coming up this week. No real threat of tornadoes when you have temperatures that are in the 40s and 50s -- Brianna?",

Flooding the main concern right now.A slow-moving swell triggered by a massive snow melt up north, it's now pushing down the Mississippi River. Flood warnings in place all the way from St. Paul to just north of St. Louis. Parts of downtown Davenport, Ohio (sic), that's what it's looking like there - Iowa, rather, under water. The city saw flooding after the river broke through a temporary barrier back in 2019. But a crest, the high point of the waters, is expected sometime today. That could exceed 21 feet, which would rank in the top-10 historic crests. We're always breaking history records with weather lately. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is in Davenport, Iowa. Adrienne, what are you seeing there? It's wet. It's deep where you are. Any relief coming?",

On Friday, I could see the street. That is not the case today. River Drive looks like a river, literally. And folks have been coming by to take pictures. Above, you will see a bridge. There's a bunch of people up there snapping photos. And we've even seen some kayakers floating along River Drive. We'll tell you about the kayakers in a moment. But first, I want to talk about the business owners. We spoke with some business owners who said history has been their best teacher. Over the weekend and throughout last week, they put up a temporary wall and sandbags. They believe those sandbags are holding. By contrast, the owner or manager of a local restaurant, which is about one block away from the river, told us she expects at least $40,000 in damages. That's an ugly situation for her. But some people are finding beauty in the situation -- Jim?",

Texarkana police cleared this field in Spring Lake Park after they said an 18-year-old from Texas A&amp;M, Texarkana, was struck in the chest by a stray bullet from a nearby shooting. He was in the bullpen area at the time. The player underwent emergency surgery and is listed in stable condition. The CDC will soon stop tracking the spread of Covid-19 at the community level. Instead of the color-coded tracking system, the agency will keep tabs on infection mainly through hospitalizations in some areas. The end of the nation's public health emergency next Thursday means the government can no longer require labs to report Covid data. And more angry protests in France over the government's decision to raise the national retirement age to 64. A CNN team on the ground saw demonstrators shoot fireworks and other projectiles at police, who responded with tear gas as they were retreating. Dozens of protesters were detained. Boris?",

CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been following this story. Jeremy, Title 42 allowed the Biden administration, and before that the Trump administration, to quickly expel migrants who cross the border. Now that it's ending, there's something like 35,000, 36,000 migrants reportedly waiting in cities across the border to across. What is the Biden administration going to do?",

And this is a daily event, many times a day. We are learning as well that a U.S. Marine was killed on the outskirts of Bakhmut just last week. The mother of Cooper Harris Andrews said he was killed by a mortar. Sadly, his body has not been recovered yet. The mercenary Wagner group has been doing most of the fighting for Russia there. Its leader is threatening to pull out, saying that Moscow has stopped supplying his forces with ammunition. That threat comes as the Kremlin has fired the military leader in charge of supply lines for the forces in the east. Ukraine says it is now fully prepared to launch a counter-offensive. Of course, it's not saying when or where that counter-offensive will take place. For now, Russia is still launching attacks across the country, many of them targeting civilians. Officials say that overnight missile strikes injured at least 34 people. CNN's Nic Robertson is in the capital, Kyiv. Nic, of course, Ukraine is not going to tip its hand as to where and when it's going to launch this counter-offensive. They do have high hopes. This, despite the fact that Russian forces are well dug in, in the east. Tell us what we know about these preparations and just what kind of fight we should be prepared to witness now.",

So there's literally a wall of men to go through.One of the things that's been holding the Ukrainians back is the poor weather. It's been sunny the past few days. That will help get a counter-offensive going and give it some momentum. But when Russia speaks about hitting its targets here, as it's claiming to do with those missile volleys fired at Kyiv and other parts of the country, that doesn't stack up. Nothing hit here in Kyiv. Further south, as you say, 34 civilians were wounded, five of them children. But as we saw in Uman on Friday, the reaction and the resolve of the community is so strong.

Anya (ph), 15-years-old, is paying respects to her near neighbors. \"So many innocent children died,\" she says. \"I'm so sorry they're not alive anymore.\" More than a day after the apartments destroyed, recovery winding down, 25 dead, six of them children. Victoria (ph) points to where her father lived. (on camera): I think this one with the blue wall here? (voice-over): She lists all the neighbors who are now dead. On the ninth floor, a grandma, her daughter, and two great-grandchildren. On the eighth floor, a father and son. On the seventh floor, a mother and daughter, my best friend. And on the sixth floor, a young couple, both 30. Her father survived. \"It was a miracle,\" he says. \"They rescued me with a ladder. And people gave me clothes.\" Victoria (ph) shows us documents, a letter to her now dead friend, the photo of another neighbor. She tells us she found them blowing in the wind. \"They're so important,\" she says. \"They're all that's left.\" (on camera): The recovery is painstakingly slow. The wait for answers about the missing just as painful. But in all the grief there is humanity. And there is anger.
