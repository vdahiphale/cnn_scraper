She delivers a speech in Charleston, South Carolina. We are standing by to hear what she has to say. This, of course, follows Super Tuesday. On the Republican side, Donald Trump won everything except for Vermont. Nikki Haley won there. On the Democratic side, President Biden won everything but American Samoa. Someone no one has ever heard of won there by like eight votes.This is changing the structure of this campaign going forward. This now is historic. This is the first time you've had a rematch in a presidential campaigns since Dwight Eisenhower in Adlai Stevenson. This could be the first time that a former president ever serves non- consecutive terms. If Donald Trump manages somehow to win, he's be the first president to do that since Grover Cleveland. We are now in this historic territory. And add to that this announcement coming in the next few hours from Nikki Haley that she is dropping out of the campaign, and we do not expect her to endorse anyone. So as of this morning, we are in the Nikki Haley phase of the campaign where both Donald Trump and President Biden are trying to reach out to her voters explicitly. The Biden campaign already out with a memo that seems to give some ideas of how to do that. Let's get right to the ground in Charleston, South Carolina.

      "sentences": "Yes, John, and Biden campaign officials I've spoken with have long believed that Super Tuesday would be the moment that this race crystallizes in the minds of voters between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And the latest proof point they got in that argument is the fact that Nikki Haley is expected to withdraw from the GOP race this morning.And one task ahead and for the Biden campaign is trying to tap into those Haley voters who have been turned off by Donald Trump. Also, those donors who may not want to donate to Trump, and they believe there could be a universe of donors that could start to give to Biden as well. And senior campaign officials really spoke to that in a memo last evening as they painted the former president as a damaged and unpopular candidate. The two women leading the campaign, Jen O'Malley Dillon and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, laid out their assessment of the Super Tuesday results, and in it they noted, quote, \"a significant share of moderate and Haley voters across the country are saying that Trump cannot count on their votes in a general election.\" And that is something that will be key for the Biden campaign heading into November, trying to peel off support from those Nikki Haley supporters, trying to win over more moderates, more suburban, especially suburban women. The campaign has long believed that reproductive rights is an issue that will work to their advantage and one that will damage of the former president. And the campaign also believes that they have a lot of money to work with, that President Biden has a significant cash advantage at this time over the former president. That could certainly narrow as this race proceeds as it did back in 2020. But they believe that they have a lot of runway right now, the resources, the time, the money to make the case to those undecided voters, to moderate voters. But of course, President Biden is facing challenges of his own. He has to keep together that 2020 coalition as we've seen some narrowing of support in groups, for instance, such as black men. There's also discontent within the Democratic Party when it comes to his handling of the conflict in Gaza. And then those persistent questions about the president's age. But really, there's this three-day span, Super Tuesday and then the State of the Union address tomorrow that are pivotal for the Biden campaign. The president tomorrow will really have his biggest platform so far in this campaign to tout his accomplishments and offer his vision for a second term as he's trying to convince voters to reelect him to the White House.",

I think it would resonate with people. I'm pretty confident, I've known her most of my political life, that she'll be a team player, that there will come a time, and I hope sooner rather than later, where she realizes this is not her moment.

And so I would expect you're going to see Ambassador Haley endorse. It probably won't be right away. It's been pretty contentious and personal the last few days.

There were four of them. The New York Times/Siena College Poll got the most press had Trump up four, but it was matched by a CBS News/YouGov poll that also had Trump up four. Fox News, Trump up two; Wall Street Journal, Trump up two, and as I mentioned, when we started, the polls right now look so much different than they did in 2020, because keep in mind, Trump led in not a single -- there were zero -- count them -- zero general election polls nationally that Trump led in during the 2020 campaign. Here, we have four right here, and I want to bring this to your attention because I think this is so interesting. Okay. Has Trump committed serious federal crimes? This is among likely voters. Overall, the majority say yes, yes, he has. Yet Trump is leading in that poll by four points, as you see that New York Times/Siena College poll up there. Why is that?
