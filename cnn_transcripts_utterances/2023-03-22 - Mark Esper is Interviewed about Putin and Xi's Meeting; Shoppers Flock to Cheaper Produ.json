And Chinese assistance could help. That said, if they did, it would strategically, I think, change the game between the United States and hopefully our European partners, which is one of the issues I'm talking about here with regard to our willingness collectively to sanction China, financially, economic and -- economically and otherwise for making such a move.",

That didn't make much sense given what's happening now in Ukraine. So, I think providing them either current models or, you know, the Marine Corps has turned in its tanks, I think we can -- we should be able to get them Abrams tanks within a matter of weeks.I think what is happening is this, Kaitlan, the Ukraine's are trying to assemble a counter offensive that would happen sometime in April or May, which is just a few weeks away. And to do so, they need that heavy armor, accompanied by fighting vehicles, to really punch through these Russian lines and push the Russians out of eastern Ukraine.

That means going to cheaper brands, cheaper products for groceries. Maybe that means getting regular fruit and vegetables instead of organic. For electronic, that could mean getting the TV that has the best deal instead of the one that has all the best features.And, you know, we've heard about this trend anecdotally, but these new numbers from Adobe, shared first with CNN, really put an exclamation point on how this is playing out online where it's actually easiest to price shop. So, Adobe found that across all 11 ecommerce categories, the lowest priced goods are gaining market share, and the highest priced ones are losing. So, for example, let's look at groceries. In early 2019, the lowest priced tier of groceries had about a third of the market. But look at that. Today, now half of the market. Same things playing out for personal care products, like shampoo and perfume and cologne. In 2019 the lowest priced goods had about a quarter of the market for personal care products. Now it's about 50 percent of the market. So it's doubled. Clearly these trends show that because of high inflation, you know, Americans have just become a lot more price conscious.",
