We discuss the raging conflict over the war with writer Jonathan Freedland and academic Mona Siddiqui. Then, superpowers face-to-face. My conversation with the U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on the high stakes upcoming Biden Xi meeting. Plus, author Emily Tamkin talks to Michel Martin about her essay, \"What Should American Jews Do With Our Fear?\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. No milk for babies, no food for patients, and no fuel for lights or incubators. Gaza's health system is crumbling under the weight of war, as Israel says, it's going deeper into the territory. Battles rage around two main hospitals. The director of the largest, Al-Shifa, says the situation is catastrophic and that all essential units have collapsed. He says about 7,000 people are sheltering there along with 1,500 patients and staff. But Israel alleges that Hamas command centers are housed beneath it with a U.S. official now telling CNN much the same. They are charges that Hamas and doctors there deny. Nada Bashir has more on the desperate situation in Gaza hospitals. And of course, warning some of these images are hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voiceover): These other sounds of the final gasps from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza City working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now, this chorus of frantic voices seen here working under torchlight tells its own gut-wrenching story. The Al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza has now collapsed. The hospital no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip. The vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah says, and those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There was a direct injury in the head, internal bleeding, and we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury. It needs an urgent surgery, a life-saving one. He is less than a-year-old. BASHIR (voiceover): Remarkably, this baby survived, but his father, who was in the very same building when an Israeli airstrike hit did not. At Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, officials say newborn babies had to be moved and that at least three babies in the neonatal unit died after generator-powering incubators was damaged in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The IDF regularly says it is targeting Hamas, but doctors here say the hospital is now completely surrounded.",

And today, a dramatic government shake up. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak fired the divisive Home Secretary Suella Braverman for making inflammatory comments about those marches. While in Paris this weekend, over 100,000 people took to the streets against antisemitism. Hate and division have flared since October 7th, making any discussion about this war extremely fraught. So, here to discuss is \"The Guardian\" columnist Jonathan Freedland and academic Mona Siddiqui. Welcome, both of you, to the program. Can we just start with -- I mean, it is a humanitarian catastrophe, as our Nada Bashir has reported and so many others. Gaza is a catastrophe for those in the hospitals, those who are -- you know, looks like exodus all over again. But the outside world is having a really hard time even trying to talk about it. Jonathan, what do you make -- for instance, let's just take the march in London this week. Pro-Palestinian. Many say pro -- you know, pro-peace, pro-ceasefire. And yet, a key minister who's now been fired, really generated a lot of division and hate over that.",

      "sentences": "She did. I mean, she was reacting to the presence within a march that is overall committed to a ceasefire,exactly as you say. The presence there of some banners, some slogans, some placards, which were off that message. And which were attacking or using age-old antisemitic imagery or language or making, you know, offensive comparisons with, for example, an image of a Star of David morphing into a swastika, so taking the most sensitive, chapter in Jewish history and deploying it against Jewish sensitivities. So, she was taking those elements and saying that therefore is the whole of the march, which I think is wrong and unfair to have done that. I mean, obviously there are a lot of people that are marching simply because they look at the kind of images we've all just seen just now and say, I want that to stop. And therefore, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a hate march. You may say that's naive. That's not the whole story. But it's not necessarily hate. And then -- and what she then went on to say was that the police are picking favorites, that was a divisive thing to say. And she all but did a sort of coded message to the far-right to then come out onto the streets. And you had a situation where British Jews were watching it, thinking, we've got people here who are, on the one hand, holding placards that frighten us, and we're being, as it were, defended by people who we think are far-right fascists who hate Jews as well. So, Jews were nowhere to be seen. There were just these two sides sort of saying things and arguing about Jews, which made British Jews who were staying away and feeling frightened at home feel even more frightened and feeling squeezed in between.",

You've seen the interview, that clip that's gone around. We would do it again, a second, third, fourth time. If you're up against an enemy that will do that, and they're planning it from underneath a hospital, what exactly is Israel meant to do? And Macron was part of that consensus that said, you know, Joe Biden and the others, we get it, you're in this terrible position. He broke from that. It's tempting to say that he broke from that for the reason that a lot of politicians are getting nervous around the world, which is they have constituents, voters, who feel bound up with this conflict. I mean, there are Jews who obviously feel intimately bound up with Israel and its fortunes even if they oppose the government and have opposed it for decades, they want an Israel to exist as a refuge, as a place of safety against antisemitism. And on the other hand, you have Muslims -- and I was speaking to a Muslim writer just today who said, you've got to understand that Palestine is one of the issues -- few issues, perhaps even in some ways the only issue, on which all the world's Muslims agree and have in common. They are not -- they don't necessarily, of course, all agree, but they are bound by that. So, you've got voters in all these countries who feel strongly about it. It's not a foreign issue for the community I'm part of or the community that Mona is part of, I would guess, it feels much more real and more intimate than that.",

I think it'sa very good phrase and I think what it would lead to, I would hope, is for people to think you could be on both the pro-Palestinian march, for example, and that march against antisemitism. There should be no contradiction between them. Similarly, you should be able to be on a pro-Palestinian march and be on a march to bring home those hostages, 240 Israeli hostages. Instead, these vigils, these marches, have been separate. Now, I know lots of Jews feel they can't comfortably go on those pro-Palestinian marches because they hear, for example, this chant, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. And they hear in that, even if it's not intended, from the river to the sea, meaning all of Palestine, there is no room for an Israel. Israel is 9 million Jewish people. It's the largest Jewish community in the world. That's what they hear. And I know that not every protester means that necessarily. But if we could shed some of those -- for example, I've mentioned the antisemitic placards, the chants from that protest, you could see a situation. I think it would require moral imagination and leadership, your word from before, to have people saying, let's do both. Let's march against antisemitism and for the people of Palestine, and I would say, the people of Israel and the hostages. They're not actually in contradiction. I think, you know, Mona and I have showed just now, we were agreeing on almost everything, but unfortunately, there are people who do want to drive wedges and divide.",

And my concern is what's going to happen next. I mean, we can talk about chants and marches and everything. I think those will continue. My real concern is the temperature is going to rise if we don't have a plan for what's coming next. Because at the moment, the Israeli government is constantly saying it's doing everything. because it's going after Hamas. Even if we believe that, and I'm slightly doubtful, I think a lot of people are, that that justifies everything, but even if we were to believe that, what is going to happen next?

The Israeli public opinion turning against him, saying this happened on your watch, that this is in a way a result of a 15-year policy of his, which was to build up Hamas at the expense of those on the Palestinian side who were ready to reach across, shake hands and do a deal. He didn't want that because he didn't want the compromise that's involved. It will eventually, I think, have to be the thing he said he doesn't want to do, handing over to some other authority, if Hamas is taken out of the picture. And no other authority you can think of, whether that's the Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas or Arab nations. will go anywhere near it, unless there is a promise from Israel, more than a promise, action from Israel to end the settlement project, the expansion on the West Bank. That is going to be the trade off, I think. And I think there will be many Jews in Britain and elsewhere around the world who would be relieved to see that, because they have for a long time wanted to see two states, side by side, secure Israel alongside a free Palestinian State. You cannot get that unless you have some compromise on the West Bank and dismantling settlements and so on, a pull out there. So, I think what he's saying there is partly for political consumption, but I don't think he's necessarily going to be part of this story.",

I think at the moment, what we want to see is less of the killing. What we want to see is -- Israel has the upper hand. Israel will have to -- the Israeli government. The Israeli government will have to compromise on something that shows the world that they are ready to make peace, that they are ready to give the Palestinians something in return for a compromise. And I think largely the compromise will still be on the Israeli government's terms. But for me, living as, you know, distant from all this, I feel that what we don't want is for what's happening there to so destabilize the communities that live side by side, and actually very meaningfully in many ways, in European societies, that there is no turning back.

And when you see that at a very young age and you experience that at a very young age it really, I think, can help shape your identity in a way that's quite defensive and quite reactive. And so, I've always been very proud to be Jewish, but I think for many years as a young person, I really thought of that as being about fighting and standing up to antisemitism. And I still think that that is a part of Jewishness and Jewish identity, but I also think that only defining yourself through other people's hatred and only defining yourself through your fear can be quite limiting and quite reductive.

What is -- what's the right set of politics to have in your own country and with respect to Israel, which for much of the 20th century, supporting Israel was really one pillar of many American Jewish communities? And for younger generations, especially though, not exclusively, that's really been tested in recent years. You know, if you are in your 30s or your 20s, you've really only -- and you're an American Jew, you've really only seen the situation get more violent, right, and more seemingly hopeless. To put it another way, you know, the younger American Jews calling for a ceasefire can couch that argument in Jewish tradition and Jewish values. The people who are saying that they stand with Israel unequivocally, they can also catch that in Jewish history and Jewish values. And to say that either one is not Jewish as opposed to giving your interlocutor the space to make the argument and to have the debate and have the discussion, I think, one, I think it's quite cruel to say that a person who is grieving and warning and angry and afraid isn't Jewish. That they're somehow an imposter in their Jewish grief and their Jewish fear and their Jewish pain. But it's also not an argument, right? Because you're just saying, well, you're not Jewish so your argument doesn't count. You're not actually taking part in the discussion or the debate. You're just saying that your interlocutor isn't real. And I think, you know, there is an American Jewish tradition of doing that, but there are -- I would suggest that that's not the most useful tradition to hold up right now.",

For much of the 20th century, as I said, Israel, really since its founding, butparticularly after the wars in '67 and '73, to be an American Jew, in many American Jewish communities, meant to support Israel. And as the reality on the ground in Israel has changed, many American Jews, particularly of younger generations, have become less comfortable with that. And so, even before October 7th, we were in this moment of push and pull between what has been and what will be and sort of it's a political dispute, it's a generational dispute. Interestingly, for the past -- for much of the past year, because the current Israeli government is so far-right and so extreme and says horrible things, not only about Palestinians, but also about LGBTQ people and reform Jews, but just the largest denomination here in the U.S. and all sorts of other groups, the liberal Jewish mainstream in the United States was becoming increasingly critical of the Israeli government supportive of the pro-democracy protesters. On October 7th, you see these same groups and elected officials come out and just say, I stand with Israel, which I think -- I also wrote about this personally, I think is quite understandable, right? And in that moment, you want to support people who are reeling from an attack. But in the months since, I think the sort of liberal American Jewish mainstream has tried to sort out in a very polarizing moment, right, what what it means to stand with Israel. Does that mean you're supporting the government? Does it mean that you are supporting the government, but saying, OK, now, we need a two- state solution? Doesn't mean calling for Netanyahu's resignation? Does it mean calling for -- does it mean standing with the Israelis who are calling for a ceasefire, right? So, I think we were in a polarized moment before October 7th, but in times of crisis, that polarization is exacerbated. And I think that's what we're seeing in American Jewish politics today.",

It's also a political request. You know, I think there has been much -- many have commented on what a scary moment this is for American Jews, particularly given Jewish history. I think that's completely valid. However, we should also note that we are afforded protections by the state that -- and has not always been the case in American Jewish or in Jewish history. That's a very important distinction. We are not being discriminated against by the state. And so, I think, you know, to hear a member of Congress call for Palestinians to be deported from this country or to hear Islamophobia not be as forcefully denounced by political leaders or by people in the media or of -- you know, I'm a member of the media. So, I'm chastising my own, but -- or generally, you know, it's personal, but it's also political.

I've spoken to people my age or younger who have -- let's say are to my right on some of these issues. I think -- you know, and I think some would say, well, it's about how close they are to Israel. Because, you know, roughly half of American Jews have never been to Israel. And so, if you feel a closer tie to that country -- to the country, if you have friends there, if you have family there, that can also impact your decision. Although, I should say that many of the people I know who are most critical of Israel are critical because they've spent as much time there as they have. We should also note, I mean, there are several factors. So, most American Jews, their families came over in the 19th or 20th centuries, and they're descended from Central and Eastern Europeans, there are also American Jews whose families came over later. So, for example, Persian Jews who escaped Iran or Jews who left the former Soviet Union, they're likelier -- or many are likelier to have family in Israel, and many are closer to their own sort of perceived moment of -- not perceived, their own moment of trauma and departure. And so, the State of Israel looms larger in their Jewishness and their own understanding of self. And so, it's -- I don't think you can point to any one thing.",

I do think that often people -- that often Israelis are far more critical of the Israeli government of what the state is doing than people in the United States. There are two reasons for this. The first is that I think many American Jews see it as, well, it's not my place, right? They're living there, so they can criticize. I'm here, so I should -- I can't. And if I do, it will sort of allow other Americans to criticize Israel. And I think the second thing is that for many American Jews, Israel is -- I want to be careful how I say this, but I do think that for many American Jews, Israel is still an idea as well as a country. And that's not to say that any American Jews who care passionately about it don't have family there, don't spend a lot of time there, don't have friends there, of course, but I do think that there is a tendency in American Jewish politics to speak of an Israel that is somewhat divorced from what's happening on the ground.
