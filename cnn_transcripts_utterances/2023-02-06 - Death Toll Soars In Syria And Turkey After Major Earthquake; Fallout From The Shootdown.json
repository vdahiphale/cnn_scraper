Even just 30 minutes ago, our colleague Eyad Kourdiwho is in the Gaziantep region felt another one that stood out to him as particularly strong there. You've mentioned some of the numbers. They are only going to go up from here by all accounts. President Erdogan said earlier today that they frankly didn't know how many people were still trapped under the rubble at this stage of the game. There are too many disaster sites to possibly even be able to estimate that number. We're talking about more than 2800 buildings by Turkey's count alone that have been damaged. There are hundreds and hundreds more on the Syrian side of the border. And so, you can imagine what the death toll may well end up being. Also consider the rescue efforts now are 14 hours in. You've also had a situation where the weather is changing and not for the better. A cold snap in the southeast and south central part of the country. Much colder than usual there and so people are only able to survive if they are in fact alive under the rubble for so long under these frigid cold conditions. You also had about 4-1/2 hours ago, this second -- technically an aftershock, but really an earthquake all on its own, magnitude 7.5 which is even stronger than the 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey that killed 17,000 people and left about a half a million people homeless at that time. And I just want to play you a piece of video that we're getting from the city of Malatya at the time of that second earthquake. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, in Turkey, we're getting a sense of which buildings are not up to code are not as well reinforced as others. In Syria, you've had a very different situation. You've had more than a decade of Civil War in that country with the infrastructure there being really completely wiped out. Hospitals struggling to cope there. And you have the White Helmets, the Syrian Civil Defense, an organization that we know well from seeing them dig people out of the rubble from bombs and missiles that have struck areas of Syria to try to pull people out of the rubble.

We're getting reports of people feeling it in a mind across the Palestinian territories. But thankfully, at least in this region, there have been no reports of injuries or damage. Just really policing that they received almost 4000 reports after the initial earthquake. And then that really strong aftershocks from just a few hours ago, that actually was felt, especially in northern Israel. There's some videos of people just fleeing buildings, because of that aftershock. It was quite strong. Obviously, people on very high alert. Now in terms of response, the Israelis are saying that -- the military planes with aides will be taking off this evening. And tonight, from what we understand there will be two planes flying out with everything from search and rescue crews and gear to humanitarian aid and basic things to help the people who obviously as you can see have just lost their homes. Have nowhere to really go. If you also think about the fact that places that you might normally go in the, you know, if something happens to your building, let's say a school, a hospital, a mosque, that they are likely damaged as well. And so, as part of this aid that they are bringing, they're bringing things, you know, like tents, like blankets, things can help people -- keep people warm. It is very cool. There is a storm coming through right here. I can tell you it's incredibly windy and cold here in Jerusalem, that same storm front is affecting the area where this earthquake hit. So, we know that those planes are heading to Turkey. Now you asked about Syria, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said earlier today that through diplomatic channels, he didn't say exactly who, they -- the Israelis did receive a request to help Syria and that they did plan to send that along which is interesting, because although Israel and Syria are neighbors, they have no formal relationship. So, if aid has been requested by a third party, we don't know exactly who quite yet. It will be interesting to see if that aid -- if that aid request actually did come through and what the Israelis will be sending. They are neighbors, so it is close by. It's also interesting that other leaders from this region, Qatar, Jordan, UAE have all either spoken with their Turkish counterparts and condolences. And we're seeing pledges of support from Taiwan, to the Netherlands, people are just planning to send of course hundreds of rescuers and as much help as they can, of course, one of the biggest issues is just how to get to some of the stricken areas. I'm from the Israeli military, they may be using, you know, certain types of specialized planes that can land in areas that might not have exactly working runways. Of course, time is of the essence right now just trying to get people there as quickly as possible. Flight time from Israel to this area in Turkey is probably about two hours. So not too long. Just trying to get as many people there as much help there as quickly as possible. And also, with the Syria. It will be interesting to see how that works. You know, if the aid does arrive to Syria from Israel, whether you know, a situation like this can really transcend politics. Becky?",
