The grand jury indictment will be unsealed and we could learn crucial new details about this case. Now, Donald Trump's lawyers claim he may speak in the hallway of the court before and or after today's proceedings, Kate, but we're going to have to see on that.",

Of course, what -- the big question is whether or not he's going to address those charges or just actually continue doing what we have seen, which is calling this a political witch hunt, a hoax. The other thing we're keeping track of is who's going to be in the crowd tonight. We know that the former president has invited GOP lawmakers, allies, surrogates. We are still unclear who among them is actually showing up. And the reason that matters is we have seen so many of these Republicans go full throttle in defense of former President Trump.

It's actually the only legal job where you have an obligation to turn over evidence that's bad for your side. Based on that, the lawyers will bring motions, motions to dismiss. We've already heard Joe Tacopina and other lawyers out there previewing what some of those are going to be. Those have to be briefed, argue decided, and then you'll get a trial date.
