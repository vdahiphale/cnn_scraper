Brand new polling this morning shows Donald Trump narrowly ahead in three critical battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, this after polls last week that showed the opposite, Harris narrowly ahead in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.The new polling from The New York Times and Siena College shows that Trump has a five-point lead in Arizona. In Georgia and North Carolina, it is within the margin of error. In North Carolina, where it is closest, the poll was mostly taken before the controversy surrounding Republican Mark Robinson's campaign for governor. And breaking overnight, his top campaign staffers, they resigned, almost all of them, after a CNN KFILE investigation uncovered Robinson's history of making inflammatory comments on a porn website, and believe me, that's euphemistic. CNN's Alayna Treene is with us this morning. This polling is the first kind of polling good news that Trump has had in a week or so.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I'd actually argue, John, that this polling is some of the best polling we've seen for Donald Trump in the Sun Belt states. As you mentioned, he lost both Arizona and Georgia to Joe Biden in 2020, but these polls showed that he has a lead over Harris for now. I mean, obviously, we still 43 days until the election. But again, this is good news for Donald Trump.Now, North Carolina shows that he only has a slim margin over Harris, notable because a Democrat has not won in North Carolina since 2008. Now, I do just want to note. Touch on your point about Mark Robinson. We actually are going to see Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, travel to North Carolina today obviously amid this Robinson drama. We saw Donald Trump there over the weekend, where he did not mention Robinson or anything involving that. Again, notable in itself, given that all of the past rallies we've really seen Donald Trump do in North Carolina, he has had Robinson there. So, the one thing I just want you to keep in mind when it comes to North Carolina is that when I talk to Donald Trump's team and many of his allies, they note that Robinson was already not doing so great in his own governor's race. But the stakes are very high for Donald Trump because this is a state where Harris is really competing in. She's been to North Carolina several times. She's continuing to try to make a push there. So, you know, we'll see what happens. One thing I want to go back to in these polls, though, is that even though they're showing right now, this is good news for Donald Trump, about 15 percent of the electorate in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina said that they are still undecided. So, that means that essentially these and I think it's important to note that the states are still up for grabs, even though, you know, we've already entered this phase where we are beginning to see early voting in several states. There is still enough time for people to change their minds. So, keep that in mind. But I think overall, the bottom line when I look at this poll is that it's kind of been the same for the last several months now, which is that this -- the nation is still sharply divided and this is going to be one of the tightest elections in recent history. And so a lot at stake, which is 43 days to go.",

But, to another point, I will say, that this lines up with what I hear from Donald Trump's team, that this is really Donald Trump's last stand. He's already done three. He's ran in three elections in the past, and you've heard him actually say kind of alluding to this before, like when he's referenced to Christian voters, for example, that he thinks that they need to vote now, and it won't matter in the future. This is what he's referencing, that this is going to be his last stand this election. But, again, notable because he doesn't often say this, and he's never really admitted this publicly before.

This week, Kamala Harris is also expected to lay out more of her economic vision to voters in a major campaign blitz starting Wednesday in the battleground commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

And that really reifies this argument that the Harris campaign is continuing to make the supporters that they are very much the underdog and have their work cut out for them in the final sprint to November.So, in Arizona, Trump tops Harris 48 percent to 43 percent in a matchup that includes the names of third party candidates who are, in fact, going to appear on the ballot there. In Georgia, Trump holds 47 percent to Harris' 44 percent. And in North Carolina, it stands at 47 percent, Trump to 45 percent. So, there's no clear leader in the race in Georgia and in North Carolina, but that is why we see this aggressive campaign schedule from the vice president. She's going to be in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, followed by Arizona on Friday, and then she'll continue to be out west on Sunday. And they argue that they have the infrastructure in place to outpace Trump ultimately in these key swing states. So, what does that infrastructure mean? That looks like staff on the ground. Now, she's also expected to talk about her economic vision aimed at laying out her vision for the economy. That is, of course, what continues to be the most pressing issue for most voters. And she's also needling the former president about having an additional debate. Let's listen.
