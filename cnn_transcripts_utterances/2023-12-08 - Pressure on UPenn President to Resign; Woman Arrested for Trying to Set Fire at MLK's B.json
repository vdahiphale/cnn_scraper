She has faced scathing criticism since her congressional testimony about anti-Semitism on campus, most notably failing to explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. And now the powerful Wharton Board of Advisors, which leads the university's prominent business school, is calling for a leadership change.CNN national correspondent Athena Jones is following this story from Philadelphia. So, Athena, all of this comes after the school's board of trustees held an emergency meeting Thursday. What more are we learning?",

A couple of audio issues here.But I can tell you some new information that we got from the National Park Service this morning from an historical architect that says thankfully there is no permanent damage to the property here. It doesn't appear that there's any permanent damage. However, there is still a strong odor coming from the property that they are allowing that to air out. And then, of course, a big concern is any sparks. So, they're keeping any potential sparks away from the property. I do also have new information from an Atlanta Police Department via email telling me that this woman that has been charged with attempted arson, that she was transferred first to a local hospital here for a mental health crisis evaluation before then being taken over to the Fulton County Jail. But witnesses here described an extremely shocking scene, seeing a woman, this woman on the porch here of this federal landmark, the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr., where he spent the first 12 years of his life, and then just pouring gasoline all over the porch and on the front door as well. And then we heard from APD that it was thanks to two -- two tourists from Utah that were paying close attention. They saw the woman in action, tried to converse with her, and then interrupted her. And then two off-duty NYPD officers, who chased after her, and pinned her to the ground until officers could arrive there and then detained her. But this was certainly a very close call here. A fireman said that these bystanders, these good Samaritans, saved the crown jewel of Atlanta. Listen to the fire chief. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
