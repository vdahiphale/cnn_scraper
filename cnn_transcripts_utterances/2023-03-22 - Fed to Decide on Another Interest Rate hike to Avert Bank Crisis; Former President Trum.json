Policymakers are set to decide today on another possible interest rate hike while taking care not to spook financial markets or the banking industry.Most economists are predicting a modest quarter point increase. It comes as treasury secretary Janet Yellen is telling the American Bankers Association, the government is ready to step up support. Yellen says the government will guarantee more deposits if the banking meltdown continues. On Wall Street, all three major U.S. indices closed higher on Tuesday. The NASDAQ fared best, gaining more than 1.5 percent. And CNN's Anna Stewart is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Anna. So the big question, of course, what the Federal Reserve plans to do with interest rates to bring down inflation without spooking the markets? A tough call, of course. What can we expect?",

And as we've seen in the last couple of weeks, frankly, confidence is in short supply.Inflation is something the Federal Reserve absolutely has to tackle, but interest rates are affected with a pretty blunt tool. There's always some collateral damage. One of the biggest risks, of course, with raising rates is that you raise them too far too fast, you push the economy into recession. But there are always other implications, and I think what we've seen on the balance sheets of smaller and midsize banks in the U.S. is a great example of this, and I think it took the Federal Reserve slightly by surprise. How many long dated treasuries were on those balance sheets, and how much less they were worth, essentially with each rate hike? That was fine unless you have a bank run, people pulling their money out of banks. Then, of course, those banks have to sell the assets at a loss. And crisis in confidence, that's pretty contagious. The good news is there are other tools to tackle this. We have seen a huge coordinated action from the Federal Reserve with their big loan facility. Also, of course, the U.S. Treasury, who have essentially bailed out uninsured depositors of two failed banks already and as you said in the lead in their Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, saying they would extend that further if they need to do so. And she also said this -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: The steps we took were not focused on eating specific banks or classes of banks. Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system. And similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffered deposit runs that posed the risk of contagion.

If confidence is restored there, if we see an entire bank runs, then the Federal Reserve can actually focus on inflation, which it really needs to do.It's all about confidence. And in that sense, it doesn't really matter what the rate rise is as long as confidence is restored to the banking sector, looking at how treasuries are trading though, I'm looking at that, and I'm thinking its looking pretty much like there will be a rate rise of a quarter of a percent.

But inflation remains high, and it needs to continue on its path to defeat inflation. There is a little bit of an argument for slowing down just to get a sense of what all of this will mean for the real economy.

So, that calculation tells us a lot about what was happening six or nine or 11 months ago. When we look at more recent figures it looks like inflation has come down to say four-point something percent, so definitely not a crisis. The bad news though is, a couple of months ago, it looked like it might have been trending downward. That no longer seems as clear and so what that tells the fed is what it's done so far has not been enough to get inflation on a clear downward trajectory.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: A Federal Judge has ruled that former president Donald Trump used one of his defense attorneys in furtherance of a crime or fraud related to existence of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Sources tell CNN that the ruling from Judge Beryl Howell makes clear for the first time that the Justice Department is arguing that Trump himself may have committed a crime, and George Howell believes that prosecutors have met the burden to require Trump's attorney, Evan Corcoran, to testify to a grand jury, meaning he can't claim attorney- client privilege to broadly decline to answer questions from prosecutors. Sources say Howell, in her sealed ruling, determined that prosecutors were able to show Corcoran's legal services were used in furtherance of a crime. The Justice Department is still seeking Corcoran's testimony after he cited attorney-client privilege as well as testimony from another Trump lawyer, Jennifer Little, CNN has learned. Trump's lawyers have sought emergency intervention from the Appeals Court. Three judges from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals have moved very quickly to respond as they're still considering whether they put the decision from Howell on hold. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One, of course, is economic. This matters undoubtedly more to Russia than it does to China. China is clear will continue to provide an economic lifeline to Russia as it adapts to life under western sanctions, which, of course, show no sign of going away anytime soon. Trade between the two countries already up some 30 percent last year, probably set to grow. Russia promising to increase, in Putin's word, unlimited oil supplies to China. There's a new pipeline in the works. In terms of the second tenant, that is their shared desire, their joint desire to counter western influence, especially if you look at that joint-statement in the Asia-Pacific region. It talks about serious concerns about NATO's continuous strengthening of military security ties with Asia-Pacific countries, serious concerns about the AUKUS partnership between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., especially when it comes to nuclear-powered submarines. And the big question, of course, which we did not get a concrete answer to, which is why this relationship is seen as so potentially dangerous when it comes to the war in Ukraine is, is China actively considering providing lethal aid to Russia?
