But you can see all the NYPD people here, getting ready, getting there sort of, you know, overview of where they're going to be throughout the parade route. We've already seen sanitation trucks blocking some of the streets points of entries to the parade route. We saw an ESU truck just driving.So, a number of measures that we do see, but also, of course, the ones that we don't see. We know ever since this war broke out in the Middle East that New York City has been in a, you know, threatened heightened threat environment. And so, intelligence has said that there has been more, you know, online calls for violence. So, there are people behind the scenes of course working to make sure that this parade goes off without a hitch as they had done for so many years.

Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT said it does a quote very good job of answering customer support questions as well as questions about corporate strategy. And ChatGPT is one of the fastest growing tech products of all time.
