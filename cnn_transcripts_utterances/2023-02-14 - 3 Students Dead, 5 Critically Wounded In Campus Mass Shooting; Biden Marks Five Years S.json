He was getting more and more bitter, angry, and bitter. So angry. Evil angry. He began to really let himself go. His teeth were falling out. He stopped cutting his hair. He looked like a wolf man.CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller is following this story for us, learning some details as well. What are your thoughts about what we've learned so far about this suspect? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, we're learning in small bits today, but one key thing is the letter that was found in the backpack at the time he shot himself. This is a two-page document rambling. It doesn't make complete sense on first reading, but he talks about being angry. He talks about wanting to finish off Lansing. He makes no mention of Michigan State University or the target. He refers to other active shooter cases, one in Colorado, talks about shooting schools in New Jersey says there's 20 of me out there. So, it's a letter that blends some dysfunction, some anger, and some of his own -- some of his own thoughts and disconnection from reality. But it tells us -- if you combine it with what we learned from the father, it tells us this is someone who was -- who was getting more and more unhinged. The backpack, on the other hand, tells us multiple magazines, lots of ammunition, a second weapon that he went out prepared to shoot many more or much more than he did or he was on his way to a second location, and that, we will never know.",

Based on what you heard today, are you as certain that these presented no threat that they were benign? SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI): Well, it's a -- it certainly is the leading theory right now. And you know, one thing though was very clear that I -- want us to be public is that they did not believe that these objects had any weapons, and were any kind of threat to anybody in the United States. There was no, as they say, kinetic, there was not going to be any kind of explosions or bombs on it, so -- and that's what at least the pilots were assessing who were checking out these objects. But the main reason for their concern was their altitude. They're in an altitude that could present a real hazard to commercial aircraft that are operating in that space. And there's no question if a -- if a jet would hit that object and could have serious consequences in that navigation. So, that was the decision for a while to bring them down. But clearly, we're not going to know exactly -- it was clear, we're not going to know exactly what they were until or if we are able to recover any of the debris. And that's looking very difficult. In my state in Michigan, in Lake Huron, you know, Lake Huron is basically an inland sea. It's incredibly deep.

As I got news yesterday and talking to officials, just a horrifying situation that students found themselves with a gunman that opened up going across campus. It is absolutely horrifying. And as students were locked down and parents were scrambling to try to reach their students to find out whether or not they're safe, it is -- it was clearly a nightmare that none of us ever want to confront and unfortunately, many, many folks had to confront that last night.So, you know, I just have -- like, I think most people, certainly, our hearts go out to those families that have been impacted. But there's also just anger. We can't let this continues to happen. We can cap -- let our schools be subjected to these horrible acts of violence. You know about 15 months ago, we had -- Oxford high school had a shooting that traumatized students there. And many of those students are actually attending Michigan State University now. And once again, they went through another mass shooting at a place where they should feel safe at their school. And that's not happening. We need to take action. We need to move forward. I'm hoping certainly the state legislature will likely take some action on a number of gun safety pieces of legislation that should move forward. I support things like red flag laws. I support making sure we have -- we close the loopholes when it comes to background checks. We're still trying to find out more about this perpetrator, this -- the person who was engaged in the shooting to find out exactly what possible motive he could have. I don't know what that would be or what his weapons were.",
