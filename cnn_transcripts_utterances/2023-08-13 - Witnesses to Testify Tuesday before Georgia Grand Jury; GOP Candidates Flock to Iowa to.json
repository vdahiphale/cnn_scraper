CNN previously reported that this was expected in the coming days, but we now know that some of the key witnesses who were subpoenaed to testify were told specifically to show up on Tuesday.

One of those witnesses is an independent journalist named George Chidi, and in 2020, he actually witnessed some of the fake pro-Trump electors meeting in the state house in Atlanta. Another key figure who will head to the grand jury this Tuesday is former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Here is what he told our colleague, Fredricka Whitfield, yesterday about the subpoena. GEOFF DUNCAN (R), FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR:  I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at Fulton County grand jury, and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting the facts. I have no expectations as to the questions, and I will certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me.

We left and ran, just ahead of the flames. We ran over to the harbor, and the flames were coming right behind us. I then put her in touch with a friend and ran her down to prison street, walked her down there. And then I went back to see them fighting the fire a bit more. Jumping in the ocean was not an option for me because at the harbor, the boats were on fire, leaking gas and oil into the water. So the water was on fire.

It comes after officials have been monitoring a steady uptick of migrant families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.So, the Biden administration is requesting about $2.7 billion in funding for border management operations from Congress. That is part of a larger $40 billion funding request from the administration to Congress that would fund key priorities, like Ukraine, like disaster relief, and also the border. Now, a homeland security official tells CNN that this money are part of that $2.7 billion, would go to setting up this new temporary facilities for migrant families to say, as they go through asylum, potentially deportation processes. Now, we know from that homeland security official that this is kind of a new concept here when it comes to families crossing the border, and border management. It would be new facilities that allow families to go in and out of these facilities but they must check in and they must remain overnight. Now, when we talk to officials, they were very quickly quick to say that they not believe this is a family detention program, that the Biden administration and did that in 2021. Instead, they say this was a humane way to deal with migrant families. We know a variable, broad border population as they continue to cross the border after Title 42, that pandemic era policy on migration was lifted earlier this year. Now, to punctuate this point, the homeland security official told CNN, and I want to read you this in a quote, they said this supplemental package would allow DHS to fund temporary housing facilities and services to manage families through immigration process quickly, and facilitate the removal for those who do not have a legal basis to stay. Now, of course, the Biden administration is not the first administration to deal with migrant families crossing the border, but it is currently the one that is in power. So therefore, they are trying to get ahead of this, potentially growing problem and deal with it. And what they call in a humane way. But of course, it could face some contention when it comes to Congress. But we know that migration is an issue that President Biden is judge very intensely on as we head closer and closer to the 2024 election, which he wants to be reelected for -- Amara.",

It was a real period of distrust in this country after Watergate and after the Vietnam War. So I have two main characters who are the kids of the heroes of my first two novels.

So I think what they're noticing is those ocean temperatures are so far above normal that they're thinking that's likely going to be able to compensate for whatever El Nino may try to suppress as we go through the season. So yes, they did increase their numbers. They had previously been 12 to 17 named storms. Now up to 14 to 21. Keep in mind that low end of that new forecast, the 14, that is what we would normally see in a standard season. So it could be anywhere from the bottom, all the way up 21.
