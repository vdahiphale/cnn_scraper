      "sentences": "Good morning. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. This is special live coverage of the funeral of Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on America's highest court. The service over at the Washington National Cathedral is set to start right at the top of the hour.President Biden left Delaware for Washington D.C. earlier this morning. He's set to arrive at the funeral any moment now, we're told. He will be delivering a eulogy, along with Chief Justice John Roberts. O'Connor first met both men back in 1981. Roberts helped O'Connor prepare for her Senate confirmation hearing, where Biden was then the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Justice O'Connor's journey to the U.S. Supreme Court began in 1952, that is when she earned a law degree from Stanford University in only two years. But despite graduating third in her class, her gender kept her from finding a job at a law firm, so she eventually opened up her own law firm. She was mostly unknown before being appointed to the highest court back in 1981. But she quickly became one of the most influential justices of her era. And truly a crucial swing vote on issues like abortion, affirmative action, and the 2000 presidential election. Perhaps her most notable vote, Planned Parenthood versus Casey, reaffirming a woman's right to an abortion. She helped shape the decision that won George W. Bush in the White House in 2000 against Al Gore. And in 2004, she penned the majority opinion on the Bush administration's post 9/11 detainee policy, writing, and I'm quoting her now, \"A state of war is not a blank check.\" Five women have since followed in her footsteps to the highest court in the land. And I want to bring in our team of experts now to discuss. Joan Biskupic, Audie Cornish, Susan Page, Laura Coates, and Gloria Borger. And Joan, you've written a terrific biography of Susan Day -- Sandra Day O'Connor. Tell us a little bit what this day means.",

And I think hurried (ph) the announcement, but they hadn't even done the FBI -- completed the FBI ticket because there was already some opposition building among anti- abortion groups to her nomination, which Reagan not only brushed away, but announced her and brought her to the Rose Garden a week later to meet us all.It was the first time I had seen her, not a name that was familiar, I think, to many of us in Washington before she was appointed.",

She was very concerned -- and Joan, you know this better than anybody, she was very concerned about the way the court was viewed by the American public. And after Bush v. Gore, she even mused at one point, well, maybe that didn't do too much for the reputation of the court. So, you know -- but she was concerned about it.

Whether it's about, you know, conceding in an election or how the hanging chads of the world will be viewed, right? I know it's a flashback to the past. Whether it's about partial birth abortion or any number of issues about gender discrimination in education. I mean, these are things that she sat with, and she and her role was so extraordinary, not because you agreed with everything she had to say or all of her writing, that wasn't the requirement. But the requirement was that she be able to be viewed objectively, to outline her opinions methodically, and to set the precedential value for future justices. And as you said, five others came after her. And I know RBG, we talk about, can sometimes be one to in some ways, respectfully overshadow the career of Sandra Day O'Connor.
