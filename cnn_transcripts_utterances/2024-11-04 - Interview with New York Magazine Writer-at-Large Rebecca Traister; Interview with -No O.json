Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In these final hours of the U.S. presidential campaign, the headlines look a lot like they have all along. Polls suggest a near even race. But could pollsters be missing a critical voting bloc that could determine the outcome of this election again? That question lurks behind this bombshell headline from the Des Moines Register. Kamala Harris leapfrogs Donald Trump to take lead near Election Day. This, in ruby red Iowa. The widely esteemed Iowa pollster, Ann Selzer, says women are driving the late shift towards Democrats. Quote, \"Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,\" is what she concludes. And here's the former first lady, Michelle Obama, speaking in Michigan, warning that when women lose fundamental rights, men lose as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY:  If your wife is shivering and bleeding on the operating room table during a routine delivery gone bad, her pressure dropping as she loses more and more blood or some unforeseen infection spreads and her doctors aren't sure if they can act, you will be the one praying that it's not too late. You will be the one pleading for somebody, anybody, to do something. So, I am asking you all from the core of my being to take our lives seriously. Please. Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians, mostly men who have no clue or do not care about what we as women are going through, who don't fully grasp the broad reaching health implications that their misguided policies will have on our health outcomes. The only people who have standing to make these decisions are women with the advice of their doctors. We are the ones with the knowledge and experience to know what we need. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Women are people. And that should be the very basic bottom line of what we understand. But when you hear what has been coming at us from the Trump campaign rhetorically and also from the American right-wing in terms of its policies, its denial of healthcare to millions of women in so many different circumstances, when you combine that with the language, the -- literally dehumanizing language, the racist and misogynist language that Donald Trump and members of his party have been using in these recent years and getting ever more intense on the campaign trail, sort of culminating with the Madison Square Garden rally that took place the night after Michelle Obama's speech, that core, simple message, that argument that women are people, that their lives have value to the women themselves and to the men who love and live with them. This is such a core moral call that I think is at the heart of how we have seen women organizing now since the Dobbs decision. And in fact, going back to Donald Trump's first win 2016, we have seen women organizing in ways that are pretty unprecedented in American history. And I think Michelle Obama's speech spoke to why that is.",

And I can't speak to whether or not it's going to turn outto be accurate because one of the things -- I think our increasing reliance on polls as predictive in the news media I think is really problematic That's something I've been writing about for years. But it's been -- and I want to say that Ann Selzer is one of the most, if not the single most reliable pollster based on her past record that we have in United States politics. That doesn't mean that I'm saying that what she found is definitely going to be right tomorrow. It would be a shocking result. But I also want to point out that we have been living through years in which there have been a lot of shocking results that are different from the polls that have preceded our electoral choices, especially since Dobbs. I don't know that pollsters have figured out how to poll well since the Dobbs decision scrambled so many people's engagement with electoral politics. And I do believe that that too goes back before Dobbs. There haven't been terrifically reliable -- steam (ph). So, yes, Selzer's poll is an outlier. I -- if it were true, I think it would forecast a landslide in a lot of places besides Iowa, if other patterns are moving that way. I should note that Iowa itself, her poll reflected a massive swing toward Harris and toward the Democrats from a poll that she took this summer. But that in Iowa, a very strict abortion ban went into effect this summer. And living with those results, again, the dehumanizing results of denying women basic health care, obstetric, reproductive care has a real impact on how people understand policy and the weight and import of electoral choices and their votes. So, we will see whether it turns out to be an accurate poll or not. But I will say that I don't see any reason to believe all the other polling is more accurate, the polling that shows it neck and neck or with Trump ahead, because pollsters haven't figured out how to poll in this environment.",

So, I spoke to a Trump supporter, the Texas congressman, Dan Crenshaw. This was last week. This is what he told me about this particular issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  I understand the pitfalls politically, but that doesn't matter to me when it talks -- when we're talking about doing what is right and standing for what is right. And it's not exactly true that this is such a losing issue. Trump's position is widely held by the vast majority of Americans. I mean, any poll that you've seen for the last 20 years shows that about 60 to 70 percent of people think that abortion past 12 weeks, it shouldn't be allowed. It should be illegal. And Trump's position has been to -- actually, to not even do that, but to say that there should be no federal ban and that it should be left to the states.

So, here's what the military told The New York Times, over the years, the closure order was violated by Palestinians, who began building illegally in the area.

So, the judges and the military laws that you have now referred to are all being created by Jewish Israelis while Palestinians are living under military occupation with no ability to influence the laws that control their lives. As you know very well, according to the fourth Geneva Convention, a transfer of population from occupied territory, which is what is happening in Masafer Yatta, is illegal. is illegal no matter what kind of excuse the military can come up with. And to directly respond to the claims, there are secret state documents that 972 Magazine have uncovered and Akevot have uncovered, which show very clearly that the military training ground was designed in 1980, to quote Ariel Sharon, to push Palestinian farmers off of their lands. And 20 percent of the West Bank are these military training grounds and they are used as a tool. They're using the tool to prevent Palestinian from obtaining building permits and to expand the Israeli settlements in the area. Like magically, the military training ground only falls on the Palestinian villages in the area while Israel builds settlements. And all of this is clearly illegal under international law as per the recent ICJ ruling.

And the chances for Palestinians to receive accountability for a settler to be actually indicted and to pay a price is less than 3 percent. For soldiers who attack Palestinians, it's less than 1 percent. And this is not because that the police or the units investigating the army find out that no wrongdoing happened, it's because they fail to investigate, according to them. So, I think, again, I know this is a claim that the Israeli state is making, but I find it to be factually false. There is very, very little accountability. I think accountability cannot come when a military is investigating itself or when a system is, you know, predicated on the dominance of one group over the other.

Like my grandmother was bornin a concentration camp and most of my family was murdered in the Holocaust. And today, like, sadly, anti-Semitism is on the rise. It's on the rise among the right-wing and it's also shamefully on the rise among the left. And because of that, it's very important that this word will not be used to silence real and legitimate criticism of Israel's occupation or of Israel's, you know, horrendous policies all around the land. And when people use this word not only to silence Palestinian critics but also Israelis like me who believe, you know, that what is going on is wrong, they are emptying it out of meaning and precisely because we should care about anti-Semitism, this is even more dangerous. And I think it's literally putting Jewish lives as well in danger.",

It is still looking for a distributor in the United States.Now, Russian politics and the price for those who dare challenge Putin's regime. In April 2022, soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the opposition leader, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was one of many dissidents arrested for speaking out. By chance, he was on his way to an interview with our colleague, Walter Isaacson. Instead, he found himself behind bars. This summer, he was released after more than two years in a prisoner swap that included the American journalist, Evan Gershkovich, of The Wall Street Journal. Kara-Murza sat down with Walter to discuss his personal story and the very unique excuse he had for missing out on their last interview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALTER ISAACSON, CO-HOST, AMANPOUR AND CO.:  Thank you, Christiane. And, Vladimir Kara-Murza, welcome back to the show. VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION POLITICIAN AND 2024 PULITZER PRIZE WINNER FOR COMMENTARY:  Hello, Walter. It's really good to be on your program. And I'm sorry I missed our appointment last time, in April of 2022, but I'm glad I was finally able to make it.",

Tell me what happened. KARA-MURZA:  Well, I was coming home to my Moscow apartment from a meeting. I was driving. So, I was conscious of the interview we had scheduled with you. I was supposed to do this from my apartment in Moscow, the same way by video link. And as I was approaching my house, and I saw the bridge over the Moscow River, I noticed a surveillance car following me in my rear-view mirror. Didn't pay much attention, to be honest with you, because if you're a Russian politician in an era of Vladimir Putin, surveillance is not something that gets you surprised, we get it all the time. So, OK, one more surveillance car. But then as I was approaching my house, my apartment block I noticed a silver minivan with darkened windows standing in that park right next to the entrance. But again, didn't pay much attention because I live in downtown Moscow. It's always busy, always cars around. But as I stopped to press the button to open the gate to go and park in my courtyard, I saw, again, the rear-view mirror of my car, five or six police officers, you know, black balaclava masks on their faces, black uniforms, who got out of that minivan and started running behind my car. So, of course, at that moment, I understood everything. So, I just had time to park my car and text my lawyer that I've been arrested. At that moment, the commanding police officer over my door told me to come and follow them. I saw the phone ringing from -- I guess, from your producers while they were driving me away to the police station, but they seized my phone. So, I was no longer allowed to use them. So, I felt very bad because it was an impolite way to just not turn up to our scheduled interview, but I've had some circumstances beyond my control. So, I hope you'll forgive me for that.",

And yet, youstill went back to Moscow to fight against or protest against the invasion of Ukraine. Why did you feel the need to go back? KARA-MURZA:  Well, how could I not stay at my home? I'm a Russian politician. Russia is my country. A politician has to be with their fellow citizens in their own country. To me, it cannot be any other way. What moral right would I have to call for my fellow Russian citizens to stand up and resist Putin's dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? So, there was never any question in my mind as to leaving Russia. To me, this is a responsibility that transcends any considerations of personal safety and personal comfort. If I'm calling on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to this dictatorship, I have to be willing to do it myself.",

That's against the law.KARA-MURZA:  And to me, it speaks to the fact that there's not enough political will to enforce export controls, to enforce all these compliance rules. They all exist. They're all out there. But we see that there are still glaring holes in these sanctions mechanisms, by the way, not only with regard to sort of these general measures, but also with regard to the personal targeted sanctions that we've just been talking about in relation to the Magnitsky Act. Up until recently, the wife of Putin's deputy minister of defense, while the war in Ukraine is going on, was still living in her apartment in Paris. How is that possible? So, we see that there are still too many holes that need to be addressed in the sanctions mechanism, that they're not effective enough in really pushing against Putin's war machine, against Putin wars -- Putin's war economy, because to me, the goal of these sanctions should be to make it more difficult and ideally impossible for the Putin regime to continue conducting this war.",

Is there some othermechanism that would be more effective than sanctions? KARA-MURZA:  It is very important to continue supporting Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and Putin regime cannot be allowed to emerge victorious from this unjust criminal war of aggression that Putin has initiated. They cannot be allowed to emerge victorious. This war has to end in a way that is acceptable to Ukraine, that is not humiliating for Ukraine, in which Ukraine emerges with guarantees of its status as a sovereign and independent democratic country. That's number one, that's very important. I understand the fatigue. This war has been going on for almost three years. I understand the fatigue around the world. But those people who are advocating for some sort of a short-term deal with Putin over Ukraine, they're not advocating for peace. This will just push the problem down the line. And in fact, we know from history that appeasement only makes an aggressor more aggressive and makes him want to grab more. So, continuing to support Ukraine and resisting these calls to cut a deal with Putin is very important. Number two, it is very important for the west, for the democratic nations of the world to continue speaking, messaging, communicating of Russian society. Because, again, not all Russians support Putin and the war, there are many who don't, and it's very important that those pro-democracy and anti-war Russians are seen by the western world as allies in a struggle. This is not a war, unlike what Putin's propaganda is trying to present. This is not a war between the collective west, as they say, and the Russian people. Not at all. This is a war between civilization and barbarism. This is a war between democracy and tyranny. And millions of Russians are allies of the free world in this war. And this should be understood, and this should be practically implemented by the western world. There have to be ways to message, for the free world to message and communicate with the people of Russia, to send a message that this war is not with the Russian people, this was with the Putin regime. The core for the west is with the Putin dictatorship. And that there will be a place for a different changed Democratic Russia in International Community who wants the Putin regime to fall.",

And we're kind of seeing around the world perhaps some yearning for stronger leaders, for nationalism. We look at the support for Orban in Hungary and other places. What do you make of what's happening to democracy? KARA-MURZA:  Well, there are always these waves, right? Many political scientists, many historians have spoken of these waves of this pendulum that sort of swings back and forth. But I think it's important to look at the big picture, and the big picture will tell us beyond any doubt at all that whatever the short-term challenges or problems or even threats that the world as a whole may encounter, there is no doubt that the general direction is always towards more democracies, always towards more freedom. If we look at the map of Europe, let's say 35 years ago, that's nothing by historical standards. That's like yesterday morning. We will see that half of the European continent was living under various forms of dictatorial or authoritarian regimes. If you look at the map of Europe today, you will only see two dictatorships left, that's Putin's Russia and Lukashenko's Belarus. And I have no doubt that, you know, the day will come in the very foreseeable future when Europe is dictatorship free. And it is important to talk about these challenges. I'm not trying to say this is not serious. It is. And it's very worrying to see these authoritarian trends in democratic countries. I mean, just a couple of months ago, there were a series of regional elections in Germany, for example, in the eastern part, the former GDR that were won -- or at least were significant success was achieved by far-right parties. No one year majority, of course, but still significant success. And yes, these are worrying trends that people should address and should think about. But I think it's important not to lose sight of the big picture. The future belongs to freedom. The future belongs to democracy. It does not belong to these archaic repressive regimes of the type that we have in Russia to the end of Vladimir Putin. And I have no doubt that in the very foreseeable future, we will see the demise and the end of all of them.",
