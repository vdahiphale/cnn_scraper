Well, American Reporter Evan Gershkovich says lost a court appeal in Moscow. The Moscow City Court upheld an extension to his time in detention which will keep the Wall Street Journal Reporter behind bars until at least March the 30th. He's been held in Russia's notorious Lefortovo prison since last March when he was arrested on a reporting trip. He is accused of trying to obtain state secrets if convicted.

Israel for its part forcibly rejects those allegations saying they are motivated by hatred for Israel.

Security Council, after saying that it would veto an Algerian draft which is expected to be voted on, in the coming hours.

There are allegations of mistreatment, there are allegations that a group of Palestinian women rounded up by IDF forces inside Gaza were kept in a cage without food and water in the cold. There are many allegations that are being leveled here by these U.N. experts and calling for this investigation. And it is not being well received. Hear the IDF is saying that their troops fight to international human -- the standards of international humanitarian law that this is not what they do. As you said they described these as despicable allegations. And it sticks particularly with many Israelis who really feel that the U.N. didn't take them seriously when they said that Hamas on October 7th and afterwards had raped and sexually abused Israeli women and girls, including IDF soldiers who were captured by Hamas on October 7th. So this I think gives you some understanding of the strength of pushback at the moment. But the allegations coming from the U.N. are not just from one person, they're coming from multiple people who are pressuring for greater scrutiny. The Israeli the government here says look, if there are specific accusations and allegations, none of which had been handed over so far, then they will of course investigate, Becky.",

Dubai International Airport already the world's busiest for international travel says it welcomed almost 87 million passengers last year. And that's not even a record, but the Middle East hub says early projections show traffic this year could reach 88.8 million that's just shy of 28 teens all-time high of more than 89 million passengers.

Well, Venezuela of course one of those major oil producers whose economy is largely dependent on the commodity.

But very crucially, he's going to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow to participate in a meeting of G20 foreign ministers. And he will meet the Secretary of State Antony Blinken in that meeting; will be the first time that the two foreign ministers from Russia and the U.S. will meet each other since the death of Alexei Navalny. And today in Caracas, Lavrov will hold a press conference in responding to questions and will be interesting to see if he's asked any comment about their death, we'll bring it back to you. Looking at the larger picture, it's interesting that he's in Caracas, because like you said, it comes at a moment of increased tension and confrontation between Washington and Caracas. What happened last year is that the two countries Venezuela and the United States found a way to speak with each other to understand each other mainly because, well, Venezuela has suffered from oil sanctions. So it's pretty much the same sanctions that Russia is suffering due to the war in Ukraine. And so, Russia and Venezuela are actually competing for the same market of sanctioned oil black market for oil crude. And so, when the U.S. announced that they were lifting sanctions on to Venezuela, it opened the possibility of return to normal relationships between Caracas and Washington, which are mostly based around oil. Caracas exports crude to the United States and the United States refined them and then exported them around the world. Now, in the last few weeks, Maduro has increased the crackdown on opposition, he has barred the opposition candidates. He has put at least 19 people to jail saying that they were involved in a conspiracy to murder him without presenting any truth, any proof. And this is increasing the tension between Washington and Caracas.
