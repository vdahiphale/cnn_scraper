Among them six hypersonic Kinzhal missiles and all were intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses. Russia though insists all targets were hit and the USB Patriot air defense system was destroyed. No comment on that from the Ukrainian military. But a U.S. official tells CNN a patriot system was damaged through the airstrikes but not destroyed and assessments are ongoing. Meantime, for the first time in 18 years, Europe's oldest political organization the Council of Europe has gathered for a summit with leaders from 46 nations meeting in Iceland to declare support for Ukraine as a top priority. The second day of talks will begin in a few hours. The British and Dutch Prime ministers met on the sidelines and agreed to build an international coalition to provide Ukraine with combat air capabilities, including helping procure F-16 fighter jets. Well for months now Russian airstrikes especially on Kyiv appear to be increasing in intensity. Firing six hypersonic missiles on Tuesday appears to be another attempt by Russia to try and overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. More details now from CNN's Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A new Russian tactic in the air assault against Kyiv concentrated fire by missiles and drones testing Ukraine's air defenses probing for weaknesses. Ukraine says it shot down 18 missiles, including six Kinzhal Russia's hypersonic weapon. It was once considered invulnerable to air defenses. Now, not so much.

But we asked Pita about this and he said that the unity among the Senate is not necessarily what it was four years ago, and he doesn't necessarily think that that will be a problem.

The number of babies born each year has been in steady decline since the 2008 financial crisis. CNN's Barbie Nadeau reports.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BARBIE LATZA  NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Italy has a baby problem, a lack thereof. The birth rate in this country once known for large families has plummeted to a record low 1.24 children per Italian woman, one of the lowest in Europe. High cost of living, low wages and expensive housing are just some of the obstacles. Claudia (ph) and Gabrielle (ph) say they often argue about starting a family with so many uncertainties. Claudia says the government thinks that 10,000 euros is enough to have a child but the incentives are temporary, a child is forever. Gabrielle says the government ignores the youth because they are the minority. The government has to take risks. They also have to take unpopular decisions if they really want to try to stimulate growth. They have to represent the side of the youth he says. The new government under Giorgia Meloni has focused on traditional families with little wiggle room for anyone else. But Italy offers very little government support or financial incentives for new mothers in comparison with European neighbors such as France and Germany. Meloni wants a country where it's not scandalous to say we're born from a man and a woman, and where it's not taboo to say maternity is not for sale. This means babies born to same sex couples and immigrants are increasingly overlooked. Pope Francis says the only hope for the future depends on acceptance and integration.

And the most -- you know, recycling right now is only constitutes less than about 20 percent of the plastic waste stream globally. So that's not much. That can be improved, it can be more effective, but that alone cannot be the solution.Although in this -- the plastics and petrochemical industry often say that that's the solution, it's not. Reducing our use of plastics, particularly single use plastics, is critical. And one way to do that is with alternative materials. This has been around for years, using cellulose, cornstarch, plant based materials, glass, ceramic, bamboo, wood, and things like that can replace plastics, they degrade, so they're much less damaging in the environment as they go out there. But the other most important thing is we need to rethink our resource economy from a linear one trip through the economy into the landfill or into the oceans through the rivers and poor waste management to a circular economy where these materials that are produced are used multiple times in the economy and reused as much as possible. That's the way nature cycles nutrients and energy and systems, that's why we need to start using materials and our economy. We've known this for a long time. Unfortunately, today, the circularity amount in the global economy is less than 7 percent or 8 percent. So we've got a lot of work there.",
