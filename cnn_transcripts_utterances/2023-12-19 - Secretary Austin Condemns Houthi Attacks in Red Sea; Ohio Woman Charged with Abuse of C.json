You have a lot of immigration policy issues that have to do with people who have been in the United States for a very long time who have lots of U.S. citizen relatives who vote, issues about Dreamers and that sort of thing. It's sort of the comprehensive immigration reform that we were having circa 2007 and circa 2013.I think an issue of the migration that we're seeing today plays very differently politically. Your typical Hispanic voter in the United States who mostly commonly is of Mexican American descent has a different relationship to this wave of immigration than to the wave of heavily Mexican immigration that we had in the 1990s. So I don't think that there is a big political penalty for reaching a deal. I think the bigger problem is two things. One is it's not clear to me that the policy deal will do anything that people will see right away as affecting this problem. And that's the big dispute that Republicans are having with Democrats right now. They want to restrict so-called parole authority where the administration can say we can't handle all these people.

And then the other thing is when the White House reaches these deals they don't really brag about them at all.

How are they getting their technical information? Where are they getting their weapons from? And finding a way to interdict those. At some point, you have to solve the problem, not the symptom. Merely being out there like USS Carney and USS Mason, as well as other ships and shooting down these drones, that is merely responding to attacks. At some point, we need to find the cause and solve the problem on a more permanent basis.

So Iran is the root cause. Houthis are merely a symptom of it. But at some point, we could start small by eliminating the threat coming from Yemen being driven by Houthi rebels.

Is this the extent of the capacity? Or is there more? Could this escalate from the Houthis themselves?  LIPPOLD:  Phil, I very much feel that this is merely an escalatory measure. I think that you will see a continued expansion because there is not a response. The one thing we have heard continually from the Biden administration is the need to exercise deterrence. Deterrence only works when you have the capacity and the capability and the will to be able to hold people who do these things accountable. If the Houthis are going to continue to engage and shoot at shipping, we are eventually going to have to hold them accountable. One of the greatest fears I have, and this came out of my experience on USS Cole, is there was no response to the attack on my ship by two presidents, both Clinton and Bush and two administrations, and 11 months later, we suffered from 9/11. There will have to be a response at some point to hold these malign actors accountable, and if it means that we need to take down the missile shooting sites, the drone locations and their ability to command and control, getting them out there to shoot at these vessels, we are going to have to consider that and put the pieces in place to execute that type of operation as well.",

And what we've learned is that she was nearly 22 weeks pregnant when she started feeling pain in her stomach. She went to her doctor, the doctor essentially said that her water had broken, that the fetus was not going to be viable and that she had to immediately get to the ER because she was at risk of her losing her life as well. She went to the ER, and according to \"The Post,\" what happened was, doctors debated for several hours while she waited there in pain to essentially see if they could induce her, which would basically be the equivalent of having an abortion because she was right at that cusp when abortion is illegal in Ohio. She eventually goes home, has a miscarriage in her own bathroom and this is where prosecutors say she committed a crime. She flushes this fetus down the toilet and actually tries to pump it back out according to \"The Post\" and discarded some of this material into a bucket outside of her house.
