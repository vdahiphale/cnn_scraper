And wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" A warm welcome to \"First Move.\" And here's today's need to know, U.S. and European allies call for Iran to stand down from any attack on Israel. Ukraine says it controls 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. Donald Trump now set to be interviewed by Elon Musk live on X shortly. And a Biles bonanza. The company turning the Olympic superstar success into profits. That conversation and much more coming up. But we do begin with urgent calls for calm in the Middle East amid rising fears of a military escalation. The U.S. says it's ready for what could be significant attacks on Israel carried out by Iran or its proxies as soon as this week. Now, all this after the killing of a senior Hamas and Hezbollah officials. U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders releasing a joint statement Monday calling on Iran to stand down. Meantime, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer asked Iran's new president in a phone call to refrain from attacking Israel. And Canada is urging its citizens to leave Lebanon, citing a real risk of escalation in Israel's conflict with Hezbollah. Israel, for its part, says its military remains on high alert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM, DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON (through translator):  We have increased the patrols in the Lebanese skies and are prepared to intercept threats in real-time. We take the statements of our enemies seriously and are therefore prepared at the highest level of readiness. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not clear if a strike within the sort of boundaries of the international rules of military engagement, i.e., not targeting civilians if Iran will have that kind of limited strike with the intent to avoid escalation. It's not clear that's off the table. It's not even clear that maximum escalatory strike is entirely off the table. It's a rollercoaster at the moment. I have to say, Paula. It's been up and down. Yesterday, the sort of mood music was that it was possible that the talks could happen on Thursday and then getting up today, it seemed just the hope that the requirements of what it would take for those talks to be successful, pressure by the Qataris and the Egyptians on Hamas to get Hamas to compromise pressure from the United States, from President Biden on Prime Minister Netanyahu to compromise his position enough to send a strong enough signal to Iran that the talks were going to be productive in some way. That, earlier this morning. had seemed that the hope of that was fading, that the tensions were really high. And in essence, that still remains a situation. But I think at the moment on that roller coaster, we're in a position right now, which still holds open the possibility those talks will happen, that they will at least hold back retaliatory strikes by Iran and Hezbollah until after Thursday. But that said, none of this is a guarantee, because there are so many potential avenues where this could go wrong. And I think when we're talking about negotiations coming up, we know fundamentally that both sides are going to try to maneuver and try to -- and have -- try to have pressure put on the other parties, try to make their position look the best.

And when you have it like that, we're at the number five of five, a level five category. Extreme fire danger today, slightly less tomorrow, as the winds will only be 30 to 40, which is still high enough to make an awful lot of smoke and flames and sparks move. Here's where the storm started. Here's where the firestorm really began up here over the weekend, but now it's down into the suburbs of Athens, not into downtown, but the smoke is already moving through there because the wind is blowing it in that direction. Those embers are moved maybe a kilometer or so ahead of the fire where the firefighters think that they have it stopped. In fact, they don't. So, here's the fire here in Athens, Athens being right there, is the fire under the word Athens. But there you see it pop up. But look at all the other fires that are in Europe right now. So, this is not the only place that's seeing this type of weather, but this is the only place today that saw those type of winds. Those are the areas that are still in drought, have been in drought, and are not going to get rid of this heat. And the heat doesn't really make the fires worse. It certainly makes the conditions worse for firefighters. It's the dryness and it's the wind that makes such a big difference. 35 degrees for today and for tomorrow. Something they would love to see is something tropical come off the Mediterranean. Well, this is the Caribbean. Now, a new tropical storm, Ernesto, about to move into the leeward islands and eventually possibly toward Puerto Rico with tropical storm warnings there.

And with, you know, small gaps between these mass events, you can see that the corals, you know, are struggling to recover. And until the study, we didn't actually know much about the past sea surface temperatures, the temperatures that the corals are growing in, and we actually can use the coral records themselves to tell us about the history. So, these cores that we take are in these massive boulder shaped corals that you may know. And many of our colleagues around the world have been coring those and some of our colleagues in the U.S. do this a lot. And we can measure the chemical signatures in those coral cores, and they're closely related to the ocean temperature at the time. So, we can produce these long, high resolution up to monthly sampling resolution records of what's happened in the past.",

ButI guess what people want to know is there a way to fix it in terms of the recovery, given the climate goals, are we really looking at an overarching solution here?

They're remarkable creatures. But they need the time between the mass bleaching events. And the big concern with climate change is that these events will become near annual. And these mass bleaching events just have -- can have catastrophic impacts on the corals. Of course, this is a world heritage site. This is one of the most vast and spectacular places on Earth with thousands of fish and corals and species and mollusks and turtles and dugongs. And, you know, I would just encourage people to come and see this beautiful place. You know, because unless we alter something in a major way from the current trajectory, we're actually likely to witness the demise of the Great Barrier Reef in our lifetime.
