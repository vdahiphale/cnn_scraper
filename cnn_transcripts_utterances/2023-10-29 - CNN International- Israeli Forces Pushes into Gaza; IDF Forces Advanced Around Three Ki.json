      "sentences": "?You're watching \"CNN Newsroom's\" continuing coverage of Israel at War. I'm Julia Chatterley.Israeli forces are pushing ahead into Gaza by land as strikes by air show no sign of letting up. The scenes in Gaza City a short time ago. Israel's military said it exchanged gunfire with Hamas on Sunday. According to CNN analysis, a video published by Israeli media, IDF forces have advanced around three kilometers inside the territory. And these images filmed from the Israeli side of the border show the intense smoke billowing over Gaza. The U.N. is warning that the \"fabric of society\" there is starting to break down, with people entering warehouses to try and find survival essentials. A child at a refugee camp in Gaza says the bare minimums are all scarce. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We have lost our right to education and lost our right to play. Life here is not good. Water is scarce, bread is scarce, everything is scarce. Life here is no good. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHATTERLEY:  And in the past few hours, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor has told CNN that every strike on civilian infrastructure will have to be justified. Nic Robertson is in Sderot, Israel, for us. Nic, and that may be the case. As you were saying to us earlier, though, actually what we're seeing, as intense as it seems to be from our perspective, the Israelis could have chosen to go in far more aggressively. And this is, it seems, more strategic than perhaps it appears.",

      "sentences": "Two levels, one because they risk losing the support of their allies who are being critical about the high civilian death toll and are also being critical about the lack of humanitarian support and are trying to guide Israel to take a course that doesn't put it irreversibly in a place where it cannot have a political way out of dealing with the people of Gaza in the future.We don't know what's on the table. We don't know what ideas are being put forward by the Israeli government, if any, to international allies and partners about their vision for after an incursion. So, I think in part their hand has been moderated in that way and significant that the unit of the Israeli defense force that put a flag three kilometers inside the north of the Gaza Strip, they seem to be in an area and have come through an area that has very low civilian population. You know, if they were to go further south or a little bit further in this direction, a bit further inland, then they would get to some of those heavily populated civilian neighborhoods. Gaza City being one of the principal ones. They haven't done that. So, on the one hand, it appears at the moment avoiding on the ground contact with densely packed civilian neighborhoods, but on the other, potentially this is not just a military exercise to do what they say they're going to do, which is remove Hamas completely, it is also a pressure point potentially for in the negotiation for the release of those 239 hostages that the IDF says Hamas and other groups in Gaza have. So, at the moment, it is hugely significant, because the troops are inside Gaza, and that's not a normal state for the IDF troops. But how many more are going to follow on, we don't know. But it would certainly be a much, much bigger number than what we've seen so far, if there was going to be a significant incursion into those civilian neighborhoods, Julia.",

Although, we thought that the world was a tinderbox last week when we spoke, and it's unimaginable, but it's actually become even more dangerous and more frightening than when we spoke last week. But I did give you a hint about something we were about to publish then, which has now come out in in many forums.Catherine Wolfram, who was a former assistant secretary of treasury, has come along with a similar statement, which we endorse in there, she's now at MIT, about going after Iran as the source of funds for Hamas, that the estimates are somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of Hamas' military is funded by Iran. But that wasn't the case five years ago. It's oil money and we could that off. The tragedy is here, we actually, for the United States, give five times more than even Iran does to Gaza. We're giving a half a billion dollars a year. There's about a hundred million dollars of oil money from Iran that's been going to fund the terrorists. But the U.S. gives far more, in fact, more than 10 times, all the Gulf Arab states combined, the U.S. gives more, they give about $50 million a year, you know, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and Morocco and UAE, they don't even give $50 million. But the Iranian money is going straight to Hamas and that's what's could be cut off by oil sanctions that we used to have in place.",

I mean, as you point out in the article, Iranian oil production has gone from, what, less than 2 million barrels per day in 2019 to, what, 3.5 million barrels per day now. And that's -- we're talking tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues that you're saying should be limited, actually, in a similar way and we've now got experience of it to how Russia has been limited.

We also have been an adviser to your list of presidents, with President Biden and his cabinet. We worked very closely with Treasury this round on oil price caps on Russia, that was at $60 a barrel because Russia is a hugely inefficient producer.It cost them about $45 a barrel to extract their oil and another $12, $15 a barrel to get it to Asia, the only place where Russia can sell it. So, they're breaking even at $60. We're suggesting a much lower price because Iran, like Saudi Arabia, is far more efficient. They're $22, $23 a barrel. So, right now, with oil around $85 a barrel, they're making a huge, a huge profit margin, much larger than Tiffany's makes on luxury goods. They're making a 75, 80 percent profit margin, and that could be cut back by -- we -- when -- I hate to say this, but the Trump administration, they did succeed. Jared Kushner and Brian Hook, who was their envoy to Iran were very effective of choking off Iranian. Oil, so it fell from that $2.5 billion down to like -- you know, $2.5 billion million barrels to about like $100,000 barrels. It was nothing. And we could do the same again right now as a supposing, you know, close to close to 4 million barrels a year. That's -- that could be certainly cut back because that's about, you know, 40 billion right there going to Iran that should be shut off. And, you know, when people argue over the $6 billion that's frozen right now, that was going back to Iran, this is way more than that. So, this is why -- and by the way, it would not drive-up oil prices, which some oil industry don't understand if the salaries are properly courted. The Saudis have the capacity -- right now that -- you know who the largest oil producer in the world is, it's us. We produced about 13 million barrels a day. The Saudis were up there during the Trump years for whatever reason. I don't know if they didn't like President Biden or they like President Putin or they don't like who knows what, is they voluntarily cut back the exact same amount that should be the cap on the same amount that basically Iran produces, it's 4 million more barrels. So, right now, the Saudis are producing about 9 million barrels a year, and they could do 13 million. So. that's the 4 million that would go into world markets that would make up for cutting off the 4 million.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST (voiceover):  This was not a military target. The revelers here, not combatants. And yet, without warning, Hamas terrorists turned the Nova Music Festival into one of the most brutal and bloody scenes of a new war. It doesn't make sense that they came with that number of weapons to use against civilians. It just doesn't make sense, says Lital Avraham. No one knew what to do. The news reported an army of terrorists had crossed into Israel so Lital and her friends ran to their cars. But then they got a call, warning them that out on the roads, everyone was getting shot. So Lital and her friends stopped the car and ran inside a camper. And for eight hours they stayed, in there. In total silence, the door locked, six on the floor, Lital and a friend flat on the bed. Terrorists banged on the windows, one poured a chemical on the camper and tried to set it on fire. They feared machine guns spray but only twice did a Hamas terrorist fire into the camper. One time leaving bullet holes in the AC unit. The scariest moment, Lital says, is when terrorists tried to unhitch the camper from their car and tow it away.",

Jake Tapper spoke with U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan about the diplomatic challenges in negotiating for their safe return.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We are in almost hourly contact with regional partners and with Israel to try to get to a point where there is a deal to have the hostages released. It is difficult. It is challenging. The Hamas terrorists have not been forthcoming about allowing these hostages to go, but we believe that there can still be a pathway to get their release, and we are going to work tirelessly to make that happen. And even though we have started to see Israel move in on the ground, that has not changed our basic view that this has to remain a paramount priority, that we have to keep working at it, and those negotiations are ongoing.
