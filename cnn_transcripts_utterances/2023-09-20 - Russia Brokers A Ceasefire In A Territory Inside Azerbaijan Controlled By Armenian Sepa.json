Russia has brokered a ceasefire, not in Ukraine but in another part of the world, a territory inside Azerbaijan, which is controlled by Armenian separatists. One day after Azerbaijan launched what it called an anti-terrorist campaign in Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku has now agreed to suspend military operations. Armenian separatist forces have also accepted the proposal and talks are set to happen Thursday although the terms of that discussion remain unclear. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds of others wounded in Tuesday's fighting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, CNN's Nic Robertson is following the developments and joins us now live from London. Good to have you on the story, Nic. So, Azerbaijan has agreed to stop this so-called anti-terror campaign in this Armenian- controlled breakaway territory.

But it seems that the Azerbaijanis want the military forces inside Nagorno- Karabakh to disarm, to put down all their weapons, to get rid of their heavy weapons as well, for the political establishment there, for it to essentially -- to end its governance of the area. This is what Azerbaijan says that it wants to do. It wants to bring Azerbaijani government to the whole of the Nagorno-Karabakh area, including all those ethnic Armenians who live there. This situation, however, it has been building for some time. And for the Armenians, they really feel that it is something that Azerbaijan has been planning, that it has been getting ready for this military offensive.

That's the sense from the Armenians now. The Azerbaijanis say look all we want to do is have the peaceful integration of the Armenian people inside Nagorno-Karabakh and this does seem to be an effort by them to completely take control of it again. And the test is really going to be as you as you ask that question what -- what are going to be the precise terms of the ceasefire that will be discussed on Thursday. Because if they are really unpalatable for the Armenian people, if they really feel that this this takes away some of their freedoms or their rights, then for a lot of them they will likely feel that they will have to leave the enclave and they are describing if that -- if that situation were to happen, they're describing that as ethnic cleansing.",

SUD (voice-over): For decades, separatists have demanded an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan, to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. The Sikh fundamentalist movement launched a violent insurgency in the 1970s. After massive crackdowns and the deaths of thousands of Sikhs, the government banned the movement. Decades later, the most vocal supporters are still among the Indian Diaspora. One of them was Harbeet Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh leader and Canadian citizen who was gunned down outside a temple he led in British Columbia in June. In a stunning accusation, the Canadian Prime Minister now says there's credible allegations linking New Delhi to Niger's murder, a claim that the Indian government has strongly denied. Saying such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty.

And he said that he went into public service because his grandmother and his siblings fled Europe to escape persecution and that she two of his grandmother siblings were actually killed in the holocaust. So, Lynda, he actually teared up speaking about his family literally owe their lives to this country and that's why he's gone to public service. But, we're seeing this hearing ongoing. It started around 10 A.M. And we're seeing the Republicans were really hammering Garland with their belief that there has been political interference during Garland's time at the head of the Justice Department and with the attorney general forcefully trying to push back while at the same time not being able to give any specifics about particular investigations. And of course, Lynda, we are at a very unprecedented time where special counsel investigations are ongoing, not only into the current President's son, Hunter Biden, but also the former President, multiple special counsel investigations into him that have led to multiple indictments.

I was there at the Elysee Palace when King Charles arrived there and they were chatting away. And this is really what diplomats on both sides wanted to see coming out of this trip. It's not really meant to be about politics. It's meant to be about celebrating the long-term relationship between these two nations. And Lynda, as you know, it's been rocked in recent years, ever since Brexit. Boris Johnson didn't really help that relationship because Macron and Johnson just, you know, they didn't have a very close personal relationship.

      "sentences": "Well, firstly, we're focusing on the issue, the urgent food security crisis. We know that one in five people across Sub-Saharan Africa face foodinsecurity, and in 2023, that is absolutely unacceptable. So, we're calling on the French government, the Norwegian government, and my own home country of Australia to step up and tackle the food security crisis and support IFAD in their replenishment to support small, hot agricultural farmers. But the second thing we're fighting for is the climate crisis. And as you mentioned earlier in your program, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister of Britain, has walked back the commitment on behalf of the British people to support sustainability and tackle the climate crisis and he did so under the false pretense of being just honest with the British public. I think that ultimately, the science and the climate crisis doesn't care about his false sense of honesty. What it cares about is are governments taking action to achieve net zero targets? So, we're calling on the British government to walk back their unfounded and misguided statement today and ultimately follow the lead of many other governments who are committing to net zero to tackle the climate crisis. And finally, we're calling on the Canadian government to step up in support of maternal and child health. We know that still 800 women die every single day during childbirth, which is absolutely unacceptable through the lack of access to basic obstetrics or a midwife in the event of an emergency. And the Canadian government, Trudeau, has declared himself a feminist foreign policy leader. So, we want to see action, not just words, and then commit to support the UNFPA in their urgent efforts.",
