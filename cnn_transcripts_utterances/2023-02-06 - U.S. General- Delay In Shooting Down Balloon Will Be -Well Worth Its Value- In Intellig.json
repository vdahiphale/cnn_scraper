Just a short time ago, the Pentagon defended the President's choice to delay shooting down the suspected spy balloon from China. A fighter jet brought down the aircraft Saturday, just off the coast of South Carolina. After the balloon crossed the continental United States, multiple Republicans have criticized the President for waiting calling it a weak response. But the commander of NORAD said the intelligence gathered from the balloon will be a value. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. GLEN VANHERCK, COMMANDER, U.S. NORTHERN COMMAND &amp; NORAD: There was a potential opportunity for us to collect intel where we had gaps on prior balloons. This gave us the opportunity to assess what they were actually doing, what kind of capabilities existed on the balloon, what kind of transmission capabilities existed and I think you'll see in the future that that timeframe was well worth its value to collect over.

But he did also touch upon some gaps in the U.S.' knowledge and U.S.' ability to track balloons that have come before this one. Because as we have since learned, since this balloon was shot down, there were at least three other ones that transited the continental United States during the Trump administration and those actually were not detected.

So moving forward, obviously, the military is going to have to do some work to figure out how these balloons can be detected in real time in the future. Because not only is it important, just in terms of preventing those balloons from being able to gather intelligence about the U.S. and about sensitive sites here, but also because it allows the U.S. to collect intelligence on those balloons as well and kind of turn the tables on the Chinese and that is another point that Vanherck made to reporters earlier that because of this delay in shooting down the balloon, the U.S. was able to gather important intelligence about China's surveillance program, Bianna.",

Mike Lyons is a retired Army Major and Bob Baer is CNN intelligence and security analyst and a former CIA operative. Welcome both of you. So Major, if I could start with you. The payload of this balloon was the size of approximately three buses. How much information do you think the Pentagon will be able to glean overall in terms of the debris that they are finding right now and sending to Quantico? MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET): Well, a lot of it just depends on what survived on impact. They seem to say that they knew what was going on in the balloon. It was tracking whatever it was tracking to be. So I like to think that - that's true statement, they - that they wanted to track it. I'm surprised we're still talking about it, frankly. I think that this is really an opportunity for us and the American people to have kind of an awakening as to what's going on with China and our relationships. The fact that you could look up in the sky and see this balloon there and collecting intelligence, maybe people will see that it's going to become a great menace. So I - we'll see what the Pentagon gets out of it, what survived the crash. They say they were monitoring it while it was an error. We'll find out more as they discover it.",

We had Secretary of State Blinken making the first trip by a cabinet official in the Biden administration to China over the weekend, that was cancelled. This comes at a time when both countries were at least trying to settle some sort of baseline in a relationship that was quickly going south, what do you make of the timing here?BOB BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE &amp; SECURITY ANALYST: Well, exactly. This couldn't have come at a worse time with Blinken on his way to Beijing. And my feeling is we don't really know what's going on in Beijing. The military could have sent this balloon. They - obviously could have withheld covering that area if the balloon was under control, like we believe it was. So you have to wonder if the military, Chinese military, is responsible for this foreflight and what did their divisions in Beijing and just how much control President Xi has over the country, which has always been a question. Unfortunately, American intelligence can't get inside the narrow circles of power in that country.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this - after he just secured a third unprecedented term as president, but you're raising some really interesting points with that response, Bob.Major, something that stood out to me was what we heard from the NORAD Commander in terms of an answer to why the U.S. government was not able to detect it in the Trump administration, those three balloons that had travelled across the United States at the time. We had the President didn't know this, the Defense Secretary, also Esper didn't know about this as well. Well, we would now know there was a domain awareness gap. That seems pretty serious and raises questions as to what other events we possibly missed as well. LYONS: Yes, it does. Sixty thousand feet is where Patriot missiles are supposed to take out incoming ICBMs. And if we don't see this at 60,000 feet, then what are we seeing there? And when does it violates a U.S. airspace? In a post 911 world, this is the kind of incident that has - there's no tolerance for, that should have been reported right through the chain of command. Hopefully, the military protocols change and get this to the administration a lot quicker and give warning to something that's violated American borders like this. And so I'm a little bit concerned again by that answer, because of what the Chinese have capability of. They've got a space station, they've got the ability to already see a lot of other things that this balloon was looking for. To me, it's a kind of a great power trial balloon, so to speak, and it was set on purpose to see what our response is. And again, hopefully it leads to a great American awakening, about the threat that China actually is. Our politicians know, our military knows, but I'm not sure American public is aware of the threat that China poses to us.",

I mean, there are all sorts of things we don't know what that balloon was carrying, what kind of cameras, whether it had communications equipment or even sensors back in the '70s. When I was working for the CIA, we used to drop sensors on China to monitor their nuclear weapons. Are they doing the same thing at our (inaudible) bases?This is why recovering the wreckage is so important, first, to give light to the Chinese propaganda, but then to see what their capabilities are. What scares me is when they get this stuff out of the ocean it's going to turn out to be American technology, which is a good chance that it will be.",

Bob Baer and Major Mike Lyons, thank you so much for your time.The death toll is climbing after a massive earthquake rocked southern Turkey and neighboring Syria. More than 2,800 people have died so far. President Biden is expected to speak with Turkey's president today. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck before dawn flattening high rises to rubble and causing more than a hundred aftershocks, one right after another sending people running for their lives. Thousands of buildings are now decimated with people still trapped under the wreckage. You can see the clouds of dust as this building just fell to the ground in a Turkish city flat like a pancake. Right now in Turkey and Syria, there's growing fear even more people will die if rescuers cannot get to them in time. Teams are digging through the rubble using their bare hands, hammers anything that they can find. More than 2,400 people thus far have been rescued, including this Syrian boy who was trapped under piles of debris. You can see him right there - it's so hard to even watch - lifting his hand to rescuers. They were ultimately able to pull him to safety. Rescuers also got this toddler to safety after her home was severely damaged. Her mother and siblings, sadly, all perished. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul, Turkey.

We're talking about at least 10 Turkish provinces with a population in the millions that has been impacted by this massive earthquake. And then, of course, you've also got these aftershocks that are continuing more than a hundred some so powerful and almost as powerful as the initial 7.8 magnitude earthquake. And authorities here, as you mentioned, a recording in both countries, more than 2,800 people have been confirmed killed. More than 1,700 of them here in Turkey and then more than a thousand in Syria and rebel-held parts as well as government controlled areas. But the fear, the real concern right now that the numbers are going to be rising significantly in the coming hours, Bianna, here in Turkey, officials are saying thousands of buildings have been destroyed by this earthquake that hit at four o'clock in the morning as people were indoors. Families sleeping in their homes when this happened, so the fear is that thousands may still be trapped under the rubble and in Syria. Aid agency saying it is very, very difficult for them to try and get information out of the country. The infrastructure there are decimated by more than a decade of that civil war. And now you've got an earthquake that has hit - really impacting communications with disruptions to communications and power outages, making it very difficult for them to get information and assess the extent of the damage they say in this hard hit part of Syria right now, Bianna.",

So water is key, blankets, food, psychological support, Bianna. We can never overlooked that. I mean, the people I've spoken to today in those parts that have been hardest hit, they went - people went to bed as your correspondents said at 4 am and then this terrifying idea of first you feel a few shakes and tremors and then maybe a car alarm and some glass will break and then it's this absolutely terrifying sense of concrete starting to crumble. At that moment, what does a parent grab? Well, they only have half a second to decide and, of course, there is nothing to grab but your child. And then they flee outside to nothing, to dust and devastation, to screams of neighbors. So psychological support, comfort, warmth are absolutely fundamental as we hoped some of the other images we get, as we just saw from you, the little boy, the toddler, we need more of those images as we wait for those brave rescue workers (inaudible) then UNICEF simply builds in as many life saving supplies as we possibly can from big water systems to hygiene kits to try and take some of the pain away from these people.",
