The twice impeached former President Donald Trump moved quickly this week to position himself at the head of the 2024 pack of Republican presidential hopefuls, announcing his third bid for the presidency this week. But his dominance within the party seems increasingly precarious. He is now being blamed for midterm election losses that will keep his party out of power in the Senate, and now, this: a special counsel has been appointed to oversee criminal probes in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, as well as the investigations into efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

You cannot manufacture that whether it's in the halls of the Republican Jewish Conference or whether it's just with voters at large or even at Trump rallies, there's enthusiasm for Ron DeSantis among people who are interested in him inside the Republican Party.

Florida is quite a different state now than it was when Jeb Bush was governor. I covered Florida when Jeb Bush was governor.
