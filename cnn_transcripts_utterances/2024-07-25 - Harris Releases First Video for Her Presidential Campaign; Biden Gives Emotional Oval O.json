The president today will turn his focus to that very issue when he hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here at the White House for a meeting. This will be their first meeting since Biden had traveled to Israel. Of course, the men have spoken on the phone multiple times over the course of this conflict. And after that sit down meeting, they will also both be meeting together with the families of the American hostages who are believed to be held in Gaza.Now, this meeting is coming at a critical juncture, as President Biden himself has indicated he believes they are on the verge of reaching some type of agreement that would put an end to this conflict and bring those hostages home to their families. But still, there are so many details that need to be worked out. Yesterday, a senior administration official said that they do not believe Netanyahu is standing in the way or delaying any type of deal. But if they ever reach that conclusion, they said that they would publicly make that clear. Now, this a potential hostage and ceasefire deal, as well as developments in Gaza, are expected to be on the agenda for this meeting. The two men are also expected to discuss threats that are posed by Iran. But at the same time, President Biden is now grappling with this transition of his time in office. Last night, the president spoke emotionally, very somberly from the Oval Office as he talked about his decision to step out of the 2024 race. Now, the president notably did not make any reference to the Democratic pressure campaign that was underway as many Democrats had publicly expressed their concerns that Biden would be able unable to effectively campaign or beat Donald Trump in November. Instead, the president tried to portray this decision as one aimed at uniting the country and really preserving democracy, which has been a central argument of this White House and his campaigns. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And meanwhile Trump's own vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, didn't appear at the joint session of Congress either.But, look, this is obviously an attempt by Donald Trump to get on the attack early on Vice President Harris. The ground is shifting very quickly beneath this campaign. This is a very different race than it was just a week ago. His own campaign put out new material in a memo suggesting that they expect this race to get much closer and potentially for Vice President Harris to maybe even get ahead. And so there is a rush by his campaign to define her before she can get on the airwaves and get around the country and start to define herself. Trump, though, couldn't resist taking some final parting shots at President Joe Biden. He released some posts on Truth Social criticizing Biden's Oval Office address, calling it, quote, so bad and saying Biden was It's barely understandable. Sara?",

It was just something that the U.S. and Canada felt that they had to respond to.According to a statement from NORAD, these bombers they did stay in international airspace, even though they entered the Alaska air defense identification zone. And, again, you know, the Russian bombers, you know, they were intercepted. The Chinese bombers were intercepted without incident. But still, it is a very significant event because we're starting to see now the Chinese kind of entered this space in a way that they haven't previously. Now, according to NORAD, these events are not necessarily that uncommon, but it is uncommon again for these Chinese bombers to enter this kind of space. And so while the U.S. has not necessarily always intercepted these Russian bombers when they have seen them flying in this international airspace, very close to and they were not able to or entering Alaska's air defense identification zone.
