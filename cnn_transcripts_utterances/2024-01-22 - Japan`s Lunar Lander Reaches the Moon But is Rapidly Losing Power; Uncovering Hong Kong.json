And the problem is that it`s having a tough time generating power. There`s an issue with one of the lunar Lander`s solar cells. And so, Japan`s space agency, JAXA is working right now, troubleshooting. They`re trying to fix it. And there is a chance that it could be fixed. It may just have -- may just have to wait until the sun actually moves position and can reach those solar cells. But it`s just too soon to say, we`re going have to wait. But the good news is that Japan was able to pull off this very complex mission. I mean, just landing a spacecraft on the moon is something that only four other countries have been able to do. Only two others in this century, China and India, even the United States, hasn`t been able to do it, or haven`t even really tried since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So, a big step forward for Japan and its space agency. But still too soon to say, if this mission is fully a success. That`s going take a bit of time. The other thing that`s too soon to determine is if this lunar lander is going to live up to its name as the Moon Sniper because it was going for a really precise target. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
