And the prosecution has put a fresh witness on the stand that we're continuing to follow. GOLODRYGA Yes, it's clear the judge is quite exasperated by the president's behavior. We'll get back to you in just a moment, Omar. But first, a humanitarian organization says Israel's orders to people in Eastern Rafah to evacuate are beyond alarming. Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, says any operation in Rafah will cause, quote, \"potential mass atrocities.\" The Israeli military dropped leaflets earlier ordering people to move to an area outside of the city. The IDF calls it a limited scope operation to root out Hamas militants. Many people are already leaving. Rafah was supposed to be a safe place. More than a million Palestinians took refuge there after being displaced from other areas in the enclave. This Palestinian asks, where will they go next? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABU AHMED, DISPLACES PALESTINIAN IN RAFAH (through translator): The Israeli occupation told people to go to Rafah and that it is a safe area. Today, they're telling us to get out of Rafah. Where will the people go? Where will all these crowds go, 1.5 million or 2 million civilians, where will they go? Should they go to the sea? Where will people go after they told us that this is a safe area? They want to commit a genocide. This is what we understood. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, the White House is watching the situation closely, as we mentioned, U.S. President Joe Biden, who has sounded the alarm repeatedly over any operation in Rafah, spoke to the Israeli prime minister earlier today. A White House official says the call was just under half an hour and all of this as negotiations for a ceasefire are stalled, but not yet over. CIA Director Bill Burns, who has been a key player in talks, will remain in Doha today. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins me now from Washington, D.C. So, Katie Bo, as we just as you just heard from the conversation with Jeremy, there was optimism about this specific deal. Things have taken a turn for the worse. Where do things stand right now?

And we seem to be be sort of watching that happen. Yet again, CIA Director Bill Burns was in Cairo yesterday working on this, now remaining in the -- in the region in Doha to continue trying to to push for for some kind of a deal in between Israel and Hamas. The proposal on the table right now proposed by Egypt would essentially trade about 33 hostages for a pause in the fighting. But the big sticking point here has been Hamas's refusal to agree to that without some kind of commitment from Israel to end the war outright. And this is something that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has has really been unwilling to touch. He's under a tremendous amount of pressure from the right wing of his governing coalition to pursue the dismantling of Hamas, even at the expense of the release of some of the hostages, even at sort of the expense of trying to get the rest of the remaining living hostages out of Israel. U.S. officials cautioning that, look, they don't think that these negotiations are entirely dead yet. Right. We do still see Burns in the region continuing to try to bridge the gaps in between the two sides here. But U.S. officials very much see Israel's threats about the imminent operation in Rafah as a pressure tactic. Right. It is an effort by as far as U.S. officials are concerned by Israel to try to get Hamas to agree to this deal. But, of course, the tricky part here is not only would you have to get Hamas and Israel sort of on the same page from a diplomatic perspective, but there's also logistical challenges here as well. The assumption is that the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, would have to agree to this proposal. And communication within Gaza has been difficult. And so lots of hurdles here. And as Jeremy so aptly put it, lives in Rafa very much hanging in the balance. The stakes couldn't couldn't be higher here. Bianna?",

The anger felt here by Europeans about China's continued trade with Moscow and specifically its export of those dual use components that Europeans fear are continuing to sustain Vladimir Putin's war effort in Ukraine. But there is, of course, also the backdrop of this looming trade war between Beijing and the European Union. A number of investigations have been launched by the E.U. into what they believe might be unfair practices undermining European -- Europe's automobile industry, for instance, not least amongst others, and specifically its electrical cars. Now, that state dinner about to get underway. But before then, we're going to hear from the two presidents. We've been hearing throughout the day, first of all, from the positions of both sides. And, Bianna, what we've heard from President Macron was earlier in the day when he met with Xi Jinping and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a great deal more caution than we had about Europe's approach. Two things that he hoped to hear from Xi Jinping, he explained, first of all, that there could be equitable trade rules put in place between Beijing and Brussels, but also a firm condemnation that he was hoping to hear from Xi Jinping. From the Chinese president himself, what we've heard so far, Bianna, was here at the Elysee Palace meeting, the bilateral meeting with President Macron. The Chinese president opened by saying that he hoped that this could foster a new era of cooperation between Europe and China and avoid what he described as a new Cold War or any kind of contest between the blocs that are China and the European Union. So very different approaches to what we expect to hear from this meeting. We'll hear more, as I say, in a few moments when the two leaders speak, but very little room for maneuver. Remember, this is the toughest crowd that Xi Jinping is going to be meeting during this European tour. That is President Macron, but also Ursula von der Leyen.

But he said to him, look, enough is enough, and if this persists, I'm going to have to do something that is going to catch your attention. And that is the possibility of jail. Now, he recognizes that going to a federal prison or a state prison would be very problematic. But each courthouse that I've ever practiced in has a lockup, essentially a jail cell behind the courtroom, which is where they hold people who come from jails and then have to testify in the courtroom so that they don't escape. The judge could say, you know what, I'm stepping you back, putting you in that cell. You'll sit there for an hour and get a sense of what this will continue to be for you if you don't honor my order. So, there's a possible interim step that can take place, a timeout, if you will, to think about it in this back jail cell. And we'll see if Trump really gets the message.",

So, I think what the prime minister is saying that, well, at least what he's supposedly saying is that Israel would allow more humanitarian aid to facilitate what you said before, and that is pushing civilians from the eastern part of Rafah to the western part, closer to the Mediterranean Sea. Look, this is a very, very dense, probably the most dense swath of land on this planet. So I doubt that this could be done, even if the humanitarian aid is tripled or quadrupled.

CNN has reached out to the prime minister's office and is awaiting a response from them. Obviously, as soon as we do get one, we will bring it to you. Meantime, back to this news here in the U.S., lawmakers in the House returned to work today. And sources tell CNN that Marjorie Taylor Greene will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson this afternoon. The congresswoman has said she'll bring a motion to vacate this week in a bid to oust Johnson from the speakership. Few thinks Greene's motion will be successful, but she has said she'd force a vote anyway out of it. House Democrats have already said they'd kill the motion and save Johnson's job. Many Republicans are also reluctant to show their party in more disarray in an election year. So let's go to CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju on Capitol Hill with more. Manu, to be a fly on the wall in this meeting between Marjorie Taylor Greene and the speaker later this afternoon, what more do we know about this meeting and how it came about?",

And yet she, at least as of now, appears to be moving forward. She doesn't have enough Republicans on her side, obviously. So this would be more of an optical message that she is sending, a symbolic message. And what is that, in fact, Manu? Is it just that you would have a weekend speaker who she could interpret as being beholden by Democrats?",

She's trying to say he won't have the support to get there. But there's a lot of time between now and then, of course. Bianna?",
