I'm Kaitlan Collins.We have breaking news, tonight, on what might have been an exit ramp, instead of the road that ended, yesterday, in federal felony charges, against Donald Trump, for mishandling highly sensitive government documents. Might have been if the former President hadn't said no to the idea. This is new reporting, according to the Washington Post, tonight. It begins in the fall of last year, at the end of 2022. Christopher Kise, one of his attorneys, who we should note, appeared with him, in court, yesterday, apparently proposed, trying to quietly arrange a settlement, with the Justice Department. The hope was that according to this report, Attorney General Merrick Garland would be looking for a way not to prosecute, and that Kise would, quote, \"Take the temperature down.\" However, The Post, citing three people, who were briefed on the matter, says that Mr. Trump wanted a more combative approach. And so, instead, Kise abandoned this outreach. It never actually happened. I should note that separately, a source, close to the legal team, tonight, is telling me, they're casting doubt on that ever being a real opportunity, given what was listed, in the indictment, yesterday, predates when Kise actually joined the team, late last August. Fast forward all of this, to the present, and what is happening now, Attorney General, Merrick Garland, is weighing in, not on the case itself, but defending the man, who was running it, the man, who was in the room, yesterday, for the first time, with the former President, Special Counsel, Jack Smith.

So, to even hear him come out, and defend Smith was significant.He's also defending the Justice Department, as a whole, from the rhetoric, from former President Trump, and his allies. Now, he went on to emphasize that the Special Counsel is operating independently, and the Justice Department is all about accountability. He was also asked about concerns about possible violence. And he said he wants to protect people, from threats of violence. So obviously, that ship has sailed. But also wants to protect people from any of those threats actually being realized.",

And the reason you have a Special Counsel is so that you can have someone, who can independently investigate, if the Justice Department feels there might be appearance of a conflict of interest, or a real conflict. And here, Jack Smith has been operating mostly independently. While he is subject, to the same rules and regulations, at the Justice Department, technically, the Attorney General can fire him. Mostly though, the Attorney General issues broad deference, to any decisions, prosecutorial decisions, made by the Special Counsel. If he was to decide to do something that the Attorney General didn't like, he could override it, but he would have to notify Congress. [21:05:00] Now, I can tell you, Kaitlan, for the past few months, Garland's staff, they have been emphasizing the fact that this decision would likely be mostly, by the Special Counsel, and would be granted, broad deference. I swear, you could ask, one of his staffers, what time it is, and they would respond, by saying, \"Just so you know, the Special Counsel is granted broad deference. This will ultimately be his decision.\" They're really trying to emphasize how this is independent.",

Of course, those were charges of falsifying business documents. The other is from last night. First, I should note, of course, both of them have been fact-checked. Both contain unfounded allegations. And the former President's claim in the second clip that you'll see here, which is about the Presidential Records Act, is false. It's just not true. We're showing them though, because of the contrast that they seem to reveal, between how Trump then, and how Trump now, is responding to these respective charges, and the different way he sees them.
