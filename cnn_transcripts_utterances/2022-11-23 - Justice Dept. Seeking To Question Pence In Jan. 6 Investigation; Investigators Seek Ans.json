After they spoke to the House, they also then spoke to a federal grand jury in secret, that was Marc Short and Greg Jacob.And there were certain things at that time that they were not willing to divulge, specifically conversations that they knew that would have been presidential privilege. So the privilege that Donald Trump had to protect things that happened in his White House. Now, Mike Pence is a different situation, though. He has his own areas where he can try and protect the vice presidency. He's not tried to do that with his deputies and has been much more open. And things really did seem to change whenever his book came out in recent weeks and he was divulging conversations he had directly with Donald Trump.

Again, this is only the first appearance with a suspect speaking softly only to answer questions by the judge. The suspect also waived his rights regarding the reading of the charges in open court. But the DA after the hearing stated those charges saying that they include five counts of first degree murder and five counts of hate crime. Now, during this proceeding, the Judge referred to the suspect by the pronoun he, this after we've known, based on court documents, that the suspect has asked to be referred to by them and they, they now identify as non-binary. Now the District Attorney was asked if this new non-binary identification by the suspect impacts the investigation in any way, shape or form. The DEA responded by saying that absolutely not, that in the eyes of the law, the definition of the suspect is now the defendant and the DA saying that his job now is to look at evidence and be the voice of the victims in court.

But there are a lot of questions that have yet to be answered about what Wal-Mart knew or should have known and what information they should have relayed to its employees and shoppers in that store. And the bigger question, Victor, is should this individual have even been employed in that Wal-Mart store, should he have had access to those employees and those shoppers.

From your standpoint, is there evidence that shows when we previously had the assault weapons ban enacted in this country for 10 years, from 1994 to 2004? Do you think that the evidence shows that if one is enacted, again, that's a big if because we have a divided Congress, do you think that that would lower the number of these mass shootings given the weapon commonly used in them?",

So it's kind of late to close the barn door. I'm not saying we shouldn't, but we have to find a way to keep them out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
