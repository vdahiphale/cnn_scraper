The campaign also sending out a memo saying that there is simply no alternative plan right now to President Biden. And also in a statement himself, the president saying that he is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail, presumably once he has recovered from COVID. He's currently the isolating in Rehoboth. That defiance, of course, is in such stark contrast from the panic that is really starting to set in across the Democratic Party. Just today, on Friday, we saw Democrats coming out in droves to say that they think that President Biden needs to get out of the race. As of Friday night, there were more than 30 congressional Democrats who had gone public. We also know that many in the upper ranks of the White House and the campaign, privately at this point, believe that the president needs to get out of the race, not to mention problems in terms of money. We have heard from a number of major donors that have said that they are simply not going to be writing checks to the Biden campaign anymore so long as President Biden remains at the top of the ticket. But as for right now, the campaign is insisting that they were emboldened by what they saw this week at the Republican National Convention, including former president Donald Trump's speech Thursday night at the RNC. Campaign officials are saying that that speech really showed that former president Donald Trump is the exact same as back in 2016, as in 2020, that he is all about himself and that the party really showed no agenda or vision for the future. So at this moment in time, despite the growing pressure, President Biden is making clear that he is staying in the race -- MJ Lee, CNN, at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It might end up being Harris because she has the experience. She's also popular with minority voters and with female voters.

In Asia, in this region, specifically, we saw the brunt of the impact among airlines and essentially airports as they couldn't process people's check-ins.We also couldn't see them processing new bookings. People saw their flights getting postponed or canceled, largely affecting their summer vacation plans. This is, of course, a time when many families travel with their with their children, with their young ones and enjoy the summer vacation. Now, after a very disruptive Friday, we are seeing many of these companies return to some sense of normalcy, begin to resume operations. But what's slightly concerning and what experts are warning about is that, in order for the whole world to fully recover, it could take a few days, if not weeks. And the reason for that is because the heart of this issue is very, very deep. Essentially, in order to get all these computers and these systems back and running again, every single affected device needs to be manually rebooted. And there are millions of devices that need to be manually rebooted. If, for instance, a company has a lot of resources, for instance, a Fortune 500 company or an airline for example, they usually have that I.T. support, that tech staff that can help them reboot their devices. But for smaller businesses, they might not have the resources or the manpower to do so, which is why experts fear, Fred, that it could take days, if not weeks, for the whole world to fully recover.",

So there may have been a critical threat which CrowdStrike were aware of.And this happens with all cybersecurity companies. They're researching new threats all the time. And as soon as they locate one, they find the antidote and then send out this patch and say, right, install this, and you should therefore be safe. So it's about speed to make sure those computers are then safe from not being attacked by this. But of course, they want to make sure that update is secure and it actually works and functions properly. So it's that testing phase, but the speed as well. This balance is so difficult, and unfortunately it went wrong here. But -- so usually it doesn't go wrong, and it's so quick and easy usually to get these updates out to all the computers around the world.",

I think most of the world is still relying on Windows, and that's why threat actors, so cyber criminals, they do tend to target particular versions of operating systems, so in this case, Windows. But also we rely on them to make sure they're working.So if we are using Windows in such a vast capacity, when it goes wrong, it all goes wrong very badly, and it's difficult to get different operating systems, say you've got Windows and then an Apple machine, to work together. So you tend to choose one. You stick with that. But of course, like we've seen here, as soon as that falls over, it can have catastrophic effects.",
