But look, I can tell you that Harvard has a tremendous school of kids and students from all ethnic groups, all racial groups, all across the world, and that adds to the unique and exceptional educational environment there at Harvard.But I can say, me personally, with regard to the Supreme Court ruling. I agree with what Justice Roberts wrote, is that ending racial discrimination means ending all of it. And when you have students, the core of this case dealt with Asian students who are academically superior to students, and they were denied access to school based on their race. And when you are eliminating students who are academically superior to other students based on the race, that is a clear and absolute violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of equal protection. And it's important that what we have moving forward is that the justices did allow in this is that students can, in their application process, they can write essays that discuss and talk about their background and how discrimination has impacted them. So, this is still part of the application and the acceptance process. It is just not one of the big motivating factors in the process.",

Everyone who is considered or gets to the next phase of where question, race is a consideration, meets the requirements. I mean, that's how affirmative action works. No less qualified student gets in because he or she is black. I mean, that is a foundation of how this works. STEWARTAnd that's the core of this case when you are denying entrance to an educational institution because of a certain race. There are standards across the board and those that have a higher standard are not getting in because of the race. The Supreme Court justices viewed that and look at that as a type of discrimination and they viewed that it's time to end that type of discrimination. That is not to say by any means, Victor, that this can't be part of the application process. The students can use that as they write the essay, but it just cannot be one of the main reasons.

You know, and to the point earlier about, you know, students that may be academically superior, you know, I'm a professor at Pepperdine University in the Graduate School of Education and Psychology, and I would not characterize any of my students as being more academically superior to another student because of their race or because of any other characteristic. It's important to note that affirmative action is a tool. It is a factor. It's not the only factor. And I think a lot of folks on the right, you know, try to make Affirmative Action and the being something that it isn't. And you know, and we've seen the President respond to this, the President in his response to the decision -- actually, walk people through what Affirmative Action is and what it isn't.

They seek all avenues of seeking higher education. And look, this decision does not say that race is not a factor in your application process.It is simply not the main factor and students can use their unique backgrounds and their lived experiences to apply to these colleges and have the exact same education that other students have. That's one of the blessings, I think, of being on campus. I see students that could never afford the opportunity to receive such a tremendous education, but because of the fact that they are able to get in and have scholarships and rely and use their unique life experiences to enrich the educational experience for all students. That is critical and it's still out there, it's still available, it's just not going to be the main factor. And the point being, to your question, Victor, this helps them not just in school but after school in seeking a greater job of greater wealth, of greater income.

Now, we got an opportunity to go to a field hospital close to the battles around Bakhmut, but we have to warn our viewers that this report may be disturbing for some.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEDEMAN (voice-over): The doctors and nurses here have done this time and time again, treating the wounded from the front, assuring the soldiers that despite the pain, they'll be all right. Near the battles around Bakhmut, this field hospital, known as a stabilization point, is where the wounded, after being hastily bandaged up by combat medics, get their first proper treatment by a full medical team. These soldiers were advancing on Bakhmut when they came under intense Russian artillery fire. This stabilization point has so far on this day received more than 50 troops from the front, suffering from shrapnel, from artillery and concussions. The Ukrainian military doesn't issue data on casualties. A recent poll conducted here found that almost 80 percent of Ukrainians have close relatives or friends who were injured or killed as a result of the full-scale Russian invasion. Andriy, a vascular surgeon, is surprised there aren't even more wounded. Even during this counter-offensive, he says, we have lower casualties than we expected. Once the wounds have been cleaned and bandage is applied, the soldiers will be moved to better equipped hospitals elsewhere. Valentino was studying biotechnology in Kyiv when the war began on the 24th of February last year. By February 26th, I started working as a nurse, she says, and then worked in evacuations, clinics, and now at this stabilization point. Eduard is still in shock, but his injury isn't serious. I'm OK, he says, but it burns a lot. I think it was a piece of shrapnel. Something flew by me like this. I got lucky. It went right past me. Not everyone here was that lucky. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
