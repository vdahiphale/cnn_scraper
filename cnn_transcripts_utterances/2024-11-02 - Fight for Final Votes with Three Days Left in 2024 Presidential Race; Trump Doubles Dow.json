In the coming day, Trump is set to stop in North Carolina and Virginia while Harris is expected to hit North Carolina and Georgia.On Friday, Wisconsin was the center of attention, with the candidates holding dueling rallies there. Polling shows, as it has for weeks now, no clear leader in the battleground state. According to CNN's Poll of Polls for Wisconsin, Harris is holding onto a slim 3pt advantage over Trump, with likely voters. Now the former president told a crowd in Wisconsin that Harris is not equipped to handle foreign leaders like Chinese president Xi and Russian president Vladimir Putin. He said she'll get overwhelmed and, quote, \"millions of people will die.\" Trump also targeted his Republican critic, Liz Cheney, in Michigan Friday. And you'll remember, she said she is endorsing Harris. Here's Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to bring in Leslie Vinjamuri, who heads the U.S. and the America's Programme at Chatham House and she joins us now from London.Thank you so much for being here with us again. So I want to go back and start with Trump's comments about Liz Cheney. Now Republicans, of course, are trying to downplay them. I don't imagine they're helpful for his campaign. But then again, he's been saying things like this since the beginning. They really haven't hurt him that much. Will this be any different do you think? LESLIE VINJAMURI, CHATHAM HOUSE:  Yes, I think what Donald Trump has been doing with that comment and over the last several rallies has really been very much about enthusing his base, that sort of 40 percent of voters, really getting them passion -- passionate about him, whipping them up and ensuring that they turn out and vote. This is clearly a set of remarks that will damage how people beyond that base feel about him. I think it's very likely to generate some more silent Kamala Harris voters, even in those very red areas of those swing states. That's a number that that everybody's very curious about. It's very hard to predict exactly what it will look like but it's a new thing. You know, we used to talk about silent Trump voters, people who didn't want to confess to their communities that they were supporting Donald Trump. Now it's on the Harris side. And part of it is about a concern by women that, you know, that this is a presidential candidate, the former president, who stokes violence, division, who's very macho, very, you know, much of the language is racist and sexist. And so there's -- I think that is not helping. But again, he is focused on those swing states, on the non-college educated white men and women who have supported him. And with this language, there's a real question of what happens. And we are seeing that the white women who didn't go to university, didn't go to college, that, even though they have supported Trump in the past, some of that support seems to be dropping. But again, it's -- at this point, do people turn out? Do they turn out in the states where it matters? Registrations are largely over, so it really is about the president's language, about Kamala Harris' ability to enthuse people. And it's very much about, you know, what we hear of the ground game. And Pennsylvania has become a real focus and, you know, the word on the street is that the ground game for the Democrats is at just -- at a purely operational day to day level proving to be much stronger.

VINJAMURI:  You know, at this point, the polls aren't telling us very much because they've continued to tell us for quite some time that this is an incredibly close race. Nate Silver said -- and I think it's a very interesting comment -- that the one thing about the polls is that they're so close in so many states that it's highly unlikely that we won't see any surprises coming out of the swing states in this election. In other words, it isn't just going to be about the polls. It's going to be about what voters do. And that might differ. You know, it's hard to get to all these people in the polls. Some people perhaps don't tell pollsters what they're actually going to do. So there are a lot of, you know, unknowns, known unknowns about this election. The biggest one is who turns out to vote. And this is, you know, as we know, it's a very practical thing. We're hearing about people standing in lines for hours. For others, it's quite, quite a lot easier. We hear about all manner of difficulties and certain, you know, just the process of voting. But people are working the state. They're working all the swing states.

The concern on the Trump side, given the level of violent rhetoric that already kind of sowing division and seeding doubt about the veracity, the credibility, the fairness of the election in ways that are not grounded in evidence, it foments the ability, that it stokes the possibility for violence. People know that the possibility of electoral related violence is real. And what we're hoping is that there is preparation for that at the local level and that we see -- saw in 2022 was we didn't see the violence that many people anticipated.

The challenge we've got is it's tough to pinpoint precisely how much of each.And that was the forefront of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics told us Friday and that was, look, we know there was a severe impact of the storms. We couldn't quantify quite how much. And that leaves us just looking at the numbers. So as you said, just 12,000 jobs added for the month of October, just a fraction of what was expected. And even if we add back what was estimated to be deducted as a result of those challenges, which was somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 jobs, it still looks like it's a slowing jobs market. It's a weaker than anticipated number. Now come the revisions. We also saw 112,000 jobs less added for the months of August and September. So again, we're building this picture of a cooling, not collapsing -- and I'll be very clear about that -- jobs market. What's interesting to me, too, is the unemployment rate, 4.1 percent. Exactly what we got in September. So perhaps that's the number that you need to look at to read through some of the noise that we got this month. Just a quick flavor of the sectors, too. As you would expect, manufacturing took a hit this month. Temporary help and services also took a hit. On the plus side, we saw job gains in the government sector, in health care, too. Where does this leave us three days out now from a presidential election? Well, it leaves us plenty of room to politicize. The Trump campaign called this catastrophic. It's not but it is a curve ball. Of course, for the White House, they would have preferred a less messy and a stronger number heading into the presidential election. Take a step back. This is a solid economy. We're still adding jobs. Prices have been painful. The silver lining here is that the expectation is the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week by a quarter of a percentage point. So borrowers, fingers crossed, something to look forward to there.

And, you know, she's broken some of the Biden and Biden's over capital gains tax, where Trump's on the other side, talking about higher growth and more tariffs on imports, which then obviously then leads to, you know, cheaper prices, more growth. And that's where it leads to inflation. And also Trump's policy and Harris' policy on the argument around what they're going to do when it comes to tariffs on China and other places and imports.

Its nuclear program is very advanced. Iran has been a long standing supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas and plays a destabilizing role in the region. And let's not forget that Iran also sent missiles to Russia this year. So the next U.S. president can continue the strategy of sanctioning and containing Iran. But it does look like some diplomatic engagement is going to be on the cards. And both candidates want to keep those options on the table alongside the tough talk. The same applies to the other issues for their so- called two state solution that we talk about in the West. But there currently really isn't too much constituency for that  horizon in Israel. Both candidates are vague. They do see a need to end the war. I think Kamala Harris has called for more support for Palestinians on the ground, obviously also for Lebanese. But how you get there is the big question mark. And it's unclear if the United States has the influence, let alone the patience, for such a process.",

Trump went to Riyadh in his last round in office. But, at the same time, it's important to remember that president Trump supported the Muslim ban. Probably didn't go far enough in supporting Gulf security interests when Saudi oil infrastructure was attacked by Iran in 2019. I think the Gulf approach, if there is a Gulf approach, is to be pragmatic and to work with either candidate. It's not clear that Donald Trump will actually prioritize ending the wars in the region. And for the Gulf states and particularly for Saudi Arabia, regional security is paramount. It cannot really deliver Vision 2030, attract FDI with all of this conflict metastasizing across the Middle East. So that is on the forefront of their minds.",
