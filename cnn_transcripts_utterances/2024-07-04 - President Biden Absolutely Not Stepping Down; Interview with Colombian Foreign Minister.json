I'm Paula Newton in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. President Joe Biden is absolutely not stepping down. That is the message from the White House following Biden's poor debate performance last week against Donald Trump. Now, earlier this week, the president privately acknowledged that the next stretch of days could be critical to his campaign while blaming jet lag and travel for his struggles on the stage. Meanwhile, more than 20 Democratic governors voice their support for Biden after meeting with the president yesterday. Here's what some of them said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

My first guest today is staff writer for The New Yorker,Evan Osnos, and he's joining us now from Bethesda, Maryland. And a happy fourth to you and thanks so much for being with us. The White House has said, look, this man is still running. And today, Biden is at the White House with family members critical to his future. They are all deciding, apparently, as a family, they are all in it as a family. Is this just damage control, or are there serious thoughts about stepping aside? What have you heard? EVAN OSNOS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER AND AUTHOR, \"JOE BIDEN: THE LIFE, THE RUN, AND WHAT MATTERS NOW\":  I think we're in a genuine proving ground moment right now, meaning that this is an unresolved issue. It is a live issue, Paula. I mean, this is what we -- what has happened and this is all as a result of the last six days, as a result of the debate performance, is that something fundamental has changed in the race, which is that the theory that the Biden campaign had was to make this campaign, make this election about Donald Trump. Make sure that you could keep this anti-Trump coalition together. It's one of the reasons why they wanted this debate, was they thought that would produce a thousand soundbites of Donald Trump saying he would pardon insurrectionists and he was proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. But because Biden's performance was so poor, the result has been that this election is now about Biden, and that's a very hard thing to change.",

And, youknow, remember, he came through an embarrassing night last week. And so, it doesn't surprise me that you have members of the family rallying around him to support him. That sort of makes intuitive, sentimental sense. That's a separate question from the strategic question that his advisers have to take up. And more importantly, perhaps people outside of the White House who he trusts, who have credibility people like Jim Clyburn, people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries. He's going to get different views from them than he would from members of the family. And he is -- I think it's safe to say, he is open to this variety of opinion.

I mean, the White House told CNN that Biden was examined by a physician a few days after the debate, they've now corrected just in the last little while to say it was really just a check in, a checkup.

And if the White House and the president are confident that this was an episode, then talk to us more about it. I think Americans do need to hear some of that. And I think you're likely to get -- hear questions brought to him on Friday night when he gives this interview, which is a very high stakes, very important moment. Because it's not enough to simply say he had a bad night. It was such a profoundly bad night that people want to see greater precision in answering that question. And, you know, some of this, there's going to be bad faith attacks to say, well, he's disqualified himself completely.

There'sobviously a lot of anticipation ahead of that ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos. You know, but the new New York Times/Siena College poll says Trump is now leading Biden, 49 to 43 percent among likely voters. Just to keep everyone informed here, that's a three-point gain for Trump from just a week earlier. You know, it's also the largest lead Trump has recorded in that poll since 2015. Think about that. Now, I know you're going to tell me that, look, the Bidens, the Democrats may not be looking at those polls specifically, that it depends how he's doing in swing states, but those aren't looking very good for him either.",

There's suspicion that some of the polls don't capture the full spectrum of opinion. But \"The New York Times\" poll was quite clear. You know, he's now trailing, as you say, six points among likely voters and nine points among registered voters. And in order to be able to turn the tide, and that's really what would have to happen, it has to be about the performance that he is able to put on, of course, over the next few days and weeks. But I think what's really hard here, Paula, is that this question of his fitness, his capacity to do the job, not only to finish this election and win, but then to perform the job for the next four years, beyond that's not going away now. That is now what this campaign, what this election is going to be contending with every day. To go back to this first point I made today, they wanted this campaign to be about Donald Trump. They thought they could win that choice. And now, it is about Joe Biden. And getting it back to that original strategic intent is going to be very difficult, if not perhaps impossible. That's why so much is riding on how he does. And, you know, he's starting to say as much to people around him, as we've seen in the reporting in \"The Times,\" and that's really crucial.",

Obviously, she would inherit, in effect, the campaign infrastructure, the campaign funding. And then, also, look, she's also been thoroughly vetted as a course of the period of both coming into the vice presidency, and now she's been in the job for the last three and a half years. I think for him personally, there's a certain logic to it. It validates his first big decision that he ever made as the nominee in 2020, who he chose as his VP, and it would also allow him to say that he had created the opportunity, advanced the possibility for another historic presidency, the first black woman in the job, the first Asian person in the job. It would be profound. There will be, I think, in some inevitably and perhaps there should be, a conversation about whether she's the strongest candidate. But I think that what's likely to have -- and there -- look, there are some people who want her ultimately to prevail in that process, but they also think there should be a kind of mini primary, give her a chance to get up there and contend with another group of Democrats who are strong options. And so, that's a scenario that you could see. But I think it's very likely that if he does step aside, he's going to signal his strong support for Kamala Harris, because I think anything else would be a real surprise.",

First, obviously, we are addressing the challenges of the Darien Gap. In that regard, we are working on dismantling these criminal networks that are using and taking advantage of migrants that are crossing the Darien Gap. In addition to that, President Petro and President Mulino agreed on implementing a development plan for the Darien Gap to create better conditions for communities in that area. But not only that, Colombia is making a tremendous effort as no other country in the region and even in the world. We have welcomed almost 3 million Venezuelans migrants. We provide them with temporary protective status. They -- we are providing also the possibility for legal pathways. And recently, we developed regulation for welcoming more 600,000 Venezuelans that are here already, and they need obviously to regularize their situation in Colombia. So, Colombia is a country that have this profile of welcoming Venezuelans. We have a special relation with Venezuela. These -- the problems of Venezuela and Colombia are interconnected. And we are -- those migrants that are in Colombia, they obviously have the vocation to a state in the country and not to -- looking for ways to get into the Darien Gap and farther north to the United States. That's a tremendous effort. And it's not really easy to do. It's very costly. Almost 1 percent of our GDP goes to -- respond to the needs of those migrants from Venezuela. We are providing health services to almost 1.5 Venezuelans here in Colombia. We have 600,000 kids that are going to our schools. We are providing jobs, with the support of the United States. We have almost 10 centers for regularization of Venezuelans in Colombia. And we consider that it is a very important effort.

In February, you suspended purchase of Israeli weapons. In June, you suspended coal exports to Israel. And you, of course, supported South Africa's complaint against Israel to the ICJ and the Hague. And it's worth noting that your relationship in the past, really, you had a good relationship with Israel.

Because what is happening in Gaza, it is really -- the fact are there, it's like what's happening there is unacceptable because you see, people are being killed, the military actions really are not protecting civilians. We see more children die. We see even human right workers, you see humanitarian workers also being killed in very significant numbers. So, that's unacceptable.

Not likely to be a Category 2, but it's still possible. And for our international viewers who are familiar with their area, it's expected to make landfall somewhere around Cancun. A lot of people visit there. It's a very important tourist destination for Mexico. Then after that, it gets into the Gulf of Mexico, and it is going to be a threat for parts of Texas. So, people in some counties in Texas already getting ready for a possible arrival of this storm. Paula.",

Appreciate it.And we turn now to Israel, where authorities have approved the largest land grab in the West Bank since the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993. Now, a declaration from the IDF's Civil Administration Department said an area of more than 3,000 acres in the West Bank is now state owned. It's a move that turbo charges the settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories. Jeremy Diamond is following all of these developments for us from Tel Aviv, and he joins us now. We will get to that story, Jeremy, but I do want to ask you. We do now have reporting that Biden -- President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu have spoken, apparently reaffirming the fact that Israel has given permission for negotiators to go back to Hamas and see what can be worked out.

And this latest land grab is the largest to date since the 1993 Oslo Accords laid out a plan -- a path for peace, I should say, between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Peace Now, which is one of these groups which tracks Israeli settlement activity as well as these land grabs, says that the Israeli Civilian -- Civil Administration issued this declaration on June 25th, according to a document obtained by that group, seizing more than 3,100 acres of land in the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, and that makes 2024 altogether the biggest year by far for these Israeli land seizures. And what's notable about them, beyond the size of these land seizures, is the fact that this is current Israeli government, the most right-wing government in its history, is being much clearer now about why it is doing this. We have heard from the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who has significant influence over Israeli settlements, over these land seizures, he has made very clear that this is all part of a plan to deny Palestinian land for a future Palestinian State.
