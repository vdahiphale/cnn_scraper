So, The Post is reporting here that Trump Attorney Chris Kise wanted to negotiate a settlement with the DOJ back in the fall. Keep in mind, as you're looking at the timeline here, this is after the FBI had searched Mar-a-Lago, found a trove of highly sensitive documents, including nuclear secrets. Trump, apparently, though, was not interested.

It's more than a decade ago. It was brought by his own group, Judicial Watch. And Fitton tweets about it a lot. His group sued to get access to the audiotapes that Bill Clinton did with a historian that he reportedly stashed in his sock drawer.

It's very clear that Donald Trump knew he had classified information. He knew he had information that was so sensitive that the classification is classified. There were several of those documents that had where it said that in the classification line, they're marked out, they're redacted because the classification itself is classified. So, he knew he had this stuff. He knew that they were in places that were accessible by his members and by his staff. And when is Donald Trump going to tell us, these are the steps I took to prevent the Chinese government, to prevent the Russians from trying to come in and bribing my members or bribing my staff in order to get access to us.

It's ten years old.Judicial Watch, which is an advocacy organization, tried to intervene and make the case that when President Clinton spoke with a historian and then got a copy of the tapes, as if any of us as journalists talked with a public figure and then gave him a copy of the tape that somehow became a public record that would be subject to all kinds of disclosure.

This happened in Bakhmut. You can see him being chased by the drone, dropping small bombs before he finally surrenders, begging for the bombardment to stop.We should state, The Wall Street Journal interviewed and interviewed the captured soldier on May 19th in the presence of a guard, but we do not know whether he was speaking under duress. It's an important point. CNN also got an exclusive look at the front lines of the war with a special ops team of Ukrainian soldiers whose main focus is breaking Russian morale in Bakhmut. Our CNN's Sam Kiley is live in Kyiv, Ukraine, with more of his reporting this morning. Can you tell us, Sam, what the special ops team showed you?",
