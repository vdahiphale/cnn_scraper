It's not happening yet because the United States today is so domestically, politically helpful to attack China, attack China, both political parties, including the administration. That's fine.

This is from the spokesperson, Brian McCarthy. I will read a portion of it. The disability plan, which is established by the NFL as part of the CBA, includes an uncapped financial commitment to provide benefits or any retired player that meets the eligibility requirements set by the parties. These eligibility requirements and administrative procedures were developed after consultation with occupational, mental and physical health experts. The plan annually provides more than $330 million to deserving players and their families. The NFL disability plan is fair and administered by a professional staff overseen by a board comprised of an equal number of appointees of the NFL Players Association and the league, which includes retired players.
