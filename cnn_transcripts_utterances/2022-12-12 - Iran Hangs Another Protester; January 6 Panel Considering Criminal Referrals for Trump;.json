Just ahead here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" CNN has learned the January 6th committee has been discussing more criminal referrals as it prepares its final report. Plus, new information on the special counsel's own probes into former President Donald Trump.After more than three decades, the alleged bomb maker in the attack on Pan Am Flight 103 is now in U.S. custody, and families may be one step closer to justice. Plus, why so many here in the United States are sick right now. A tripledemic of COVID, flu, and RSV is filling hospitals and emptying shelves of pain and fever medicines. What you should do right now to stay healthy. Those stories in just a moment, but first, nearly three months into the demonstrations that have shaken Iran to its core. We are learning that a second protester has been executed. Government affiliated news agencies say the man was publicly hanged Monday morning. He was convicted of allegedly killing two members of the security forces and injuring four more. Last week, Iran carried out its first known death sentence connected with the anti-government protest. Mohsen Shekari was hanged on Thursday after his conviction in October for allegedly injuring a paramilitary officer. We'll bring you more on this developing story as details become available. Well, in the United States, the House Select Committee investigating last year's insurrection has held a meeting to discuss criminal referrals. That is according to sources who say a subcommittee presented its recommendations to the panel on Sunday. The panel is weighing referrals for former President Donald Trump after he pushed a conspiracy that led to the January 6th capitol attack. But it's still unclear if they've reached a decision on the referrals. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  We will be releasing a report I think around the 21st. That will include whatever decision we've made on referrals. If we do make referrals, we want to be very careful about how we do them, but I think we're all certainly in agreement that there is evidence of criminality here and we want to make sure that the Justice Department is aware of that.

We've been really reticent so far to really make him accountable for some of his actions. But we're seeing with some of the legal results that have been taking place with also the fact the Trump Organization was found guilty on 17 counts of corporate fraud and a series of other case in Georgia, a civil suit in New York, and the investigation that you talked about with Jack Smith, the special counsel, looking into what happened in Mar-a-Lago as well.

Arizona is a purple state, so to speak. There's a mix obviously of independents, Democrats, and Republicans. She claims that she likes to work across the aisle for bipartisan legislation with Republicans like she did she claims in the Infrastructure Bill and lowering of pharmaceutical costs. And I think she felt he didn't like being pigeonholed as being part of the Democrats. The thing is that when she was part of the Democratic Party, this did put a lot of attention on her. There are critics that are saying that she's doing this again to get more attention. But ultimately it doesn't matter that much now after Warnock's victory because the Democrats still have enough with, you know, Kamala Harris as vice president to break any kind of ties. And so, she said it's not really going to change the way she's voted anyways. So, in the end it may not really matter what her label is.",

Two-hundred and seventy people died in what is still the U.K.'s deadliest terror attack. CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, has more on the suspect and the investigation through the years.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Almost 34 years since the deadliest terror attack in British history and the man accused of building the bomb that killed 270 people mostly Americans is finally going to face justice in a U.S. court. A huge moment for victim's families. KARA WEIPZ, LOST BROTHER IN PAN AM FLIGHT 103 BOMBING:  It has been one of our -- it has been the top priority to find these groups and to hold these people accountable. And the fact that this is now going to happen in the U.S. is -- it's monumental. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Libyan Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al- Marimi was arrested for his alleged role in blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland 38 minutes after it took off for the U.S. from London killing everyone onboard and 11 people on the ground. The U.S. first charged Al-Marimi for his involvement in the attack two years ago while he was already in custody in Libya for unrelated crimes. MICHAEL SHERWIN, THEN-ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY:  It is alleged in the criminal complaint and indictment that at that time all co- conspirators worked together to arm the explosive device in the suitcase. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  The Justice Department expects Al-Marimi to make his first appearance in district court in Washington in the coming days. For years, the only person convicted in the Lockerbie bombing case was Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi. Al-Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official was accused along with another Libyan man who was acquitted for planting the explosive inside a portable cassette player in a suitcase on the plane. Al-Megrahi was sentenced to life in prison. But eight years after his conviction in 2008, he was released from a Scottish prison with terminal prostate cancer. Arriving home in Libya, he received a hero's welcome. In 2011, following the revolution that toppled Libya's dictator, Muammar Gadhafi, I visited Al-Megrahi at his home in Tripoli. He was near death. His family, as they always had, protesting his innocence. (On Camera):  Has he been able to see a doctor?

But it all starts with this first uncrewed test flight.

It's such a critical test for this spacecraft because they can't replicate conditions like that here on Earth. By all accounts, it performed beautifully, but now they are going to have to conduct some final checks once they get this spacecraft out of the ocean, and back to the Kennedy Space Center. But for a program, a rocket, a spacecraft, a mission that has encountered, so many delays, so many setbacks, including getting hit by a hurricane, just five days before liftoff.
