The active shooter does not equate to mental illness. In most cases, 75 percent, there is no pre-diagnosed mental illness in the active shooter.

One of them we did see hit a building not too far away, an apartment building, we understand about four stories. Israeli officials are now saying that there were three people injured, moderate injuries, mild to moderate, one of them a 20-year-old man. But again, just the randomness of what happens here, it was that immediate billowing of smoke. It looked like that was actually a rocket that had broken through the Iron Dome as opposed to just a piece of shrapnel. That's what it appeared to be from the best that we could ascertain from this distance, but we could see that. And of course, we can hear the thuds from Gaza as those strikes continue. There were, again, about 300 of them overnight as Israeli forces continued both the air assault as well as an assault by sea. Special Forces assault by sea and by land. They have done that now two nights in a row, where they have gone into Gaza a kilometer or two with a significant land incursion.

So, a senior defense official told us last night that those facilities were occupied throughout the day by IRGC personnel and other personnel affiliated with those militia groups that Iran backs.However, it is unclear at this point just how mini or if there were any casualties as a result of this strike. It targeted a weapons and ammunition depot in eastern Syria. However, the senior defense official did seem confident that there were no civilian casualties at this point. But, look, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in his statement that these are very narrowly tailored strikes and that it has nothing to do with the broader Israel-Hamas war that is happening right now. This is what he said, \"These narrowly tailored strikes in self-defense were intended solely to protect and defend U.S. Personnel in Iraq and Syria. They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\" But look, these strikes do not come in a vacuum. They are, of course, a response to the more than 19 attacks that these Iran-backed militias have waged against U.S. And coalition bases in the region in Iraq and Syria since October 17. According to the Pentagon, there have been 21 U.S. Service members who have suffered casualties, who have suffered injuries as a result of these attacks, including traumatic brain injuries.
