About Michael Cohen not being able to go fully rogue because you've got a micromanager in Donald Trump, who they put out book quotes as well. Where you talk about Trump think like a billionaire, even before Stormy came on. Talking about signing a check yourself. You're seeing what's really going on inside of your business.You have the idea of as you put up the amount of money. If the jury is to believe that Michael Cohen is truly rogue about all these things, then it would it really question the ability to then have this amount of money come in. We're talking about $420,000 as it's broken down. That he would have signed this check and he would have said, I'm going to reimburse you nonetheless. I think the jury has to, almost, stretch credulity to get from the point of this person, Donald Trump, is in control. And yet Michael Cohen, who have they painted as a buffoon really, and all the different witness testimony could have that control. And that's -- poses a problem for Michael -- Donald Trump, excuse me, if he were to testify on the stand. He has two choices, either show he wasn't really in control or that he was complicit.

That was something that, you know, the prosecution tried to front that baggage before they were done with him. What -- how does that work with a jury?

But when we talk about credibility, it's important to distinguish between two types of credibility. Is Michael Cohen a credible person? And I think, you know, in fairness, the answer is no. If he came to you and said, I have a great investment opportunity for you, most people would say I'll pass.But the more important question is, does he tell a credible story? That is, is the story he's telling, the account he's giving, is it corroborated by other evidence and witnesses? And almost every piece of it has been corroborated. Is it uncontradicted by any other evidence, and so far, although it's not the defense's burden and the defense may never try to contradict it, it remains uncontradicted. And last, and probably more important, is this story plausible? Did this Michael Cohen guy just drop out of the sky from somewhere. Claiming all of these things or was he a regular, trusted lieutenant and fixer for Donald Trump, you know, who wouldn't go to the bathroom without Trump's permission. And that seems to be the picture that emerges. So yes, Donald Trump will be happy that Michael Cohen is -- spends all day on the witness stand, admitting his lies.

This is actually a moment where Todd Blanche tripped him up the other day where he was saying, it's not a lie, it's an inaccuracy. And Todd Blanche said, OK. What's the difference? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And he didn't have an answer. The answer was that it's still a lie, and it turns out that it's the same thing, and that's what he just did here too. Here it says, I was just using different terminology, Cohen says. I mean, that's exactly what happened on Tuesday when he said the same thing. Blanche says, so it was a lie? Correct, Cohen responds. This is literally exactly what we already saw on Tuesday when he said something else. He said, what's the difference between this and a lie? He said, nothing. They're the same, just different words. So, again, they're trying to trip him up. They're trying to get him to say that he was lying. Cohen is doing everything he can to avoid using the word lie because he knows what they are doing here. But I also think, to your point, they -- Cohen is comfortable here, which is why you saw this, kind of, all over the place questioning from Blanche on Tuesday, trying to trip him up.

Arguing that he made the actual business records be falsified. Now, they say, when you met with him and talked about the offense conduct, you blamed others, correct, Blanche said. Yes, sir. So, this is them, likely, trying to line up for the jury that in past cases Cohen has not taken personal responsibility, instead deflecting on others. And they will likely argue that's what he's doing here. He was the one who paid the hush money. He was the one who falsified the invoices.

And that individual will likely speak very briefly. They're limited in terms of what they can share. A lot of this is likely to preserve issues for appeal.Alan Garten, a Trump Organization attorney, could be called depending on what Michael Cohen says, but at this point, that's not expected. Some folks have speculated about whether Rob Costello would be called, because he was called before the grand jury in this case. He testified before Congress yesterday, attacking Cohen's credibility. At this point, he is not expected to be called, unless the former president saw his performance on the Hill yesterday and said, we've got to have him. He is not expected. So, the defense case is going to be extremely brief. And then of course, we have the question about whether the former president will testify. At this point, I think the legal team understands, right? If there is a conviction here, they believe that will be largely be in part because the jury doesn't like their client.

He's confirming that Cohen has called the federal judge at different points in time and that -- and in trying to attack it. But here's another explanation though. If he is painting the prosecutors as something that is corrupt, and the average person is seeing the conflation to the narrative Donald Trump has raised in the past, this actually could inure also to the benefit of the prosecution, who's already tried to distance themselves as someone giving them -- giving him a pass. Now, and part of what this is all happening about is thinking about the ways in which we're trying to go after him. I'll give you a quick update on this, because Cohen is now explaining why he did not feel he should have been charged even as a first-time tax evader. His voice apparently is getting more animated as he begins to speak. So, his pace is quickening. This is called a trigger. And of course, this was the goal of the defense to be able to, in some form or fashion, go after the very thing he doesn't want to have to do, which is to change. Cohen's confirming that he called the STNY prosecutors at one point in time, giving them some effing animals as well and the judge in that case.
