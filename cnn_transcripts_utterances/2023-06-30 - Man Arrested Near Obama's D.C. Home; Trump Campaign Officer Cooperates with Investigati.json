And it was an investigation into sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy, which uncovered a history of substantiated rapes and assaults that were ignored or even covered up by high-ranking officials.You've never heard of it because no one ever saw that report. It was buried. Even though it was completed a few years ago. The findings were kept secret by Coast Guard's top leadership. And, get this, after all this time, the Coast Guard finally came forward and reported it to Congress this month only after CNN's investigative team asked about it. The report found dozens of cases of alleged sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy, even though they only looked at a limited time frame, from 1988 to 2006. And here's some more details about what's in Operation Fouled Anchor. It said that there was a disturbing pattern of not treating reported sexual assaults as criminal matters, even in cases where there was overwhelming evidence. Leadership was more concerned at that time about Coast Guard Academy reputation than about the victims of crimes who were members of our service. And that the suspects and sometimes the sometimes the victims were simply disenrolled from the academy with no investigation at all. If there were punishments, some were laughable. Minor things, like extra homework or lower class standings. Even those pushed out of the academy were sometimes able to serve in the U.S. military. Now, CNN repeatedly reach out to the Coast Guard for answers to detailed questions and instead they reached out to Congress to fess up about the report. I want to go now to an interview that I did with a young woman who recently graduated from the Coast Guard Academy. She told me that the culture has not changed. She asked us to hide her identity. This is what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we're told that behind the scenes adviser here at the White House and the Department of Education, all across the board, have been working on the plans for the various outcomes to this case. They have been discussing, we're told, some policy options that could be put into effect if the court was to rule against this plan.Additionally, they talked about ways that they could try to promote and advise student borrowers on other programs that they can take advantage of. We've also heard from progressive lawmakers and some debt relief advocate groups who have urged the administration to consider the use of the Higher Education Act. That's a law from the 1960s. It's unclear whether the administration would actually go down that route. It could have a complicated legal route as well. But in addition to preparing for the fact that it could be struck down, they are also preparing for the possibility that they will be allowed to move forward with this proposal. They likely would be sending out notice to borrowers and servicers about the steps ahead. And let's not forget, this is a plan that the administration anticipates could affect up to 40 million student borrowers. There have already been 26 million applications submitted with 16 million of those approved. This could cancel up to $20,000 of student debt. Now, those applications have been on hold. For Americans who have already applied for this program, they're not going to have to apply once again if this program is allowed to move forward. So, big questions going forward for the administration today on these next steps. Earlier today the education secretary, Miguel Cardona, would not say whether they had a plan b, but take a listen.
