I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with breaking news and new details emerging about the suspect and the second Trump assassination attempt. He left a letter detailing planning what he planned to do eight days ago at the former president's golf club. In newly released court documents, prosecutors say Ryan Routh wrote that, quote, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and urging others to, quote, complete the job, end quote. CNN's Randi Kaye joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. Randi, you've been reading through these documents. You're seeing this new letter that's emerged. Apparently there's a photo of the rifle and so on. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Good morning, Jim. We have been looking through these documents, this prosecution's filing, and this letter was addressed from Ryan Routh to the world. And it also reads, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you, he writes. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job, and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job. That is evidence that will, no doubt, be discussed in court at this detention hearing this morning.We also have learned from these filings, Jim, that a witness told officials that Routh had dropped off a box at his home months ago, and in that box was ammunition, a metal pipe, tools for phones and various letters, including the one that we were just reading to you. Also, there were photos of the guns that you mentioned. This is also new in the filings. This is a colored picture of the gun. It also shows pictures of 11 bullets and that extended magazine scope. Also, some new information, Jim, coming from these filings has to do with the search of Routh's car. They apparently found six cell phones. And included in one of those cell phones was a search. They found a search that he had done on Google from how to get from Palm Beach County to Mexico. Palm Beach County is where Trump International Golf Club is and where we are today. Also, there was cell phone data that actually puts Ryan Routh around Mar-a-Lago and around Trump International Golf Club many weeks before this incident occurred, starting on August 18th and going until September 15th, which was the day of the incident. Apparently he had been around that area multiple times according to the prosecution's filing. And also there was a list of dates and venues, a handwritten list that officials got their hands on, apparently, from Ryan Routh allegedly from him. This would be showing Trump's events that he had both past and future events, some leading up to this 2024 Election Day. Also, there was detail in this filing about Routh's position where he was at Trump International Golf Course. The filing says that he was, quote, directly in line with the very next hole. Jim, as you know, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole at Trump International and Secret Service was in their golf cart looking along the fence there. They were one hole ahead of him trying to secure the area. That would be the sixth hole where they spotted that rifle allegedly belonging to Ryan Routh sticking out through the fence. So, they are now saying that he was directly in line with the six hole, which is interesting because Secret Service has said that he never fired a shot at the former president. It was when the Secret Service then fired on him that he fled. Jim?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. MARK ROBINSON (R-NC), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We're for small business people. We're here for all those parents out there that are losing their children to fentanyl. We're here for all those people out there that are struggling to keep their small businesses open. We're here for the people who are -- we're here for the people who are struggling to get their children a decent education. We're not here to talk about 15 or 20-year-old salacious false lies. They don't want to talk about what's going on right now. They want to talk about what possibly happened 15 years ago. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was in Wilmington on Saturday. He did not invite Lieutenant Governor Robinson to appear with him on stage. Robinson had a small public event at a speedway instead in a different part of the state, didn't even mention Robinson by name at that. And this is someone who we, at one point, called Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids. This is a person who had a speaking position at the RNC earlier this summer. And so while he is trying to focus on the campaign, I will tell you that other Republicans here in the state of North Carolina are very concerned about that investigation as well as the campaign shakeup.",

[10But, again, Donald Trump has not said anything about it at all, remaining completely silent. And we have absolute faith in our reporting that these are Mark Robinson's words from this porn forum. Now, Donald Trump, I am told, is not likely to invite Mark Robinson to any former future events. He is expected to be in North Carolina again later this week. We shouldn't see Mark Robinson with him, if that holds, him not inviting him to any of these events. But in terms of disavowing him or disavowing what Donald Trump himself has said about Mark Robinson, we haven't seen any indication that is happening. Now, look, when it comes to the ticket, asking him to get off the ticket, that's not possible. We know that the ballots have already gone out, those military ballots, as well as absentee ballots with Mark Robinson's name at the top of the ticket. But there is huge amount of concern, as Diane said, among Republicans that this is going to hurt Donald Trump If you look at the most recent polling The New York Times put out today, it is well within the margin of error. It has Donald Trump leading by about two points, again, within the margin of error. Neither side Harris or Trump is going to take that for granted. They want to win the state of North Carolina, which has gotten increasingly closer since Kamala Harris was boosted to the top of the ticket. This could hurt him. The question is, what would hurt him more him coming out and disavowing Mark Robinson or just leaving it alone? And it clearly as at this point, the campaign thinks just not saying anything is the right move for the former president.",

Even though he was speaking before him, they were going to have someone else or a voice of God introduce Donald Trump, which seemed like a very determined or very specific clarification that they were making there. They don't want them to be lumped together. But, as you said, he has praised Robinson multiple times.

He is sticking with his campaign and vowing to come after this network, as several of his aides are bailing ship, though. They are, at this point, saying they're not going to stay with the campaign and are resigning from working for his candidacy. Let's discuss now with CNN Political Commentators Maria Cardona and Shermichael Singleton. Shermichael, let me start with you.

I've text with a few folks in North Carolina to sort of get an understanding of the lay of the field there. And from what I've been told, people in the state party were worried about Robinson for months now, and many of them wanted the party to back Mark Walker, the former congressman and pastor, who they believed would have been a far more formidable opponent to the Democrat, potentially even winning the seat maybe, right? Instead, the party decided to go with Robinson because he had the support of the sort of populist base with the Republican voters there. The former president obviously endorsed him, so that certainly helped as well. But here you go finding a candidate who is a liability, he's embattled, He's likely jeopardizing down ballot seats with congressional races, as well as state houses and state senate seats as well.",

And as I was saying to Dianne Gallagher a few moments ago, this reporting is so bad, why are these staffers leaving the campaign? Why isn't Donald Trump bringing them up on stage at a rally at this point in the campaign?I mean, this -- you know, you look at this battleground map right now.

Talk about it anyway, because, I mean, Trump, according to this, polling ahead by five percentage points in the battleground state of Arizona, one of the things that we should note, and I don't know if we can show this number, I want to put this up on screen, Latino voters have moved away from Harris in Arizona.

If I'm looking at this race electorally, you got to win Georgia, you need to keep North Carolina Arizona, Nevada, and a victory in Pennsylvania, which is still really tight. It's a little above 270.So, if I'm the campaign, I'm focusing on all of those states. I'm obviously making sure I have ads penetrating the Latino community, Spanish-English ads, talking not only about immigration, because I do think a lot of Hispanic-Americans, Latino-Americans care about immigration, but also education and also health care.

And what this campaign has done is that they have gone out with the messaging about how the Harris campaign and the Harris as a candidate and her administration are the ones who are going to be focused on giving Latino families, working class, families, middle class, families, the tools to, like she says, not just get by, but get ahead.
