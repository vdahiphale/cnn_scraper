Pennsylvania, Harris up two. Again, close races. But blue, not red, you jump over here with me to the sunbelt battleground states, you see a little blue at the top in Nevada, plus one. We don't have any new polling from there. But you look at North Carolina, Trump up by less than a point, Arizona in the average, Trump up by two. Georgia, Trump up by two in the average.So, in the sunbelt battlegrounds, more red than blue, predominantly red. In the Great Lake battleground, predominantly, in fact, all blue.

Back in 2020, 81 percent of Donald Trump voters were white. Look at where we are today. It's just 77 percent. The non-white percentage jumps up from 16 percent to 20 percent. And if you know anything about those sunbelt battleground states is that they are more diverse than those Great Lake battleground states. In the southwestern they're more Hispanic than they are nationwide. In the southeast, in North Carolina and Georgia, they are more African- American than they are nationwide, John.And I think the real question here is, what does this mean for the electoral map, because that's what we're all interested in. And it is - look, folks, it's just as tight as it can possibly be, because if the polls are exactly right, yes, Kamala Harris carries these Great Lake battleground states. But, of course, Donald Trump carries North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, and that leads to 276 electoral votes for Kamala Harris to 262 for Donald Trump. But that is only if the polls are exactly right. You saw back in slide two how close these states are. The bottom line is, we're just going to continue to mention this over and over and over again.

That's why we see her returning to Pennsylvania and campaigning out west in the coming days, and needling the former president, goading him into participating in an additional debate.

The Israeli military is amping up its airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across the country.Let's get right to CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, great to see you. I can give you a sense of the scope of this air campaign. Every dot here is somewhere that Israel has hit in the last couple of days. It's interesting because this follows the attack on the explosive pagers and walkie-talkies we're showing you right here. How do you think, General, that this attack has impacted or influenced this air campaign that we're seeing right now? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Good morning, John. Hey, this is exactly the key point, that the attack on the beepers, the walkie-talkies causes a communications breakdown within Hezbollah. Once any terrorist group has a communication breakdown, they start scrambling. They try and find new ways to communicate. And when they do that, they open them up - open themselves up for operational security requirements and problems. So, the chatter that's going on within Hezbollah after they've lost some of their main ways to communicate has caused Israel to pick up more intelligence in terms of what they're doing because they've become more open sourced. So, there were 150 strikes the day after those - the walkie-talkies were hit. That tells me, because I've done this in combat myself, that there was a lot of movement by Hezbollah forces, a lot of attempts to use couriers and other methods of communication. So that opens them up for signals intelligence and for Israel to strike. The day after the walkie-talkies were hit, there were over 150 fighter jets, Israeli fighter jets, in the area striking multiple targets. They found some areas where cruise missiles were being launched from inside of houses in Lebanon. And they have taken those houses and destroyed them with air attacks. One hundred and fifty jets in areas of the Gaza, Lebanon and also operating in Judea and Samaria to strike those targets where Hezbollah terrorist and others are communicating.",

One area that has not been hit extensively, of course it did happen last week, the targeted attack in south Beirut, no widespread attacks around Beirut. Do you think that will last, or do you think Israel will target? I mean Hezbollah is ensconced in certain neighborhoods around Beirut, where tens and tens of thousands of people live.",

And the other thing that you're talking about with those dots you've placed in terms of where Israel hits, coincidentally correspond to where missiles are being launched from. And they have - they strike targets where they get intelligence.But the strikes inside of Beirut, like the one last week against the Radwan (ph) force meeting with Ibrahim Aqil, which killed allegedly about 36 terrorists leaders, tells me that that's their headquarters. And again, I go back to the communication. The frontline forces shooting the missile, shooting the artillery, shooting the rockets are talking to those leaders that are stationed in Beirut. So, once you get the communication linkage and the signals intelligence gives you a location of the leaders of the Radwan force, then you can strike them. And that's what Israel has been doing as more intelligence starts coming into their headquarters.",

They can go a lot farther than most of what Hezbollah uses to strike in the area just south of the border, but they haven't. You're right, they haven't used the hundreds of thousands of missiles. And I think they're waiting for a cue from Iran. They have been told, standby. If Israel does more things against Iran, then I think you're going to see Hezbollah become very active.And that's some of the preemptive strikes by Israel inside of the Lebanese territory, striking against some of the rockets that are being set up, especially some of those cruise missiles, which I talked about earlier.

Five people were killed in that vessel. A Coast Guard panel is in the middle of a two-week hearing to investigate what happened. Earlier testimony portrayed the company as prioritizing profits over science and safety.Dwyane \"The Rock\" Johnson trying to give traumatized students from Apalachee High School some joy. Those students endured, as you know, a deadly school shooting that killed two students and two teachers earlier this month in Georgia. \"The Rock\" was in the Atlanta area working on a project, so he met them on a sound stage and shared photos and video on Instagram. One of the posts said, \"sometimes one of the best paths to beginning the healing journey is through our smiles, laughter, and joy.\" All right, speaking of smiles, laughter, and joy, meet Pesto. Look at that big boy. The adorable king penguin chick who's making waves at an aquarium in Australia. At just nine months old, he's already 50 pounds. This little guy has outgrown his parents. The average sides, by the way, of a king penguin, 37 pounds. Photos of Pesto hovering over his parents have gone viral. He eats about 30 fish a day. Way more than the typical adult penguin. Whoo, he's so cute. All right, don't have enough ways to communicate? Never fear. There are more emojis on the way. There's an exhausted face, a fingerprint, a purple splatter, a root veggie, a bear tree, a harp, a shovel, and a flag for a remote island in the English Channel called Sark Island. The tired face was voted most anticipated emoji. There is actually a non-profit group that oversees emojis and must approve new ones. Now that these have the seal of approval, you should start seeing them over the next few months. What do you do with the harp? Oh, you're harping on it. Stop harping on this issue. I don't - there's a lot of things.",
