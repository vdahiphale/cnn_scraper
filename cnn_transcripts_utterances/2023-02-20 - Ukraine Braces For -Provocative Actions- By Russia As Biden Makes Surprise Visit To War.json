I'm Pamela Brown, in for Erin Burnett tonight. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. And tonight, ready for anything, Ukraine's military preparing for provocative acts by Russia to mark the one-year anniversary of its invasion, and telling Russia its air force will be ready 24/7 to respond. The warning as President Biden made an unprecedented surprise visit to Kyiv to meet with President Zelenskyy, sending a painful reminder to Putin of how his invasion plans have failed. The visit also stinging Russian troops already dealing with major morale issues. A Telegram account managed by Russian military bloggers noting Biden has done something Putin has not, saying, quote, almost a year after the beginning of the special military operation, we are waiting in the Russian city of Kyiv for the president of the Russian Federation but not for the president of the United States. And the man Putin has turned to in hopes of winning this war is also now complaining he lacks the necessary equipment. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner Group, the brutal private mercenary group, saying this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator):  All the questions I raised about ammunition, unfortunately, stay completely unresolved. And it is the most serious problem.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Pamela.First of all, they're making a big deal out of the fact that the White House didn't notify the Russians. And essentially there are some here in Russia who are essentially claiming that it was the U.S. asking for permission for President Biden to come there into Ukraine. It was quite interesting because the former president of this country, Dmitry Medvedev, who also is the second in command of National Security Council, he essentially said that president Biden needed security guarantees from Vladimir Putin. However, there are also some who view that very differently. There are some pretty prominent military bloggers here in Russia. And they've become a lot more important as this war in Ukraine keeps dragging on, who clearly sees that as a sign of weakness by Vladimir Putin who are essentially saying, look, Russia claims that it can strike Ukraine at any point in time. And yet there was nothing that the Russians could do to stop President Biden from going to the Ukrainian capital and speaking with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. So, certainly, there is some dissent on the part of some hard-line Russians here as well. However, as far as the messaging itself is concerned, essentially what the Russians are saying is that they believe that this shows that the U.S. is essentially part of this conflict, a party to this conflict. That's what some analysts have said. And that's the sort of messaging that we've seen from the Kremlin, also from state-controlled TV here in Russia as well over the past couple of months as things have been difficult on the battlefield for the Russians. We just saw that in Alex's report. They've essentially been saying, look, we're not only up against Ukraine in all this, but also against NATO and especially the United States with all those Western weapons coming in. And we do believe, Pamela, that's also a lot of what we're going to see tomorrow in Vladimir Putin's speech. One thing, though, I think is important for our viewers to know that we, that we're on the ground here in Russia, we get the feeling about all this, there is no indication that Vladimir Putin is anywhere near backing down. In fact, it seems as though Russians are gearing up for a very, very long war, Pamela.",

You're right there in Kyiv. It has been nearly a year, hard to believe, since Putin invaded your country. Almost a year. Yet today, it wasn't Putin in Kyiv. It was President Biden with President Zelenskyy, which is notable because a year ago all expectations were that by a lot of the military experts were that Russia would've taken over at least Kyiv, that hasn't happened.

What do you think we are most likely to see from Russia if Ukraine is right?MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  If Russia chooses to celebrate this first-year anniversary of combat in Ukraine, I think we need to walk through what's not going to happen. There won't be a nuke blast. I don't think that's a zero probability, but it's incredibly low. It's essentially improbable. I think what we might see is what we've seen in the past, which is an onslaught of probably missile and rocket attacks from distance, and an increase in the use of drones and maybe some air power as well. I think that's how it makes sense to me that's probably how Putin would probably choose to engage because he can do that, it would increase his narrative. And also, as the Ukrainians have demonstrated before, an incredible ability to shoot all that down. But if you get a couple of those drones through, then the narrative for him becomes a real positive and a real plus. So I would think something like that would occur.

We have not once asked for any military intervention by other countries, by other armies. Ukraine and army is fighting and we have been pretty successful. We have been much more successful than anybody else in the world, including, of course, Putin expected us to be. So I do think that there is a clear path to end of this war, and this clear path is unfortunately saying that with a very heavy heart, I go through the military lines. That is why support for Ukraine is so critical right now. And I very much hope that this visit from President Biden to Kyiv today will also lead to some very practical results, that will lead to increased weaponry to Ukrainian Army, because we have proven that this has results. We do hope that next time President Biden will be taking decision on the long-range missiles, on the fighter jets to Ukraine, he will remember his visit to Kyiv. And he also had to witness hearing the air raid sirens and remember that this is the military that millions of Ukrainians have been living under and this is the reality that needs to stop.

Saturday's missile one of many on display just last week, a record number of ICBMs, more than any military parade in North Korean history. Kim ordered mass production of ICBMs earlier this year. The parade featured new missiles and a new face, Kim Ju-ae, Kim's daughter, believed to be just 9 years old. She began appearing on state media three months ago, fueling speculation she's being groomed as the next North Korean leader.

And, to me, and I've worked for several presidents, he is the closest we've had to a renaissance man as president. He was a public servant who was a nuclear submariner. He was the head of his county board of education, state senator, governor, 39th president, a painter, a poet, an author of 30 books, an engineer, a fly-fisherman, a great woodworker, a humanitarian, built homes for Habitat for Humanity. He is a preacher at a Sunday school. Created the Carter Center, which is a model for now former presidents as an active institution that monitors over a hundred elections, that has cured two African diseases.
