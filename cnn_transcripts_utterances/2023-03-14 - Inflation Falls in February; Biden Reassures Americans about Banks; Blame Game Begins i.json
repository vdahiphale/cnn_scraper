So, you're paying more for just about everything, but those price increases are cooling, and I think that's important here. When you look at the trend is your friend, Jim, as I always say, you can see that line chart very clearly showing peaking on the inflation front. This is, I think, good news for the Fed because last month it was a little hotter than we expected month to month and this time it's just exactly in line, which I think gives the Fed a little bit of room, in light of this banking instability, to be able to maybe have a lighter Fed rate increase next time around. The Fed next meets, of course, March 22nd. Let me look inside these numbers for you to show you, food prices up 9.5 percent year over year. Anybody who's going to the grocery store, I mean this is kitchen table economics, you know that this is still tough. Gasoline prices down a little bit, but shelter up. And the government noting, and I think this is important, noting that 70 percent of the overall price increase in that CPI number is because of lodging, is because of shelter.

You can have the strongest banking system since 2008 and you can still have more bankruptcies.

We're probably going to get some more answers.But last night Republicans did hold a call with their leadership to discuss the path forward and really the messaging path forward of how they want to discuss these issues. I got the sense from talking to members that there isn't a lot of appetite on the Republican side to look at a legislative fix, perhaps to go back to some of those rollbacks to Dodd-Frank that happened in 2018 and perhaps make some changes around the edges. Does that start to develop over the next couple of days and weeks if this starts to intensify? I think that that's possible. But right now Republicans really making it clear they're going to sit on the sidelines when it comes to legislative fixes. Meanwhile, they're more than happy to blame the Biden administration for increasing interest rates really quickly, arguing that that plus excessive spending and inflation concerns caused a situation where Silicon Valley Bank was just really vulnerable and, therefore, failed. So that's what you're hearing from Republicans. Meanwhile, you have people like Elizabeth Warren, who has been on the outsized voice on this issue for a long time, arguing that there are changes that need to be made legislatively. She also sent a letter to the former president of SVB arguing that she has some questions for him that she wants answered by the end of the month.

We have really watched this storm change with you with every live shot this morning, going from the rain, to now pretty heavy snow that we're seeing there. And it's going to last for a little while. DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, these snowflakes are massive and they're piling up very quickly. That's a great note because it started out as rain, a very cold, wet, miserable rain this morning. But now that it's transitioned over, we're getting about two to three inches an hour and it's picking up in intensity. You can literally squeeze the rain drops out of this. I just want to give you a perspective of where we've been at all morning. The crews here at the salt barn for Worcester County are working overtime filling up the salt trucks as well as the roadway clearing machines that just -- doing their best efforts to try and keep up with these impressive snowfall rates. But as heavy as this snow is, we're going to start seeing the winds pick up. And, remember, some of the trees starting to bud here. So we're going to get that snow load that is going to make the potential for that combination of wind and snow to bring down tree limbs. Power outages are going to spike. You already mentioned over 200,000 customers without power. I want you to get to the radar really quickly because I want to show you just how hair pin precision the forecast for this is. Right along the coastline, near Boston, this is rain. They've got that warm nose, the influence from the ocean waters. But just inland, where I'm located, Worcester, Berkshires, the Catskills, this is ground zero for the heaviest snow. One to two feet anticipated as this nor'easter takes grip. And we are seeing the impacts on the roadways. The Massachusetts Turnpike, for instance, being snow covered the further inland you travel. Seeing the impacts at the airports as well with LaGuardia currently having a ground stop as they deice planes and deice the runways. So, this storm really starting to crank up along the east coast.

So, it was just at that taxi on the way to takeoff, and that's usually 10 or 15 miles per hour. And then the nose gear just kind of came off, moved over into the grass. Otherwise, here's the snow now. And Derek had it right on. I mean the line from snow to rain is now just set up in those Boston suburbs. And it is heavy rain. It is heavy snow. It is five to one snow, which means normally 7, 10, 10 inches of snow to an inch. Now we're only seeing five inches of snow to an inch of water, which means this is going to be heavy stuff to shovel. This is going to be back-breaking work to move what could be setting up to be a foot or a foot and a half of snow in some of these areas. When you get that kind of weight, you can get that weight on branches, on limbs, on your home. So, things can be coming down later on today with this weight of this snow. We're already seeing more than 100,000 people without power, and that number will likely grow because the wind is going to pick up as well. Winds are going to be in the ballpark of 50 to 60 miles per hour on top of some of this foot, foot and a half snowfall. So, here's the wind now even into New York, Pennsylvania, moving on up toward New England, even toward Maine. And some of this, again, this afternoon and this evening, gusting to 50 or 60. And that's why we're seeing so many potential outages here across with impacts significant across New England for today. Now, a lot of people along the coast saying, hey, it's just raining, but, wait, because after sunset this is all going to get colder and this line between rain and snow is going to start to creep toward Boston.
