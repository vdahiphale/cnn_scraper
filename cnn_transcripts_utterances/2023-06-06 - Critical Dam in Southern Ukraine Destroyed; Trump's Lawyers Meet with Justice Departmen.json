Good morning.We begin with this major dam in Russian occupied southern Ukraine destroyed just hours ago, the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River prompting evacuations and fears of large scale devastation. I want to bring in CNN's Sam Kiley live in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Sam, what's happening here? Russia and Ukraine are blaming each other what looks like very serious destruction. What do we know about what happened and what's being done I guess to save lives and property here?",

Of course, the Ukrainians blamed the Russians, saying that the Russians have pre-mined it, in other words set explosives on that dam. And that the Ukrainian side of the dam had been regularly subjected to shelling. And so -- rather the Ukrainian bank. So that had been under Russian control.But nonetheless, 80 settlements the government here saying are being affected as this great -- vast amount of water is unleashed, all of the -- well, huge amount of the water of course that has been built up over the winter months, melt water building up the size of the Dnipro River now being unleashed downstream, likely to affect Kherson or elements, parts, districts of Kherson, the city recaptured by Ukraine from Russia last year. But I have to say, most of the flooding is likely to be to the east of the river according to experts and that is where it is Russian-held territory, Russian occupied territory, until recently at least territory, used by gun emplacements, artillery placements by the Russians, to shell places like Kherson and other West Bank Ukrainian held parts of the river. Now, the Russians are saying that it was not them that was behind this and another thing very crucially here, that the water supply for Crimea is for the time being secured. But that in the long term simply isn't the case. Once the dam is blown, there is a water -- a fresh water canal that links that dam to Russian occupied Crimea and over the long term, that, a various large region of occupied territory, will be very, very seriously struggling for water.",

A source tells CNN the pilot was seen slumped over in his seat. That is prompting investigators to focus on a loss of cabin pressure as a possible cause for the crash. Four people died including the pilot, Jeff Hefner, a mother, Adina Azarian, along with her 2-year-old daughter Aria and their nanny. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  New details on the crash from that private jet in Virginia that prompted an emergency fighter jet response. A source telling CNN the pilot of the Cessna Citation was observed unresponsive and slumped over in his seat. The NTSB is now on site in central Virginia going through what's left of the wreckage, with another source saying investigators are now most interested in hypoxia, lack of oxygen, as a possible cause of the crash. The twin engine jet went hundreds of miles off course, including passing over the D.C. area into restricted airspace. Investigators describe highly fragmented wreckage in very mountainous terrains.",

And, you know, there is a reason why the Department of Justice empanelled a grand jury in the southern district of Florida. This was news to all of us. We just found this out.
