El Al is probably one of the only ones that is reliable, but there are very few, very few seats for people. At first, we were seeing tons of people coming in because the reservists were coming in from all over the world. But going out is a different thing for families who want to leave.And particularly for Americans, there's a large contingent of Americans who are here. About 20,000 of them contacted the State Department, not necessarily to leave, but to get information, and some of them should get information to try and leave Israel because they're having such a hard time over the past week trying to get out. It just wasn't working. What we have noticed today is this ship, which is the Rhapsody of the Seas, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, and basically the United States has asked to use the ship in order to take Americans out, we've seen mostly families, to be honest. It's mostly families with small children who are making the decision to leave. This ship holds more than 2,000 passengers, but we've only seen a few hundred Americans. And again, it is oftentimes a mother, father, and three children, or two children, who are leaving. Often the parents feel very strongly that they want to make sure that their kids are safe, are secure. There is a lot of conflict in leaving, as well, though. The families sort of trying to figure out what the right thing to do is. For many of them making sure their kids are safe and making sure their kids do not feel afraid, as many of them have expressed, is the most important thing for these families, who some feel they should stay because they want to be here to help the country as it goes through this cycle of war. But it is remarkable to see this, having to use a ship. But I just want to get out of the way, just let you just kind of get an idea of just how big this ship is. I mean, it is a proper cruise ship that has all the accouterment onboard. And we are seeing, it is about to leave. It has been here since this morning, waiting for people to board, and then at 2:00 is the cutoff. It is now, let's see, it is now 3:00. So you notice, there is no way to get on now. It's no longer available to actually board because people were supposed to be here by 2:00. They are very close to leaving. They have just taken some of the ropes away, and, actually, I think it is moving back just a tiny bit. But, yes, this is the way that people are evacuating Israel. Every family we spoke with, by the way, says that they will be back. They are not leaving forever. Erin?",

But families desperate for refuge are still trapped in the war zone. The dead and injured flooding a healthcare system on the brink. More than 2,600 Gazans killed so far, just over a quarter of them are children, according to Palestinian officials. And a week long siege is strangling the enclave, the UN says amid fears food, fuel, water, and medical supplies may soon run out. Some two million people are crammed into this 140 square mile territory. Now many of them pushed into an even smaller corner of the enclave. About half the population are children. There are not enough shelters to house the sheer number of civilians, and even those who do find spaces in overwhelmed schools turned refugee centers, it is little comfort to the youngest victims.

But what's clear, and we've heard from the Egyptian Foreign minister in a statement, that there has been \"no progress made\" on any opening for any reason, at the Rafah Crossing. And as you know, there's only two crossings, one is Rafah into Egypt, and one up in the north is the Erez Crossing into Israel, where there's obviously no humanitarian or any other movement as Israel braces for what looks like a ground offensive there. So what the Egyptians are saying, that they don't want to open it until Israel agrees to allow humanitarian aid in, that hasn't been agreed to yet. And others say that they can't open it because the bombing around the Rafah Crossing has made the roads impassable, they can't be used. So it's unclear exactly what the exact reason is. Now Palestinians are saying, and other Arabs are saying who I've been speaking to that they -- many of them do not want to move from Northern Gaza to the south A., because they don't want to leave their homes. They don't know how to survive there. They think, it is probably just as dangerous in the south as in the north. But many are concerned that they may never be allowed to go back to their homes in Gaza City and in Northern Gaza after any war is over. They're worried about that. There are Arab leaders who are concerned that if the aim is to, you know, push Palestinians into Egypt, first, Egypt doesn't want that because they don't want to have a mass influx.
