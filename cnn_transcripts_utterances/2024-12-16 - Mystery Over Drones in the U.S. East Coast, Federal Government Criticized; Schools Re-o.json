Just ahead, after weeks of mysterious drone sightings in the US Northeast, there are still no real answers, and frustration is growing.A step toward normalcy in Syria, schools reopen a week after Bashar al-Assad was overthrown, a challenge now rebuilding the country after more than a decade of civil war. And Israeli authorities say they have arrested multiple spies working for Iran recently. But to their surprise, many of them are Israeli. Good to have you with us. The U.S. government is facing growing pressure for answers as swarms of mysterious drones have now been spotted across six northeastern states over the past month. Federal agencies have drawn bipartisan criticism for downplaying the concerns from state and local governments, even as they have acknowledged the unusual nature of the reported sightings. Still, the Homeland Security Department insists there is no evidence the drones pose a threat to communities. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer says he will co-sponsor legislation to give local authorities more drone detection tools. And he urged Homeland Security officials to deploy drone tracking technology to the region. In New Jersey, former Governor Chris Christie says he's even seeing drones hovering over his home.

      "sentences": "Well first let's start with Boston because the police department there tells us they arrested two people who were found to be flying drones dangerously close to the airspace over Logan International Airport. Now we are still waiting to hear more about what was behind these arrests But what we do know so far is that an officer spotted the drones and then was able to deploy drone detection technology to identify the drone history, the owners, and the locations from where they were being operated from.That led the police department to Boston Harbor Island. This is a largely uninhabited part of Boston. And once police arrived there, they were able to arrest two people. They initially tried to flee on foot, but they were eventually captured. One of them had a drone in their backpack and another is believed to have fled using a small vessel, a third person who the police are still looking for. Now, we don't know how much we are going to learn as a result of these arrests just yet and whether or not it will explain some of the sightings that have been reported in Boston. But the fact that the police department was able to use technology is certainly something that a lot of law enforcement officials and representatives across many of these different communities are talking about. Many of them are asking the federal government for more resources, for more information, so that they can take a more active role in detecting and intercepting some of these drones that are being reported. Now we have also heard from the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaking this weekend about the drone sightings and acknowledging that what people are reporting are definitely drones. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  There's no question that people are seeing drones, and I want to assure the American public that we, in the federal government, have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology, to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings. (END VIDEO CLIP) [02:04:58] PAZMINO:  So the Secretary says that he is sending resources to New Jersey where many of the sightings have been reported, but here in New York, Governor Kathy Hochul also telling us that the state is receiving some additional resources from the federal government after some drone sightings resulted in an airfield having to be shut down over this past weekend because of drone sightings over airspace at a local airport. Now, Governor Kathy Hochul issued a statement on Sunday saying, in part, \"In response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are deploying a state-of-the-art drone detection system to New York State. This system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigation.\" Now, something we're not clear on just yet is exactly what kind of technology New York is going to be receiving. If it's going to be anything like what Boston deployed and helped them to find the drones and conduct those arrests. I have been asking about this technology but I've been told that because this is now an issue of national security, the state is not going to share more information about what the technology is or where it will be deployed. However, I am told by sources familiar with the conversations that the governor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas held a few phone calls over the weekend to discuss the need for more resources. In the meantime, still a lot of frustration and a lot of questions being asked by local officials across the Northeast who want to do more and to make sure that their local governments have more resources to respond to these sightings.

That right there is the failure, that they don't know what this is, is clearly shows a large vulnerability to the U.S. infrastructure in the national airspace. We clearly see the war in the Ukraine and the combat development of unmanned aerial vehicles. And utilizing these and that we know that foreign adversaries have ships and vessels that can deploy drones into different air spaces. We don't know what these are and it's showing a clear vulnerability.

And for that support to arrive in Syria, sanctions need to be lifted. But we're not only talking about sanctions. We're also talking about delisting Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham from the terrorist list.

      "sentences": "We had an incredibly active weekend of weather in California. We had an EF-1 tornado confirmed in Scott's Valley. That sits about an hour south of San Francisco.We had 90-mile-per-hour winds in that twister, and it was able to snap trees, downed power lines and overturned cars, injuring some people. Now, this is incredibly rare for the Bay Area. I mean, we're talking only nine tornadoes on average happening here in California. The storm was so powerful. We had winds up at 78 miles per hour in Monterey, 83 mile per hour gusts at the San Francisco airport. That was clocked during a tornado warning that was triggered in the San Francisco Bay Area, their first ever tornado warning in history. No tornado was confirmed out of this, but those 80 mile per hour gusts did do some damage to trees and power lines there as well. That storm working its way east. But we have another one that's already on its way in, and atmospheric river will develop as we go into the week. So, more rain and snow is likely. We're looking at a level four out of five when it comes to impact for the atmospheric river, meaning it could be potentially hazardous. Some of that rain will be beneficial, but with the amount of rain coming in a short amount of time, we could be looking at some hazardous conditions. I mean, look at how healthy these rain chances stay as we go into the workweek, especially Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, for a place like Eugene, Oregon, 2 to 4 inches of rain is likely some isolated totals up to six inches possible. You can see all that moisture starts to move in as we go into the workweek starting on Monday. Rain and snow from Washington down towards Oregon and northern California, even as that clears, another round comes in. Going into Tuesday as the atmospheric river continues to pump in some of that moisture. Overall, rain totals will be about two to four inches, some of those totals up to six inches are possible. And we're going to add to the snow depth in the mountains as well. Another one to two feet of snow possible on top of what they already got. Winds will also be gusty as well. That could cause some problems with power outages. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
