We know some specific examples. We've been digging while we were in the minority. We certainly now, in January, will have a lot more authority to be able to obtain information. So, I believe our first hearing will be about Covid funds. We certainly want to try to identify any waste and if there's any possibility to claw it back, we want to do that. So that's going to be a priority. We're concerned about the southern border. And we believe that it's a disgrace, honestly, what's happening at the southern border. We need to secure that southern border and we've been communicating with whistle-blowers about the southern border. So, that's obviously going to be a priority, too.

If you're president and you run -- you have a big business empire that's doing business all over the world, you become president, we probably need more disclosure laws.So, I think, at the end of the investigation into the Biden influence pedaling.

Now, luckily, cats always land on their feet, but the translator receiving some criticism because, well, probably could have been a little bit nicer to that cat.All right, elsewhere in the NBA last night, we had a thrilling finish to the Jazz and Warriors. Golden State was up by four with just 13.3 seconds left. But Utah's Malik Beasley's is going to hit a three right here to cut the lead to one. [06:55:03] Then, after a timeout, on the inbound, Utah's Nickeil Alexander-Walker steals the ball away from Jordan Poole, they get the ball up to Simone Fontecchio for the dunk in the final seconds. The Warriors lose in heartbreaking fashion to the Jazz, 124-123. And, Kaitlan, the Jazz had a record of 1 and 118 over the last 25 seasons when they were down by four or more with under ten seconds to go. So, there you go, that's how probably that win was.",
