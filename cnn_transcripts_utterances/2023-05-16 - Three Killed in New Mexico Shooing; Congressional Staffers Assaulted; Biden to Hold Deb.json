The U.S. Capitol Police, at this moment, says there's no known motive, but the congressman, however, in an interview with CNN, he says he believes this is something likely more about a mental illness.Now, the suspect is 49 years old. And according to his own father is schizophrenic and has not taken his medication, according to his father, for three months. Now, the congressman says the suspect had contacted his office in the past before. He had reached out for help to the office on a particular issue and that the staff had certainly sensed in those conversations with him that he made some bizarre statements, but that he never made any threats like this violent attack that unfolded yesterday. In an interview with CNN, Congressman Connolly says it was only the quick thinking of his staff that prevented many more in his office from being injured. The congressman notably was not there at the time. But he says that the suspect entered the office filled with an out of control rage, demanding to see him. Here's more of what he told CNN's Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): I don't think there is a motivation. I think we're talking about real mental illness. If you're a member of Congress and your office happens to be in the federal building, you know, the courthouse, you're going to have security. But if you're in a commercial office space, like me, you have no security. None. And what could go wrong with that? Well, we learned the answer to that question. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That really shows you the massive lift for lawmakers going into this meeting today. In part they can't even agree on whether or not they are making progress. Staff has been meeting continuously, including over the weekend, for the last several days, trying to figure out what the contours of a deal would look like. Meanwhile, there just isn't that much time. Biden leaves tomorrow for a foreign trip. We know, of course, that he can continue having conversations with key stakeholders over the phone. But it's important to remember that it takes time in the Congress to pass legislation, both out of the House of Representatives where Republicans and those on McCarthy's right flank want time to look over any proposal, and in the U.S. Senate, where floor procedure just takes a lot of time. And I know that sounds very dry to folks back home, but, Sara, it's so important to emphasize that they can't just snap their fingers, get a deal at the last minute and get this passed. It's going to take quite the lift. And it's going to take a lot more time than we certainly have looking at that potential date of June 1st as the x date for when the U.S. could default on its debt.
