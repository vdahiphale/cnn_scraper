And the judge had a big issue with this, particularly saying she wasn't sure if it was constitutional because it had a role for her in there. Sort of, ironically, they put that role in there thinking that it would avoid the politics of the situation in case there was ever any question of if he broke that agreement.You know, and also in this filing, over the weekend, Hunter Biden's lawyers saying, you know - they're kind of putting some blame on DOJ for mucking this up, saying that they have come to them to do plea talks and that they had written these agreements that the judge had questions with. And then, of course, now DOJ wanting to tear up. But one of Hunter Biden's attorneys, Abbe Lowell, was on CBS this weekend. Here's what he said.

You know, so where -- why now is still the big question that we don't have an answer from the Justice Department on of what was it that made it important just now to do this.

It basically says, anything to do with the Hunter Biden investigation, which is quite broad. And Kara's right, now that David Weiss has been named special counsel, he does have a bit more independence. It's not all that different from being a U.S. attorney, but he does have a bit more independence, separation from the attorney general.My big question again is, why? Why now? Why in a case that's been going on for five years, three days -- four days ago there was no need for a special counsel. Now there is? And what DOJ said is the reason is, quote, extraordinary circumstances. Now that's pulled out of the law.

You see a total of three homes that were destroyed in all of this. The gas crew company was dispatched to the scene immediately. They were able to determine that at this point that the system was operating as expected, though a final conclusion could take months.And we did learn overnight there had been at least two previous incidents. One house explosion last year that is still under investigation and then a deadly one that happened in 2008. I pulled up the final NTSB report. There turned out to be a excavation team that actually damaged a natural gas line outside of the home. That eventually led to the explosion. And when they say that it may take months to find out, it's not an estimation. It took about eight months for them to find out that one.",
