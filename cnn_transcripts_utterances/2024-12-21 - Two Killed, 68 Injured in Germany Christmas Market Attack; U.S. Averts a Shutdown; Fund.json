TAMARA ZIESCHANG, INTERIOR MINISTER, SAXONY-ANHALT STATE (through translator):  As far as we know now, there have been two fatalities and a large number of injuries. The perpetrator has been arrested. He is a 50 year old man from Saudi Arabia who entered the Federal Republic of Germany for the first time in 2006. He had a settlement permit and thus a permanent residence and has been working as a doctor in Bernburg. According to our current knowledge, he acted as a lone offender.

But what we've seen is the original bill that was backed by Trump was not able to get through, did not get through in the House. In fact, there were 38 Republicans in the House that voted against it. And so what we're seeing here is that Trump's hold on the Republican Party, while it is incredibly strong, it is not ironclad. But he, definitely, along with Elon Musk, were trying to maneuver things behind the scenes, mostly through social media. And Musk has become an incredibly powerful figure in American politics. And putting out information in this case, some of it was not truthful information about what was going on with the bipartisan deal. He was claiming that, falsely, that there was going to be aid to Ukraine in that deal. And, you know, he has over 207 million followers on Twitter. So he can have a very big influence.

In fact, you've already hearing about Elon Musk as a possible Speaker of the House, because you don't have to be a sitting member of Congress. Senator Mike Lee and Rand Paul floated this idea, along with house member Marjorie Taylor Greene. So he's already facing the type of scrutiny, attention and conflict that Kevin McCarthy faced when he was Speaker of the House.

That then will give you a sense of how much planning and whether others were involved. The assailant's -- the killer's ties to Germany were deep. He had been there almost 20 years. You are not talking of the sort of, you know, is it a Syrian refugee or is it a young person, you know, recently from another part of the country who got radicalized? It is that deepness of ties to Germany -- a profession; we don't know about family, presumably an income -- that is different about this. And so that is what they are going to be looking to. So it might be the ties to Saudi Arabia. It might be something related to Gaza and Israel, which has amplified a lot of protests in Europe and elsewhere. Or it could be something uniquely German. And we will determine whether it was politically motivated, given what is happening in Germany, or someone with just, you know, a particular reason for doing this. So all of those are still open. But it is the deepness of ties to Germany over a couple of decades. Either it was a radicalization from afar or it was something different. That is what I think investigators will be looking for, including his ties to people, contacts in other countries. If there had been sort of secondary weaponry to get the first responders -- they come to the car and then it blows up -- That's just a level of sophistication, a sort of level of knowledge. And also just creating even a rudimentary device would have been planning. Why wasn't that -- you know, why wasn't that caught? So when it was determined that there wasn't one, then people like me and the rest of the panel begin to think, OK, well, was this more spontaneous? What was this triggered by? Because it takes absolutely nothing to get into your car.

That's the scary thing about these car attacks.

They don't know that it's them but that's why there's big trash trucks in New York and Boston and elsewhere. Those are just ways to try to limit speed and an ability of a vehicle to get to large masses of people. That will be ratcheted up in the days to come because of this attack. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The plan extends government funding into March and includes disaster relief.But it doesn't include a debt limit suspension, which is something Donald Trump wanted. A source says Trump is disappointed that the deal couldn't include that debt ceiling hike. When lawmakers return to Washington in January, the incoming class will be the most closely divided House since the Great Depression nearly 100 years ago. Republicans will hold a historically narrow margin, leaving them little room to maneuver. CNN's Phil Mattingly reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF U.S. DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: All 435 House races have been called. And we can say definitively that House Republicans, once again, have the majority, barely. And what do I mean by barely? I mean, to a historic degree, barely because when you pull up what the actual numbers are, 220 Republicans, 215 Democrats. That is a five-seat majority in the balance of power. And that means House Republican leaders can only afford to lose two of their members in a party line vote and still win that vote. And yet, that's actually a lot easier than how it's going to be. What do I mean by that? Well, House Republicans can thank the guy that many of them credit for helping them win the House majority, for making it even harder because Donald Trump is taking House Republicans to be in his administration. He started with Matt Gaetz, picked him to be his attorney general. That nomination or effort failed catastrophically, as was expected. But Gaetz, Gaetz resigned. That's minus one Republican. What about Elise Stefanik, close ally, New York Republican, Donald Trump's pick to be U.N. ambassador? She's expected to be confirmed by the Senate. That's minus two Republicans. And Michael Waltz, National Security Advisor for Trump, he doesn't have to be confirmed at all. He will start on day one with the administration. That means three House Republicans won't be there for a period of months likely, which means, if you do the math, take 220 minus 3 and this is where you end up, 217-215. If you thought losing two votes was the maximum and that would be complicated, try losing barely one. That would be borderline suffocation for any Republican leader at a historically difficult moment for House Republican leaders. What do I mean by that? Put this away for a minute because I want to pull up some context here. If you take a look at majorities at every scale over the course of the last five decades, like right here, you'll see after decades of Democratic dominance. Post Watergate, you got 149 seat majority at one point, back in 1977. You can track that down -- 100s, 100s, 80s, 70s, back to 182. That flipped when the chamber flipped, of course, when House Republicans took over in 1994. They didn't have a huge majority but 26 seats, not bad; 19-12. Narrow at nine, but then starting to pop back up. And we saw that toggle back and forth as both sides took majorities over a period of years until the most recent period, where a new trend started, right about there: 10 Democratic seat majority, then nine Republican seat majority, then five Republican seat majority. So let's take this away and go back to where we are right now because, again, was 220-215; at some point during this process, it's going to be 217-215. And that makes it really, really hard on one person in particular, this guy, Speaker Mike Johnson. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
