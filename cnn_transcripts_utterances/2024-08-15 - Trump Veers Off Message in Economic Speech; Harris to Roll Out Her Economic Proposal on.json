Max is off this week.It's 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Maryland, where U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks in the hours ahead. The focus, progress made on lowering drug costs. The event comes amid renewed excitement among Democrats since Harris launched her White House bid. A new Monmouth University poll finds 85 percent of Democratic registered voters say they're enthusiastic about the race, up from 46 percent in June. Enthusiasm among Republicans remains unchanged at 71 percent. And a separate poll shows 63 percent of Democrats say they'd be excited if Harris was elected president, compared to 57 percent of Republicans who say the same about Trump. Meantime, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump veered off message during an event in North Carolina as he delivered a speech meant to focus on the economy. But instead, Trump did what he's being urged not to do, lob personal attacks at Kamala Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What happened to her laugh? I haven't heard that laugh in about a week. That's why they keep her off the stage. That's why she's disappeared. That's the laugh of a crazy person. You know why she hasn't done an interview? Because she's not smart. She's not intelligent. All over the world, crime is down because they're taking their criminals and their people from mental institutions and they're putting them into our country because we have stupid people like Kamala and Joe running our country.

She understands that for too many families, prices remain too high and so wants to make sure that the American people understand the ways in which we can grow our economy and make sure that everybody has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead as we move forward here. And I think that will be in stark contrast from what we see out of Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He promised several things, making the economy better. However, it was pretty light on how exactly he would do things.One thing he said specifically was that he would commit, if he was elected, to cutting U.S. energy and electricity prices. Unclear exactly how he would do that, but important to note that he now has thrown that out there as something he is going to specifically do. Now, in terms of whether or not he stayed on message, he veered in and out. It was a little bit different than the excerpts we were provided, but that's not that surprising. It was only slightly longer than the campaign told us it would be. I'm going to be checking in with my sources, allies of Donald Trump's, to see what they think about this new model that they're testing out of these smaller venues, of these issue-based speeches, to see if that gives them any sort of hope or insight into the direction this campaign is going.

We know that the broader framework has certainly been agreed upon. That was our knowledge in early July.But, of course, Hamas will not be participating in these talks directly. We've heard from a U.S. official saying that, while the broader framework has been agreed upon, there are still significant sticking points, significant gaps between where Israel and Hamas currently stand on a number of key issues. And, of course, Hamas has said that they will be speaking to mediators afterwards if, indeed, there is a response from Israel that they feel is sufficient, if there are any significant developments. But we know that these sticking points have been an issue for some time now, including questions over the movement of Palestinians from southern Gaza back into parts of northern Gaza. That is something that Hamas wants to see without restrictions, without an Israeli military presence. And, of course, a crucial part of the current peace proposal on the table, as laid out by President Joe Biden in May, calls for the release of some Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Now, what Hamas doesn't want to see is Israel's demand for veto power over which Palestinian prisoners are actually released. And, of course, there is the crucial sticking point with regard to the border separating Gaza and Egypt, the Philadelphia Corridor, as it's known. Israel wants to maintain some sort of security presence, Israeli forces on the ground. That is something that Hamas has outrightly rejected, and that continues to be a key point of debate in these ceasefire negotiations. And, as we know, there has been that broader framework agreed upon, but according to officials and sources within Israel, it is understood and there is a feeling that the Israeli prime minister may also be sort of undermining the ongoing negotiations. We know, of course, that there are members of the coalition, hardline right-wing members of the coalition, who don't want to see a ceasefire deal struck, who have threatened to pull out if, indeed, a ceasefire is struck. So questions as to whether Netanyahu or whether Israeli officials are actually on board with getting a ceasefire struck at this point.",

Nada, thank you.Now, Columbia University's president has resigned months after pro- Palestinian protests gripped her campus. Egyptian-born economist Minouche Shafik said it had become difficult to overcome divergent views, saying she's been distressed by threats and abuse. In April, when talks began between the university protesters and -- the university and protesters broke down, some of them stormed a campus building. Shafik called in the police, who carried out arrests and made sure the encampments were not re-established. Now Hurricane Ernesto is gaining strength as it turns north and heads into the open Atlantic. The Category 1 storm leaves destruction and flooding in its wake after lashing Puerto Rico and knocking out power to half the island. U.S. National Hurricane Center predicts the storm could strengthen to a Category 3 storm by Friday. They expect Ernesto to slow down as it approaches Bermuda, dumping up to nine inches of rain on the island. Meantime, in the Pacific, Typhoon Ampil continues to grow stronger in warm waters as it surges towards Japan. Right now it's the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane with winds of almost 100 miles per hour, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It predicts the storm will only brush Japan's coast, but Tokyo and other coastal areas will bear the brunt of the heavy rain and hurricane-force winds in some areas. Well, after a short reprieve, the threat of wildfires is expected to return today in parts of Greece. At least one person was killed when gusty winds caused a fire to spread rapidly throughout the Attica region and onto the suburbs of Athens on Sunday and Monday. And those strong winds, dry conditions and higher-than-normal temperatures will be back today. That comes as Greece and 19 other countries across Europe are currently under heat alerts. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is Abul Baraa, the German-speaking TikTok preacher who is targeting and radicalizing young minds by answering seemingly innocent questions from his followers. In light of a foiled terror plot on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, there is renewed concern about online extremism among youth. The 19- year-old alleged mastermind of the attack was radicalized online, Austrian authorities say, though we don't yet know how. Abul Baraa has repeatedly denied any connection to ISIS and never openly calls for violence, but he is always testing boundaries online. If someone is, quote, \"bad,\" he says in this clip, then regardless if that person is Muslim or non-Muslim, this means death is better for them.

But on TikTok, where he has more than 82,000 followers, he is undeterred and prolific, even responding to recent media reports linking him to the Taylor Swift concert terror plot.
