The pilots did a really good job here, air traffic control did a really good job here, the flight attendants did a great job, they really had to coordinate, although at a lot of chances, a lot of places in this in this narrative, they couldn't talk to one another.

That is exactly what residents of Panama City Beach, where I'm located, woke up to this morning. Terrifying moments.This house literally taken off of its pylons and it is now supported by its neighboring home. Look at the neighbor's house and some of the paint that's actually been kind of etched off because of the power of the wind and the sand being picked up. And even here to the right side of this leaning building is another home without its roof. Well, that is the scary moments that people had to deal with this morning. There's even some condos here from this water spout turned tornado earlier this morning, one of several tornadoes that moved ashore along the Florida panhandle, ripping off some of the protective barriers on the outsides of the condos and the porches here. There are currently over 500,000 customers without power along the entire eastern seaboard. And this storm is kind of eyes set on the northeast with heavy rain and the potential for flooding. So yeah, this is a tumultuous day across the eastern seaboard -- Boris.",

Primary care physician and public health specialist Dr. Saju Matthew is here to discuss. Doctor, great to see you as always. What's your reaction to this study? How dangerous are these plastic bits?DR. SAJU MATTHEW, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, let me just tell you up front, you know, drinking out of a bottle of water should be a thing of the past, Boris and Brianna. And I'm telling you, we've always known that bottle water coming out of plastic bottles is harmful. But now this should put any doubts to rest. We're talking about nanoparticles, as you mentioned in the in the intro. These are tiny particles that we always knew existed, but now we can actually see them. And just to give us a perspective, about one million products of bottle water are sold every minute globally in the world. So this is really a global issue of consuming products that could be very dangerous. It can actually affect infertility. It can increase your risk of breast cancer. It could seep into our cells and digestive systems. So we really need to figure out ways to change our human behavior.",

Also, when we talk about plastic products, we have to think about toys. A lot of kids around the world play with plastic toys and children put these pieces in their mouths. And also, we have evidence to show, Brianna, that there is plastic even in placenta, even in human feces. So these nanoparticles are so dangerous for us as scientists because they can seep into the tiny cells. And over time, it can cause so many different issues.",

We're talking about food that comes out of plastic containers.And here's actually what makes it worse. You have a plastic container that's stored in the fridge. The cold temperatures will actually keep the plastic from seeping cells, just like our human body basically sheds cells every single day. When you take it out of the freezer or the fridge and you put it in the microwave, now the heat can actually cause that plastic to shed even more cells. And also, let's not forget that the human body temperature, Boris, is much higher than outside. So that also causes, if you will, the shedding of the plastic into our bodies and organs.",

How about looking at tap water in a very different realm? I'm a huge tennis player and I'm guilty as charged, but I'm definitely going to change my behavior. It's easy to get a bottle of water when you go out there in the heat than to actually put water, like, say, in a Yeti. But I think what we need to do is maybe add a filtration system to the faucet at the kitchen so that you're not worried that the tap water is contaminated. Also, remember that tap water is so much more tightly regulated than bottled water. We think of bottled water as maybe being more pristine and coming from springs, but that's not necessarily true. A lot of bottled water actually can come from tap water, just regular tap water. Dr. Saju Matthew, thank you so much for the time. Appreciate it.",
