So they're going through methodically all of this. For many people, Anna, they may have thought they're going to have to address the bias that he doesn't like Trump. Remember Necheles at one point in cross examination said, we'll get this straight. You hate Donald Trump. That's not the full story here, going through the why, the iterations, the change in his standing with Trump. It's part of the story they're trying to weave.",

You know, one of the things that we do as trial lawyers is we don't just think about, you know, what witnesses are we going to call? What evidence do we want to introduce?But what Once we decide that there's a witness we want to call, we have to think about how do we want that witness to tell their story in a way that's going to be most believable, most credible to the jury, and you've been talking about it all morning. Cohen has a lot of issues, right? He's got a lot of credibility issues. And I think what's really interesting is they decided to tell this chronologically.",

They're hearing Michael Cohen was sent back to solitary confinement. Now, this might be a very important moment in terms of not just trying to humanize, but in particular, to get across to the jury what his experience was in prison, what his experience was in jail. And also he's explaining that in addition to talking to the special counsel's office, he talked to also the local prosecutors, the DA's office for the first time while he was still incarcerated.The jury is hearing, remember that the DA's office that is actually bringing in the case, albeit a different head of that office now in Alvin Bragg, no longer Cy Vance. How might that be playing? Oh, also, excuse me, he also has been before the grand jury in this case, and the jury is hearing that he also got immunity. Excuse me. Go ahead. COMINSKY: Right, I mean, it's interesting to me because I will also say, you know, as we think about how's the jury perceiving this. I am also wondering why some of this is actually relevant. Relevant to him, relevant to his credibility. I mean, you have to wonder why does it matter for this case having to do with falsifying business records that he went to solitary confinement. Obviously, it's understandable all of the things, right? His guilty plea, his sentence, those are all relevant to his credibility. But it's interesting some of the facts that the prosecutor's bringing out. And based on what we're hearing, I'm of course not there right now to see. But appears to be that there's not any objections to some of this. So it's interesting to me how the defense has decided to let some of this story come out. That's really been interesting to me as well. And when you talk about the jury's perception, one thing that I think has been really interesting about the defense's approach to Cohen's testimony so far is they have had very few objections. And I think the idea there is to show the jury, there is nothing about this guy that we are looking to hide from you. We want you to hear everything he has to say because all of it is incredible, it's not believable. And we'll have our chance, but you can go ahead and listen to his story right now.",

We're at a bit of a disadvantage in terms of the extent to which but they are -- some of them were -- had been sustained or overruled by the judge. There's a conversation happening right now as we are conversing, Adam,where he's talking about how he first met with the D.A.'s office. He wanted a letter sent that he had been cooperative, that to give him some advantage in being able to be released, or the terms of his conditions changed.The D.A.'s office said that they would provide a letter of cooperation, provided that the SDNY, the federal prosecutors, agreed to as much. They chose not to. Again, in New York, Testifying in front of the grand jury does confer automatic immunity, but he does say that Cohen said that seeking a letter did not impact him telling the truth to the DA's office or during his testimony to the grand jury. The jury is hearing all of this right now. What do you think is the motivation for the prosecution to bring all of this up? Is it to try to suggest that they were not simply going to do anything and everything to curry favor with Michael Cohen? ADAM KAUFMANN, FORMER EXECUTIVE ASST. MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Sure. There's a few reasons why they need to do that. One is, you know, on the one hand, prosecutors we've talked about bring up all the negative about the bad things about someone. But they also want to bring out any benefit that they conferred or discussed conferring to the defendant. So, you know, they don't want it to come out on cross examination that they were willing to send this letter to help out Cohen. [12:35:02] Then it looks like they're hiding it. So they're trying to bring that out now. Anything where they might have offered him a benefit, anything they did for him, they want to have come out on direct -- during the direct examination.",

To me, you know, bringing up the SDNY thing, I think, let's them demonstrate that while they were willing to make a record of Cohen's cooperation, they also were deferring to the prosecutors who had already prosecuted him. So I think to me it more distances them from Cohen a bit and puts him a little more at arm's length from the DA's office.

What did he do to turn them back on? Did he get a new phone and beyond? Cohen says that he used one of his older cell phones that had been seized by the FBI in order to record a conversation with the Bureau of Prisons. Hoffinger asks, at any time, would you alter or modify the audio recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump?To which Cohen says, no, ma'am. We are revisiting a topic that took place yesterday and one, of course, that Trump's defense team has been very clear that they want to try to create the impression that he altered that conversation, that it had been cut off mid-sentence. And the why, yesterday, you recall, Anna, that Michael Cohen offered an explanation, an incoming call had come in. Hoffinger gave, at that point in time, some corroborative details about a call being incoming and being registered on the call records.

Today, most likely with the thought in their mind that, you know, the longest we may be able to stretch this out will be through Tuesday afternoon, you know, if we're able to go that far, so this may be our final chance to sort of get through and think through all the issues. And they're clearly concerned they want to make sure that they're airtight with respect to that conversation, that reported conversation, and making it clear to the jurors that it was in no way altered.And as we know, a lot of this hinges on Cohen's testimony itself, his words itself, so while they have the chance, they want to have him say, he didn't do anything to this recording.

And Hoffinger here, we see began asking Cohen about his testimony in the New York attorney general civil fraud trial, Blanche objected and now the attorneys are side barring, trying to bring up that civil fraud trial, which was charged by -- recently in order to pay an enormous fine. Obviously, Trump's lawyers do not want him to do that. Speaking of Trump's lawyers, there was one thing I just wanted to point out, which was kind of interesting. You started on it with Alina Habba sending a note to one lawyer who sent it to another sent to another. Alina Habba is not a lawyer in this case. She's just there as a guest.

China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more than the rest of the world can absorb, and then dumping the excess products onto the market at unfairly low prices, driving other manufacturers around the world out of business.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

Michael Cohen talked about how in February 2021, he invited Stormy Daniels on his podcast, Mea Culpa, and he apologized to her. It was the first time they'd ever spoken.The jury has shown a post on Donald Trump's social media site, Truth Social, from March 15th, 2023, in which Trump references a convicted liar and felon. Cohen says this is the time of his testimony before the grand jury in that case in the business fraud case. Susan Hoffinger, the prosecutor, asks Michael Cohen if there came a time when he became aware Trump had been posting negative comments about him on Truth Social. Cohen says, I was. He says it in a whisper then he clears his throat, says again, I was. Cohen confirms that Trump brought a lawsuit against him, against Michael Cohen, for half a billion dollars. He eventually dropped it, as is not uncommon for Mr. Trump's more frivolous lawsuits. Cohen is asked if he regrets his past association with Trump. Michael Cohen said, I regret doing things for him that I should not have, lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal. I don't regret working with the Trump Organization, as I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass and I suffered the penalty, as has my family. Susan Hoffinger says she has no further questions. So, they're going to break for lunch right now, the court, and the cross examination will begin. Todd Blanche, we believe, is going to do that. That is Trump's -- one of Trump's attorneys in this case. That cross examination will begin after lunch. And let me ask the three lawyers on our panel. If you were Todd Blanche, how would you start your cross examination of Michael Cohen after lunch?",
