U.S. Special Counsel Robert Hur is about to testify on Capitol Hill after describing President Biden as a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. And Donald Trump against TikTok or is he for TikTok? The former president might have changed his mind about the Chinese owned app. Haiti's prime minister is stepping down as the country descends into lawless chaos. Ariel Henry says he will stay on until a new government can be formed. Regional leaders met in Jamaica on Monday to discuss a framework for the political transition. Henry has shown little ability to control the gangs that are running rampant in Port-au-Prince. The last straw may have been an attack on a prison earlier this month that resulted in the escape of 3,500 inmates. Henri pleaded for peace as he announced his resignation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ARIEL HENRY, OUTGOING HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My government will leave immediately after the inauguration of the council. We will be a caretaker government until they name a prime minister and a new cabinet. Haiti needs peace. Haiti needs stability. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the takeaway from the State of the Union was that he was fully capable of taking the second term, that according to voters who I spoke with on the ground in Atlanta, Georgia, where he held a rally over the weekend. And so they've been trying to build on that momentum as the president continues to hit the trail. But it's moments like today when memory and age are part of the dialogue and our front and center in a congressional hearing that really bring this issue back to the forefront for the campaign when they're trying to diffuse those voter concerns. Of course, it's March, it's a long road until November. But anticipate that Congressional Republicans will be attacking President Biden on all of these fronts today.

Now, Robert Hur led an investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents.The interviews show the president telling old political stories and at times showing moments of foggy memory and at one point forgetting what year his son Beau had died. Our Evan Perez broke the story. He's joining us now with a closer look at what is in that transcript. Hi there, Evan. Tell us more about what stood out to you in this interview. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Amara, this was an interview that lasted over -- it went over two days. It was about five hours. It was negotiated ahead of time between the president's attorneys and the Special Counsel Robert Hur. And what comes across in the transcript is, you know, obviously he doesn't remember how documents got from his vice presidential residence, for instance, to a home that he rented in Virginia, to his home in Delaware, or a private office at the University of Pennsylvania. He said he left a lot of the details of handling of classified information, returning them to their rightful place. He left that to his aides. And so that's one of the things that I think goes through all of the transcript. Now, the big one that you pointed out is the one where he doesn't remember his -- the year that his son, Beau Biden died. It's clear that Joe Biden brings it up in the interview, and he says specifically the month and day, May 30th. And then someone in the room says it was 2015. And so, that's one of the big things that I think you're going to hear a lot at the hearing that is happening in the next hour here in Washington, a discussion about exactly the relevance of his memory and why that should be something that I think everybody goes away from this hearing and this report from.

So there are a lot of questions about why he's sort of changing his mind now. And when I talk to Donald Trump's senior advisers, there's a couple of reasons they bring this up. One is that they said he's not completely reversing his position, that it's more skepticism over this potential bill. And part of it is because he really is afraid that if TikTok is potentially banned in the United States, that its users will migrate to Facebook. And Facebook is something that Donald Trump has criticized repeatedly over the past several years. He is not a fan of its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He believes that Facebook played a role in influencing the 2020 election. There are questions of whether that is true or not. And I also think it's worth remembering as well that in 2016, Facebook actually very much helped Donald Trump. And so, he has a very strange relationship with that social media platform. But the other part of this is political. Donald Trump recognizes that if Facebook were to be banned or something were to change and users across the country were to feel the effects, they would blame Joe Biden and that's what he wants. He recognizes young voters, especially our huge fan of the app. It is widely popular here in this country with young voters. And that's a demographic that Donald Trump recognizes he needs to peel away from Joe Biden in order to be more successful in a general election rematch in November. And I do just want to give some context as well about the timing of these comments. He actually first made this or showed the skepticism last week on Truth Social and it came after he had a meeting with a man named Jeff Yass, excuse me. He is a huge Republican megadonor. He has a major stake in TikTok, roughly $33 billion. And Donald Trump met with him at Mar-a-Lago last week as he continues to hunt for donors. So there's question of whether that could have had some influence on where these comments are coming from. Donald Trump himself said that he did not discuss TikTok with Yass, but there are questions of whether it may have come up or if he is trying to, you know, show this skepticism to appease Yass. So, I think there's a lot of questions of whether or not this -- his rhetoric around this potential bill could impact its passage. But from our conversations with Republicans on the Hill, they believe that they can move forward with this bill and have it be successful, at least in the House. There are questions of whether or not it could pass in the Senate. Amara?",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a classic Trumpian embrace of a strongman. At Mar-a-Lago, the former president hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and he heaped praise on Orban's style of leadership in videos posted on Orban's Instagram account. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He said this is the way it's going to be and that's the end of it, right? He's the boss.

Stocks on Wall Street start trading next hour.And for now, here's how futures are reacting to the numbers. Fed watchers are saying don't expect to see an interest rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joining us now to break down the numbers. Hi there, Vanessa. So what's the big picture for inflation in the U.S.? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: The big picture here is it's a bumpy road to get to that 2 percent target that the Federal Reserve is looking for. So on an annual basis, prices increasing just a little bit to 3.2 percent. On a monthly basis in February, prices ticking up to 0.4%, but that's the largest increase we've seen since September. Leading the way, though, on these price increases is shelter and gas, accounting for 60 percent of the monthly increase in February. So if you break it down, you have shelter rising 0.4 percent in February. Gas prices though, rising 3.8 percent. Some good news for Americans, though, food prices stayed flat at zero. So that's good news. If you're going to the grocery store, you're probably not going to see volatile price changes there. But gasoline, you know, in the last couple of months, we've seen it go from 307 a gallon to 340 a gallon. That is largely because of seasonal changes. Gas prices tend to move higher as you head into the spring months and summer months. But, of course, for everyday Americans, that's uncomfortable. No one wants to pay more for anything, let alone gas prices as people start to hit the road as the warmer months get going. But this is a pain point for the president, President Biden. No doubt. He has been relentless on encouraging Americans to realize that prices really have come down from the highs that we saw in 2022 when inflation was over 9%. But we haven't cracked the code to get below 3 percent. We're at 3.2 percent annually, according to this report. The president in other ways has tried to minimize the pain of prices on Americans by creating a task force to go after companies who are engaging in something called shrinkflation. He's also tried to crack down on junk fees. So fee extra fees that Americans are paying every single month. In terms of the Federal Reserve, Amara, the Federal Reserve is going to be looking at this closely. They have indicated that this would be a bumpy road to cool inflation. Obviously not the report that they want to see. You want to see prices going down, not up. But some encouraging news, slivers of hope on the food front, but really gasoline prices pushing this report up in February, Amara.",
