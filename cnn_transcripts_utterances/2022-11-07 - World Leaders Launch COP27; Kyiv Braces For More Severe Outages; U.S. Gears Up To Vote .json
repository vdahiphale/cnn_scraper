Tonight, world leaders launch COP27 where theU.N. chief has told the world we're on the highway to climate hell. Then, Winter weather sets in with no power in parts of Ukraine. And Kyiv's mayor tells citizens to prepare for the worst-case scenario. And later, on the eve of the U.S. midterms, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are not on the ballot, but they've got clear messages for voters. We are on a highway to climate hell. That is the dire warning from the United Nations Secretary-General, as the COP27 Climate   Summit kicks off in Egypt. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS:  And the clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives, and we're losing. Green house gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of the 193 countries that said we'll do that, 24 have delivered one right now. There seems to be a malaise, part of it has to do with the war in Ukraine, Putin's war that's created these energy shocks around the world. Part of it is, there are 76 degree days in November and are pleasant for some people around the world, the decision makers. So it's the human psychology of this -- of this crisis. But the longer it goes, the more expensive the price-tag is going to be. Humanity will end up paying for all of this, it's just -- you know, how dramatically, how painful that payment has to be, how suddenly. And what's telling, I think is Costa Rica along with Denmark in Glasgow was one of the first countries to form the beyond oil and gas alliance. They were going to say we'll be models to show life as we know it could be beyond fossil fuels. This year, they're moving away from that, saying they're really backing away and saying we'd rather focus on deforestation in the Amazon. Right now, even as they're getting record profits, the oil and gas multi- nationals, record-shattering profits, they're still getting billions in subsidies from countries around the world.

They do not believe that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, they have been very vocal about that. The secretary of state, by the way, is the person who ultimately approves or certifies the vote nationally. So that person's role is very important. Here at the polling stations, there have also been some issues in the lead up to this particular election this midterm. One of the things that has happened is, there have been people who have complained, feeling like they were under threat as they were just trying to drop off their ballot. A judge has ruled on that, and basically said, look, there are some rules now in place where if you are armed, which you can be here legally in public, you have to stand very far away, about 200 feet from any place where people are dropping off their ballots in this election. You also cannot be right up on the electorate as they're trying to just do their civic duty. And you can't be wearing camo as well if you're going to be a poll watcher. So those are some of the things that have been put in place recently because of some of the complaints that have come forward. But so far, things have been fairly calm here. This is just one of 223 places that you can vote in this county alone, Maricopa County. We should mention that Maricopa County is very important for Arizona, because it is where most of the population in this state lives, about 40 percent. They have outsized number of people living here. So the votes here are really important, and about 85 percent of those votes cast have already been cast. Typically, people mail them in, they walk them in, but they vote early in this state. And so, we should start seeing some of the count about an hour after the polls close. Lynda.",

It happened in the province where Imran Khan's party is in government.\" And the military has also issued a statement saying in part, \"The baseless and irresponsible allegations by Chairman PTI against the institution and particularly a senior Army officer are absolutely unacceptable and uncalled for. Pakistan's army prides itself for being an extremely professional and well-disciplined organization with a robust and highly-effective internal accountability system applicable across the board for unlawful acts, if any, committed by uniformed personnel.\" Pakistan's Ministry of Information released a video, Imran Khan.

I think the American people deserve that. You know, in 2015, I had gone to Ukraine after Russia had invaded it. And I then went to the White House with a bipartisan group and I met with then Vice President Joe Biden, trying to get them to sell the javelins, a defensive weapon to protect the Ukrainian people.
