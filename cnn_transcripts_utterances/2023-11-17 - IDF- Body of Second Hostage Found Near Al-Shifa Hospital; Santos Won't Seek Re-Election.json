Is it concrete evidence that the IDF is handing over, that indeed, their belief that Hamas ran a command center, a control center, into the hospital is indeed, fact? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Israel faced tremendous pressure to prove this assertion because it wasn't just something heard in past days and weeks, it's something they have said for years that Hamas used Al-Shifa Hospital above ground to have terror infrastructure below ground. And the first batch of evidence they showed was some weaponry, some ammunition in the hospital itself, they say, a far cry establishing decisively that Hamas used the hospital underground. Now, they released more pictures of a hospital shaft within the hospital complex. CNN has geolocated the video showing the entrance to the shaft far closer to establishing and substantiating what they say is an operational tunnel network below the hospital, but still we clearly need to see into the shaft itself, not just the opening. They say the shaft was found near a cache of weaponry and ammunition. Directors, health officials and the Hamas-run enclave have denied accusations saying it was only a medical complex. But it's worth noting that the U.S. and President Joe Biden threw their weight behind Israel, saying they have their own information that Hamas used the hospital itself as cover for infrastructure below the hospital. Still waiting to see more evidence and the IDF has promised more evidence and a look deeper under the hospital itself, Poppy and Phil.",

They had announced several days ago, she had died in Gaza but had not been able to locate her body. They say both bodies were located in the area of the Al-Shifa complex and they brought those out after identifying those and notified the families. Those are the first two Israeli hostages who have died in Gaza that we know of.

The question is, was it done, what's the intent? What was the alleged purpose? And in the case of Donald Trump, we see that he knew he was in possession of documents, he was asked for those documents, and he seems to have taken action to hide those documents, in addition to using or at least talking about national documents with significant national security implications.
