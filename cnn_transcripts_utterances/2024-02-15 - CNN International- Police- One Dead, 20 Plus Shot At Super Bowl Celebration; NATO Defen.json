Police say one person is dead, 21 others were shot and injured when someone opened fire on a celebration for the Super Bowl champions Kansas City Chiefs. Radio station KKFI identified the person killed as Lisa Lopez-Galvan who worked as a D.J. and a programmer at the station. An estimated one million people were attending that celebration. More than 800 law enforcement officers were on duty. Police have detained three people for questioning and the FBI has set up a website asking people for video of what happened and tips. Bystanders say they saw one person opened fire and then moved in to tackle him. Here's how they described what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's just -- you know, it's a difficult event to plan for.

The Ukrainian group says Moscow use the so-called Zircon missile, which is believed to fly eight to nine times faster than the speed of sound. Experts say the weapon can evade even the best of Western anti- meta -- missile defenses. New U.S. intelligence about Russia's abilities to deploy a new killer anti-satellite system in space had Capitol Hill buzzing on Wednesday. The uproar started when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, and that's what he called, a serious national security threat. Turner also urged the president to declassify the intelligence. But several members of Congress briefed on the matter, say the intelligence is concerning, but doesn't pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests.
