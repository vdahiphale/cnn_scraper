Dozens are injured, including children. Then, terrifying moments in South Korea after the emergency door of a plane open while it was landing, the latest on the investigation.And scientists use artificial intelligence to discover a powerful new antibiotic that can kill a deadly superbug. We begin them in Ukraine where a regional official says at least two people were killed and more than a dozen wounded after an airstrike on a medical clinic in Dnipro. At least 23 others were hurt, including a six and a three year old child. Military officials say they down most of Russia's 17 cruise missiles and 31 attack drones. Russia has also reported shelling.

      "sentences": "Hi, Max, what is certainly another devastating attack and some of the video especially in the early stages after that attack, which happened in the morning hours of today really was devastating with people you know, with bloods all over their heads and their bodies trying to evacuate from that building and being helped to out of that building.And as you were already saying, Max, as of right now, the toll stands at 23 people wounded 21 of them hospitalized and several of them in pretty severe condition and two people so far confirmed dead. Unfortunately, as is so often in the case with strikes like that when you have a lot of debris when you have some pretty heavy ordnance being launched on civilian targets. Unfortunately, it could be the case that that toll might in fact rise. But you are absolutely correct Max, to point out that this has been a big night of strikes by the Russians on targets here in Ukraine in the capital Kyiv and in Dnipro as well. The Ukrainian so far are saying that they have been pretty successful downing a lot of those cruise missiles. And that's a pretty big deal because those are some very big cruise missiles that the Russian shot over here at Ukrainian targets and also taking down apparently most of those attack drones. Those Iranian supplied showerheads, that as well that were loitering here over the territory of Ukraine. We did overnight hear the sirens go off here in Kyiv, we heard some of the interceptions that were taking place, and certainly the Ukrainian air defenses have been telling us that they have been getting more proficient at getting that done, the latest information that we have and of course, again, this is still pretty early stages. Apparently that medical facility that was hit in Dnipro may have been hit by a ballistic missile. So not by a cruise missile, those ballistic missiles are much more difficult to hit and to target and to take down by air defenses than cruise missiles would be. So that might be one of the reasons why that facility was hit. But of course, once again, a civilian target in an urban area with mass casualties hit during one of these large barrages of Russian strikes on Ukrainian territory, Max.",

A boat carrying around 500 migrants that was flagged by a non-governmental organization on Tuesday, remains missing in the Mediterranean Sea, the coastguard rescue two other migrant boats on Thursday carrying more than 1000 people.But an NGO rescue boat went to the location of the last coordinates of the missing migrant vessel and found no trace of that boat. It's complicated. That's the assessment from one Republican negotiator as the White House and GOP lawmakers tried to hammer out a deal to pay the U.S. government's bills, money that has already been spent. Sources say both sides are moving closer to an agreement, that potential compromise would raise the debt ceiling, but cap federal spending levels for two years. There are less than six days left to prevent a potential default that could trigger a global financial crisis. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live from the White House with some of the sticking points here. The markets don't seem too worried about this at this point.

And as the plane was two to three minutes before landing as it was about 700 feet just over 200 meters from the ground.He then opened the door. Now at this point they're investigating exactly why he would have done that we heard from one policeman saying it was very difficult to get information from him at this point as he was not in a good state mentally and was unable to stay upright when they arrested him. They said they he has confessed to opening the door but at this point has not given a reason. But what many aviation experts are asking the question they're asking is how this is even technically possible to open an emergency door while the plane is still flying? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet in 2023, we must ask a new question and that is can AI help us specifically, can artificial intelligence discover an antibiotic? Researchers using AI say they found an antibiotic that works against bacteria that can be almost impossible to treat. The compound was so precise that it could target the problem pathogen and leave beneficial bacteria in place. [08Let's get more on this incredible story actually from CNN Elizabeth Cohen. Elizabeth, why are researchers hoping to combat these bacteria and how does the AI help to achieve that?",

      "sentences": "Max, this bacteria called the Acinetobacter Baumannii, it is really quite terrible because it's so smart, it's managed over the years to outwit nearly all or sometimes even all of the antibiotics that we can throw at it, it's seen those antibiotics, and it has managed to learn how to outwit them.So people are also trying to use intelligence now, to outwit the bacteria. The way that this usually happens is that you try out this drug and see if it works, try out that drug. But that is relatively slow, and there's no time to waste and here's why. So these bacteria, it really preys on people in hospital settings. And so the most vulnerable people who would prey on it can cause infections in the blood, and the urinary tract can cause lung infections. In other words, it can cause pneumonia, and it clings to surfaces. And that's really why this is such a villain is that even if you're very, very good at cleaning, there, it is possible that you could miss it. So artificial intelligence can do this much more quickly, it can try out this different drug, that different drug, that different drug, you can try out hundreds of millions of drugs or even a billion drugs. Whereas when you're doing it sort of the old fashioned way, maybe you can do like a million drugs. So what these folks did, these are scientists in the United States is they took a mouse, they gave it a wound with this bacteria. And then they gave them this gave the mouse this antibiotic. And not only did he kill the bacteria, but it didn't hurt good bacteria. That's one of the things you look for an antibiotic, he wanted to keep the good bacteria and kill the bad bacteria. Now, I will say, Max, that we shouldn't think this is going to be on the market anytime soon. This is a great day, if you're a wounded mouse, this is not a great day, if you're a wounded person like today, we'll have to wait to make sure that this drug doesn't, you know, we'll have to try it out as a cause other problems for human beings. Can we get a pharmaceutical company to see that this is profitable? Those two things are challenging, and they will take years at least, Max.",

And that to me was a key indicator of these three aspects combined. That something was going on probably the export of Iranian drones to Russia.ABDELAZIZ (on camera): This heat map from Lloyd's list shows were most of those gaps in AIS are concentrated mostly near Iran's Amirabad port and Russia's Astrakhan port, where ships appear to be turning off their data on approach and going dark for extended periods of time. Now, using data like this and expert analysis, CNN was able to identify eight vessels that exhibited suspicious behavior in the Caspian Sea. This is one such vessel. It's a Russian flag tanker that was seen in early January, leaving Iran's Amirabad port making its way across the Caspian Sea to Russia's Astrakhan port. Now, we cannot independently verify what this tanker was carrying. But experts tell us the shipment was likely linked to the arms trade. ABDELAZIZ (voice over): And there are signs that Tehran could be air mailing arms too. The U.S. and Ukraine both accused Tehran of sending supplies to Russia by plane. CNN analyzed the tracking data of four Iranian cargo planes flagged by the U.S. Commerce Department for potentially carrying drone shipments. Collectively, the aircraft made at least 85 trips to Moscow airports between May 2022 and March 2023. Iran has admitted that it sold a small number of drones to Russia, but it says the sale was a few months prior to the war in Ukraine. CNN has reached out to Iran and Russia for comment, but has yet to receive a response. But given the much larger volume cargo ships can carry the Caspian Sea corridor is likely the primary conduit and experts say it is the new frontier for weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran tucked away from Western interference. It provides an easy avenue for sanctions evasion, Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi says.",
