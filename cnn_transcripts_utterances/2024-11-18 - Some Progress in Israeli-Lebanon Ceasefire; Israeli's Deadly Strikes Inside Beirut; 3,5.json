      "sentences": "And a warm welcome, thanks for joining me tonight, I'm Erica Hill in for Isa Soares. Tonight, the Bidenadministration green-lighting Ukraine's use of long-range missiles to attack inside Russia. Moscow says it is pouring oil on the fire of a conflict. Plus, Donald Trump doubling down on his controversial cabinet picks as a number of candidates face an uphill battle for Senate confirmation. And Israel, Hezbollah edging closer to a deal while the U.N. describes the Middle East conflict as a quote, \"living in a nightmare\". I'll speak with James Elder of UNICEF for the very latest from the ground. Ukraine is poised to strike into Russia, possibly very soon after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range American missiles for that purpose. Russia says if Ukraine does strike with those missiles, it would constitute, quote, \"direct participation of the United States in the war.\" It, of course, is a move the White House has resisted for months, fearing that it would escalate the conflict. The weapons are expected to be used primarily in Russia's Kursk region for now where North Korean troops have joined the Russian counteroffensive. Now, the Biden administration says it considers the addition of those troops to be an escalation on Russia's part, and the White House's changing policy is a response to that escalation. The Army Tactical Missile System, also known as ATACMS is a long-range guided missile. It's produced in the U.S. The missiles can travel up to 300km, about 200 miles, and could be launched from a mobile launcher. They can either carry a single warhead or hundreds of smaller bomblets. This development comes as Russia unleashed its largest aerial attack on Ukraine in months. Here's more now from CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. We're going to get to that story from my colleague Nick Paton Walsh in just a minute. While we wait for that, though, I do want to bring in CNN military analyst, Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. \"Spider\", always good to have you with us. As we look at where things stand now in this war, we heard the response from Russia saying that they see this as direct involvement essentially by the U.S. First, put it into perspective for us, giving the OK to Ukraine to use these ATACMS to go inside Russia. What does that change for Ukraine?",

Look, let's keep in mind that striking the enemy deep behind its own lines,to strike from Ukraine into Russia, to go after command and control facilities, logistics locations, unit assembly areas, ammunition stockpiles, maintenance facilities et cetera. That always is a great capability that needs to be applied because when you engage up close, you want to have your enemy in a much-reduced position. And that's what long-range fires do. So, from the outset, it could be argued, in fact, it was argued that giving capabilities to the Ukrainians that allowed them to reach out that much farther beyond the frontlines was exactly what needed to be done.

And it's not unusual also to see the narrative from Moscow inflame or at least make threats that historically have not been followed through. So, we need to be clear-eyed about this. Look, the ability to do long-range strikes makes perfect tactical and operational sense. It is not going to strategically, as Nick indicated, it will not strategically alter the outcome of the fighting. What it does potentially, is alter the outcome of a potential for a negotiated settlement, albeit that's not been said before. But I would anticipate this new administration is looking forward to having a very serious conversation about a cessation of hostilities and drawing a line of where the Russians are now in Ukraine that goes back to Russia, Ukraine then gets about its business -- we'll have to see what that looks like.

And certainly, President Biden is here looking to burnish his foreign policy legacy, announcing a number of funding initiatives on poverty, on climate. But in the end, I think a lot of leaders are looking at those as sort of symbolic with the recognition that Donald Trump could come into office with very different views when it comes to foreign assistance and reverse a lot of what President Biden is doing here in Rio. And in fact, Donald Trump's influence is already creating some behind-the-scenes drama here at the G20, leaders are trying to put together this joint communique, which is standard for these kinds of summits. But what we've heard is that one of Trump's top global allies, the President of Argentina is resisting signing on to this statement because of what its language is on taxing the ultra wealthy. Now, debates over these communiques are to be expected at these summits. But what diplomats view as something curious is that the Argentines had already agreed on this language over the Summer, and it was only after Trump had been elected that they started putting up these roadblocks, and they really do view this as an attempt by world leaders to curry favor with Trump before he comes into office. And you can already start to see some of these alignments coming into place. These conservative leaders who feel like they have more in common with Trump feeling emboldened in this group now that Trump is coming into office. And so, it's a dynamic that Biden certainly is having to navigate while he's here on the world stage. And you can already kind of see, world leaders, looking past Biden and looking towards Trump as they sort of look to jockey to curry American influence, and we actually just saw that sort of on full display as the leaders were posing for a family photo. They had just come out from a session on poverty and hunger, discussing those issues. They come out to take a photo and they didn't wait for Biden to arrive before taking this photo, he was inside talking to Justin Trudeau from Canada and Giorgia Meloni from Italy. All three of them ended up missing this photo. I think in an ordinary world, the leaders would have waited for an American President before posing for their family photo. In this case, they did not, and it just gives you a sense of how the world is starting to look past Biden and toward Trump as he enters office.",

Now, the Biden administration saying it needs that $100 billion to replenish those funds. At the end of the day, disaster relief is usually a bipartisan initiative in Washington, and certainly, you have heard from a lot of Republicans who say that it will be essential to ensure that this fund is restocked. The question now is whether it will be at this eye-popping level, and whether lawmakers will decide to pass a separate package just with this disaster relief or to insert it into a year-end funding package that they will need to pass before the end of the year, sometimes that makes passing things of this size a little bit easier because at the end of the day, the government will need to be funded.

Kennedy Jr., for example, a vaccine skeptic to run America's health care system. The senators that do have questions about Gaetz are going to come under enormous pressure from the Make America Great Again movement from the Trump White House, from conservative media. So, they are thinking about their futures too. There's already been talk about senators being potentially primaried before the next election if they have to run for re-election. So, you can see that it's going to be a very lonely spot for one of these senators to come out and oppose the Gaetz or other nominations. Having said that, this is a question that's wider than the Gaetz nomination. It's about the power of the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility of advising and consenting to an administration. This is about the constitution. There are some people in the Senate who take that very seriously. If Trump is able to walk over them with the Gaetz nomination, particularly because that is the most controversial one, it will suggest that he will have a completely free hand in Washington. He already has Republicans controlling the House. There's a conservative Supreme Court. So, this is as much about how Trump will run Washington in the next four years as it is about the singular nomination of Matt Gaetz.",

We know this meeting was on Friday morning, Trump is telling \"Fox News\" that Scarborough asked for the meeting. Trump is saying that Scarborough was very friendly, very kind, conciliatory in the meeting, and he's describing it as a chance to open up lines of communication. That's really what Brzezinski and Scarborough told viewers this morning as well. They said, look, it's time to try something different. We've seen how the voters reacted to Trump. Let's try something different and start talking to him again. A decade ago, Trump and Scarborough were close friends. And Scarborough would hang out at Mar-a-Lago as a former Florida congressman, he had a close relationship with Trump, but that all disintegrated during the 2016 presidential campaign. And in 2017, when Trump took office for the first time, it devolved basically into name- calling with Scarborough and Brzezinski calling Trump a narcissist and much worse. And with Trump coming up with conspiracy theories about Scarborough at one point, even implying that the \"MSNBC\" host was a murderer. That's how ugly this relationship became.

And Comcast was not the only company to do that today. Other media companies like \"Nexstar\", a major owner of TV stations in the United States came out welcoming Brendan Carr. Some of those statements maybe a little bit more friendly, maybe a little more over the top than I've seen when it comes to other relationships between media companies and government agency regulators. You know, there's certainly this effort to figure out what the relationship will be and whether there is common ground. And that's a phrase, by the way that Scarborough and Brzezinski used today. They said Trump maybe wants to find common ground with Democrats, and reaching out as an anti-Trump TV show is maybe a way to do that. Now, I think a lot of \"Morning Joe\" viewers are highly skeptical of that notion. In fact, if you look on social media today, liberal social media is full of people saying they'll never watch \"Morning Joe\" again. So, there is the tension, right? There is the tug of war that exists. If you are a television host who's been out there basically calling Trump a fascist, all of a sudden, you're  asking to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago.

We -- just like Gaza, a number of child psychologists who speak to me about Lebanon saying that we'regetting into uncharted territory, meaning children now on the back of this crisis, which, of course, has escalated gravely in the last two months, but has been going on for 13 months. Children are now looking into their parents' eyes and realize after displacement, displacement, not knowing where the frontline is, that their parents have lost the ability to protect them. And parents have that realization. It's a horrible, horrible thing for a child to learn. So, look, there's hundreds of shelters around Lebanon. UNICEF, we're getting child psychologists in, play, whatever we possibly can, anything to create a moment where a child can be a child. But again, as soon as you do this one place, people are having to move again, because, again, this idea that nowhere is safe. So, it's a beginning. In shelters, we do a lot of water. We do a lot of hygiene kits, all those things. Families don't leave with clothes, only with mattresses and blankets. So, all of those things, but again, you know, very few places see the level of upheaval that happened in Lebanon in a space of a very, very short time. So, I see this when I visit children, you know, you see children sitting there often very stony silence, you see children not playing, you see a sense of frustration in children. They simply want to go home, but their families and everyone is realizing we are a long way away from the kind of deal that will get these children home. It's -- again, I think, Erica, we're seeing this escalation of children killed and injured and displaced. And yet, we're not seeing any meaningful response, yet again, from those who do have influence to end this war.",

The readings now reaching the highest levels this year in the capital of New Delhi. Visibility in Delhi dropping down to 100 meters or 109 yards.

More than half a million people were forced into emergency shelters. As the storm knocked down homes, the storm surge measured more than three meters, nearly 10 feet in some areas. And those back-to-back storms have understandably made recovery efforts incredibly difficult. The COP29 Climate Summit in Azerbaijan is now in its final week, and that means, of course, time is running out to agree on how to get financing from the developed countries, banks, and the private sector to developing nations. Funding for climate-friendly farming efforts was announced just a short time ago. That effort is being led by the U.S. and the UAE, with more than $29 billion pledged to reduce the agricultural impact on the climate.

You got libertarians like Milei, Javier Milei in Argentina basically making a big show of pulling out of the COP process, you know, in affinity with Donald Trump, again, who promises to pull out here as well. And this is on the private side as well. There's so much possibility to help developing countries skip fossil fuels and use clean energy. But the financing can be out of whack, even though, you know, clean energy is now cheaper, it can cost much more to get a loan because it's untested compared to the old legacy fuels. That needs to change. That takes political will. So, yes, these are always sort of a frustrating exercise and allies and enemies coming together to try to find agreement.

So, just how could life change for someone in a wheelchair if those wheels could take them almost anywhere, even on rocky terrain? A group of engineers at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials is now making that dream a reality. Here's CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This wheelchair can move like no others can. Engineers in South Korea have developed a shape-shifting morphing wheel, calling it the world's first. The wheel can shift between rigid and soft areas, providing stability on both flat ground and rocky paths. And it may even allow users to climb stairs. All this without complex machinery or fancy sensors. SONG SUNG-HYUK, PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER, KOREA INSTITUTE OF MACHINERY AND MATERIALS (through translator):  Traditional wheels are designed to retain a rigid, circular shape for stability on flat surfaces, which limits their ability to overcome obstacles. However, our wheel maintains its round form on flat ground and softens only when navigating obstacles. STOUT (voice-over):  The wheels can reach speeds of 30 kilometer or 18 miles per hour. The innovation behind these wheels is simple yet groundbreaking. The wheel's flexibility is inspired by the surface tensions found in liquid droplets, says the researcher. SONG (through translator):  When the force that pulls the outermost molecules of a liquid droplet inward increases, the droplet can maintain a stable, circular shape. Similarly, our wheel is designed with a smart chain block on the outer edge. The greater the inward pull on this block, the more stably it maintains a round shape. STOUT (voice-over):  The wheel turns firm for stability when the wire spokes pull the block inward. When it's loosened, it softens, allowing the wheel to adapt to uneven surfaces. Researchers see big potential for the wheel: from personal mobility to robots. SONG (through translator):  This modularized wheel can be attached to any mobile platform, simply by replacing existing wheels. Once installed, the wheel provides variable stiffness, adapting to each application. STOUT (voice-over): Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
