The S&amp;P 500 looking to snap a five-day losing streak, perhaps paring back some of the positions into the weekend. Those are the markets and these are the main events. Republican Mike Johnson holding on to his Speakership after a nail biting vote in the US House. President Biden blocking a Japanese firm's bid to take over US steel, calling it a National Security threat. And shares in the world's biggest brewers fall as the US Surgeon General calls for cancer warnings on alcohol. Live from New York, it's Friday, January 3rd. I'm Julia Chatterley in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening once more. Tonight, a major political victory for Donald Trump.

Johnsoncould only afford to lose one Republican vote, and he initially lost three. Two of the holdouts changing their minds last minute and supported his bid.

We can fight high inflation and we must. We will give relief to Americans and we will extend the Trump tax cuts. We are going to protect our industries from -sided trade deals, and we are going to bring overseas investments back to America's shores. We will -- that's right. We will defeat the harmful effects of inflation and we will make life affordable again for America's hardworking people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw members vote for Johnson, but he quickly developed three holdoutswhen he could only lose one, and Republicans decide to keep that vote open and see if they could do some convincing and negotiating behind the scenes and try and seal this still with that one vote. That's why it took so long, but why it ultimately ended with Johnson being elected on the first vote. And I am told from sources that during that extended time, when Johnson was meeting with groups of different lawmakers, President-elect Donald Trump was making calls of his own and speaking directly to some of the holdouts, including Republican Congressman of Ralph Norman of South Carolina, because Trump knows how much is at stake here, and he has backed Johnson. So he has a lot -- he is deeply involved in this process and wanted to make sure that the person that he endorsed for Speaker, Mike Johnson, actually succeeded in clinching that gavel. So that's why it was such a kind of chaotic couple of hours there, but it ended ultimately with Ralph Norman and Congressman Self changing their votes at the last minute to give Johnson the margins he needed to become Speaker. And now the real work begins, I mean, Republicans elected Mike Johnson, but they are still deeply divided on a number of issues. In fact, a group of Republicans put out a letter who ultimately supported Johnson, but only kind of begrudgingly about the list of demands that they now want to see Johnson enact moving forward. So Johnson has a very tight rope that he will be walking, but with Trump's backing, he is safe in his position for now.",

The president-elect backed Johnson wholeheartedly, and he needs to keep the Republicans united to advance any legislation. There were also personal stakes for the president-elect.

I saw a letter that some of the holdouts put out this afternoon. You know, they want to cut spending and do other things. But the reality is, this body is a majority body, and the Republicans have a thin majority. And so if they don't stick together, they will get nothing accomplished. That just won't be acceptable to Trump. So I think the message that he and Johnson have been going with here, which is, teamwork and party unity is vital ultimately is what carried the day. I am sure that's what he told those members on the phone.",

You know, they're going to want to pass some laws on immigration to go along with what I assume will be a lot of executive orders from Trump on immigration. It is a really ambitious agenda. What you don't want is to have a fractured team when you're in such a closely divided chamber. So hopefully the spirit of unity, for Trump's sake, will overtake the Republicans in the House today, and they will move forward on this together, and largely agreeing, yes, we have to help Donald Trump be successful. If these guys spend all their time fighting amongst themselves, it means they aren't passing bills. It means they aren't helping Donald Trump. That won't sit well down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

But I think for the folks who are on the ground in these places, critical battleground states like Pennsylvania, US Steel is everything to them. And for there to be a question mark about what happens with the company, whether its sold or whether it can be viable here in the United States, I think that's important for the president-elect coming in, President Trump, to know that he has their backs. I think a lot of this, obviously, is politically motivated in many ways to make sure that a lot of people here in the United States, especially those steel workers, understand that not only is the president investing in the country, but in jobs, bringing in foreign investment, but also investing in the jobs that already exist right here on the ground, especially in those key states like Pennsylvania -- Julia.",

But even if a vehicle took up this entire street, you can see there still is a good amount of space to go around that onto the sidewalk, which, as we know from video, is essentially what happened. Now you see some yellow temporary archer barriers on the sidewalk, but those were not there when this attack unfolded.

It brings traffic from New Jerseyto New York and pretty soon, commuters will have to pay a lot more to make the journey downtown. From Sunday vehicles entering the congestion relief zone in Manhattan will be charged a toll, and that includes local streets and avenues at or below 60th Street. It aims to reduce overcrowding and improve air quality. New York's congestion pricing will be the first of its kind across the United States. Similar programs have been implemented internationally, though, in cities like London and in Stockholm. Not everyone is for the congestion pricing, especially restaurants and food businesses who argue the plan will increase overheads throughout the supply chain. Food distributor Baldor puts it simply, if you eat food in New York City, the cost is going to go up. Baldor is leading an industry coalition to have food and beverage distributors exempt from the charge. Seth Gottlieb is the Senior Vice President of logistics at Baldor Specialty Foods and he joins us now. Seth, fantastic to have you with us. I know you're just one of an entire coalition within the industry that saying, look, something has to be done here.
