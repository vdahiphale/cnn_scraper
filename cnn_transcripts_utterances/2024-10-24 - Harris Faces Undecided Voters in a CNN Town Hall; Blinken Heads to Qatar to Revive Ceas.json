So this was noteworthy, but look, this comes as Donald Trump over the last several days has really been escalating those personal attacks on his opponents and also increasing his dark rhetoric when it comes to the current picture of America.He did all of that on Wednesday night. He focused heavily on immigration. The border specifically and what he argued were undocumented migrants coming over the southern border to commit crimes in the country. He also talked about the economy, about energy, but one thing that was very notable was how big of an event this is. This was hosted by Turning Point Action as one of the biggest outside groups that has been really helping Donald Trump with his ground game strategy, not just here in the state of Georgia, but also in the other key battleground states. Now, the founder of Turning Point Action, Charlie Kirk, as well as, have several other high-profile Republicans that includes people like Tucker Carlson, RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Dr. Ben Carson, as well as the country music star Jason Aldean. All of them spoke on Wednesday as well and it really did feel like the vibe in the room felt almost like a mini-Republican National Convention. Now, I also just want to point out one thing we heard earlier in the night from Tucker Carlson because then it ended up playing a bigger role when argued that if Donald Trump were to win in November, it would be like dad was coming home. And he said, in response to criticizing the media as well as the Democratic Party overall, he said that Trump, like God, would treat everyone as his children, but also would recognize that they needed a spanking. Later on, you heard the crowd chanting when Trump was on stage, daddy's home and daddy's home, so notable as I have not heard that yet before on the campaign trail.

And she spared no punches. She called him a fascist on record. She uses her traditional terms of calling him unfit and a dictator and these sorts of things. So she's had this incredible wave of a campaign in the last few months, but she's really coming home to this core argument here that democracy is on the line.

She was tasked with, sort of, developing the root cause solutions to immigration from certain countries in Central America. That was sort of her task as vice president and people have been, you know, fairly disappointed with how she's delivered. So she immediately takes this and turns it around on track. And there was a question in there, I believe, Anderson Cooper sort of pressed her on, you know, would she support more funding for a border bill? And she got sort of squirrely about answering this, even though funding for the border bill was in that bipartisan bill that she supports.

But it doesn't matter if they're going to the grocery store and they're upset with how their bill is coming up. So, you know, she starts with acknowledging it and then talks about price gouging, which, you know, studies have said is not necessarily the most important factor with the economy. But this is something that she is trying to develop a middle class economy, right? This is her pitch, is an opportunity economy for the middle class.

The Russian president, who's hosting the event, is due to meet with the U.N. Secretary-General later today, who's expected to urge him to end the war in Ukraine. During his speech on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin pushed for the creation of a new world order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is the essence of the Strategy of the BRICS course on the global arena, which meets the aspirations of the main part of the international community, the so-called global majority. And it is precisely this course that is especially in demand in the current conditions, when truly cardinal changes are taking place in the world, and the process of forming a multipolar world is underway. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH; Despite Western efforts to isolate President Putin over the war in Ukraine, more than a dozen world leaders are attending the summit and Russia appears to be strengthening ties with Asian powers. BRICS members now represent 45 percent of the global population. The U.S. is publicly confirming a move by North Korea that has Western allies on edge. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the U.S. is seeing evidence of North Korean troops in Russia but what they're doing remains unclear. A senior administration official tells CNN thousands of North Korean troops recently arrived in eastern Russia and are undergoing training. The move has fueled concerns they may take part in Russia's war in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN geolocated this video. Sergeevka training ground near China and North Korea, the front lines of Ukraine more than 4,000 miles away. Ukraine is where South Korean intelligence says these soldiers are going. 1,500 now, as many as 12,000 could be deployed, South Korean media says. Some seen here supposedly just days ago getting their Russian military uniforms. The audio muffled, the language sounds like Korean. We can't independently verify this video provided to CNN by the Ukrainian government.

But we felt it was really important to share our experience because it does touch on the broader themes and challenges of covering this conflict, but also of the complexity of the situation in Darfur, the difficulty of getting aid in, the difficulty of human rights organizations getting in, and getting the stories out of the people of Darfur that deserve to be told and that the world needs to hear.

But what we know so far is that at least 49 people have become sick across 10 states, 10 people have been hospitalized, including a child, and one person has died.Now most of the cases have been identified in Colorado and that is where the elderly person who died was. Now they are still trying to trace the exact ingredient that was contaminated here. They said that every person they interviewed had reported eating at a McDonald's and most particularly remembered eating a quarter pounder. So far the investigations are homing in on the fresh slivered onions that are used on the quarter pounders, but they haven't yet ruled out the beef patties. So McDonald's says that it is pulling those ingredients from store menus in affected states as this investigation continues and they are trying to reassure folks that it is safe to eat at McDonald's right now. Here's what they're telling people. JOE ERLINGER, MCDONALD'S USA PRESIDENT: It is important to note that the onset dates for this disease are between at this point, September 27th and October 11th. If there has been contaminated product within our supply chain, but it's very likely worked itself through that supply chain already. But certainly we'll be working with the CDC and cooperating with them on the investigation. And we'll take in more data and let the science continue to lead our action.",
