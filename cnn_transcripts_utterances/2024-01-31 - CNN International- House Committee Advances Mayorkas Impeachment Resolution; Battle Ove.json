President Biden would simply appoint another person to carry out his immigration policies. So that's the farce, the political theater of what we're seeing here, because all of this, it will have zero impact on our border crisis, the humanitarian crisis, and certainly the leadership crisis in Washington. And the fact that we haven't done this as a country since nearly 150 years really says something about what a serious move in the impeachment of a cabinet official is. I mean, it would be setting a very dangerous precedent, in my view, were this to go through, because we could see in the future with politicians from both parties going ahead with attempted impeachments or impeachments based on similar grounds as here, which is basically policy differences, not actual high crimes and misdemeanors.

Republicans had been united over this issue for several years and demanding action from Joe Biden. Well, now on the cusp of a major deal in the Senate, a bipartisan deal cut between a conservative Republican Senator James Langford with the Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, an independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema, and Joe Biden himself.Now there are divisions within the ranks. Donald Trump, for one, has urged House Republicans to kill this measure and urging Senate Republicans also to scuttle the push. Even as the GOP leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell has worked behind the scenes for months to try to help secure this deal, which would also greenlight desperately sought aid for Ukraine and its war against Russia. But because of GOP divisions, now it is entirely possible that this whole thing could collapse. That has caused concern within the ranks, particularly among supporters, Republican supporters of this bipartisan deal. One of them, Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, strongly criticized the House Republicans and Donald Trump, especially since this deal has not yet been released yet. The legislation is still being drafted, saying that they need to compromise and agree to even, even -- even if it's not everything they want, it could go a long way to secure the border. And he also warned of voter backlash. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I don't think it's fair to just characterize a bill that people haven't seen that hasn't been written as dead on arrival. I just think it's irresponsible to start and end a negotiation with the same position, all or nothing. That's not what you can do in a divided government. If we don't try to do something when we have the moment to do something, all of those swing voters in swing states for whom the border is the number one priority have every right to look at us and go, you blew your opportunity. If we can't get there, fine. But if we don't try, then shame on us.",

That is a debate that happened behind closed doors in Mitch McConnell's office, and that will continue to be discussed at a private lunch meeting on Wednesday, when senators gather and decide what to do on this issue that is now tripping them up and could haunt them in November.

I suppose the U.K. feels a certain sense of additional responsibility given that it was the one that, if we go back in time, the Balfour Declaration saying that Israel would be the country for Jews to kind of have their own state. And then also, of course, was the power up until Israel's independence in 1948.So, will it change anything on the ground? Well, let's not forget that you're talking right now about a government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that says that there will be no two-state solution, fighting a war against Hamas, which is also fervently opposed to a two-state solution. So, I'm not quite sure how Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, thinks that any change in that position by the U.K. would help bring about an end to the current conflict. But this is something that he's articulated. It was to a group of Arab diplomats that he made these comments. And I think perhaps that the language we heard from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressing Conservative Friends of Israel the previous week might have been slightly different. So, it's unclear as to what legs this proposal has.
