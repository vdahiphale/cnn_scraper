So, this is right on brand for a Governor DeSantis and his team.Listen, they are trying to speak to a certain segment of the electorate. When I was at the Faith and Freedom Forum in D.C. not long ago, speaking to Christian evangelical voters, these are the voters that Republicans need to capture in the early state of Iowa. They told me that their number one concern was they're concerned about transgender Americans, how gender identity is taught in schools. And I would push back and say, really? Out of all the issues that we are confronting in this country, whether it be abortion, or the economy, they said no, it's transgender issues. It's gender issues. And so Governor DeSantis is speaking directly to those anxieties. And he is probably relishing that the likes of Secretary Buttigieg, Will Hurd and Chris Christie are going after him, because those are people that Republicans, base Republicans would characterize as the elites.

Well, now, he says, the Supreme Court has given him the right to ban bigots from seeing his hit shows. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:15:00] CAMEROTA: White Lotus star Michael Imperioli has a message about the Supreme Court ruling on LGBTQ rights. He wrote this on Instagram, quote, I've decided forbid bigots and homophobes from watching Sopranos, the White Lotus, Goodfellas, or any movie or T.V. show I have been in. Thank you, Supreme Court, for allowing me to discriminate and exclude those who I don't agree with and I'm opposed to. USA, USA. That was his response, of course, to the Supreme Court ruling in favor of that Christian web designer who refuses to create websites to celebrate same-sex weddings. Let's bring back Jay Michaelson and Jason Osborne, also joining us is Evan Osnos of the New Yorker and Constitutional Law Professor Gloria Browne-Marshall. She is the author of the book, She Took Justice, the Black Woman Law and Power. Great to have all of you. Professor, I do want to start with you. I assume the Imperioli rule is unenforceable in terms of who can watch his shows. But is his point valid in that it's sort of what Sotomayor was saying in terms of the balkanization of providers being able in the future to decide who they want to serve and who they don't serve? GLORIA BROWNE-MARSHALL, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR, JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE: I think it is. It's directly on the point that Justice Sotomayor is saying that not just the protected class, women, people of color, immigrants, anyone could be prohibited from being served in restaurants or being allowed into particular movie theaters. And now we see that the other side of that is to say, well, anything I feel is an area that I want to preclude other people, I should be able to do it based on the Supreme Court decision. It opens the floodgate and it goes back to what is wrong with the Supreme Court decisions. It doesn't have the legal rationale that the American people can follow, or businesses. And that's what the Supreme Court is supposed to do. It's supposed to give us a rule to follow. And right now, as it is pointed, out we can do about anything we want based on these very vague decisions by the court.",

So, first, obviously, Michael Imperioli, thank you for your allyship and I understand he was kind of making a lighthearted point. That being said, my general sense is we should not be giving our enemies, our opponents more rights than they are already taking away.When we say -- so, this was, I think, a -- so, first of all, this opinion was wrong. This does provide a pretext for discrimination because you can go to this website, it was a web designer and get a website, no, I cannot, that's discrimination. However, it is limited to cases where there really is a free speech interest. In this, case both parties agreed that creating a website, typing in the words of a website, is speech. And that means that it is not a sort of blanket license to discriminate such that anybody can make that decision. And, again, I'm not interested in getting the Supreme Court off the hook. People who know me know that's not my interest. Rather, I don't think we should be -- as they sometimes say, don't comply in advance. We should not be giving away more rights by saying they've taken away all these rights when they have not. That's what I think is actually dangerous.",

And that is why I say the decision is so vague that someone then can prohibit a person, a group, because of the vagueness of the decision, and then an action has to be brought for the Supreme Court or lower courts to give us some meat on these bones to better understand what these limitations are and how widespread we are supposed to interpret this decision.",

And I agree, there could be a flood of litigation, and you and I both know there will be more of these lawsuits, just continuing to kind of open the window to exclude more and more of our lives.That being said, I just am worried when we kind of do that in advance, because that does, exactly as you said, it creates a social reality where businesses and others, you know, we saw after the Masterpiece Cake Shop case, pizzerias are putting signs on their windows saying, no gays allowed.

She helped identify the ways in which large sums of money, often from donors that we didn't know the full identities of, going to organizations whose names we were unfamiliar to us, were having a big impact on politics.We used to talk about people like the Koch Brothers, for instance. Well, these days, what you are seeing in the actions of the court is that it is increasingly shaped by similar kinds of dynamics. Take, for example, somebody like Leonard Leo, who is a very prominent conservative legal activist, who oversees a set of organizations, this sort of web of groups involved in a number of cases. Take, for example, the affirmative action case. The litigant in that case, the plaintiff in that case, Students for Fair Admissions, in 2020, a third of their revenue reportedly came from an organization that Leo runs, and then many of the briefs that were submitted in support of that position came from organizations that he also supports.

And, likewise, I don't think the services that this person is going to provide are going to be in line with what the services of a gay couple wanting them to do their website. But all that being said, in terms of the dark money aspect of it, I think let's not kid ourselves in thinking that this is just one sided. The other side, the left has folks like George Soros, that are out there funding campaigns and organizations that are out there not only doing kind of oppo research on judges or people that could be judges, the same is on the right side.

And you see this showing up in attitudes that people have about the court.Look, trust is declining rapidly. A Gallup poll last fall showed that it is now at the lowest level ever recorded, and it's gone down 20 points in two years.

It's an annual block party called \"Brooklyn Day\" and it's happened for the past 20 plus years. But this party -- this block party, does not always happen on the same day, which is why police would later tell us that they did not have as much of a presence at this block party as they normally would have in past years. Now, then, early Sunday morning, the party went into the evening and into the early morning. Early Sunday morning, just after midnight then, police say multiple gunmen opened fire on a crowd. At some point, there were hundreds of people in this crowd, in this party, and of course 28 people were injured and 18-year-old Aaliyah Gonzalez and 20-year-old Kylis Fagbemi were also killed.
