CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, it's absolutely extraordinary that we have a major party presidential candidate who is so openly endorsing the use of violence in our politics. His advertisement that if he's elected that he will pardon the individuals who tried to violently overthrow our government is, of course, just an invitation for people to do the same thing again. And so, I am deeply worried about violence as we head into this fall's election. I'm worried about what happens of Joe Biden wins the election -- whether we will see mass-scale violence that makes January 6 look like child's play. I don't know why we just don't take Donald Trump at his word. He's said that he's going to use dictatorial powers on day one. He has shown a cavalierness about democracy. He's shown an endorsement for violence. And I just -- it's sick. I'm thinking about my Republican colleagues in the Senate, many of whom I consider to be friends.

Hamas does not care about the people of Gaza. That is just plainly true.All that being said, if your goal, as Israel says, is to defeat Hamas and to decrease the likelihood that a terrorist group -- Hamas or another terrorist group is going to be able to attack Israel in the future, I just don't think the conduct of this war is effectuating your war aim. Ultimately, the number of civilians being killed in Rafah right now, in Gaza throughout this conflict -- it becomes bulletin board recruiting material for Hamas or other non-state actors that are going to replace Hamas. Just like what happened to the United States in Afghanistan, this war, in the end, may make the threat to Israel more serious. That's why I have counseled Israel to pause these military operations and to prioritize humanitarian relief.

And so, to think that yesterday was actually the day that those kids should have been graduating from college (sic), it's just stunning. It's heartbreaking. It's shocking. There were 20 kids that should have graduated high school yesterday, but there were hundreds of others that did graduate in Newtown, Connecticut. Kids that have been living with the trauma of listening to those gunshots and perhaps of stepping over their dead classmates' bodies. And what those kids have done over the course of the last decade and a half is really extraordinary. Many of them have become part of the anti-gun violence movement. Many of them just played small roles in trying to help their classmates recover. Many of them took part in charity activities -- charities that were started by the parents of those kids who died in Sandy Hook Elementary School. There are hundreds of heroes who have grown up to be really amazing young adults in Newtown who lived through that experience in Sandy Hook.

And what stood out to me was the NYC transit vest, along with all of these guns, ammunition, and a stun gun. When you hear all the details of this, what does it tell you about the suspect? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURTY (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it tells me that the magnitude of the ammunition, the type of uniforms, the type of paraphernalia, which is sort of to mimic law enforcement. It wasn't just NYPD; it was also transit. So you have a subway concern. And the fact that he had them all in one place and in transit means to things. One is the NYPD did a great job. I mean, there's just no question about it. Someone transiting with these kinds of materials is unlikely just doing it for storage. That there was probably an attack planned or imminent and that's why he had it in his car. Assuming -- if he -- if he has a home, they'll be checking out that as well. The second is just this increased threat environment that we're in. Again, we don't know his motive. I will say in one of the press conferences or press releases there was a discussion of writings. That seemed to me to be a clue that they have some sense of what the motive could be. They're his writings and so we'll find out what his intent may have been. The third is just this threat environment that we're in overall. As we know, 2024 has a lot going on and it -- and we will find out the true motive. I think the connection to law enforcement, or it was an attempt to mimic law enforcement can be quite scary and just goes to the increased vigilance that we need in this period that the FBI director says we all need to be vigilant.",
