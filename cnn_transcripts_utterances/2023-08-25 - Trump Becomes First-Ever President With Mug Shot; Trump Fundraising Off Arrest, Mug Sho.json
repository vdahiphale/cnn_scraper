The surrenders are now done.The legal updates are just beginning. The latest co-defendant tied to the fake electoral scheme says she was acting at Trump's direction. And she is not the first one to make that argument in court. CNN's Jessica Schneider. She's covering the legal threads. Nick Valencia is outside the Fulton County -- Fulton County jail where the former president surrendered there. Jessica, first to you.

She was one of those fake electors who prosecutors say signed the paperwork claiming Trump was the winner of Georgia 2021 when of course he wasn't. And so, now she's charged as part of this broad plot to steal the 2020 election. But in her filing today, she's asking for this case to be moved to federal court. And she's saying it should be moved to federal court because she was just following the orders of then-President Trump. So, she put it this way in her filing, saying.In performing the duties of a presidential elector, Mrs. Latham was acting to assist Congress in its count and announcement of electoral votes for president and vice president of the United States. Mrs. Latham was furthermore acting to assist the president and was following the advice of the president's legal counsel for the purpose of preserving the challenge to the election results. So, Cathy Latham, she's now joining at least four other defendants who say they want their cases moved out of county court to federal court because they say they were acting in some official capacity. Of course, we've seen this with Mark Meadows. He said it was because he was Trump's chief of staff. Jeffrey Clark saying it's because he was an official at the Justice Department. But now, we're seeing this fake elect or accused fake elect or Cathy Latham, and she's making this even broader argument that she was acting under the former president's direction, Jim. So, trying to broaden out this argument, and it's possible that other defendants may follow their lead.",

She's from Chicago.And according to prosecutors here, she is alleged of driving down from her Chicago home to come down here to intimidate Fulton County Election worker, Ruby Freeman. And according to District Attorney Fani Willis, Kutti allegedly told Freeman that she was a loose end that needed to be tidied up. Now, after Kuttis's surrender about an hour before the noon deadline that was set by Willis for today for all co- defendants to turn themselves in, we saw Illinois-based Pastor Stephen Lee surrender to authorities. And Lee is accused of doing the same thing. Driving down from Illinois to knock on the door of Ruby Freeman. Freeman actually called the police and there's a video of that encounter. After Lee surrendered and was released, his attorney came out here to speak to reporters. And during those comments, he says not only does Lee not personally know the former president, but he also claims that his client came down here only to knock on doors.

I want to share some reporting that I have on that. I know that Donald Trump's team had discussed what they wanted him to look like in that mug shot prior to him going to the jail and taking it. They had discussions about how he should appear. And ultimately, the former president decided that he wanted to appear \"defiant.\" That is what some of his advisers told me, rather than smile, or it's like some of his other co-defendants in their mug shots and give off the impression that you know he takes this very seriously. But again, he is very frustrated about this. He has had to go through this process four times. He had never had to take a mug shot before.

      "sentences": "Right. So, you have to keep in mind that Fani Willis said that she wanted to try all 19 of these co-defendants together. Typically, when you have co-defendants who are all listed in the same indictment, that is how it would go. Unless any of the co-defendants are able to do something called severance, that's where they're separated, you know, from the case or from other co-defendants.And so, we know from filings with Trump after Chesebro made this motion for speedy trial and Judge McAfee set the date for October 23, Trump has of course said that he does not want to go to trial that soon. I am expecting the other co-defendants don't want to go to trial that soon either. And usually, judges you know, whenever a defense attorney or defendant says we're not going to be ready for trial that -- at that expedited rate, they're going -- the judge is going to take that very seriously. And if these co-defendants or Trump make motions to sever, then I think that the judge is very likely to grant that. So, what we could end up seeing is that Chesebro goes to trial in October but then the rest of these defendants maybe together maybe some of them separate, go much later on. And what that means is that that's a strategic advantage for them because they're going to be able to watch how Chesebro's trial plays out and kind of what Fani Willis's trial strategy will be, and how she will try the case. So, that's an advantage for them and may very well be helpful for the defense.",

GDP, which is the best measure of economic output is at 2.3 percent. That beats expectations. And then retail sales keep beating expectations too. On top of that, the markets are still trading near record highs. But of course, there is some bad news. Credit card debt in America is just past one trillion dollars for the first time ever. Credit card delinquencies, they're still rising, hitting over 7 percent. Now, mortgage rates now at a painful 7.77 percent. That is the highest rate that we've seen in 22 years. And Bank of America is reporting that there was a 36 percent jump in people taking hardship withdrawals from their 401Ks. And then we have some things that fall somewhere in between the good and the bad. Inflation, it has fallen significantly. It's now at 3.2 percent from the peak of 9.1 percent last June. Powell wants it though, at two percent. The average cost of a gallon of regular gas. That is $3.83. That is down from a record high of $5.01 last June. But that's been creeping up over the past few weeks, you may have noticed. And wages do keep rising, which is great for workers. It does though add to inflation and there have been several labor strikes that could be more, which helps workers secure better work conditions but often at a cost of different -- often at a cost which is disrupted services and supply chains. And then just moments ago, members of the United Auto Workers Union overwhelmingly approved possible strikes at GM, Ford, and Stellantis, which is the company behind Dodge, Ram, Jeep, and Chrysler.
