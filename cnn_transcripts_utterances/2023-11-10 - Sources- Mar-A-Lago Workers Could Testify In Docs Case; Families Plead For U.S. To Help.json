And while it may not go directly to whether or not those are classified documents, it certainly begins to paint a picture of maybe the insecurity, the lack of physical security, and at some point, the chaotic sense that these classified documents may have been kept at Mar-a-Lago.So, they are important witnesses, but again, I don't think that these are silver bullets that have been held back.

I mean, we have not got to the place here where we've got appeals, we've got issues sent up to the 11th circuit, things to delay a case, especially one like this. So, while I think it's important that she kind of keep this window open, I think at the same time, it might freeze out the issue of bringing the state of Georgia case in the middle of next year, for instance.Because, typically, the federal trials would take priority or precedence over the state court trials, and so that block some of the calendar. But again, we have not had a situation where we've been taking issues of presidential immunity and executive privilege up to the appellant courts as we prepare for a trial. Those can take some time to decide. And I think you will see those issues raised both on the federal and the state level. But at least for now, she has blocked out part of the calendar for some other cases that could move forward. I don't think she did that intentionally, but that's just the reality of what has happened. And so, we will see. I think it's probably a bittersweet pill at the same time for the Trump team especially since you saw the early Georgia trials result in pleas.
