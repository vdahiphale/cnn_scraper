And yet, despite, many are doing their best to keep some form of holiday spirit going. Lynda Kinkade reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the Berezhko family from Kyiv, this Christmas is about getting together with the Polish family that took them in soon after Russia invaded Ukraine. SERHIY BEREZHKO, UKRAINIAN REFUGEE (through translator): We arrived here with just a couple bags and with the things we had on ourselves. We left all necessary things in Ukraine and all that we have now is thanks to the Poles. KINKADE (voice-over): More than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, many with help from strangers. MAREK MIODUSZEWSKI, BEREZHKO FAMILY HOST (through translator): It was a natural impulse to help. It was in the first days of the war. We met on a freezing night outside of my house. I invited this family to my house. And I hugged them to my heart. KINKADE (voice-over): Traditionally, Ukrainian orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7th. But today, many celebrate on December 25th. And Ukraine has made it a public holiday as part of a larger break with Russian tradition. People all over eastern and central Europe are helping refugees enjoy new traditions. These proud residents organized a party for refugee children. HANA HILLEROVA-HARPER, CAROLING ORGANIZER: We felt like these kids, there's 130 children living here and they're spending their Christmas not at home but in a strange dormitory. So we're just trying to make it a little bit better for them. KINKADE (voice-over): In this Bucharest shelter, Ukrainian refugee children decorate trees with ornaments as families wait in line for packages. Many refugees are saving money for their relatives back in Ukraine, like this family now living in Prague. VASIL KHYMYSHYNETS, UKRAINIAN REFUGEE (through translator): As refugees we don't have many possibilities. We had to think if we could afford to buy a Christmas tree or not. That's why we decided to just use some branches for the decoration so that it looks good and makes the children happy. KINKADE (voice-over): A few simple decorations that carry a lot of meaning -- Lynda Kinkade, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
