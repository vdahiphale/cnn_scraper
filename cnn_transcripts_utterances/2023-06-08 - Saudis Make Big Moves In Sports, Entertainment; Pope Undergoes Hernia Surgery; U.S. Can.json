There are risks obviously of things like respiratory disease, asthma or COPD. There's also an increased risk for heart disease as a result of exposure to wildfire smoke, and there is a specific risk for pregnant people for a slightly increased risk of preterm birth.So, there is really a recommendation to try to protect yourself. You know, doctors tell us that it's not just people with conditions or in these specific groups who could potentially be vulnerable. Even healthy folks could be at risk of developing asthma or COPD, depending on how much smoke they inhale and for how long. So really, the recommendation is that everybody should try to take precautions. The American Lung Association saying \"Iff you can see or smell smoke, know that you're being exposed, and they are really recommending folks should try to stay indoors as much as possible.\" If they have to go outside experts recommend that you could wear a high-quality mask like an N-95 Or a KN-95. Those are things we're very familiar with from COVID, of course. And in the home experts really recommend good high quality air filters using HEPA filters. But they say even if those aren't available, shutting the windows running the air conditioning can be very helpful. And of course, don't forget about animals as well. A lot of these warnings can apply to our pets, in addition, so we have to look out for that as well. Back over to you.",

He was again cross examined by the lawyer for MGN Andrew Green on dozens of stories which Harry says were obtained using illegal means by the group's journalists, including phone hacking.At one point he alleged that the private investigator working for MGN fitted a tracking device in the car of former girlfriend Chelsy Davy. He described an article in the now defunct British magazine, the People that gave great detail on a private conversation between him and his father. Now King Charles, saying that kind of article just perpetuated feelings of distrust within all of my relationships. Harry highlighted this picture, an article published by the Sunday Mirror in 2007, which shows him dropping Davy off in a private road near Kensington Palace. He said he was suspicious of the means by which the photographer knew about this location, and it posed a security risk. One by one, the court went through articles published in the 1990s and 2000s. Harry detailing his suspicions about how the information was sourced. Green would then point to legitimate ways MGN reporters could have gathered information on him such as via Palace spokespeople. He repeatedly accused Harry of entering into the realms of speculation, and it's this accusation that led to Harry's only real show of emotion in his two-day appearance. Later, he was questioned by his own lawyer about how it felt to be repeatedly accused of speculating, having to sit through so much cross examination. Harry paused for a long time and got visibly choked up. Harry's evidence finished early in the afternoon and the court then heard from Jane Kerr, a former Mirror journalist who wrote many of the articles Harry identified in his testimony. Kerr has been defending her stories and has denied using any illegitimate means to obtain information. MGN is contesting all of Harry's claims saying he lacks evidence or they've been brought too late. Harry said in court today that he would feel some injustice if he and other claimants lost their case. We'll have to wait a while to hear the result, though the hearing is expected to go on for another three weeks or so. Max Foster, CNN London.",
