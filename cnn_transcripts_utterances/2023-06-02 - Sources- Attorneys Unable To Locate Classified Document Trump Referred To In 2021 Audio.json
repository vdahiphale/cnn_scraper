And we're told it was very shortly after she left that grand jury testimony the prosecutors sent a subpoena to the former president saying that they wanted any and all documents related to Iran and General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Trump is referencing on that audio recording that we reported on Wednesday.And basically, what I was told that they were specifically seeking was the document that Trump is referencing on that tape. Prosecutors made clear to Trump's legal team that they wanted that document. Trump's team, though, was unable to find it. They did produce some materials, we were told, in response to this subpoena that they got. They could not find that document, though, that is at the heart of what Trump was referencing. So, it's raised a lot of questions of where that document is. I asked Trump's attorney the other day, if it had been sent back to the National Archives, what happened to it? He declined to answer. He also didn't say whether or not Trump had declassified it as an argument they've been making. So this is just raised questions about this episode, which we know Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, is very focused on. I mean, they've been brought General Mark Milley in to talk to him about this episode because Trump was referencing him when he was on an audio recording discussing classified information.",

But a few things, number one, the Defense Department likely has a copy of it. Number two, you could get people who made the document or aware of it to testify about where it was and where it went until the point at which it went missing.

I think they think the legal significance of this, they realize how great it is, and that it could potentially be game changing when it comes to this investigation. They had been pretty confident, they were almost joyous when the documents were found at Pence's home and the Biden document situation happened, very different situations, of course, but they were almost joyful that because they thought it was essentially a guarantee that nothing would happen to their client. I think the people around the former president are very worried now that they know Jack Smith has this audio.

This obviously takes us back to January when they added an abundance of caution went looking for documents partly because of what had happened with the former president, Donald Trump, who had a special counsel appointed as a result of having declared that he was running for president. Merrick Garland also appointed a special counsel to look at the documents related to President Biden.And so, the question has been hanging over this review that has been ongoing, this investigation whether Mike Pence would also end up having a special counsel, because as we know, we're days away from a likely announcement from the vice president, the former vice president, saying that he is running for president. So, this clears the decks for him. And look, again, as Kaitlan pointed out, the circumstances are so different, right? Mike Pence finds these documents, turns them over to the National Archives and the FBI cooperates fully, allows for searches to come in, does not publicly claim that these documents are his, completely different way of handling this.

I think when you think about, Alex, over the course of the last six months, the type of cloud this has had not just over the presidency, obviously the U.S. economy, really the entire country, you have this and an opportunity not just because it was bipartisan, not just because of the development of a relationship between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but also because there are not major legislative wars that are expected in the months ahead.And that's important, not just from a legislative perspective or from a White House perspective, but also from a candidate perspective. Obviously, the President is already in announced reelection candidate in 2024. And keep in mind this these remarks tonight, this ability to get the debt ceiling behind them comes on the same day that the President got a another very strong jobs report, beating expectations once again, 339,000 jobs in May and upward revision of a pretty significant degree in April. So you put those things together and I think there's a sense from a White House officials that this will be a very clear opportunity to talk about a very critical moment not just for the presidency, not just for the White House, but really for the country given the kind of free run in the months ahead.",

This has been a cloud that has been hanging over the country for some time. And people are so anxious, despite all the good economic news.The other thing that I think you're going to hear the President stress, which is so important to him, this is another bipartisan accomplishment. And the fact that he was able to get this deal done, bring us back from the brink and work in a bipartisan manner, that's critically important, particularly for those voters in the middle who have been so tired of the partisan rancor who want to see a president who's able to bring people together to get some things done.

So, how much do you think -- how much work does he have cut out for him on the economic front? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER &amp; STRATEGIST: Well, this has been an enormous frustration of the White House for months now that they have claimed the data say the economy is great, why don't voters feel it. But you can't force a voter through sheer force of messaging to believe something that they are not feeling in their pocketbooks, in their paychecks when they go to the store. Things like inflation are still a big deal. Even though we may have a labor market that feels really hot, if people don't feel a sense of stability, that's a big problem. And so while this is certainly a victory for stability, and for not careening into the summer and into this weekend, with a massive economic, global economic crisis on our hands as a result of a potential default, that does not in and of itself mean that everyone will suddenly go, yes, Joe Biden has been great on the economy, he still has a lot of work left to do.",

Conservatives, right wing, not happy with him, progressives, left wing, not necessarily happy or thrilled with him. That's kind of the space where he won election in 2020. It's kind of the space where he's governed up to this point, particularly now in divided government has had some big wins for progressives, no question about that. But kind of from a policy perspective, from an ideology perspective, that's to some degree where he is.Look, I don't think White House officials are ignoring the fact that there's work to do with progressives who are upset on Capitol Hill. And I think you've seen over the course of the last several days, there's been dozens of briefings and phone calls trying to connect with them trying to explain. I think it is important on the work requirements, especially when people actually get a look at the legislative text and realize the exemptions that were put in place along with the broadening of those work requirements, perhaps the effect wasn't as dramatic as they thought it would be, you started to see people start to ease their concern a little bit or at least ease their criticism, not entirely, there's still work to do. But I think what officials right now, one, feel good about the deal, and two, feel good about the combination of bipartisanship and kind of what they didn't allow in this deal from a policy perspective, but also from a default perspective, is something that they will absolutely take despite the criticism.",

They've been sort of sparring with each other more on the Trump side for several weeks. But this was at close range.Of course, the Florida Governor has been talking about his conservative ideas and taking some shots at the unfinished business of the Trump years. Trump for his part has been simply casting DeSantis is unready for the job, you know, going after his claim that it would take eight years to finish the job. Of course, Ron DeSantis is making the argument that if you elect him, he can serve two terms instead of one for Trump. But all this back and forth going on here really has voters scratching their heads. We met Bob Nikkel earlier this week. He said he's still considering Trump but looking hard at DeSantis.

We're not looking for, you know, 20 candidates to emerge onto the debate stage.So by doing this, unlike the Democrats last cycle, Alex, where it was like you could meet the polling threshold, or the donor threshold, the RNC say, no, you need both, you need to have at least 1 percent support across these national polls are a mix of national and state polls, and you need these 40,000 donors, by the way from 20 states, so showing some breadth to your support as well. This is not going to be a slam dunk for every one of the 10 or 11 major contenders that are that are in this race, you see the field there. Some of these folks are not yet there.

So he could say I'm going to sign it because I think I will be. We will see if the former president decides to engage on the debate stage or not. He's done both things in the past. In fact, here in Iowa, I'm always reminded he actually skipped a presidential primary debate back in the 2015, 2016 cycle, because he did not like the rules and but the reality of that that likely hurt him.Ted Cruz actually won the Iowa caucuses at that point. So we will see if he goes through and actually skips the debate. Call me a bit skeptical about that, because the former president likes the limelight likes the spotlight and the oxygen from this television coverage, particularly on \"Fox News.\" So I would be not surprised at the end of the day if he participates, but boy, it will be a different event if he does not.
