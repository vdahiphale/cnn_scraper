So, this happens all the time.The next thing that happens is you fill out a form, you get what's called a Governor's Warrant by the governor of New York, who requests from the governor of Pennsylvania that he be brought here. He has a couple of weeks to file a writ, basically to essentially contest that and that will trigger a hearing. And at the hearing, the prosecutors will have to put forth some of their evidence to show that they have evidence to support these charges. Just a very thin amount of evidence, but they have to show that they have probable cause that a crime occurred, and then the judge will decide. So it's going to happen either way. He's going to be extradited. The only potential wrinkle would be if Pennsylvania said they wanted to go forward with their charges first, which I think they've already said they don't want to.

But I think one thing I just want to point out is it looks to me like this -- there might be a not guilty by reason of insanity defense that they're going to be thinking about, because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did. And I hear what you're saying about being radicalized. I hear what you guys are saying.

Now, the fall of the Assad regime sent shockwaves throughout the whole region.Israel says it carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria the past two days on facilities it says contained chemical weapons and long range missiles. IDF ground troops have been deployed into a demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries for the first time in 50 years. And the Israeli defense minister claimed that the Syrian naval fleet was destroyed overnight. Still, though, one of the biggest unknowns remains what the collapse of Assad means for Russia's military influence in the Middle East. Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Syrians embark on a new era after ousting longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad, Russia fears the era of its massive military footprint in Syria could be coming to an end. The former commander of Russian forces in Syria and now Member of Parliament is already warning Russia's leadership not to make concessions. Any gesture of goodwill in the Middle East is perceived as weakness. Weakness is unacceptable, he says. What should be done in this situation, he's asked. Talk from a position of strength, he answers. But how much power does Russia still hold in Syria? Kremlin control TV strategizes over what might come next with maps showing Russia's bases in Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off guard again. Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014, he says. I want to highlight one universal lesson for world powers. Don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself, this is a verdict. For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's air force pounding rebel groups, its navy firing cruise missiles at ISIS militants in eastern Syria. In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main airbase near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project power throughout the Middle East.",
