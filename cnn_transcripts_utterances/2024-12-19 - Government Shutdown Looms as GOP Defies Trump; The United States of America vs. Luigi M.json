That has been the habit. But let's get back to reality. The SWAT team is there because they're worried about a groundswell of people who are saying, we should free Luigi.

So, his decision was, I want to be an assassin, a revolutionary, a hero, and then he started to go through and look for the most worthy target, because he does write in his notes that although he procrastinated, it was a good thing, and then he settled on the insurance company because they checked off all the boxes. So, to me, the order of things was this is what I want to do, this is how I want to be famous, now I have to find a victim, then he found the victim, and then things fell into place. And one other thing that he said, he started off saying just to the feds, I worked -- I did this by myself, which is something he probably learned from the Unabomber's manifesto, because we did struggle with that originally, thinking that the Unabomber could have had some help, and this guy wanted to make sure, no, no, it's all me.",

We know in New York State, this is not a death penalty state, though it would be a federal charge and allow for it, the constituents here, the jurors, that make up that jury in federal court, are the same jurors that would make up that jury in a state court.

Fani Willis plans to appeal the decision to disqualify her from prosecuting Donald Trump in Georgia. The split appeals court decision ruled her relationship with former special prosecutor Nathan Wade tainted the case. The majority, writing -- quote -- \"While we recognize that an appearance of impropriety generally is not enough to support disqualification, this is the rare case in which disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.\"It all started in January when one of Trump's co-defendants filed a motion to get her disqualified over the alleged affair. A judge held hearings in February and March, and both Willis and Wade testified. The judge ruled Willis could stay on the case only if Wade resigned. Even though there was a -- quote -- \"odor (ph) of mendacity to their testimony,\" Wade resigned. But days after that, Trump's legal team appealed, leading to today's decision disqualifying Willis. A spokesman for Trump saying the ruling -- quote -- \"puts an end to a politically motivated persecution of the next president of the United States.\" Now, if Willis's office can't prosecute the case, a state special counsel will appoint a new prosecutor. Joining me now, former chief judge of the Fulton County Juvenile Court, Judge Glenda Hatchett. She is also a friend of Ms. Willis. Good to see you this morning -- evening, Your Honor.

There is a little bit left in that song, whether it's the way that the voice cracked intentionally or the soul came out or the arc of the note.
