Of course, this comes on the heels of a report released yesterday by the leading global authority on food insecurity that said that half of Gaza's population is now on the brink of starvation. Famine in northern Gaza is imminent, could come anytime between now and the beginning of May, with some experts indicating that famine may have already arrived to parts of northern, Gaza where we know that hundreds of thousands of civilians have been struggling to obtain just the very basic necessities. Amid all of this, we saw yesterday that the Israeli military began conducting a very dramatic and significant military operation at Al-Shifa Hospital, which they say is now being used once again by Hamas militants. The Israeli military saying that their troops are still operating at that hospital. They claimed to have killed over 50 militants and apprehended approximately 180 suspects, they say. But civilians on the ground, including one medical student who spoke with us, described the severe impact that this military operation is having on the thousands of civilians who have been sheltering at that hospital as well as on the patients as well. This medical student told us that anyone moving on the hospital grounds, they said, will be targeted by snipers and that doctors at the facility are unable to go out and treat the injured. All of this, of course, ramping up the importance of these ceasefire and hostage negotiations that are currently underway in Doha, Qatar. An Israeli delegation headed up by the Mossad director left Qatar after one day of negotiations. That is not a sign, though, that these talks are falling apart. A technical team is still on the ground and the next step now is for Israel to submit its counterproposal, some cautious optimism being voiced by the mediators involved.",

It is obviously extremely offensive to many American Jews, the idea that, because they follow the Jewish faith they should  therefore accept all of the actions that a right-wing government in Israel has taken. Even if those actions were as a result of a terror attack, a heinous terror attack on Israel itself, that attack and subsequent events have really caused a lot of soul searching for American, the American Jewish community. If there's any political tactic behind it, I guess Trump is trying to drive a wedge between Democrat -- Democratic voters and the president and Chuck Schumer, who made those remarks criticizing Netanyahu last week. The top Republican senator, the problem, however, is that 70 percent usually of American Jews vote Democratic. They're quite a liberal community.

When there are American troops on the ground, I think foreign affairs can play a major role in an election. But you're right; generally, other issues like immigration, health care, the economy are far more important. Where I think it's going to be interesting to watch this year is that there are a number of swing states that are very narrowly competitive, especially Michigan, for example, where there are large numbers of Arab American voters and progressive voters who, in the Michigan primary a few weeks ago, registered a protest vote. More than 100,000 of them against President Biden because of his handling of the conflict in Gaza and support for Israel up to that point. If only half of those people didn't show up to vote in the election in November, that could be very injurious to Biden's hopes in that state and to his hopes of winning back the White House. We don't know if the conflict is over, if that would be the case, if people would vote against Biden or not show up. It seems very, very unlikely that those voters would vote for Trump, given that he tried to institute a Muslim ban in the early months of his own presidency. So it's very fluid. It's very interesting to watch. But in an election that is as finely poised as the one we're going to have, a few thousand votes in a few states can cause a huge difference.",

He has opened the way to a lot of more violent rhetoric in politics. The march of the Republican Party, the extreme right, has shattered all sorts of standards in decorum. You're seeing some of this play out on the far left of the Democratic Party as well. So it's a much more hostile political culture in the United States. What Trump does is he gets support from a lot of people in the heartland in his political base, because he's willing to say things that a lot of people have long thought but have kept suppressed. And Trump understands that he has to keep up this brand, continue his popularity and, the result of that is, is this increasing march to the Right. And millions of Americans are following him. And that is why this is going to be one of the most incendiary elections that we've ever seen in the United States.",

The focus is on Gaza City and Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians are crammed against the border. The White House says President Biden warned prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his plans for a major ground offensive in Rafah would be a mistake. Those comments came Monday during the first known phone call between the leaders in at least a month. Meantime, America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, prepares to head to Saudi Arabia and Egypt to discuss progress toward an Israel-Hamas cease-fire. Covering all this is CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, at the White House for us. Priscilla, what did we glean, based on that phone call happening between Biden and Netanyahu and the reports that followed about the relationship between the two leaders at the moment?",

And so, you know what it really provides is that we have an imminent famine in the north, about 300,000 people who are stuck there, and that we need to avert this famine urgently. It can be done. But we need a completely different access in completely different volumes of assistance coming in. But I think also what's striking is that half the population, 1.1 million people, now are in that highest category five, catastrophic levels of food insecurity.

I think we have seen a desperate coping mechanism, people eating animal food or even mothers pretending to cook for their children in order to bring down stress and concern. And so, yes, it is a very desperate situation and, again, we are just weeks away from a famine in the north. But again, what I want to point to is really that this can be averted. We have the means. Two days ago, we entered north of Gaza with 20 trucks using a new route that was safe. We have worked on a concept that can provide to the people in an orderly and controlled manner.

Of course, that would be a completely different thing. But right now, we don't really see any option where this can be done in an orderly and safe way for the beneficiaries included and based on humanitarian principles, reaching those most in need.
