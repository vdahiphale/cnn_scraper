You can't have this both ways. I don't judge him for taking the job at Colorado. They probably increased his salary by something like 15 times, right? I totally get that. It all makes sense.But what he did was something that college coaches do all the time, which is, you have to sell people four year, ten year plans, when your plan is always one year at a time. That's the only way that you can really pull that off. And so he came and he sold a long-term vision for what was going on at Jackson State, but his goals and ambitions were always to be a power five head coach. My take has always been, he went to Jackson State primarily because he wanted to be a head coach but didn't want to ever be anybody's assistant coach. So, he had to find somebody that would give him a job and make him a head coach and so he could have that on his resume and then he could take that to try to get the job that he actually wanted. Jackson State was the place that could do it. And he did a lot of good work while he was at Jackson State.
