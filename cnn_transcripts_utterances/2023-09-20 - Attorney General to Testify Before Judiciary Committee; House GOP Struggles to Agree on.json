It makes charging decisions and investigative decision as its own entity.And that is really a central point of what Garland is going to say in front of the House Judiciary Committee today. One expert -- excerpt really hones in on that point. It says, look, \"I'm not the president's lawyer. I will also add that I'm not Congress's prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people.\" You know, again, making clear that, when it comes to investigating and criminal charges, the Justice Department makes those decisions outside of political influence. Now, look, Republicans and Democrats are going to have their chance to question Garland directly, as you said. Republicans are really going to probably focus on two main issues, right? Hunter Biden, this idea and the claims that he got a sweetheart plea deal. Also, that there was claims of political influence over the investigation of Hunter Biden.

But he's walking a line I think you saw Zach Cohen refer to part of his testimony: I'm not the president's lawyer. It's important people understand that about the attorney general. I'm also not Congress's prosecutor. And there is an attempt to politicize justice in our country, to reduce faith in law and order and justice. And so this is a chance for the attorney general to try to draw a bright line and clear that up.
