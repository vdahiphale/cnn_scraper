It shows that moment, over the weekend, when the U.S. says a Chinese military ship set sail in front of a U.S. destroyer, causing the U.S. vessel to have to slow down to avoid a collision. The ships are said to have come within about 140 meters of each other. You can see the distance right there. Now, all of this happening as the U.S. was taking part in a joint exercise with the Canadian navy. China's defense minister accusing the U.S. of staging provocations and trying to destabilize the region. And as relations remain strained, a top White House official says President Joe Biden will meet with his Chinese counterpart, quote, \"at some point.\" Here's how one former official believes the U.S. should respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: I think what this requires is the kind of strategic response that shows that the United States, whether it's in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, or anywhere else, is simply not going to give up its rights to transit the straits to have innocent passage for its naval vessels. And, to show to China their assertion of sovereignty over any part of China -- of the world that we don't recognize already as China, something we're simply not going to accept. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One was to attack the United States and blame it for all of the problems in the region. The other one was to appeal to the Southeast Asian nations and provide them with a Chinese alternative to the U.S.-led ruled-based international order. And the alternative that General Li laid out is actually a pretty appealing one. Of peace and stability, and commerce and everything wonderful that you could imagine. The problem, of course, is that in many of the Southeast Asian officials of the communist (ph) part of the South is that China's words and his actions don't match. And we saw a pretty striking example of that during the conference as the Chinese general was preaching peace and stability. A Chinese warship, almost rammed into a U.S. warship in the Taiwan Strait, an aggressive and unprovoked move. So, you know, I think the Chinese general did his best to present a charm offensive at Singapore. Fortunately, I think at large, it fell upon deaf ears.",

Well, U.S. officials have stopped putting timelines on a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, because they don't think it's really helpful to say.But most of them believe that China will have the capability to invade Taiwan, although it hasn't made the decision to invade Taiwan. By about 2027. Now, what the Chinese defense minister said very clearly is China will reunify with Taiwan, whether you like it or not. And anyone who tries to get in the way, we'll fight. And so, that was a very aggressive message. He didn't put a timeline on it either. But he said it eventually will happen, and that reserves the right to use force to make it happen. The question, I think, from the audience was, well, if you're not going to use force, what are you doing to entice the Taiwanese? What are you doing to persuade them? What are your efforts towards a peaceful reunification? Because from Taiwan's perspective, it doesn't look like China's doing much at all to make the Taiwanese want to rejoin. So, they're really leaving themselves no other option but to attack. So, again, I think this is where you see a very reasonable message coming from the Chinese, which is we want to peacefully reunify but a very aggressive posture which undermines that decision, and really scares the heck out of a lot of people in the region, including the Taiwanese.",

That triggered a manhunt, and then in ensuing a firefight between what turned out to be an Egyptian security officer and Israeli soldiers ended in a third Israeli soldier being killed, as well as the Egyptian security officer. Now, the Israeli military says it appears as though this Egyptian security officer crossed the border fence, the barrier between the two using what appeared to have been some sort of emergency exit and entry point. And we do have an image that was reported by the Israeli public broadcaster, Kan News, which shows what seems to be a sort of small square opening in the fence. The Israeli media reporting that it was helped shut just by zip ties. So the zip ties must have been cut some way for the security officer to be able to cross the border. Now, the Egyptian military is saying that this security officer was actually in pursuit of drug smugglers when he breached the border and then engaged in the fire fight, although, the Egyptian military also saying that they are expressing condolences to those who were killed. Now, the Israeli media is reporting that this officer was found to have not only his regular weapon but extra magazines on his persons. But all indications we're seeing from both the Egyptian and Israeli officials is that they are trying to treat this as a very unusual and isolated incident. And that it does not -- that it does not spiral into a bigger situation. The Israeli minister of defense and the Egyptian minister of defense have already spoken on the phone together, saying that they're going to cooperate on the investigation. And the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson saying that this situation is not indicative of the relationship between the two militaries, who often cooperate with one another, especially to try to thwart guns and weapon smuggling along this portion of the Sinai desert. But a lot of questions still to be -- still unanswered, including why was this Egyptian security officer crossing the border fence without alerting the Israeli military, and he seemed to be by himself. Why was he going after drug smugglers, as the Egyptian military says, by himself. And from the Israeli military, there's a lot of questions about the -- those two soldiers in those outposts. They should've been checked in upon once an hour. That was not done so, according to the Israeli military. How, also, did somebody cross the border without -- without triggering some sort of alarm?
