But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he's pessimistic is deal can be reached before the June 1st deadline. And a special counsel appointed during the Trump administration has released his findings about the FBI's Trump/Russia probe. He concluded the FBI did not have enough evidence to launch a full-blown investigation and connections between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Two sources tell CNN that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is preparing to launch his 2024 presidential campaign before the end of the month. He has been widely expected to enter the Republican primary. On Monday he criticized his party's recent track record at winning elections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): The party has developed a culture of losing. I think that there is no accountability and I think in Florida we really showed what it takes to not just win, win big, and then deliver big. What results are you producing for people? That is really what matters. You can sit there and talk about cable news, social media, all these other things that people are fixated on.

Inside the party he would enter the race with as much money if not more than anyone in the field who isn't Trump. But concerns remain amongst DeSantis donors and supporters over his willingness to take on the former president.Meanwhile, Governor DeSantis has signed a bill defunding diversity, equity and inclusion programs at all state universities in Florida. The new law also bars public universities from spending state or federal funds on programs that promote social or political activism and demand that courses not include a curriculum that teaches identity politics. DeSantis signed the bill at New College of Florida, where he placed conservative political allies on the school's board of trustees earlier this year. And the Florida governor's cultural crusade against issues of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools is having ripple effects.

The parent who reported her also happens to be on the local school board. CNN's Isabel Rosales has more.
