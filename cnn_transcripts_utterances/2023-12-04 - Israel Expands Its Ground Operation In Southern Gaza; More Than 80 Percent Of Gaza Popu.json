All of this raising a lot of fears about what it means for those people who are struggling to survive. I want to bring in CNN's Larry Madowo in Cairo for us, following these developments. Larry, I want to put this into context for people, because prior to the war starting on October 7th, roughly around 500 aid trucks entered into Gaza every single day --500.

So, that's one example of how we are seeing these health impacts -- indirect health impacts of the conflict. And also last week, World Health Organization Director General, Dr. Tedros, he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that we know about 1.3 million people are currently living in shelters. Overcrowding and lack of food, water, sanitation and basic hygiene, waste management, access to medications, all has resulted in a high number of acute respiratory infections. At least 100,000 infections, around 12,000 cases of scabies, 11,000 cases of lice, around 75,000 cases of diarrhea-related illness with about half of those in young children.

We are not fighting the people of Gaza. The people of Gaza are not the enemy of Israel. And it is Hamas that is the enemy of Israel. And indeed, when we are telling people to evacuate from specific locations, those are specific locations, our centers of gravity of Hamas' activities. And it's what we are doing over the last three or four days now since we've resumed our operations is a more specific plan of action for individuals, so that they know where to go, whether it's leaflets or websites or announcements or radio announcements, all these different types of methods that we have in order to get people out of harm's way. And indeed, of course, there is going to be challenges. And as you rightly pointed out, since the dawn of war, civilians have been caught up in it. It is a tragedy, and we have to do everything in our power to limit those casualties, to limit the civilian effect. I can assure you that is precisely how -- that is the guiding principle of the IDF, to distinguish between the civilians, to distinguish between the non-combatants and the terrorists.

You know, just as we were coming out, there's an interesting component. We killed a squad of rocket-propelled grenade, RPG launchers that were conducting an attack against one of our forces in the north. They come out of a hole in the ground, a tunnel. They try and conduct an attack. We took them out. They are wearing jeans and sandals. So, if somebody picks them up, they're counting civilians. They're not counting terrorists. So, I would say the intelligence gathering is extensive. It is widespread. And it serves the operational goal of defeating and destroying Hamas, which is a, I would say, a guiding principle or a guiding directive of what we are conducting as we speak today, but also to bring back the hostages that remain -- the 137 hostages with women and children that Hamas refused to release, and therefore we are today back in battle.",

We are at Kubik's factory facility where we're going to be converting over 45,000 kilos of plastic waste every single day into our building materials. Today's a very exciting and a very emotional day. It's been two years in the making with a lot of ups and downs in making it work.
