With us, any moment now a portrait of pain and grief in Memphis. You see the scene right there. The family of Tyre Nichols is about to speak.They are doing so just a few hours before the world gets to see a horrific video, video a police beating of Mr. Nichols and the family is speaking one day after five now fired police officers were indicted for murdering their 29 year old son. This morning just a jaw dropping preview of what we will see that video and it comes direct from the Memphis police chief. She warns her officers acted quote, the same if not worse, than the L.A. cops who beat Rodney King a generation ago. Her officers the chief says escalated, their aggression she says it's just simply unexplainable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF CERELYN \"CJ\" DAVIS, MEMPHIS POLICE: I was outraged. I was - it was incomprehensible to me. It was unconscionable. I don't think I've witnessed anything of that nature my entire career.",

You can really feel, John, today the emotion of this story, the pain that law enforcement is feeling as a result of this. And that's really what's going on here. Today for the most part, the streets are quiet. We're in downtown here in Memphis. There's not a lot of activity. We're not seeing an uptick in police activity. Some of the school events here for tonight have been canceled across the city as they prepare for this video, which is set to be released in about six hours here. So, it's going to be a difficult night for sure. But, you know, you can really sense that people are preparing themselves for what they're about to see more from an emotional and just how difficult this is going to be than anything else. And in terms of any kind of reaction here in Memphis, the police are prepared and police all across the country are making preparations, just in case there's any kind of reaction, John?",

With me to share their expertise and their insights, the former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams, and the former maryland state police commander, Neill Franklin.Major Franklin, I want to start with you, and I want to listen to more Chief Davis. I know you know, Chief Davis in Memphis. And one of the striking things about this tragic situation is that the family keeps applauding this police chief for her actions and for her words. Listen here, as she describes one of the painful, painful things we are going to see when this video is released later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. First, regarding the timeline of the release, I think the chief also spoke to this. And people have been questioning this decision, but you want as few people out and about as possible. Schools will be closed. Many of your businesses will be closed. You know, we're coming into the weekend, there'll be less traffic, less people out and about and better conditions for safety and better conditions for the police to get ahead on things.Hopefully, you know, things won't go right. We talked about being optimistic and that's where we need to begin with this. I think her actions, her swift actions, and many police chiefs don't have the ability to fire people so quickly. But her swift actions, the investigation, how quickly that took place, the prosecutor moving very quickly on placing charges has a lot to do with the potential response from the citizens. I think it was Benjamin Crump, who said this is a blueprint for how these things should be investigated when they do occur. So, I think Chief Davis has done a wonderful job thus far, and in light of the circumstances. And just real quick, she spoke about reducing the number of higher ranks in her department, so she can put more first line supervisors on the street. And I think we should talk about that later. But it's very important that police departments take a look at this strategy across the board. Because we have these young police officers who have a lot of power at their fingertips, and you need good, consistent, first line supervision. The well-trained, police officers are well trained, but we have to enforce that training through first line supervision.",

Today is obviously about the video and about the family and about the prosecution. But we should continue that. Elliot, one of the interesting things, I want you to listen to the police chief here. You know, we have murky information, very vague information about how this played out.But what we did have on the record was that there was some reckless driving. And that was the initial - the police were pulling Mr. Nichols over because of reckless driving. Listen to the chief, she says, and she has seen the video, and she obviously has access to information that we have not made public. And she says, she cannot even see the probable cause for that.

Number one, John, there were two different charges that the officers are facing related to official misconduct, set aside the violent crime that happened here, which of course they're charging. But, you know, the prosecutor clearly has identified that something went wrong, and how the police even conducted their jobs. There's also an indication that they were - I think, using elevated toner was highly charged when they approached the vehicle in the first place.Now, look, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which talks about searches and seizures, really says that for the most part, when you encounter a police officer, you're free to go. And this whole idea of creating this custodial situation where he did not - clearly did not feel he was free to go was restrained, being beaten and so on. All plays into the legitimacy of the stop and plays into number one, whether they should have been there in the first place, and two the charges against the officers themselves. So, there's a lot going on here. I think again, I don't want to speak before I see this video, but I think there's improper conduct from the officers even outside of overstepping the bounds physically.",

      "sentences": "Yes. They definitely do seem to have that different perspective. One of the key things that I think that the police and the authorities here have done so well is bringing the families into this very early on, keeping them informed, telling them, the D.A yesterday saying, I spoke to the family about the charges that we were considering, including them in that process, showing them the video, telling them everything that was going on.And not just anyone at the police department, you're talking to chief, the mayor, you're talking the district attorney, that is a very important thing to do. Anytime you have families who are suffering like this, who need information, keeping them informed and keeping them in the loop on what they were thinking and what they knew, I think is one of the big differences in this. And making them part of their decision and making them feel like they're part of every decision that the D.A was doing, that the police were doing, they told the families we are going to be releasing this video, but we just need some time. And what that does is then you can have the families come out and talk. And the attorney like Ben Crump come out and talk to the community and say, hey, this is what we are being told by the police. This is what we are being told by the authorities and we believe them, and so you should believe them. So let this play out. And let's keep the peace. And we will get to a point where you will see this video. And I think another important point in all of this, John, is because a lot of people are talking about this is should we see the video? Should the video be out there because it's so horrific? The family is asking for this video to be out there. They feel it's important because it's about accountability. It's about making sure people realize that what happened here should never happen and should never happen again. And in some cases, the only way, perhaps, is to see the violence of this, that perhaps if people see this violence, perhaps if people see what happened here, maybe in some way, it could prevent it. Because we've seen time and time again, where video was not released. And it's problematic when it's not. And I think even though we've had to wait 20 days, ultimately, I think the family and that's what's really so important here, John, is the family. What are the family's desires? And what are the family's wishes. And I think the D.A and the police have been doing that very well and meeting that.",
