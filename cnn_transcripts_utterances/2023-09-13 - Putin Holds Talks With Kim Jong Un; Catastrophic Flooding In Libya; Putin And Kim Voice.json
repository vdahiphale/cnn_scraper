      "sentences": "Well, this hour, on diplomatic display, the deepening ties between Russia's Vladimir Putin and NorthKorea's Kim Jong Un, the two leaders came together in Russia's Far East earlier. Whole Libyan neighborhoods have been washed away after catastrophic flooding smashed through two dams. 5,000 people are dead. At least 10,000 are missing. Well, after 14 days on the run, an escaped convict has been captured in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. He is serving a life sentence for first degree murder. And Ukrainian missiles pounded shipyards in Russian-annexed Crimea. Two dozen people were wounded. Well, \"productive candid talks\", that is how Russian President Vladimir Putin describes his meeting earlier today in eastern Russia with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But, just what did they talk about? Well, Putin says, the five hours sit down focused on topics like Russia helping North Korea develop a space program and agriculture initiatives. Kim praised Putin, saying Russia will defeat and punish \"evil forces\", an apparent endorsement of Russia's war on Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIM JONG UN, NORTH KOREAN LEADER (Translated): Russia is engaged in a fight for justice to defend the sovereign right and security interest against the hegemonic forces. We have been expressing the full and unconditional support to all measures that you have taken in response, and that in the front line of anti-imperialism and independence, I will always be standing with Russia. I'm using this opportunity to make it clear. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They head up to heavily sanctioned countries, and they stoodunited today against the United States, against the West, thinly veiled statements made towards both. And it was very clear that the talks were military and focus, just from the very fact of where they were held. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice-over): Kim Jong Un is given the red carpet tour of Russia's successful space program. According to one reporter present, he asked \"a lot of very detailed questions\". UN (Translated): Is it eight meters in total? HANCOCKS (voice-over): Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is happy to share the knowledge that Kim craves, a sharing of information Washington has been warning off. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Translated): The North Korean leader has shown great interest in rocket technology. They're also trying to develop space. We have good competencies. We will show them our new facility, the new Cosmodrome, HANCOCKS (voice-over): North Korea's last two attempts to put a spy satellite into space have failed. Putin showed Kim his Presidential limousine manufactured by Russian luxury automaker Aurus, reminiscent of former U.S. President Donald Trump showing off \"The Beast\" to Kim during friendlier times in Singapore. Kim praised Putin for standing up against hegemonic forces, a thinly veiled swipe at the United States and the West, even appearing to toast Russia's war in Ukraine. UN (Translated): I firmly believe that the Russian Military and people will inherit the shining tradition of victory and demonstrate their dignity and honor on the frontline of military operation. HANCOCKS (voice-over): U.S. and South Korean intelligence predict an arms deal including North Korea providing Russia with much needed ammunition to use in Ukraine. The symmetry and their weaponry means certain ammo could be used immediately by Russia. Another possibility, the very public meeting could be sending a message.",

These before and after satellite images of hard hit Derna show the scale of this devastation. And I've got to warn you, some of the images coming in from that city are frankly graphic. Hospitals are at capacity. Bodies lined the streets, as the morgues are full. And Libya's International Rescue Committee has now warned of a \"crisis within a crisis\" without access to clean water and sanitation. It is calling on the international community for help. Well, various countries have already started to send in aid, but there are major blockades, both physical and political, for trying to get help where it is needed most. Let's kick this off with our Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman. He knows this country well. Ben, you've covered it for many years. You're joining us now live. Can we just talk about what we understand to be the international aid response at this point, and what is needed?",

Forinstance, Turkey sent three airplane -- four low airplanes full of search and rescue personnel as well as equipment. We know that, for instance, Italy is also dispatching firefighters. Variety of things are being offered, are arriving. The problem is that, for instance, many of the roads and bridges into Derna, which is the hardest hit area, have been destroyed by the flood, and therefore it's very difficult to get anything there. In fact, Italy is sending a ship, which is probably the easiest way to get a large amount of relief supplies to the city as opposed to a land route. And otherwise, the only way to get to the city is via helicopter. And that obviously has challenges in and of itself. So, the logistical challenges are very big. I mean, you do need to get all sorts of things. You need to get generators. You need to get water purification equipment. In addition to personnel, search and rescue people, medical personnel as well, and getting them all there is proving to be quite a challenge given the destruction that this earthquake caused. And of course, one of the immediate problems that's becoming very apparent is that there are so many dead bodies in the city. It appears just from the video, hundreds, perhaps thousands are out in the open. The morgues are all full. It's not clear if they even have enough electricity to provide refrigeration for the bodies. And doctors have said, they are worried about an environmental disaster, basically, an outbreak of disease as a result of this body. So, for instance, some of the bodies are being loaded into trucks and sent to Tobruk where they actually do have refrigeration facilities for those bodies. So, it's a logistical nightmare at the moment, Becky.",

And if the deadbodies were allowed to ferment and release bugs and bacteria, that could be lethal to the people who are still alive. I suspect what the people need is immediate evacuation out of that city, which, by definition, is no longer really suitable for living, because the city itself is divided into two halves. You cannot go from one side of the city to the other. You have to go out to the city, go all the way to the south of Derna, then try to join in the other side, about 100-mile journey, or they're about to be able to see your relative, your friend on the other side. In addition to that, the road access to Derna, which is parallel to the sea, has unfortunately been damaged on both -- on either side of the city. So, there is only one route to Derna that come from the south that goes through villages close to (inaudible). And unfortunately, even (inaudible) and nearby villages have been badly hit. And there is so many deaths and so much difficult to access these people, even to provide them with simple amenity of needs of life, sadly. What they really need is to evacuate those who are at risk, at the same time very urgent to try to gather these dead bodies and bury them as soon as possible.",

I think the authorities should be firm that any house or any property in line with the flow of water, with potential flow of water in future should be discouraged, and find an alternative accommodation for these people. That's number one. Number two, we need really to support cities and towns nearby Derna, like Benghazi, Tobruk, and other villages nearby, in order to allow people of Derna who are currently available as IDPs (Internally Displaced People). And Benghazi, for example, we have 10 schools which full of people, have been displaced from Derna, the same will apply to Tobruk, I'm sure, and they'll wait there. These people will need, again, to have as normal life as possible in terms of access to basic life needs, and the kids needs to go to school, and these people need to be able to access hospitals for care and so on. But, the problem is that you have to -- the school is about to start in Libya, maybe in one or two weeks' time, and they will be forced to leave the schools to find somewhere to live, which really, the current governments from both sides will not be capable of erecting the required housing and accommodation needed for these people in such a short time.",

After 14 days on the running, escaped murderer has been caught in theUnited States earlier today in Pennsylvania. Danelo Cavalcante was captured through a combination of heat-seeking technology and a Police canine. Here you see him being loaded on to a Police van. Well, regular viewers of this show will remember that he escaped by crab-walling -- crab-walking up the wall of a prison yard on August 31.

What wewere told was that at about 12 midnight, a little after midnight last night, there was a local burglar alarm that went off in a residence that authorities went and checked on that burglar alarm. But then, at about one o'clock a.m. Eastern Time, there was a heat signature that was picked up by a DEA aircraft flying overhead. They wanted to, you know, zero in and send teams in there. But then, they had a lightning storm that forced the aircraft to back out of the area and get out of the sky. However, they were able to send tactical teams to the area where that heat signature was detected shortly after 1 a.m. Eastern Time. And by eight o'clock a.m. Eastern Time, shortly after eight o'clock, that's when the teams had isolated Cavalcante lying in the tall grass in a field. The teams moved in on him. According to Police, he was unaware that they were there, but then very quickly became aware that they were there. Then, he started to crawl away quickly. That's when they released the canine. It was either a German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois that they released. The dog tracked him, basically got on top of him, and he went flat, and the dog at one point bit him, but that's when he was subdued by Police. One of the other additional details was that while he was crawling on the ground, he had that rifle that he had stolen within arm's reach the entire time, and the rifle was within arm's reach when the dog was on top of him. So, a bit of a close call there. But, thankfully, neither the dog nor any law enforcement officers nor any members of the public were harmed. And shortly after 8 a.m. Eastern Time, they took Danelo Cavalcante into custody. We were told that he looked pretty depleted, that he had been -- we know that he'd been out on the run for close to two weeks. And they finally have him in custody. They have not said really anything about whether he has spoken. We get indications that he has not spoken, and said anything to them as of yet. But, of course, investigators are going to be questioning him.",

But, when David Ignatius, the Columnist for The Washington Post, who has been close to this President for many, many years, for many decades, actually, when he makes this type of blunt argument in the pages of The Washington Post, that certainly has taken a lot of people by surprise and taking notice of this. The question is, is he trying to send a message, or who is he trying to send a message through to, uh, to get to the President? He was very blunt in this, and he is not really coming from it from a critical way as much as from a way of admiration. He said he has been a very successful President. He said it pains me to write this, but he launches an argument on a couple of fronts, once the age of the President, and as well, the Vice President. He says, they believe that she simply is not going to help the ticket here. And he was explaining earlier this morning in another interview why he did this. And he said, he is saying this now, because he believes there should be at least a conversation about this. This is something that the Democratic Party does not want to talk about. Democratic Senators do not want to talk about the President's age. White House advisors don't want to do that. So, this is why David Ignatius says he is injecting into the bloodstream, if you will, to get this conversation going. But it's very blunt. And the President has not commented on this specifically, but you can bet, he has read it. And his words reflect our polls. You can see there. 67 percent of Democrats told our poll last week that they would like to see a different candidate.",

But, look, there are no signs that President Biden has given any indication that he does not plan to run. In fact, quite the opposite. His re-election campaign is already well underway.

That's what a Ukrainian official said, following an overnight attack that Kyiv carried out on a shipyard in what is Russian-annexed Crimea. Now, Kremlin says Ukraine launched 10 cruise missiles, three uncrewed boats also involved. In the end, Russian officials say two ships that were being repaired were damaged in the attack, and they say 24 people were wounded. Let's get you back to CNN's Melissa Bell in Kyiv.
