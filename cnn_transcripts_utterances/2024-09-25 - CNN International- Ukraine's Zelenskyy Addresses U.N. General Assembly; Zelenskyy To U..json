Energy must stop being used as a weapon. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians, possibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the UN Charter and guarantee our right, Ukraine's right to territorial integrity and sovereignty, just as we do for any other nation.

We all remember Chernobyl at the end of the 1980s. It was a catastrophe, and Russia has been systematically threatening the integrity of the power plant, for instance, at Zaporizhzhia. And actually, at the beginning of this month, I met with the IAEA Chief, Rafael Grossi. He was in Ukraine. He had visited Zaporizhzhia. And he was saying, it's a really dicey and tricky and very dangerous time, because Russia has cut off some of the electricity to there, and if that proceeds in that way, it will end the cooling ability of the reactor, and that could lead to a Chernobyl meltdown. So, it's very, very real problem, and the West really needs to understand it.",

Look, he is warning about radiation to take up the whole world from a spillover, disaster at Zaporizhzhia, the nuclear plant, or some of the other plants. I think he called Putin, in fact, almost insane with his land grab. He said Russia is 20 times the size of Ukraine, and he is saying the war is over, in effect, that Russia has to realize that.

Everybody in the region understood that, and has tried while supporting the people in Gaza, who've been under basically the most inhumane system of warfare mankind has ever seen, the -- to avoid falling into the trap of the Israelis.

This is the first time a missile fired by Hezbollah has ever come this close to Tel Aviv.

So, Jeremy, this moment in Tel Aviv, an intercepted missile, this would understandably rattle residents. What are we hearing from Israeli officials? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, no doubt about it that the residents who woke up this morning in Tel Aviv to the sound of sirens, were certainly rattled by that ballistic missile that was fired towards the city, the first ever to be fired by Hezbollah towards the city of Tel Aviv, and the furthest south that a Hezbollah missile appears to have reached. That was just one ballistic missile, though, and it was indeed intercepted by an air defense system known as David's sling. As far as Israeli officials are concerned, frankly, they have been expecting more from Hezbollah. They had been expecting more from Hezbollah. As Israeli officials -- as I've talked to Israeli officials over months now about potential scenarios for an all-out war with Hezbollah, or certainly a very severe intensification of the conflict, they have talked about this notion of hundreds of missiles being fired simultaneously by Hezbollah, multiple long-range missiles fired simultaneously in order to try and disrupt and evade Israel's very advanced air defense systems. And instead, that is certainly not what we have seen. We have seen Hezbollah fire a few hundred rockets a day over the last couple of days, but certainly not that amount of rockets and missiles being fired simultaneously, and part of that appears to be because the Israeli military has certainly severely degraded Hezbollah's ability to carry out command and control operations to fire its rockets, and certainly destroyed a significant portion of its rocket arsenal, although it is not clear how much exactly. And what also remains unclear is the extent to which Hezbollah will be able to regroup following this last week of attacks, and should it have the capability and the willingness, importantly as well, to carry out have -- had been expecting, but have yet to see actually be carried out by Hezbollah so far.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The sunrise, that beautiful view we had this morning is no more, as the weather conditions just continue to deteriorate throughout the day. We are on the right side of the storm. But, what a storm. It really is, because it is battering Cozumel, Mexico, and Havana, Cuba, at the same time, a distance of more than 500 kilometers. So, that's how big it is, and it is gaining in strength, as it travels over the warm waters of the Yucatan channel.So, throughout the day, we expect, and we are already feeling the weather conditions just to get worse and worse here, as these outer bands continue to go through. So, more rain, some more wind, and it will just continue to soak us throughout the day. And the dangerous thing there is, even if it doesn't make a direct hit on Cuba, of course, the city of Havana has so much aging infrastructure in it, that as the storm passes, as things begin to dry out, that is when a lot of the old stonework here begins to collapse and fall. So, even if you don't get the heavy winds the storm will bring to Florida, it still can cause a lot of damage and destruction here. We expect to have storm surge, having flooding along the coast of the city, as typically happens when you have a storm pass by close to here, and then it travels on to Florida as a much stronger hurricane, as potentially a major hurricane. Having covered those is much different than what I'm experiencing. That is when you cannot be in many types of structures. That is when you have to get away from the coast because of the dangerous storm surge that it brings. That is when many homes will not stand up to that kind of wind speed. So, certainly to the people in the storm's path that are going to get a lot more serious blow than we're receiving right now in Cuba. They need to finish up their preparations, because the storm they're going to be facing in the next day or two will be a very different one than what's currently taking place here in Cuba.",
