Believing he has now got a mandate from the American people to enact his policies. Amongst his top priorities, the mass detention and deportation of migrants. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security are said to be bracing for a seismic shift in immigration policy.

She's actually going to be the first female chief of staff in the history of the country. She is somebody who has been loyal to him for years, somebody who served as his co-chair of his campaign, and somebody who was really there next to the former president. And when he saw Republicans across the party try to distance themselves from the former president. Now, I do want to read you the statement that Donald Trump put out on his naming of Susie Wiles. He said, Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and it was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns. President Trump said, Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to make America great again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud. The one thing to keep in mind about Susie Wiles is that we have learned from sources that she did have some stipulations in taking this job, essentially saying that she wasn't -- she wanted to make sure she had control of the clown car, that they wouldn't have access to the White House at all times. And that is something that we saw in the first administration, that these controversial outside figures who caused problems for Donald Trump had free reign at the White House. And something Susie did during the campaign was essentially try and stop that kind of chaos around former President Donald Trump. She always said to sources that she knew she couldn't control candidate Trump. However, she felt she could control some of the people and circumstances around him. This really sets the tone for what the administration is going to look like. Susie is well respected across the political spectrum. We'll obviously see how the rest of these naming of appointments, of putting forward candidates goes in the next several days. Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Particularly late in the campaign, Trump and the people around him were making pretty naked isolationist appeals to the electorate. And that didn't seem to hurt him, may have even helped him. And so our allies are afraid that that's what they're going to see.President Trump likes to cut deals. Those deals tend to have sort of short-term benefits for the United States, at the cost of long-term benefits for our allies -- I mean, I'm sorry, for our adversaries. And so I could well imagine Xi Jinping and Putin putting together deals that would look good in the short run, but actually hurt American interests in the long run. And they'll see if Trump will go for it. It is interesting that the rest of the world sees this election as a sign of American decline. That's the opposite of the message that President Trump emphasized on the campaign trail. He sold this as a return to American greatness. The rest of the world looks at it as a confirmation that America's in decline. And we'll soon find out which is right. He's likely to be the same president in the next term that he was in his first term. But what has changed is the composition of people around him. And in the first term, he had quite a few people who would say to him, boss, are you sure you want to do that? If we do that, then this and this and this will happen. And that'll be adverse. And they talked the president out. They didn't block the president from doing it. But they warned him of consequences. And then he had second thoughts. It's likely that in the second in his second term, he's not going to have those kind of truth tellers around him. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It was important to make that distinction that many of these marches are, in fact, anti-war marches against Israel's military actions in Gaza, not necessarily anti-Semitic protests. But, again, there have been instances of anti-Semitic attacks on the fringe of these movements.

And now we are learning that quietly, behind the scenes, Trump allies and some in the private sector have been preparing for exactly that, essentially detaining and deporting migrants on a large scale.Now, a key component of that is detention space. Of course, if their federal authorities arrest someone, they would also have to detain them before repatriating them to their home country. And the private sector is involved because the federal government often relies on contractors to manage these detention spaces. And that is part of the quiet preparations that are happening behind the scenes. And they are expected to ramp up in the days and weeks to come. But current and former officials I've spoken with say that the challenge here is also the money and the resources. That is why the federal government has not been able to do mass deportations in recent memory, in addition to other concerns, for example, the impact it would have on the economy. But practically speaking, the amount that it costs to apprehend, detain, process and remove an undocumented immigrant, according to some analysis, is nearly $11,000. That's for one individual. Now, former official I spoke with to do something at a big scale the way that Donald Trump has said he wants to do would cost millions, if not billions of dollars, and therefore would be difficult to execute on in addition to the need, for example, for more personnel. Now, the Department of Homeland Security has reprogrammed funds before, essentially moving funds around to try to bolster their immigration enforcement. But again, doing something as big as mass deportation is costly. All the same, though, preparations, sources say, are underway to try to execute on this part of the discussion, being to focus on those undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Another part of the discussion is whether to also include those undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children known as DREAMers. Now, that segment of the undocumented population has typically had bipartisan support, and some are protected, temporarily protected, under an Obama-era program. But certainly a lot of discussion underway as to how this first order of business would look like, one that Donald Trump has repeatedly talked about and has indicated that he intends on doing.
