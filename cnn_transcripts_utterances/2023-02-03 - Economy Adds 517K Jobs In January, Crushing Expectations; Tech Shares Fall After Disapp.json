      "sentences": "If you want to get ahead, read a book. So we are at the New York Public Library tonight with an hour left togo for trading on Wall Street. The market is down. We had jobs numbers, which the market liked and then decided it didn't, which explains the chart that you're seeing on the screen at the moment. It's all a bit peculiar, but those are the markets and these are the main events of the day. The US jobs market bonanza. It is red hot, we need to understand for how long and why. A very different picture in the world of tech, with Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, all posting weak earnings. And tonight, I sit down with the New York Public Library President. He wants to teach the whole world to read, preferably with books from his library. Live from the New York Public Library on Friday, it is February 3rd. We have slipped elegantly into February. I am Richard Quest, and at the New York Public Library, I most certainly mean business. Yes, a very good evening to you. Part of our summer series, which then became winter series, and now anytime of the year, we like to be out and about and we are delighted and very grateful that the New York Public Library have allowed us to interlope, yes, they put us in the lobby, a long way from the readers down there where there's lots \"shhh\" but I'm told I can make as much noise as I like out here, which is just as well, the way we're going. There are millions of books in these hallowed halls, and we will give you the history and show you some of the finest exhibits that they have to show. All of that is later in the hour. First, though 517,000 -- over half a million new jobs added. That was much more than the market had been expecting, and consequently initially gave a real bump, yet, the unemployment rate itself is now at the 53-year low, which shows an extraordinarily strong labor market despite the Fed hiking rates. So we decided, since we are in a library, we would try and understand the economic data in terms of the books. What economic lessons can we learn? Our stock markets hope the Fed will change course. For example, \"Don Quixote\" tilting at windmills, or perhaps it's more like Dickens, you can never go wrong with Dickens, the best of times in the labor market, the worst of times in the tech sector. If you're reading is more Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in \"A Hundred Years of Solitude,\" that you'll know the quote, \"There is always something left to love.\" Even the labor market today where consumer spending, which is still going strong. You can't go wrong with Leo Tolstoy in \"War and Peace.\" All we can know is we know nothing, so he said, and with today's economic data, it proves him right. Finally, I think you have to look at Jane Austen to get to the real nub of it all. It is a truth universally acknowledged that an economy on the precipice of a recession must be in want of jobs. Hang on. Had she been reading the latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics? It's an idea blown out of the water. Matthew Luzzetti is actually the Chief US Economist at Deutsche Bank. So you heard the quotes, where are we in this job market?",

We learned that we have a completely different picture for the labor market, adding over half a million jobs and an unemployment rate that's the lowest since 1969, wage growth picking up.

I mean, the NASDAQ before today was almost out of bear market territory, up something like 19 percent, almost 20 percent from the lows in December. I think, it is no big surprise that some of these tech companies are having issues. I mean, Apple, it is less of a demand problem and more of a supply issue. Namely, they weren't able to make as many iPhones in China as people wanted, but obviously China is opening up. They have relaxed their COVID rules, and so that, of course, would help Apple meet some of its demand. Alphabet and other tech and media companies, of course, are dealing with this advertising slowdown. A lot of companies are reluctant to spend on advertising. And you know, Amazon is dealing with the issue that consumers are still grappling with high inflation. But Richard, you know, if you had told me that those numbers were going to come out last night, and then this jobs number was going to be as ridiculously strong as it was, I would have imagined that we would see even bigger losses for the stock market today.",

Dangerous wind chills as frigid as minus 50 are set to blast the Northeast with nearly 25 million people under wind chill warnings or advisories. An Italian mobster has been found working as a pizza chef. After 16 years on the run. Edgardo Greco was arrested by anti-mafia police in France where he was working at an Italian restaurant. He'd been convicted in absentia in 1991 for a double homicide. The legendary Spanish fashion designer Paco Rabanne has died, best known for his work in the 1960s of using materials like metal and plastic to create a space age aesthetic. Rabanne dress some of the biggest stars of the era, including Jane Birkin, Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Fonda. He was 88. U.S. Secretary of State has canceled a visit to China after the Pentagon said it discovered a suspected Chinese spy balloon that's now flying over parts of the Northern U.S. states. Antony Blinken was expected to meet President Xi Jinping to help smooth over relations. But instead of getting better, there seems to be getting a great deal worse. Marc Stewart has stayed up late for us tonight. He is in Hong Kong, you're either staying up late or getting up early. Whichever it is, it is appreciated, Marc.

No. In fact, as we heard during a Pentagonpress conference earlier today in the United States, it was immediately quashed, and it was very firm that this explanation that something just went off course is not being believed at least by the Department of Defense. In fact, if I look at the statement that was sent late Friday from Beijing, Beijing referred to this as a force majeure. That's the French term meaning that something went wrong out of their control. But also, of note in the statement is the fact that the Chinese government is expressing regret about what happened. I don't know if we can go as far as call it an apology. But even this acknowledgement of regret, this moment of contrition is very significant, because that's not something that we typically would hear from the Chinese government, especially in something as sensitive as diplomacy or national security.
