Or even if it really did come from an animal, making sure that all of that information is transmitted to health organizations all across the world, as soon as possible. So that political leaders, scientific leader, medical leaders, health officials in each of the different countries can make an informed decision on how they're going to proceed. The part of the problem that we had with COVID, whether it came from a lab or it came from animals is that the Chinese were very, very slow in alerting the world to it. And only came out from bits and pieces from scientists and doctors within China, and by then it was too late. And so, we really need to beef up our communications systems, our surveillance systems, so that all countries can act immediately. And of course, we need to make sure that however this happened we're prepared for the next pandemic, whether it comes from another country, whether it comes from animals or what have you.
