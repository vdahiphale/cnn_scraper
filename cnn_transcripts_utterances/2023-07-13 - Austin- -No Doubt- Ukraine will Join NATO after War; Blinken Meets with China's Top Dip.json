Just ahead on today'sshow finished forum U.S. President Joe Biden meeting in Helsinki with the leaders of five Nordic nations. Biden rather hailing Finland's entry to NATO, Sweden's bid to join the alliance gaining traction as well. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is also talking to CNN about Ukraine's future in NATO all of that and more all the very latest in just a moment. Plus from reading lines to picket lines thousands of TV and film actors are poised to go on strike as long running contract talks break down. All those as the writers guild continues its three months walk out the latest on Hollywood's worsening crisis just ahead. And Pows progress U.S. investors hailing the latest encouraging news on inflation. A sign that the fed's aggressive interest rate hiking campaign is working consumer inflation is at its lowest levels in more than two years. Just minutes ago a fresh look at wholesale inflation prices at the factory gate open or rather up only a 10th of a percent over month in June. And that was less than expected on global markets cooling inflation continues to give a boost to stocks. Look all that green there U.S. futures in the green arrows pointing up after the highest close for FT100 (ph) in well over a year. Europe on the advanced as well after a strong Asian hand over the HANG SENG the outperformer in Asia up more than 2.5 percent Chinese tech stocks rallied amid new signs that Beijing's crackdown on tech is winding down. Oh so much together this hour. I want to begin though in Finland President Biden meeting with the leaders of the Nordic countries and Finland; by the way that is the newest member of NATO. His visit President Biden's visit comes after a NATO summit where Turkey made a surprise U-turn agreeing to support Sweden's bid to join the alliance. Following the NATO Summit in Lithuania, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sat down with CNN's Wolf Blitzer for an exclusive interview, just listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There also seems to be an agreement with Sweden that it will also crack down on other opposition groups, the -- group, as Turkey calls them, and also the PYK, a Syrian Kurdish group. So there's the fact that Sweden has said it's committed to helping Turkey raise its voice to get into the European Union, which we heard Erdogan, say a few days ago, was super important to him still, and a commitment to self-defense weapons to Turkey, with Turkey as a big army. They'll now be members of NATO, no reason not to be able to sell, let's say, Swedish fighter jets, the -- which is something that, you know, is actually a highly sought after fighter aircraft on par people talking about it on par with the F-16 which Turkey is trying to get upgrades for those from the United States?

But if you're talking about 160,000 members of an Actor's Guild not working, then you really have way more productions grind to a halt. Now the last writer strike in 2008 lasted 100 days. Right now the writers have been on the picket line for more than 70 days. And by noon, Los Angeles time today, we could see the actors join them as well. The chief negotiating team for SAG-AFTRA sent a statement that said in part, the studios and streamers have implemented massive unilateral changes in our industry's business model, while at the same time insisting on keeping our contracts frozen in amber. The studios and streamers have underestimated our members resolve as they are about to fully discover. Now we've already seen a number of actors join writers on the picket line this week, anticipating what's about to come.

It's a weekly report, and how many Americans are filing for unemployment benefits and as you said, it unexpectedly declined. We were actually expecting unemployment claims to rise a bit so fallen 12,000 to 237,000. Zain, if we go back a few more weeks, and we can pull this up for you can see we've been sort of in this range and the two hundreds to put that in perspective that is still very low, we've been ticking up. But in historical standards, historical perspective, this is still very low, and is the sign that the U.S. labor market is still very strong. The caveat with weekly claims is that the data can be a bit noisy it can be a bit volatile. So we don't take one week necessarily, and sort of extrapolate a large picture from that. But it does give you a better sense of what's happening on a real time week to week indicator. But Zain, this is the second report this morning that came in better than expected. I want to turn your attention very quickly to the Producer Price Index, which you just mentioned there that also coming in a cooler than expected both on an annual basis and a monthly basis. On an annual basis prices, and I should say Producer Price Index, this is the Inflation Index for the producer of goods and services. And so the idea is what you see in this report, we will tend to see in the Consumer Index report a few months down the line. But so prices decline both on an annual basis, Zain, and on a monthly basis. And we're getting to the point where some economists say we might be now looking at deflation, not just a decline in growth of prices, but actually deflation. I want to bring your attention to one quote that caught my eye this morning, this coming from Gregory Daco of Ernst Young, the Chief Economist saying the underlying details in this report being PPI. There were encouraging and arguably more so than the CPI data. He goes on to list some of the factors here with base effects i.e., favorable comparisons with last year's elevated food and energy prices subsiding, easing demand for goods and services, the past through from softer housing price inflation and cooling wage growth should lead to faster disinflation. So all that to say, we might be looking at the end of the road here, Zain, shortly when it comes to this record high inflation, and I'll be the first one to say -- you're here.",

So in terms of how it works, there are two basic steps. First, we replace the high carbon cement, concrete glue, as you said, with low carbon materials. And then we activate or cure these materials with carbon dioxide, which ends up being permanently stored in the concrete. In order to do this, we have to put a little bit of new equipment at the plant. But together these two steps resulted in a 70 to 100 percent reduction in carbon foot print. We call that ultra-low carbon concrete. And very importantly, as you said, it doesn't cost more it performs the same way. And it's available today at our first retrofit in Alabama.",

And really, I've been working in climate tech in different verticals for over 20 years. It's very rare to find a combination of economic benefit and significant climate benefit from the get go. And that's what got me enthusiastic when I found this technology. And what makes me so bullish about our ability to make an impact, both in terms of industry transformation and climate impact in the near term.",

So, you know, the work on this started about a decade ago, it UCLA, and it was in 2019, 2020, where, thanks to the help from the Department of Energy. We're able to pilot the technology and show that it could work and to deliver products that met the same performance requirements. And, you know, it starts with having the first plant out there that others can come see and see that it's working. So this is you know, the milestone we reached back in May, turning our first plant on is huge for that process of convincing new customers. I will say that, right now, our customer pipeline is more than we can handle, we're working with concrete producers that are, you know, from small ones, to very large ones and this combination of economic benefits where they do not have to sacrifice profits or charging premium in order to get the sustainability benefits. You know, in combination with everyone realizing what's happening in the world around us. I mean, you talked about these events happening around the world, which are tough to ignore, right? And you combine those together, and we are seeing customers move on this. The other piece that I think is critical is that we're working in a product segment where the products can be tested right at the factory gate, so these questions of you know, does the product work? Will it be good enough? Can be tested long before the product ends up going to customers?",
