The stories we are talking about tonight: Evan Gershkovich has spent a year behind bars in Russia. The White House says it is working every day to secure the release of \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter now. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell says there is no hurry to cut interest rates. And Easter, an eggs-tra special time for chocolate makers. This year's joy is tempered by rising cocoa prices. The question of whether these will survive the hour. Live from London, it is Friday, it is March 29th, end of the month. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. We begin today with the US calling for the immediate release of Evan Gershkovich on the first anniversary of his arrest in Russia. The 32-year- old \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter is considered wrongfully detained by the State Department. President Biden says he will impose costs on Moscow for using US citizens as bargaining chips. \"The Journal\" left part of its front page blank today to mark the anniversary. Instead of a headline were words \"His Story Should Be Here.\" Gershkovich is being held by Russia as an alleged spy. CNN's Fred Pleitgen now looks at where the case currently stands. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): No media allowed at Evan Gershkovich's most recent court hearing in Moscow, just this short clip by the court's press service. Despite a year in a Russian jail, a defiant smile from \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter. No surprise, his detention was extended yet again through June 30th. The US ambassador to Russia ripping in to the verdict.",

What we've also heard today is that there has been some small breakthrough, at least the beginning of some hope on the hostage talk front and that could of course change the calculation that Israel is making with regard to Rafah, its plan so far, its thought, its thinking, its calculation had been that it needed to get into Rafah, carry out this ground assault, Richard, that it may take out the final battalions of Hamas that it believes are holding out in that part of the Gaza Strip, the southernmost point. What we are now hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu is that he will be sending a delegation of his Mossad and Shin Bet Israeli Security Services officials, both to Qatar and to Egypt to resume those indirect talks.

He never trailed during that campaign.

Joe Biden last time got a little bit north and 300, I believe it was 306. This time around, based upon the polling and past results, you see, Donald Trump would be favored to win with 283. That key three states to keep your eye out on or on the Great Lakes. It's Pennsylvania and yellow. That's the furthest year right. It's Michigan, which is a light pink right now leaning towards Trump and a state that Joe Biden won by a little less than three percentage points. And it's that other yellow state right there, Wisconsin, right there on the other side of the Great Lakes in yellow there. If Joe Biden can sweep those states and then when Nebraska is second congressional district, that little tiny piece of yellow in the middle of your screen, he gets to exactly 270 electoral votes. Those voters tend to be overwhelmingly white. There are a lot of college graduates in those states, but they're also like a lot of white non-college graduates. I think Biden is best trying to attack Trump on the economy, saying, look, consumer sentiment is up in this country. More Americans are saying the economy is excellent now than any point in the last three years. He has to convince those folks who right now give them a low economic approval rating and say you know what, ride with me this economy is high, it will continue to be high.

So today, let's dive with Dr. Austin Gallagher where we will discover the endless promise of certain natural assets for Bahamas and beyond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Whether in the lab or in the field beneath the waves has focused much of its recent attention on the so-called blue carbon ecosystems. DR. AUSTIN GALLAGHER, FOUNDER AND CEO, BENEATH THE WAVES: Things like sea grasses, mangroves, salt marshes, and through natural processes like photosynthesis. These plants sequester and store massive amounts of carbon significantly more than their terrestrial counterparts. STEWART (voice-over): And it turns out that the Bahamas archipelago has one of the planet's most significant blue carbon spaces. A revelation that came to light from their Tigershark research. The footage retrieved from their shot cams combined with satellite mapping and additional underwater surveys led to what Austin calls a holy grail moment in animal science. It actually ended up validating a prediction of up to 93,000 square kilometers. About 50,000 square miles of seagrass ecosystem here in the Bahamas which makes it by far the largest on Earth. STEWART (voice-over): For the Bahamas, the discovery is opening up new doors, particularly in its fight against the increasing intensity of natural disasters.",

STEWART (voice-over): Bahamians, like Anthony Ferguson, are working with Beneath the Waves under a private public partnership to establish a science-based marketplace where the Commonwealth of the Bahamas can develop and sell blue carbon credits. The potential buyers are companies, investors and even other countries looking to offset their carbon emissions. The aim is to have the project accredited by 2026.

The sediment cores that we were able to collect in the field, they definitely do have a monetary value. And it's actually quite high because the carbon sequestration market has the potential to be quite valuable for the small island developing states.
