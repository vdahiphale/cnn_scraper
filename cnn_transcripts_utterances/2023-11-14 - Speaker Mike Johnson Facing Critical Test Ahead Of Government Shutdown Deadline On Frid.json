And ultimately, three days later, that cost him his job.Now, we have to have the caveat that Kevin McCarthy had a lot of personal differences with some members and no love lost between many of them, so that didn't help McCarthy either. But the fact is that they put in a new leader and he is doing the exact same thing. It's fascinating though because Mike Johnson is concerned someone who is much more conservative than Kevin McCarthy, who is steeped in conservative policy. And so, when faced with a choice of either shutting down the government and appeasing the far-right of his conference or moving forward in a bipartisan fashion with Democrats or needed Democratic support, he has chosen the latter. And it's just a fascinating moment that also shows how difficult Republicans -- how difficult it is for Republicans to pass anything along party lines when, of course, there's a Democratic Senate and Democratic president.",

And they want, potentially, something out of providing, once again, Republicans their votes for a Republican plan. But all signs, Kasie, are pointing to the fact that Democrats don't want the government to shut down and so they're likely to provide the votes.

And sort of the consensus in Washington is sort of like all that would do is hand Donald Trump the presidency. And Romney was quoted extensively in this McKay Coppins book as talking about some of these possibilities and basically saying that a Trump presidency would be a complete disaster for the country.

They also found signs that Hamas may have held hostages there.Let's bring in CNN military analyst, Col. Cedric Leighton. Colonel, always grateful to have you here in the mornings. I want to talk about this hospital, what the Israelis have said, and what we know. What do we know about what's underneath that hospital and how Hamas is using infrastructure like the Al Shifa hospital? CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF AT PENTAGON (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, good morning, Kasie. It's always great to be with you. The big thing that I think we can take away from this is that it looks like what the Israelis have said that there are military facilities related to the Hamas organization underneath these hospitals, I think that may very well be true. The -- of course, you always want to have a neutral observer look at this stuff. But the big thing is that they are putting military hardware, control nodes -- all of those kinds of things right underneath civilian -- protected civilian institutions such as hospitals. And what that does is it complicates the targeting process for the Israelis. In some ways, it's an ingenious way for Hamas to do this. But what it does is it is also, in essence, committing a war crime if all of this bears out. And the reason it would be a war crime is because as a combatant, you cannot put others in danger. You cannot put civilians deliberately in danger because of your actions.",

You see much more movement in terms of humanitarian corridors or humanitarian pauses -- not a ceasefire because a pause is much shorter. But the basic idea is that the Israelis are actually trying to shorten the windows in which they operate their combat -- their combat missions.So the Israelis have a problem here. On the one hand, the dilemma is that they are going in from a military perspective and they have a justified reason to go in there because of the October 7 attacks. The problem that they have is that their targeting process is absolutely complicated by the fact that Hamas is using civilian institutions as basically a cover for their actions. So what it means then for the Israelis is yes, they are adjusting their tactics. They are adjusting their public posture. And they are trying to come back on the public information sphere to try to fight that battle itself, which is very important in warfare.",

Let's dive deeper into this meeting and what else is going on on Capitol Hill and around the country with Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Congressman, I'm so grateful to have you up early. And let's start there with what Marc was reporting on -- this meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi in San Francisco. There are obviously specific objectives for this meeting, including apparently, restoring military-to-military ties between the new nations -- the two nations. How do you view this in the context of global security, first of all? But second of all, China has become very much a political question on the campaign trail and I'm interested in your thoughts on how the Biden administration is handling that piece of it. REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA):  Good morning, Kasie. First, the context for this meeting. The United States is in a stronger position relative to China than when last President Biden and Xi Jinping met. And that relative positional change is important because it gives the United States stronger terrain. And the United States should always be strong and smart in every engagement with China. I think it'll be important for the president to demonstrate strength by condemning China's human rights abuses in Xinjiang province and being clear that the United States will be unflinching in standing with our allies in Taiwan, in Hong Kong, in Israel, in Ukraine. And we can be smart also by looking for tighter Chinese export controls on fentanyl, which is helping to drive the opioid crisis in the United States. And by restoring military-to-military communication channels that we don't have an accidental escalation. But strength is going to be the determining factor here. Congress can strengthen the president's hand by preventing a government shutdown and by passing the supplemental security package to show that the United States is going to support democracy, whether it's fighting against totalitarianism, or tyranny, or terror. And that will allow the president to speak more forcefully and credibly.",

So we want to govern in a bipartisan fashion but right now, the House Republicans are mired in dysfunction and chaos. Last time they filed a C.R., at the end of September, I said it was the last time I was going to support a continuing resolution without clear, credible, and concrete steps to support our allies overseas -- Ukraine, then, and Ukraine and Israel now.

I think the president's campaign knows that and certainly, Democrats know that.And it's incumbent on not just the presidential campaign but Democrats across the country, including members of Congress, to go out there and 1) communicate what the president and Democrats have accomplished -- investing in infrastructure, investing in the American economy and domestic manufacturing, lowering health care costs, standing for democracy the world over. And also, to draw a stark choice. The president has been a capable steward of our democracy in a turbulent time.

He's made a pretty pass and look at this incredible catch by Courtland Sutton. Drags the foot as he makes the catch with no space to spare right there. That touchdown put Denver up 9-0. The Bills, though, still able to battle back. They took a one-point lead after that Josh Allen touchdown right there but penalties would doom the Bills.
