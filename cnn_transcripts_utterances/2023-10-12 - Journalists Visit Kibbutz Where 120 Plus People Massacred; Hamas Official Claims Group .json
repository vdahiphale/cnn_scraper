We begin with gruesome new details about the attacks carried out by Hamas over the weekend. Sick cruel acts of brutality on women and children which were beyond abhorrent. The subject matter and the video are graphic and disturbing.Israeli government now says babies and toddlers were found with heads decapitated at a Kibbutz in southern Israel. Hamas denies beheading children, calling the allegations fabricated and baseless. Meantime, Israel's military is stepping up its airstrikes on Gaza as its forces mass near the border ahead of a likely ground incursion. Palestinian officials say the only power station in Gaza has now stopped working. Hospitals are expected to run out of fuel for their private generators in the coming day. The weekend terror attacks by Hamas have brought together rival factions from across Israeli politics with the announcement of an emergency government and wartime cabinet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The people of Israel are united. Now the leadership is too. WE put aside our differences because of the fate of our country is on the line. We will work together shoulder to shoulder for the sake of our citizens of Israel. BENNY GANTZ, NATIONAL UNITY PARTY LEADER (through translator): There is a time for war and a time for peace. This now, this is time for war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The farming community Kibbutz Be'eri was one of the first places attacked by Hamas early Saturday. Jihadi fighters went door to door massacring more than 120 people at will. It took the Israeli military hours to regain control. On Wednesday, journalists were allowed to see the carnage firsthand. CNN's Clarissa Ward has our report and a warning. The content of her report is disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was 7:11am on Saturday morning when the militants arrived at Be'eri Kibbutz. Surveillance footage shows them lying and wait until the car arrives. They shoot the driver and enter the compound. More poured in on motorcycles eerily at ease and in no apparent hurry. Thomas Hand heard the gunshots and immediately thought of his eight-year-old daughter Emily, who was staying with a neighbor. THOMAS HAND, KIBBUTZ BE'ERI RESIDENT: She doesn't do it very often. But unfortunately that night, that particular night, the Friday night she went to sleep at her friend's house.

But it's good to mention that Israel has been run by a very extreme government, including Smotrich, who declared that Palestinians should have no hope, no state, and they should either emigrate or accept a life of subjugation or die.This extremism is, of course, led to this explosion. But the main root cause that has never been dealt with by several Israeli governments is the continuation of Israeli illegal occupation of Palestinian land. The fact that this occupation which is 56 years old, the longest and modern history has transformed into a system of apartheid that suppresses every Palestinian. Today, of course, the issue is not that Israel is attacking Hamas only, the Israeli airstrikes and the Israeli bombardment is attacking civilian Palestinian population in Gaza. They are dehumanizing Hamas, but in the process, they're dehumanizing all Palestinians. And when you attack a place, which is the largest open prison in the world, with 2.2 million people in living in less than one point -- 140 square miles, with 50 percent of the 2.2 million people are children. The result is drastic. I mean, up until now 1,200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes, including 326 children and no less than 180 women. This will not lead to peace. The way out of this is to immediately have ceasefire, immediately deescalate, immediately have exchange of prisoners. So there's -- though that -- those Israelis who are held in Gaza will come back home safe in exchange of releasing some Palestinian prisoners who have been injured, some of whom have been in jail for 43 years.",

Dehumanization of all Palestinians will not also solve the problem. Look, we've been under occupation for so many years, we haven't seen a day of freedom for 56 years, and many of us, especially the 70 percent of the people in Gaza are refugees who were displaced by Israel 75 years ago.So Israel has already conducted five wars on Gaza. Did that end Hamas? Did that end violence? Did that end the situation? Of course not. And when they are planning now a huge ground operation, they are engaging in something that is totally inhuman, unacceptable, even according to Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, who said, you cannot impose a total blockade on Gaza. Now Israel is preventing food, milk, water, electricity from the people of Gaza. I receive calls. I'm a medical doctor and I receive calls every day from patients in Gaza who are about to die because they don't have access to kidney dialysis, and children and incubators who could die because there is no electricity. Besieging a whole population is not a solution. Yet striking on children and women by terrible airstrike is not a solution. And let me warn you, a very important dangerous point here is what Israeli leaders are calling for which is evicting the 2.2 million people in Gaza to Egypt, creating a much very serious matter of ethnic cleansing one more time against the Palestinian people. This will not lead to peace. This will not lead to peace even if the United States is fully supportive of Israel.",

And there is no way I know to continue this inhuman situation. Either we have to state solution as soon as possible, or we will have to be together with equality.

A couple of years ago, another monk and I were talking about sexual abuse. And we knew as monks, we wanted to raise awareness about the taboo subject. We didn't know about human trafficking yet.

How they do their coordination we don't know. They're very secretive and they are very good now at keeping secrets. But they clearly formed a what they call, strategic deterrent front.

It used to be (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of other groups. Now it's Iran. And it's ironic that the U.S. negotiated an agreement -- a very good agreement with Iran on nuclear issues and sanctions, but Iran is seen in the U.S. public sphere and political elite and the media as a really terrible menace. Almost as bad as China is in the U.S. eyes. And therefore they keep playing this -- overplaying this sense of we're going to stop Iran from doing this and doing that. And Iran shows no sign of wanting to be involved in the war. So I don't take very seriously what the U.S. says about Middle East ideological and political and military movements.
