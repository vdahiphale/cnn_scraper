      "sentences": "Ah, the debt ceiling, the eternal Washington food fight. So what is it? And why is it socontentious? The debt ceiling is the legal limit set by Congress on how much money America can borrow. Because the U.S. spends more than it takes in, it borrows to make up the difference. The debt ceiling caps how much. The problem is, it`s not enough. So, every once in a while, Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn`t, the Treasury Department won`t be able to pay all the country`s bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around. But eventually, the accounting tricks run out and there`s no more avoiding the debt ceiling. That`s when the fireworks usually break out. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Our debt is out of control. I mean, we`re talking about over $30 trillion. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  Me? I get rid of the debt ceiling altogether. It serves no function except to create leverage. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Look, they`re difficult political times. Nobody likes them but they are necessary evils in a sense because it`s the only time that you can actually negotiate ways to get our budget under control.",

      "sentences": "Ten-second triviaIn 2005, the British travel company used an unscientific formula to determine what kind of day of the year? Best for shopping, the most depressing, the shortest, or the worst for traffic? Blue Monday as they called it was supposed to indicate the most depressing day of the year and it typically fell on the third Monday in January. Well, yesterday was the third Monday in January and while Blue Monday is a myth, some still use the marker to predict when travel purchases may peak as people are looking to escape the cold temperatures for a sunny vacation destination. The winter blues though, those can be very real. Ever hear of seasonal affective disorder? Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us all about it and gives us some tips on how to make the most of the winter months and to help us find our happy place amid the wintertime grind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Even if you love the cold and winter sports, you`ve got to admit, this has felt like a long winter. At least 12 million Americans suffer from something known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD, numbers probably even higher than that. Longer nights, shorter days, all of that leads to a chemical imbalance in the brain. What happens is your serotonin levels are down and melatonin, which makes you sleepy, that`s up. To make sense, symptoms can be mild or severe, you can get fatigue, lack of energy over sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and also cravings for food that cause weight gain. That probably sounds familiar as well. Diet and exercise can always help. Also, get outside as much as you can. You can also get a specialty designed light box. You just sit there and stare at it for a while each day or at least put it on your desk, the point is you can get a boost of more natural light. Another tidbit, find things that bring you joy -- open up the blinds in your house, play some of your favorite music, and be with your family. Laughter and togetherness are always great therapy for the winter blues. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, the government of Indonesia has decided to build a completelynew capital city in a completely different location. But at what cost? Aside from the estimated billion-dollar price tag for the futuristic smart city that the government officials are calling the world`s most sustainable, critics say that the impact on the wildlife, ecosystem and indigenous people could be devastating. More now from CNN international correspondent Kristie Lou Stout. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LOU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jakarta is a sinking city, scientists say the sprawling capital of Indonesia, home to more than 10 million people is dropping below sea level at alarming rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan, to carve a new capital city called Nusantara, out of the dense jungles of eastern Borneo. At an estimated cost of more than $30 billion, it`s being designed as a futuristic smart city and touted by government officials as the world`s most sustainable. JOKO WIDODO, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The development of the new capital has to become a move towards building cities that are healthy, efficient and productive, that are designed to be a place where the people are close from any destination, where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions.",
