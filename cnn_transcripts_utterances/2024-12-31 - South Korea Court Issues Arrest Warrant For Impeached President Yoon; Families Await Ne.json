The president was swiftly impeached and suspended from power after he issued a short lived martial law decree earlier this month. He's facing charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion.Yoon's martial law decree led to public protests and mass resignations from his cabinet. CNN's Marc Stewart has more now.

So we're just going to have to and see on all of this. But it is important to emphasize the context in all of this. Even though President Yoon is essentially suspended, stripped of his powers, he's still South Korea's president and he's still entitled to stay at the presidential residence.This is not something that suddenly happened out of the blue. This all stems from an investigation that was launched after President Yoon's declaration of martial law on December 3. The nation's Corruption Investigation Office issued three summons asking for its cooper in the probe, but he has refused. That's what led to this arrest warrant. It's an investigation focusing on charges of abuse of authority and insurrection after he announced martial law. During his short lived martial law, Yoon allegedly ordered his defense minister to arrest several high ranked politicians, civil activists and even judges. He's also accused of obstructing operation of the National Assembly with military forces. Yoon's attorney is fighting back, calling the issuance of the arrest warrant illegal and invalid, hinting that the president will likely not comply with the warrant. He said the suspended president will confidently respond when the due process goes on. So for now, we are just going to have to keep watch on this potential arrest. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.

Families of the victims are literally camping out at Muan International Airport until they get information on their loved ones who were on board. CNN's Mike Valerio reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is the unmistakable outcry of grief heard throughout South Korea's Muan International Airport. Families unable to absorb the anguish of the Jeju Air catastrophe. Hundreds of relatives huddling in the departure hall waiting for news of whether their loved ones remains are found. A friend of a couple killed in the crash said he came here to confirm for himself. His friends of 30 years are simply gone. I have nothing to say, but it's tragic, he told us.

I do want to point out that before we go down, you know, what is a very complicated crash investigation right now, clearly the families are in absolute agony, Miles, all of them wondering what all of us want to know, how could this happen? Because normally if it was a bird strike of this kind, it wouldn't normally bring down an entire aircraft in and of itself.MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Pretty unusual scenario, Paula. Yes. A single engine lost on a modern airliner is pretty much a non- event. You shut down the engine and you get to a runway as soon as you can. But the aircraft can fly one engine with no problem almost, you know, as long as the fuel holds out, so to speak. So something else happened here, clearly. And was it the loss perhaps partial or total of power on the other engine as well, which put this aircraft in a situation where the crew felt compelled to get on the ground very quickly and that changes the dynamic significantly.",

You know, many have pointed out that, look, it could be quite chaotic, obviously, but also that there's a cascading, a domino effect that takes over. Can you explain what this crew, who apparently was very experienced, would have been going through?O'BRIEN: Yes, it's an experienced crew, and these are not unlike the scenarios that they train for in simulators on a regular basis. But the real world is the real world. And when you're startled by an impact by birds, and these are big migratory birds and that part of the world, potentially we don't know for certain, one of them might have even struck the windscreen for the pilots. And that could have had tremendous impact as well. But you're about to land, and there's a startling effect by all that the standard operating procedure for the airline might be in that situation, abort the landing, get everything stabilized as best you can, and diagnose the trouble before attempting a landing. And maybe that's what happened. That would have been sort of their muscle memory in this scenario. In retrospect, in a situation like that, it might be the better part of valor to get on the ground as quickly as possible. But procedures and training come into play here, and a lot of the experience they've had in simulators may have been what dictated what they did.",

Treasury officials notified lawmakers on Monday that China state sponsored hackers infiltrated several department workstations. The hackers gained access by using a stolen key for a third party software service provider. Now a Treasury official says that company notified the department ofthe breach earlier this month. A source tells CNN that Treasury officials plan to brief the House Financial Services Committee next week in a classified hearing. Funeral plans are coming together former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who turned who died Sunday at age 100. Five days of services will begin this Saturday as Carter's motorcade will travel past his boyhood home in Plains, Georgia. He will lie in repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta later in the day. Carter will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol from January 7th through the 9th, ahead of his state funeral at the Washington National Cathedral next Thursday. Carter will be laid to rest in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, at the same location his wife Rosalynn was buried during her death last year. Now U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy. He has designated January 9 as a national day of mourning when Carter ran for president in the 1976 election. In fact, Biden was the first senator to endorse him. And we do turn now to a major loss for journalism. Veteran journalist and former CNN anchor Aaron Brown passed away on Sunday at the age of 76. That's according to his family.

Whether it was 9/11, whether it was the Iraq, Afghanistan invasion, Katrina, Indonesia, Aaron was front and center of everything. And I think for viewers, his sort of calm demeanor, not yelling at you, not being hysterical, sort of gave everybody, I don't want to say a sense of calm because it's hard to say there's a sense of calm in the midst of this chaos. But it certainly didn't make people feel any worse or more concernedabout things. They knew they were getting the story. One of the things Aaron always stressed, I think, to reporters on the air and to his staff and to guests, that it's OK to say I don't know as answer because that's truthful and that's what we know at the time. So if you don't know the answer, say you don't have answer and you move on to something else. And I think that's something that also viewers learn to appreciate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
