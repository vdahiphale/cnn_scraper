We've got excellent analysis ahead from Alberto Ramos, the Head of Latin American Economic Research at Goldman Sachs. And for now Brazil not the only focus is Eurozone inflation hit record highs this month. Plus, as you can see in front of U.S. stock market futures are weaker with Big Tech names set to extend last week's losses. The picture outside of tech land however looking a bit brighter the DOW soaring almost 6 percent last week and on track for its best monthly gains since the mid-70s look at that downdraft though in September. Also today fresh losses in China's stock markets the HANG SENG dropping more than 1 percent down 14 percent in fact, for all of October too its biggest monthly loss in well over a decade the catalyst today Chinese factory activity contracting this month due to ongoing COVID curbs despite hopes for more resilience.

About 48 hours ago, really Saturday night it was a party night here in Seoul at one district, where you have these kinds of narrow alleyways. And roads lined with bars and clubs, lots of young people thousands of them some in costume out for a night out drinking. And I've spoken with some of the survivors who say that the crowds were getting uncomfortably packed in cheek to jowl, just around the corner from where I'm standing right now. They were joking about how crowded it was initially. And then it started getting increasingly scary.

And it is today that the U.N. is trying to get 12 ships out, waiting to see what Russia's reaction to that is. And one of those ships is, is on its way to Ethiopia. But I want to bring you more into the situation here in Kyiv where there have been air strikes on electricity stations today. The mayor says 80 percent of the city's water has been cut off. So the city has opened up the standpipes here for people to come out and get their water. So you have many city residents now. The mayor says they're working to get the water back on again, over the coming days. But the majority of the city's residents now they have to get their water from dozens upon dozens of these standpipes that are in and around the city. And this is of course really, I'm sorry, sir, really impacting people's lives. 355,000 homes in the Capitol today are without electricity, a power generating facility, a hydropower station on the outskirts of the city here targeted. The government says in 10 different regions, 18 critical facilities targeted today. And the city's ability to cope with the country's ability to cope is now more precarious than it was before. We've had power; we've had hits on the power system here over the past few weeks. But it is now that it's beginning to have that significant impact to cut off water supplies and as you can see here, people literally for their drinks for dinner tonight or how they're ever going to cook their food this evening.

Because it's his military, that's bombing the infrastructure here that's cutting off the water supplies as damaging the electricity supplies around the country hitting the heating stations. So you know why the residents here say they're ready to put up with us and go on with it. Russia has got to the point and its attack of the critical infrastructure here.

And on that point, obviously, news that we saw over the weekend was the attack on the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi and obviously, it was reported widely across the media. Elon Musk himself then re-tweeted an article from a website that in the past has made questionable accusations it suggested Hillary Clinton, I believe, one point had died.

And so it's a little strange, I think, to de-verify everyone, you've already gone through the process of verifying. But I think this does speak to a larger problem within the Republican Party. And more broadly, in our information environment where conspiracy theories like these fringe ideas can gain foothold very quickly, inside the Republican Party in the broader U.S. public conversation. So Paul Pelosi, we know was attacked, those reports came out on Friday. And by Sunday, you have someone like Elon Musk, who is a very smart person giving credence to this idea. It just shows how broken I think our information environment really is. And, frankly, Elon Musk, who is the Head of Twitter, now plays a key role and he should be working to clean this information environment up not contributing to the contamination.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-KY): Let me be perfectly clear, violence or threat of violence has no place in our society and what happened to Paul Pelosi is wrong. Having heard it I reached out and called the speaker. She was on a plane back for her husband, so we were able to communicate by text. She did say that the surgery went well.
