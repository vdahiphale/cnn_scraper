It is Tuesday, September the 24th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. across the Israeli-Lebanese border, where Israel has begun another round of airstrikes, according to Lebanon's national news agency.The Lebanese health ministry says nearly 500 people, including dozens of women and children, were killed in Monday's wave of strikes. An Israeli official says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his security cabinet his aim is to cut Hezbollah from the war with Hamas. The official also says the cabinet has agreed to raise the level of military operations each day. The Israel Defense Forces says it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets on Monday, and today Israel says it hit dozens more in southern Lebanon after the Iran-backed militant group fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel overnight. And amid the violence, civilians in southern Lebanon are fleeing their homes and seeking safety. Israel's Prime Minister says the Lebanese people are not their target. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we understand from the Israeli military that they have been telling Lebanese citizens to move away from any areas where they believe that Hezbollah operatives are in the process of firing against Israeli towns and air bases in northern Israel. They also say that they are concerned that Hezbollah is hiding ammunition, is hiding missiles inside civilian infrastructure, inside civilian homes.

And they've been doing it for a long time. And Iran has stated very clearly that they're going to continue to support Hezbollah. Whether or not there's an opportunity with the new president in Iran to try to see whether at least you can begin some kind of dialogue, I don't know. But that's probably worth an effort. But I think right now, to be truthful, we've crossed a threshold here between a war that tries to apply some restraint and a wider war. We're clearly walking into a much wider war.

So if he hopes to carry the state, he really needs to boost his numbers in the specific more rural areas of Pennsylvania.Now, the rally was a relatively normal Trump campaign event. The former president stuck to the teleprompter a good amount in the beginning of his remarks. He focused on the economy, on the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan and hit on fracking, of course, an important issue here in Pennsylvania. But he did drift off topic as well, at one point lamenting Johnny Carson, no longer being the host of The Tonight Show, complaining about the moderators of the last debate and also criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for her interview with Oprah recently.

The reason, sources tell me, is that they are trying to narrow the gap in polling. Of course, former President Donald Trump has held a lead in polls when it comes to the issue of immigration.But while some campaign officials remain concerned about that lead, they also see an opportunity to close the gap. Now, one source telling me that no final decision has been made. And of course, the vice president has visited the U.S.-Mexico border as vice president, as well as California senator and as attorney general in that state. But a visit to Arizona would also come at a time where former President Donald Trump is leading in the polls, and as border crossings remain low, the lowest they've been since 2020. But Republicans have tried to cast the vice president, falsely so, as the border czar, solely putting her responsible for border security. Well, that hasn't been the case. Instead, she has been focused on the root causes of migration in Central America. Border visit would offer the opportunity, campaign officials say, for her to deliver her message on this issue. One, where she has been talking about her work as attorney general, tackling transnational gangs, but also saying that the former president is unserious about the border for tanking that bipartisan border bill. All the same, the vice president is slated to visit Arizona later this week. That will later be followed by Nevada, two important states that she is trying to gain a lead on former President Donald Trump ahead of November. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
