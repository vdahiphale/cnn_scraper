Israel has been carrying out airstrikes over since then, troops have been amassing assets, tanks and armored personnel carriers and the like have been amassing around the Gaza Strip.But we still don't have a time line. And to be fair, I suppose it's understandable that the IDF isn't going to give us a specific time line because it wants to at least keep some element of surprise. In terms of these airstrikes, the IDF says it was going to be ramping up airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, and to that extent, it's been true to its word. As you say, more than 320 targets hit according to the IDF in the last 24 hours, that may be the largest number of targets hit since the beginning of this war. Certainly, that's what the IDF -- well, they're looking into whether it's specifically the largest number. But we heard from our Nic Robertson in Sderot, that they -- to his mind and to his ears, was the heaviest bombardment of the Gaza Strip since the start of this war. Israel saying that it was targeting everything from militant tunnels to operational command centers, including those which actually had militants from Islamic Jihad and Hamas inside. Also, hitting military compounds and anti-tank firing -- anti-tank missiles, says as well. Also saying that it's hitting targets in order to reduce the threat, targets that pose a threat to its troops that are on next to Gaza. And of course, we saw the first clash on the ground inside the Gaza Strip between the IDF and militants yesterday. That resulted from an anti-tank missile being fired by militants towards the Israelis and the deaths of one IDF soldier and three more were injured. Hamas claiming to have destroyed a couple of military bulldozers and a tank. So skirmishes have started, but this doesn't seem yet to be the starting gun on a full-blown ground invasion, Kasie.",

So that's going  to be the key thing. The intelligence would have to be really good in determining where the attack came from, and then I think there would be a response, probably a proportionate response, depending on the nature of the attack.

So prepare to deploy, in other words, is kind of like the yellow light, the green light then is you have a deployment order, a deploy order as it's called.And then that's sent out to the unit and then they move out, and everything is basically put in place, the logistics, you know, all the material that they need to make sure that they've got all their weapons at the ready, and that they can then move that step forward, all the equipment, all the personnel, move that forward to a predetermined location.

So the third phase, according to the defense minister will require the removal of Israel responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip and the establishment of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel.
