And this is Royce Hall, one of the iconic buildings on campus where there was a mobile protest, a walk out of sorts. Students and some faculty this morning all with the same demands. Divestment, bringing attention to what they say is going on in Gaza.Now the reason that we are not allowed in is media. In fact no one's allowed into that camp without the approval of the protesters. And since Sunday when it got ugly there was just one barrier. And the protesters and the pro-Israeli counter-protesters clashed over that barrier. So the university has now brought in a sort of buffer zone, two layers. So the university controls this, the protesters control this, we are only allowed here. Now there have been counter-protests as I mentioned and one is kind of continuing. So over here they have this huge video screen that has been playing non-stop with loud audio scenes from October 7th, testimony from October 7th. Just a handful of pro-Israeli protesters actually on campus today. They tell me they are not planning anything for the night. But it's really unclear how this is going to end. I mean these protesters are saying divest. The UC college system is saying no we won't divest. Because as the college puts it, divesting from Israel, breaking ties with academic institutions in Israel, that then impinges on the academic freedom of some students. The college, like all these colleges, is trying to balance. Here they are trying to balance free speech, the safety of students, and of course the core mission of a college which is to educate and to learn. They learned from what happened at USC last week where the police went in a little more heavy handed and it got pretty messy, nearly 100 arrests. Here at UCLA they are really trying to keep the security at an arm's length. Trying to keep this as peaceful as possible. But a lot of students are saying this is a public college. I go to this public college and right now I cannot walk across my campus. Nick Watt at the UCLA campus in Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

However, the question is, what does that actually mean? If the Israelis allow people to return to northern Gaza and sort of the end of hostilities, that basically means the end of the war.Now, at the same time, the Israelis are saying that they still are maintaining their ultimate goal of destroying Hamas. So how that's going to be achieved, it's hard to say. And, of course, then the question is, what happens next? Does Hamas simply restore, take over Gaza again? And we go back to the situation before the 7th of October. Who is going to reconstruct Gaza? Who is going to restore basic civil services like schools, hospitals that have all been destroyed? Many schools have been destroyed. The health system has been destroyed. There's so many questions to that. But certainly it would be for the people of Gaza who are now in the 207th day of this war with more than 34,000 people killed. According to the U.N., 70 percent of them women and children. It would certainly represent a massive improvement on the situation today. But there's still many questions as to what happens in Gaza if this deal actually comes off.",
