Most notably missing, Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian penal colony one month ago. During a victory speech, Putin made an unprecedented break with his tradition of not saying Navalny's name. He not only spoke about his late rival's mysterious death but he confirmed about a -- would confirm reports about a proposal to exchange Navalny in a prisoner swap just days before the opposition leader died. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): The person who spoke to me had not finished his sentence yet when I said I agree. But unfortunately, what happened, happened. There was only one condition -- for him not to come back. Let him sit there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, of course, you're saying, well, yes, this was Navalny. It was all very unfortunate. Which, of course, like everything else that comes out of the Kremlin, is essentially false. So that's -- that's no big surprise there. It's also no big surprise that Vladimir Putin is trying to find some sort of moral equivalence between, oh, yes, occasionally, there's a death in a Russian prison. That happens in the United States and other places. Which, of course, is, indeed, ridiculous, like again, everything else that comes out of the Kremlin these days.",

There's problems with the U.S. legal system. Because he knows that as a free-thinking Western society, we say, oh, maybe we have to think about that. That's exactly what he's trying to do. He also, of course -- it's really no surprise there should be no surprise that Vladimir Putin would very much rather see Donald Trump as the next president. Because Donald Trump is saying things like, well, let's let the Russians do whatever the hell they want in whatever NATO country they want. We're not going to come to their assistance. And the current president, Biden, is saying precisely the opposite and trying to strengthen these alliances. So again, it's very beneficial for Putin to have somebody like a Donald Trump in the White House as opposed to a Biden.",

It costs about $19.99 for a one- month supply, $49.99 for a three-month pack, and $89.99 for a six- month supply. And these online sales, Brianna, they're starting today.

You go to Iceland, you're going to this thing. So let's talk about this now with Jess Phoenix, a volcanologist and author, \"Misadventure, My Wild Explorations in Science, Lava and Life.\" Jess, thanks for being with us again to talk about this as we watch this for yet another eruption here. One expert said that this eruption on Saturday was the most powerful so far. What's behind all of this activity that we're seeing? JESS PHOENIX, VOLCANOLOGIST &amp; AUTHOR: So Iceland sits at the intersection of two tectonic plates, and those two plates are pulling apart. And so that allows the molten interior of the earth to breach through the crust at the surface and we get volcanic eruptions. Iceland just happens to be sitting right on the jackpot because they are directly on that connection between those tectonic plates. It makes for pretty consistent volcanic activity. Sometimes big, sometimes small. But you can guarantee that Iceland is always going to be at risk for eruptions.",

It would be -- it would make volcanologist's job a lot easier if we could say how long these eruptions would take.The trick here is that volcanoes are geologic forces. They operate on the scale of millions and billions of years, where we humans, we live for maybe 100 years, if we're lucky. So this volcano could have eruptions and then quiet periods, eruptions, quiet periods. They could last from days to weeks to months, and sometimes even years. So I wish I could say. But I will say that the eruptive activity has been calming a little bit since the initial phase on Saturday. So we're seeing a little bit of a decrease, but the hazards are still very real.",
