Look, I mean, I think one of the things that the FBI director has been very, very concerned about is the skyrocketing number of threats associated with, obviously, the events happening in Israel and Hamas, Israeli war. But also, the number of people who are now being threatened, Jewish Americans, Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, are all in the receiving end of these threats.And what they talked about is a rogue's gallery of terror organizations. Everyone from Al Qaeda to ISIS to Hezbollah and Hamas have called for some attacks against Americans.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. The House of Representatives just voted to avert a government shutdown for now. But that wasn't all that happened on Capitol Hill. A former Speaker of the House was accused of elbowing a fellow congressman. The chair of the House Oversight Committee called a colleague a Smurf. And Senator Bernie Sanders had to stop a fight between a senator and a hearing witness. I'm joined now by Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, a Republican from Indiana. Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. Have you heard any new reports of member-on-member violence yet today? REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN):  Listen, I wish we would spend as much energy at governing how we do at fighting. I mean, healthy conversations are good, but, you know, just do -- go personal. It's probably not necessary, and it's really a waste of energy where we have real problems to deal with.",

Some of us thought he did a good job, and we have a new speaker now, and he has a big tax ahead of him, but we always hold our leaders accountable.

Because this is a very important bill where we need to look how we can improve competition and farm. It is health (ph) of Americans, how we can help smaller farmers, and also how we can have Americans healthier and have better food.So, I think we need to think about things like that. And I was very disappointed that we decided upon this issue. And I was -- I don't think it was very wise.

In the next few months, he will have to deliver on very serious issues, including on debt commission, including on border security and appropriations.

And what's happening with the economy and inflation, we might have a very, very serious fiscal issues.And when we said, like, oh, our future generations children and grandchildren will have problems. No. Unfortunately, even we're going to have them right now. So, we have to become adults and start dealing with these issues.

The IDF has long accused Hamas of using Gaza's largest hospital, the Al-Shifa Hospital Complex, as a base for terror infrastructure, as a command-and-control center. A U.S. official coming out and saying they also have evidence and intelligence that that is what Hamas uses the hospital for.A senior Israeli military official who briefed reporters says, they have evidence. Specifically showing Hamas uses Al-Shifa Hospital and they'll put that out, not at this point, but that's expected sometime later on today. The official said they've been preparing for this specific operation for a couple of weeks, and it required specialized training for the difficulties and the complexities of operating inside a hospital. Israel went in with Arabic speakers to be able to communicate with the doctors, the officials, the patients, and the civilians. The hospital had been treating some 650 patients, and over the course of the past several days and weeks, had been home to thousands who were seeking shelter from the fighting outside. This is also some video released from the IDF earlier today that shows them dropping off incubators, medical supplies and baby food. We have geolocated to Al-Shifa Hospital, but because we're not on the ground in Gaza, we cannot independently verify what's happening there because of the difficulties of reporting in Gaza at this time. Meanwhile, there had been reports and we have spoken with officials at the hospital of ongoing fighting on the streets outside. The Israeli military says there had been no gunfights or exchanges of fire in the complex itself. They haven't been specific on where they're operating. Take a look at this map. This shows you how large the complex is. They say they're operating in a very specific part of the complex. That is where they're going after Hamas, but they won't be any more precise about where that is. According to Israeli army radio, they have not found any evidence of hostages being held at Al-Shifa Hospital. That too, part of the ongoing effort of the Israeli military in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
