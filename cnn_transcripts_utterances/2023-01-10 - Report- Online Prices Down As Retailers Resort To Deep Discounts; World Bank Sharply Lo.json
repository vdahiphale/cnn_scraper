But this report, guys, yet another example of lower prices. So as you said, 1.6 percent prices are off compared to last year. That is the fourth month in a row where we've seen annual declines. So directionally, we like to see it. Right? When we look at some of the biggest categories where we're seeing sharp declines, take a look. Computers off 16 percent compared to a year ago. So if you were looking for a computer, now might be a good time to buy it. Electronics off 12 percent. Toys, sporting goods, both off about 6 percent to 7.1 percent. Now, I should say that there are some categories where, unfortunately, that trend is not continuing. Some essential categories, which is problematic. So groceries, those prices are still up 13.5 percent compared to a year ago. Medical equipment also higher. And personal care. Now, that hopefully -- some of those larger categories, that should hopefully provide some relief for folks at home.
