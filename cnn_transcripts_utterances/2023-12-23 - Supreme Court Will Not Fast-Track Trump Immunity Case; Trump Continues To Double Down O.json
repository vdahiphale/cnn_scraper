Law enforcement officials in Florida say multiple people have been injured in the Paddock Mall after police responded to an active shooting situation earlier today. Officials report the mall has been evacuated, but add there is no longer a threat at this time. Authorities also said the suspect has fled the scene. Police did not say how many people were injured or -- they did not comment, we should also note, on the severity of the injuries. But this is something we're following closely at this hour. It's a continuing, developing story, and as more information comes in we'll bring that to you, as it develops. So stay with us for all of that. In the meantime, we begin the hour, as well, with justice potentially on hold for Donald Trump with the nation's highest court refusing for now to decide whether the former president is protected from federal prosecution for alleged crimes he committed in office. Special Counsel Jack Smith argued that the court has a singular role to safeguard the Constitution when it comes to presidential wrongdoing. Meantime, Trump's lawyers argued without any evidence that Smith's request for urgency would, quote, \"tarnish the court's procedures with partisanship\". The court's decision to not expedite the legal wrangling could delay Trump's criminal election subversion trial and upend his entire 2024 legal calendar. That means voters may not have a ruling on whether Trump plotted to overturn the 2020 election until after they cast ballots in the 2024 election. And CNN contributor John Dean joins us now, he is the White House counsel to President Nixon. John, great to see you, as always. What did you make of how the Supreme Court ruled on all of this? We are getting some legal experts throwing some cold water and saying, maybe this is not such a big deal. The special counsel did have some precedent for his argument, according to the justices early intervention in the 1974 case, U.S. versus Nixon, which you are familiar with. What do you think?",

He's telling these canvassers, it would be a terrible thing if you, you know, you agree with this certification, they had already voted for certification.

She's a history professor at NYU and the author of \"StrongmenAnd we should note that this is despite a resurfaced interview, a story that featured some reporting about his first wife, Ivana Trump, who said that Trump used to have a book of Hitler's collected speeches kept in a cabinet by his bed, that according to reporter Marie Brenner, reporting in \"Vanity Fair\" back in September of 1990. What do you think of all this, and what do you think of these denials that he's putting out there? RUTH BEN-GHIAT, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: Yes, I've known about this Ivana -- she said he had two books that he read the most. One was a book of Hitler's speeches, not \"Mein Kampf\" but a book of Hitler's speeches. The other was his own \"Art of the Deal\". And both of those things make a lot of sense. You know, Trump has been using racist language since 2015 to signal to white supremacists, he used to retweet white supremacist speech. So, using this language now is continuing to tell all the extremists -- I mean, this is somebody, Jim, who kicked off his campaign at Waco, Texas sending a very strong extremist message. So, you know, he can deny that he's, you know, doesn't know who Hitler is, or doesn't know that speech, but that's -- that's incorrect. Those who are around him, Stephen Miller, his spokesperson Stephen Chung, who is threatening people who call them out on this. I was told by his -- by Stephen Chung, his campaign spokesperson, that I would find my existence, quote, \"crushed\", for making comments that link his speech to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. So, they know what they're doing. Trump is a very skilled propagandist, and he's teaching Americans to desire authoritarian leadership and all the racism and violence that comes with that.",

Is that kind of it?BEN-GHIAT: Well, you know, my research and that of others shows that these -- this kind of language and these kinds of charismatic demagogues like Trump, they have the most appeal when a society has been through a lot of change. It could be a lot of racial equity, it could be gender equity. We had eight years of an African-American president that some people never accepted. And so, all of this sense of grievance that the whole theme that Stephen Miller and all of the Trump campaign, that White Christian civilization is threatened. And that was a mainstay of his first time in office. And so, people have been educated to think that there is a crisis, and only extreme measures right now can solve this crisis.

That's 1,200 feet, an area equivalent to roughly 60 soccer pitches or around 90 American football fields. The IDF told CNN, \"In stark contrast to Hamas's intentional attacks on Israeli men, women, and children, the IDF followed international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\" But is that true? This is just north of the Shati Refugee Camp along the main coastal road. When you go in closer, you can see, in just this small neighborhood, at least nine creators consisting with 2,000-pound bombs, which means the potential kill zone could encompass this entire area.

Plus, we've always talked about -- you and I, you know, have talked about this for, you know, for the last few months, where we have gone through this and said, you know, this is such a densely populated area, that there's no wonder that there are such civilian casualties here.

Unfortunately, civilian deaths are not completely avoidable, but they have to be minimized.

But it is also ironic that this is all happening -- at least in the back-channel world of diplomacy, this is happening at the same time that the Russians are actually achieving small -- very small gains in places along the eastern and southeastern fronts in Ukraine. So it's interesting to note that they are making some gains. But I think what that also means is that those Russian gains are perhaps not as sustainable as we are being led to believe.

And so, I think you see both the strategy, which is to go after these DEI initiatives with the hope of stopping them, and you see the tactic, which is the litigation that gets you there. And, you know, litigation involves actual legal claims that have to be decided according to the law. So, there's a very real issue in each of the complaints that has to be addressed and will be addressed. And may well create new boundaries that -- (INAUDIBLE) -- others will have to follow. But I think we're seeing Stephen take a page out of Steve Bannon's playbook, which is to flood the zone, which is why we're receiving dozens and dozens of these claims and suits being brought against the biggest name brands, as well as colleges, universities, even law firms.",

He's previously said DEI programs are illegal and embrace what he calls \"reverse discrimination.\"I mean, this is some of the same language that we hear Trump use. We heard this during the Trump administration when they would go after certain things. What's your response to all that? And what -- what does the future hold for these kinds of programs?",

Stephen Miller says that his focus is on equality, that everybody should be treated the same, which ignores historic and systemic problems that equity focuses on. What we're seeing are businesses with very specific metrics and very specific actions around hiring, promotion and financial rewards, tied to increased metrics tied to race. And so, that seems to be the focus. And the impact that's already having is that we're seeing businesses and others with DEI initiatives becoming a little bit more general in their approach to their initiatives. I think the hope might be that they will stop these programs altogether. I don't think that is what we will see happen in the future. I think we're going to see -- diversity has always been a bedrock of America. It will always be one. So, I don't think we're going to see DEI initiatives in whatever form they may take go away, because it's already part of what makes America great.",

I think the goal has been to have a chilling effect.I think when they talk about flooding the zone, they know exactly what they're doing. They're trying to create a chilling effect. To a degree, it's had that. But I also think we've seen the private sector, including but not limited to law firms, create committees and defense initiatives that will allow businesses to equip themselves with what's necessary to be able to withstand the attacks, to support each other in the process. And to continue to highlight and promote maybe wider dimensions of diversity within their ranks. But it's not going to go away. It's going to continue. And smart, good people are going to find ways to continue to foster these important programs in the private sector and beyond.",
