A law enforcement source tells CNN \"people are being threatened to be killed for doing their civic duty.\"This comes just days after the grand jury voted to indict former president Donald Trump. Their purported names, photos, social media profiles, even home addresses were published on far right message boards linked to violent extremist attacks. Experts tell us that some anonymous users are calling for violence against those jurors. And meantime, in Texas, a woman has been charged with threatening to kill the federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's January 6th case. After police say she left a voicemail message saying, \"You are in our sights, we want to kill you.\" CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller, joins us now. John, let's begin with that dangerous threat to Judge Chutkan. What do you make of all of that?  JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, the threat to Judge Chutkan comes from a phone call that comes from places - a town called Alvin, Texas. Federal Protective Service officers from the Department of Homeland Security went to that address, interviewed the woman who made that call allegedly, Abi Jo Shry. She said, \"Well, I was never going to carry out the threat out of a gun. I'm not going to go there and shoot anybody. I was drinking when I did it.\" Her father testified she's a nonviolent alcoholic. And yet, they brought this charge because the recent court decisions really say, as long as the person has a conscious disregard to the idea that their threat would be taken seriously and cause fear in the person that's directed at, that's still a crime. And, that's a federal crime when you're threatening a federal judge. So, she went in front of a different federal judge and was denied bail while they sought out what those conditions are going to be.",

And so there could be some sort of collision course with that debate on Wednesday. But regardless, like you said, Jim, he's not expecting to be on the debate stage on Wednesday. And instead, Donald Trump himself has been personally throwing out ideas about how he might want to counter program it, including a potential interview with Tucker Carlson, as well as calling into different cable news shows. I'm also told his team has been coordinating with Trump surrogates about having them there to represent him in the debate room. People like Byron Donalds and Matt Gaetz, both congressman from Florida, as well as Kari Lake and members of Donald Trump's team.

And what we're seeing is the deliberate targeting of not only judges, but we're seeing prosecutors, we're seeing jurists now in the favorite foil of the former president, which is the FBI. But how do you protect them, right, with all of these inbound threats.It's a challenge for law enforcement to assess the means, opportunity in the intent for individuals who are making those threats to actually transcend from political rhetoric into violent acts. And - but we're seeing that speed of rhetoric to violent action shortening. Most recently, we've seen an individual by - who was picked up by the Secret Service by Obama's residence that literally took messaging off of social media and transcended that messaging into a call to action and specifically a call to violence. We start with Paul Pelosi. So this isn't out of the realm of possibility when we're seeing these threats. We're seeing them materialize into violence very quickly.",

But listen, this individual didn't just do that on her own, right? She was influenced by something else. And we have to look at the forums where these discussions are being held where violent political rhetoric is really metastasizing. These discussions are taking place at increasingly volumes in different pockets of the internet and a lot of them have a long history of being linked to violent extremism, they're basically the safe harbors for violent rhetoric. And the issue right now is this borderline content is rapidly being amplified and we're amplifying it, we're seeing the consequence of that amplification.

You've lost your school, you've lost your daycare, you've lost your grocery stores, you've lost everything that creates what is known as a life.

The burn area behind me is over three square miles and they have 40 dogs here that need a break every 15 minutes or so because of the heat and to protect their paws from hotspots as well.And it takes a real skill, a forensic skill to spot maybe a bone shard in all of this, you know, scorched devastation around there. So this will take a very long time and your heart breaks for people who are in limbo right now. We met some of those folks who have submitted DNA samples who know in their heart, they've seen what was left of their mother in law's house and - but they have to hold on to hope as long as they can until they get that official confirmation. The fact that they're opening up the main highway in for folks whose homes didn't burn down as a big stress relief just on the community there. But there are still so many questions about the alarm system, conflicting reports about whether they didn't work from the governor. But then the head of the emergency management system here on Maui yesterday says they weren't activated because they're afraid people would run up the hillsides thinking it's a tsunami warning. Others are pushing back on that right now. There are no sirens in the upcountry fire - places in Maui, so that wouldn't help those folks up there on how to flee, so a lot of questions there. Hawaii electric, there's new investigation showing that they had promised back in 2019 to use drones to examine the high wire lines around Maui and see where the most vulnerable areas are. But Wall Street Journal is reporting they spent less than $300,000 on that project in the last few years. And obviously, it wasn't enough to head off the disaster. You see more and more social videos sort of surveillance, security cam footage of sparking lines. So it looks like that might have been the cause, that seems to be the most consensus on what caused this thing. But so many questions about what happened during and after, Jim?",

And that's - the utility plays a huge role in that, has to go out and contract for these projects.And a lot of the utilities' focus was on helping Hawaii hit these clean energy targets. That's not to say that a utility can't procure clean power and address infrastructure risk at the same time. The utilities can and should do this, but it's - a simple fact was the company was very focused on procuring clean energy and didn't recognize the extent to which it really could face operational risk exacerbated by the changing climate, as we've seen.",

That was true for certainly for PG&amp;E and it may, indeed, be true for Hawaiian Electric.And I think, you know, in general, utilities are tend to be fairly backward looking. I think that the past is a reasonable indication of the future and that relationship is beginning to break down.
