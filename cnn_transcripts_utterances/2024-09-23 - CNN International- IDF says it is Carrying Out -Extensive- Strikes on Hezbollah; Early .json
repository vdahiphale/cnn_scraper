It's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Also coming up this hour, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is in the United States to present his victory plan as he calls it to the White House, with early voting underway for the next U.S. President. Both candidates are heading to the swing states and Manchester City eke out a tie against Arsenal in the final minutes of their tie in the English Premier League. We start though with Israeli warplanes, which have been pounding targets in Southern Lebanon today in what a Hezbollah commander says is now a battle without limits. Israel carrying out the most intense strikes on the region since October the seventh. Lebanese Health officials say at least 182 people were killed and hundreds wounded. And this after more back and forth attacks over the weekend with Hezbollah rockets reaching deep into Israel. Cars are lining up in Southern Lebanon as people try to get out while they can. For the latest on the ground, CNN has Ben Wedeman reporting from Beirut. Nic Robertson is standing by for you in Jerusalem. Ben, let's start with you. It has been an exceptionally worrying weekend, not just for those in Lebanon, of course, but we keep them front and center in our minds as we continue to watch what is going on there, but for the region as a whole, with calls from the U.S. for de-escalation. Tell us where do things stand as we speak?",

I think you know, as Ben said, this is a war, and the signal and the moment on it really seems to have begun last week, last Monday night, when the Israeli cabinet voted to include the north of Israel, the defense of the north of Israel, as part of their war aims. It was the next day that the pagers exploded are worn by many Hezbollah operatives. There was a day after that their radios, walkie-talkies exploded, a very serious hit on senior Hezbollah commanders a couple of days after that, the escalation over the weekend, and now, as Ben says, this is the worst level and scale of bombing, and every indication is that it will carry on. The IDF describes this as the extensive proactive air strikes based on precise intelligence, they say. They use precise intelligence in their airstrikes in Gaza. This is what they say there. And the civilian death toll in Gaza has been very, very, very high over the last number of months. Is this precisely what's happening in Lebanon? We don't know, but this is different, because Hezbollah can strike back. And we heard the Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant today, telling people that it was imperative, and I use some of his words here, that the civilian population observes composure, discipline and full obedience for the directives of the Home Front Command. Meaning that they should stay close to their shelters and in their shelters when they are directed to do it, otherwise there will be casualties. So, Israel is definitely expecting more missiles to come. When you ask about diplomacy, sources I talked to over the weekend in the region, believed that there was a narrowing and time expiring element of diplomacy still in the works. I don't think they were holding out much hope that could come about. And it does seem, by Israel's actions, that whatever diplomacy there was, or is it's not affecting their game plan at the moment.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, look, I mean, it's clear he's got, really six weeks to drastically changethe course of the war in Ukraine's favor, not over dramatizing that that's essentially what he's been saying himself and his statements, that they will be looking at a will be looking at a new U.S. President in November, and potentially a new course of U.S. support in this war. Now his victory plan has the vague parts of which have been touted for some time, but it's the details that will be utterly key. The first point is he's going to try and persuade President Joe Biden, something he's been saying lengthily in public, to authorize the use of U.S. supplied long range missiles to strike a specific list of targets deep inside Russia. Now I should stress that we've been seeing Ukraine for its own means, hitting targets deep inside Russia, ammunition depots, two of which have exploded spectacularly quite far inside Russia in just the last 72 hours. So, this is perhaps a bid using the greater accuracy of U.S. weaponry, but also getting U.S. political will on side for hitting Russia's key military infrastructure deep inside its territory. Bear in mind that is something unthinkable 2.5 years ago, when this war indeed began. The second point, I think, is the one we'll see more of later on this year, which is to try and get Russia forced into a diplomatic solution. Most Western allies in Ukraine feel that Russia is not a trustable negotiating partner, and that to freeze the conflict right now would be to hand Moscow a victory it may not have militarily in the months ahead. So that's key. And remember too, he's going to be seeing not just Joe Biden, but Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. You can expect Vice President Harris to roughly emulate Joe Biden's Ukraine supports if she takes power, but Donald Trump has said he would be able to end the conflict in 24 hours. No details there at all. But also, been quoted by Hungarian President Viktor Orban, a Putin ally or admirer at least, that he's not going to be giving any more money to Ukraine for its war against Russia. Unclear if that really is his own policy, but it's certainly a doubt in the back of Zelenskyy's mind. He needs to go to New York with a plan that says, if you support me in these key steps, I can deliver you a weakened Russia and a place from which it's good to negotiate with Moscow in a matter of six weeks. That's tough ask. He may frankly spend six weeks just negotiating on these missiles with the Biden Administration, but it shows you how fast things are moving, how the potential for a political change in Washington is changing the calculus on the battlefield, enough of itself. And I think, also too exactly how this war has been struggling to get the bandwidth necessarily ahead a year ago, since the conflagration in the Middle East soaked up so much the Biden Administration's time here. You know, this is the largest land war in Europe since the 40s. And it's one where we're seeing Ukraine trying to change the narrative in the past months, but acutely aware that perhaps the loudest clock ticking is the U.S. political one and the electoral race we're currently in, Becky.",

And Eva, let me start with you, because you know there is still a sense out there that Kamala Harris has not provided enough detail on her plan for the economy. One of the key issues in what are these critical swing states. How will the Harris campaign try to gain an edge on this in the coming weeks? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So, Becky, they will push back on that and argued that she talked quite a bit about her vision for the country on a whole number of fronts, but yes, we'll get another pillar of her economic plan this week. They haven't previewed it as yet, but if passed, is prolog, it's really going to focus on the cost of living, which is the most persistent issue that we hear from most voters. She is already outlined how she would address affordable housing, how she would try to bring the cost of basic goods down, and I suspect that it is going to be a lot more in that vein. But in addition to this, she is also aggressively campaigning in the battleground states. We're going to see her out west and in Pennsylvania as well. And then also, the campaign is up with a new ad talking about reproductive rights, talking about access to fertility treatments and using women, really, to tell their own stories of how restrictive abortion bans have impacted them.

At least as of yesterday morning, a senior adviser told me they spoke to them and that he was adamant he was not doing it. Now that doesn't mean that he hasn't floated the idea to certain allies that he maybe would be open to a potential debate, but he has a lot of people telling him that it is not worth it to hit that debate stage again, that they don't think that the timing wise, that it would look good for him, that if anything happens, they say that the media will favor Kamala Harris. Obviously a very common talking point among Republicans and among Trump allies in particular, and so that he shouldn't get out there particularly so close to the election. Obviously, Donald Trump decides at the end of the day what he's going to do or not going to do. So, we'll wait and see what he ultimately says. But as of now, it appears that is not going to happen now for this week, Donald Trump again, he is also in those critical battleground states. He's going to be in Pennsylvania all day today. We expect him to possibly be in North Carolina later in the week. I'll be with him in Savannah, Georgia tomorrow. Georgia again, one of the ultimate key battleground states there, and we're going to see this every day moving forward through this election, I am told he is going to be on the road hitting these various states, particularly a seven to nine of these swing states they believe are swing states, and going out there to try and reach voters. Obviously, we've seen the polling. We know it's all within the margin of error. It is going to be a very tight race, and both sides are telling me they understand this is going to be decided in those margins.",

As you mentioned, you currently, only faces those two-gun charges, but we know from our sources that investigators have continued to try to find evidence that could help them bring more serious charges. The FBI has made clear that from the jump, that they both viewed this as an attempted assassination. But they need the evidence of intent and motive in order to prove that case, and we're getting our first look at the evidence that they've gathered so far, and includes a handwritten letter from Ryan Routh that appears to state what his intent was, very clearly. It says, quote, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. And it goes on to list out a series of grievances that he has with Donald Trump's foreign policy, including his dealings with Iran. That's something that investigators really honed in on from the very beginning was Ryan Routh's sort of geopolitical interest in his opposition to Donald Trump seemed to stem from his opposition to Donald Trump's foreign policy views. They also talked about other evidence, hard evidence, electronics that they've collected from Ryan Routh's car, including one cell phone that had a Google search on it that searched how to travel from Palm Beach County, where Trump's golf course was located to Mexico, suggesting, potentially that he was going to try to flee across the border after, you know, he accomplished whatever he set out to accomplish to do. Now look, this all comes as you mentioned, prosecutors are going to be back in court today arguing that Ryan Routh should remain behind bars while he awaits trial on those two-gun charges. He currently faces possession of a firearm, is convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. We're waiting to see if prosecutors do ultimately decide to bring additional, more serious charges against Routh. But today, prosecutors focused on trying to make sure that Ryan Routh, who they view as a flight risk and a state of the community, stays behind bars until a trial is ultimately held.",
