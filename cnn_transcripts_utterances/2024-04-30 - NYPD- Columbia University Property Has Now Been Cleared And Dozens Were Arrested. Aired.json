Hundreds of officers on Columbia's campus tonight after the university asked them to clear out pro-Palestinian protesters who had set up an encampment and taken over a building just last night. Dozens of people who have already been arrested, zip-tied, and loaded onto buses.Columbia University putting out a statement, reading in part -- quote -- \"We believe that the group that broke into and occupied the building is led by individuals who are not affiliated with the university. The decision to reach out to the NYPD was in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing. Early Tuesday, protesters chose to escalate to an alarming and untenable situation -- including by vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, blockading entrances, and forcing our facilities and public safety workers out.\" Now, Columbia tonight is asking the NYPD to maintain a presence on campus until at least May 17th. I want to bring in CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. Shimon, what are you seeing right now? And tell me, how did all of this go down?",

You know, many of the people here don't agree with this.Look, many of the faculty members, many of the students don't agree with the NYPD, having the NYPD come in on the campus. It was about a week and a half ago when Columbia first did this. And when they did that, when they did -- when they asked the NYPD to come on campus and clear the encampment the first time, it's very significant. And there was a lot of backlash on the university from the faculty and the students, this escalation. Why are you calling the NYPD in? And for days, we heard from the university, they didn't want to call the NYPD in again. But after what happened this morning, it really left the university with no choice.",

That's John Jay Hall, which is just down from Hamilton Hall.And people are actually hanging out, just watching what's happening on the street. These are people who live in the dorms here at the university. They're able to sort of just stand out on the windowsills themselves and watch everything going on. But it -- while it is done on the inside, it's certainly not done on the outside. Just a short time ago here at 113th, protesters are gathering. They're yelling at police and they -- you know, police are still trying to control the situation outside of campus. You can see all the people across Amsterdam Avenue. They have set up an enormous cordon around the university here. Broadway is shut down, both directions from 113th to 120th. Amsterdam is also shut down. So, both sides, both avenues along both sides of the university are completely shut down. All the side streets, 113th, 114th, 115th, 116th, they're all shut down as well, and then they have barricades.  They've been moving barricades. And we knew something was going on because we saw these trucks early and late in the afternoon with tons of barricades coming in. So, it was very clear that something different was happening than we'd seen in previous days. But right now, police say Columbia University itself is done and there's nobody on the grounds that shouldn't be there. There were no injuries, they said. No reports of resisting arrest.

They knew one for certain, there was going to be no element of surprise. It was in social media, it was on the news, that police had been authorized by, in writing, by the university to retake the building. And I think the considerations that were built into their plans were to bring an overwhelming number of police officers to be able to show that overwhelming number to whatever number of people they confronted outside and then inside that building, which was unknown, to minimize the use of force that they would have to use.

It would likely not include burglary or certain criminal trespassing statutes if they weren't inside. If they were a student, it would be something even less because it's hard to charge a student who is entitled to be on campus with one of those things. So, that may be what we saw.

They have a hammer and a sledgehammer, trying to break into areas that appear to have libraries inside. Obviously, this is a university campus. This isn't an academic office. They're going up the stairs or passing down chairs. It seems there have been areas of barricading as well. I mean, what I'm seeing right now is tactical gear, helmets, shields and zip ties. And I'm assuming that they would also have weapons on them because they would not necessarily know the level of resistance or if it was armed resistance that they would be, in fact, encountering. Tell me about the coordination, though, that it would take to have this many NYPD officers on a college campus.

Columbia made the decision that this is where the line is drawn and called them in. For police, this was a plan that they had already been considering. They brought a lot of people, but they also brought a lot of special equipment, as you mentioned. They brought the emergency service unit. Those are the people with the jaws of life if they have to breach a door. Those are the people with the tools to cut through any barricades if they have to. Those are the people who have the flashbangs if they needed a distraction device. But what you didn't see was a lot of special weapons. In other words, they came armed the way police officers do with their sidearms. But there wasn't any particular large number of SWAT-type weapons because they knew they were dealing with kids, they knew they were dealing with protesters, they knew they were likely to be unarmed.

I mean, shortly, it will be May 1st, but that's at least almost a three-week period at that point in time to have additional police presence.What would that look like in terms of the amount of police that would be present?

What it means is that a few hundred police officers came up to clear the kids who were both students and non-students, who were camped out on that piece of ground, and then when that operation was over, life resumed, and they came back and they re-camped out.So, at this point, the college, Columbia University, has made the decision, if we're going to retake that ground for the second time, when we retake it, we have to have a program to hold it because we have graduation coming up in just a couple of weeks and we don't want to have to keep doing this either to that ground or the buildings. So, the police can do a minimal presence there, which is they can put jersey barriers -- not jersey barriers, they can put the bicycle barriers around that piece of land. They can have some limited access, controlled access or no access as they prepare to set up for graduation. They can have a small number of officers around it controlling that and a larger number on the outside, or they can go with a larger number on the inside, which I think might just not be the look they're going for.

So, people were under the impression that, you know, there's not going to be another NYPD raid on campus. Now, with the end of negotiations and with, you know, the escalation in the form of the occupation of Hamilton Hall, that all -- that entire calculus has definitely changed on the administration's level.",

New York Police say university property, including Hamilton Hall, which was taken over by pro-Palestinian protesters just last night, has now been cleared just about two hours after hundreds of officers entered the New York City campus.Joining me now, Hagar Chemali, adjunct associate professor at Columbia University. Thank you so much for being here, professor. I mean, we have been watching this throughout the last couple of weeks, but certainly in the last 24 hours and hours since this has happened. Dozens have been arrested, some will be expelled, and the university statement saying tonight that they made the decision to bring in the NYPD back to protect the safety of everyone. Do you support that decision, to have had NYPD on campus to clear the campus and specifically as well Hamilton Hall?",

But the fact is that the university, and we saw them, the administration, were negotiating in good faith with the protesters for at least 10 days. We were being kept up-to-date.As your previous guest, Jonas, I believe mentioned, we were getting emails on a daily basis and often multiple times a day and detailing the negotiations that they were making progress, that they had hope. So, it looked like it was in good faith, especially after the arrests from 10 days ago, that this was the route the administration was trying to take. But those talks reached an impasse and the problem now is that they had no choice because the students barricaded themselves in this building. This is an academic building. You've got exams next week. You have -- the students are very loud. You have -- they're right in front of the library where students are trying to study for their exams. And they vandalized. And frankly, what they did was not just against Columbia rules, but was also illegal. And so, they have to restore order on campus, not just for the exams, but also for graduation. You have students who didn't have a graduation because of the pandemic before who have it now. You have students who've never had anyone in their family graduate. And you can't have a small group of protesters mess that up for everybody else.",

Shimon, tell me what you are seeing right now. We're looking at some footage from earlier in the evening of NYPD entering into Hamilton Hall, removing chairs, using some sort of a device to break into or open up a door.

Most of the law enforcement presence is gone.Now, really, you know, we're going to learn more about who some of these people are, and that's going to come tomorrow and the days ahead. It's going to be significant, especially as we learn about the individuals who broke into Hamilton Hall, which really set all of this off. Had those individuals not broken into the building, perhaps we wouldn't even be here right now. Things have changed because of that. And so, tomorrow, at some point, I assume they'll be in court. They're facing some pretty serious charges, burglary charges. The students that were arrested on campus will likely mostly face trespassing charges, maybe some other charges. But the most significant charges will come from the individuals who broke into Hamilton Hall. And, really, I think the NYPD is going to make it a focus of theirs, to put out information about these individuals who they say some of them are outside agitators, outside elements that came in and co-opted this protest and broke into that room. So, there's still a lot more to learn here. But, for now, the big presence of law enforcement, things are calm, things have been cleared, and we'll see what happens tomorrow, certainly the response from faculty and the students in the coming days.",

People think about burglary as in the taking of something. You're going into someone's home or a space and removing property. It can also be the breaking and entering during the nighttime hours, is often defined as burglary as opposed to just trespass. I would assume there's a lot of disorderly conduct things coming as well.I want to bring in Columbia University professor and CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali into the conversation. Tim, good to see you. I mean, this is quite reminiscent for so many people of a series of different protests that have happened more collectively on college campuses, albeit for different reasons, but this NYPD action is actually coming on, I understand, the 56th anniversary of the 1968 action at the same building, Hamilton Hall.
