A lot of people think affirmative action was allowed because of remedy to past discrimination, but, no. When Lewis Powell cast that decisive vote in 1978, he said it was for the educational mission to have a more diverse student body. And that's what the justices upheld in 2003 and that's what is at issue here. And several schools have tried race neutral measures and they say they just do not do the -- they did not provide the kind of diverse campus student body that people would like on campuses, again, for the educational mission, to build a diverse workforce for the global economy, and as a solicitor general is going to argue today in both cases, in both Harvard and the University of North Carolina, that for the military academy, it's important to have a variety of students of all race and ethnicities.",

The House is a different position than the Senate. The Senate is the focal point here for the final days for the final days of the race. But, look, it's a one-seat majority.
