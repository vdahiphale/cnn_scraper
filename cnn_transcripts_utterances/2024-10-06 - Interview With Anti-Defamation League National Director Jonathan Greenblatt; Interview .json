I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is 30 days out.We have just over one month left in one of the most extraordinary presidential campaigns in American history. And more than one million voters have already cast their ballots across 30 states in what is expected to be a hard-fought and close race right up to Election Day, no doubt with plenty more twists and turns to come. Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris surveyed damage in North Carolina, as that state tries to dig out of the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, while Donald Trump returned last night to Butler, Pennsylvania, where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt just three months ago, and now faces a new opponent in a much tighter race. He was joined on stage by there by my next guest, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump. Thank you so much for being here. I know it was a late night last night. We talked about what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, but you were there last night. And I'm sure that it was not easy, that it was emotional for you and your family. But, as I mentioned, a lot has changed politically since that happened three months ago. Can you give me a sense of the state of things on the ground in Pennsylvania, where you just were? LARA TRUMP, CO-CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Yes, well, let me just briefly say, Dana, that it really was a beautiful moment yesterday in Butler. And I think it was really important in terms of healing for this country. I don't think any of us will forget, whether you love Donald Trump or not, where you were when you found out what had happened to him on July 13. And that's a traumatic thing to happen to a country. And I can tell you, when we got off the plane yesterday, I was a little bit emotional, and I got to sit right next to Helen Comperatore, Corey Comperatore's widow, and his two daughters. And it was a really beautiful tribute. And I think it was important for Donald Trump to go back and create new memories for the people of Butler, Pennsylvania. And that's exactly what you saw yesterday. But, listen, you're right, this -- the polling would indicate that things are neck-and-neck. I can tell you there were over 100,000 people at that rally there last night. I have never seen a crowd like that. You couldn't even see standing on the stage how far back the audience went. And I think that that shows you that there is continued enthusiasm and growing enthusiasm for Donald Trump. And I think, as every day goes by -- we are 30 days away from this election -- people are really considering what kind of America they want to live in. Do you want to get back to a time where you have great economic policies, where you have more money in your pocket, a secure southern border, and peace agreements, instead of wars breaking out around the world? They remember, I think, Dana, who brought them that. It was Donald J. Trump. And that's why I believe, on November 5, he's going to be victorious in this race.",

You can go online and you can look at videos of people recording themselves and posting online saying, we need help. No one has come here. We have nothing and no one has even addressed the situation in my neighborhood or my area. So I'm glad to hear that he feels very good about that. And I -- honestly, I hope that we hear more of that.

Is there any circumstance in which Donald Trump would accept a defeat and concede? L. TRUMP:  Well, of course, if he feels that this is a free, fair and transparent election, which, by the way is my number one goal at the RNC. You mentioned at the top I am the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. And our number one charge has been trying to make sure that we restore faith in our electoral process. There were a lot of people after 2020 all across this country who felt like maybe they couldn't trust that system. We want to restore the faith in that because it is really foundational, Dana, to who we are as a country, as American citizens. Every vote matters and every vote counts. And we have extended this offer to our friends across the aisle at the DNC. Please be -- at the DNC, please come join us in this pursuit of election integrity. And so we want every person to feel, when they go vote in America, whether they're voting Republican, Democrat or third-party candidate, their vote matters and their vote counts.

And there is no evidence to prove that. There were, what, 60 lawsuits where lawyers, like the ones that you're hiring, went through the process, which he had every right to do.And there was no evidence of widespread fraud. His attorney general, Bill Barr, said that again. So it sounds like you're setting up the same question of free and fair, when that is what we saw. So, again, do you see a scenario where he will take a different approach this election year? L. TRUMP:  Well, we are setting things up differently from the RNC standpoint. And we, instead of having to respond days, weeks or months later to any issue that we might have, are going to have people in the room every time a vote is cast and counted, so that we can ensure if there is any question about anything we're addressing it right then in that moment and we're not waiting later. Those lawsuits you referenced, by the way, the vast majority of them were not dismissed based on merit. They were dismissed on clerical errors. And if you go back and look at that election, let's just be honest. Everybody watching this understands that was a very different, very unique election. Laws were changed state by state illegally. It's the state legislature that decides the voting laws in each state. That didn't happen. And it was because of COVID-19. You had poll watchers who had to stand across a room and couldn't even see anything going on. You had massive information coming out. The people just said, I don't understand what's going on here, and we never got answers to that. We're trying to rectify that right now. And we're hoping that 2024 is the year and going forward that people trust our electoral process once again. Again, it is our number one focus. (CROSSTALK)",

It's not lost on me and it shouldn't be lost on the American people that Donald Trump, when he was president, gave a giant tax cut to billionaires. Elon Musk is the richest person in the world. He's got a tremendous amount of interest in Donald Trump being elected president because Donald Trump made it -- I mean, it's clear he's going to double down on tax cuts to billionaires, while sticking it to American families. Middle-class and everyday folks are going to get a bad deal under Donald Trump and billionaires like Elon Musk will get their giant tax cut again. So, it makes sense, I guess, that he's there.

I respect her ability to take the position she's taking, and others will make similar or different decisions. But it's really up to the voters in 30 days.

I'm winning independents by more than 20 points, and I'm getting more than a quarter of all Democrats, and I'm working hard to try to convince others who actually thought I was a great governor and voted for me twice and have a favorable opinion of the job that I did.

And I'm trying to convince voters that they should put country over party, and that we shouldn't just vote red and blue. We should vote for the person you think is best qualified for the job and the one that you think can stand up and be a key voice in the middle to make a difference.

And here in the United States, we're getting troubling new numbers about the rising antisemitism in the wake of those attacks and the Israel-Hamas war. Here with me now to bring you those new numbers is the CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt. Thank you so much for being here. I want to dig into these numbers and show them to our viewers. According to your report, there have been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. since the October 7 attacks, including over 8,000 instances of verbal or written harassment, more than 1,800 instances of vandalism, and more than 150 physical attacks targeting Jews. And just for context, that's a 200 percent jump from the previous year. JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO AND NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE:  Yes, Dana, so these numbers are truly astonishing. ADL has been around for over 110 years, and we have never seen data like this before. Think about it. Like, we are honoring, commemorating, this solemn anniversary of the murder of 1,200 people simply because they were Jewish, right? They were slaughtered, they were tortured, they were killed, they were kidnapped. And yet, here in the United States, that triggered a tsunami of anti-Jewish hate. And it's not just the numbers. I travel all over the country, and the stories I have heard about restaurants being boycotted in Philadelphia simply because the owners are Jewish, about cafes in Chicago being targeted, ice cream parlors in the Bay Area, again and again, people are being told they can't participate in a conference because they're Zionist, again, you shouldn't patronize a restaurant because it's Jewish. I mean, this is unbelievable. And, by the way, like, we're seeing these stories about what happened in North Carolina and that tragedy. And there has been an avalanche of antisemitic conspiracies directed at the mayor, directed at FEMA, as if somehow the Mossad is involved in distributing disaster relief. So, I think conspiracism is at an all-time high and antisemitism is raging like we have never seen before.",
