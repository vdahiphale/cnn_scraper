And so sadly, as for so many towns over this vast stretch of front lines of Russian artillery strikes, missile strikes. And that is exactly what happened in the last couple of hours. This was people going about their market. We just heard President Zelenskyy speak to this, the utter abomination of what has taken place. People at a market, a pharmacy, civilians, 16 of them. But the toll could rise, as we understand, Becky. Amongst those confirmed dead, though, one child at least. And I think it's an important reminder of what civilians continue to live through, day in and day out. This is a large number of civilians to be killed in a single attack. As to its timing, I think that we can safely assume that things are far too chaotic on the Russian side for us to read too much into the timing of this, coming as it does on the day of Secretary Blinken's visit. It is all too tragically the daily life here in Ukraine. Certainly the uncertainty of never knowing whether a missile strike or an artillery strike is going to land on you and there were also here in Kyiv today, by the way, Becky, even ahead of Secretary Blinken's arrival, more ballistic missile, cruise missile strikes.

In Nairobi, African leaders just wrapped up their first ever climate summit. The event was part of a massive effort by African leaders to position the continent as a destination for green investment, as the world tackles the climate crisis. Africa was able to succeed by landing funding pledges worth $23 billion, including a $4.5 billion pledge by the UAE to support clean energy projects on the continent. The summit also called on the international community to reduce carbon emissions, cut the use of coal and honor its climate finance pledges. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo, who's been on the sidelines of the summit.

This is a departure from where you claim $100 billion  but you have no idea where it's coming from or the way it's being invested.

Phaseout is because you drove here today. What did you use? Petrol, diesel, whatever. It will take time to transition.

And so we know that this is something that the administration officials are really privately focused on in the next year, what could be the last year really of the Biden administration. And so one of the critical pieces to all of this, as you noted, is that the Palestinians are actually engaging this go-around. They, in the last round of Abraham accords normalization agreements, they really did not engage. They were frustrated, they felt that engaging would not be beneficial to them. And now, they are seeing that there could be room for them to get something out of it. According to \"The New York Times,\" as you said, they were in Saudi Arabia for meetings yesterday; the day before, this delegation of U.S. officials is in Saudi Arabia.

But this is perhaps a significant development, because it means that the president of the Spanish football federation, Luis Rubiales, yes, suspended, of course, by world football's governing body but he could face criminal charges. Spanish prosecutors said last week that they were going to give Jenni Hermoso 15 days to file a complaint if she so wanted. They made it clear at that point that was a complaint that could lead to sexual aggression charges. So the Spanish prosecutors have said they will be issuing another update.

Spain have a new woman's head coach and we have got news of that and the other developments coming up in a couple of minutes.",
