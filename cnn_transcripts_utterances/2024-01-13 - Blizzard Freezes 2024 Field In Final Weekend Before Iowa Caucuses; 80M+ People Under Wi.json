Nikki Haley here in Iowa City today, this is her second of three events across the state today. It's interesting to note that Iowa City is in Johnson County, which just one of the more Democratic strongholds across Iowa.That's important because Nikki Haley is someone who is known to appeal to more moderate Republicans. We'll see if there maybe even any Democrats in the room supporting her. I met some students from the University of Iowa who are out supporting her today. And as you said, the weather cannot be ignored. All of her events yesterday had to be canceled. Former President Trump, too, excuse me, three of his four events across the state this weekend had been canceled because it's frigid here, because there are blizzard across the state right now. It's really quite frankly dangerous in some places. It's in the negative degrees, potentially negative ten, negative to 15 on caucus day. And Nikki Haley earlier today, reminding folks that they need to wear layers when they go out to caucus, that this is something that they need to be cognizant of, but encouraging them to show up with their friends. Listen to part of her pitch from earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fellows are scared. I'm telling you. You can see our numbers going up in the polls. Americans just want to see if it's possible and you could have set the tone. This starts with Iowa. You all know how to do this. You take this responsibly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been trying to peel off some support there.And he yesterday, as we saw a lot of people canceling all of their in- person events, forged ahead with a couple of in-person of events. And then today has continued a big schedule and aggressive schedule that puts him all across the state of Iowa. He's going to be here at West Des Moines, in his headquarters in just a little bit. But here's what he had to say to supporters just a little bit ago at one of his last stops. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Never going to have an opportunity to cast a vote that's going to have more of an impact that on Monday. I mean, it's going to be a relatively small numbers people, you know, I don't know. They did 186,016. Some people think it will be less this time, who knows?

So, by taking that out, that denies them, it denies them an important part of their military capabilities. But the Houthis are threatening to respond now, not just against the United States and the U.K. and others in that military coalition in the Red Sea.

But I think when you're trying to examine how are the Houthis is going to whether these this round of military strikes, look to their recent history. They had a ten -- well, I've been going through about a ten- year civil war the last couple of years, it's more or less been on truth and a lot of that involved Saudi coalition air force strikes trying to hit Houthi targets with U.S. support actually inside of Yemen.

The message, though it hasn't changed, it does feel a little bit more urgent. Now, three months into this conflict in Gaza, the death toll rising and people here are calling for that permanent ceasefire.

So, that's what today is all about. We're about to march. They're going to be heading out, walking to the White House and we should again see that continuing rallies and chants.

But we saw the top U.N. court, Fred, just as we take up that genocide a case against Israel.

One, Congress and in particular the Republicans who've been brought blocking aid to Ukraine should get its act together, renew the -- renew the funding, renew the deliveries of weapons that we've been doing so successfully for the last year. And secondly, the White House, and together with other Western countries, should look at using frozen Russian assets.

There are -- you know, there is a risk that freezing Russian assets could affect other -- other kinds of financial transactions. But I really think that at this point, the situation is urgent, both the -- both the military situation, but also the psychological situation. As I said, this is a kind of game. The United States needs to win the game. It needs the West to win the game. And one of the ways we could do that is by taking those frozen Russian assets, giving them to Ukraine and showing Russia that we are in this for the long term, and that will sooner or later convince the Russians that the war is not worth their time. It's not -- they aren't going to win.
