The markets, of course, we had a coupleof days of losses, and now we can see those losses have reversed, a little smidgen of green. We're going to go backwards and forwards. It will be fascinating to see how the next hour progresses. The main events of the day that have been pushing all this forward. President Biden is set to introduce new limits on US investments with China. The aim is to protect national security. WeWork, the tech darling of workplace warns it has substantial doubts that WeWork will survive. And technology could solve one of travel's greatest challenges, translation. Tourists in Tokyo can now ask for directions in 12 languages. Now that is progress. Live from New York, midweek, Wednesday, August 9th, my word, where do the days go? I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. We start tonight, with the US president taking aim at China's high tech development despite recent efforts of administrations to stabilize relations with Beijing. The president is expected to announce new rules within a few hours. For those familiar with the plans say they will target Chinese quantum computing, AI and semiconductors. US investment firms will be restricted from investing in those areas and required to report their activity in China. It will give the American government an overview of exactly what's being invested where in the Chinese economy, particularly when it comes to quantum and AI and computers and technology. The president is set to speak at any moment in an event in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The remarks he'll have will be mainly on domestic manufacturing, but we'll keep an eye in case there's much relevance on that. Kevin Liptak is in Washington. Square in a circle for me. They want better relations with China, and Blinken has done much towards that goal. So why are they doing this, which is only going to exacerbate and annoy the Chinese?",

And when you talk to officials here in Washington today, as these restrictions are coming together, as they're being finalized, the point that they keep making is that these are narrowly focused on national security. They're not meant to disrupt legitimate business with China. They're not meant to damage the Chinese economy, and President Biden is trying to resuscitate a relationship with Beijing that has really sort of bottomed out over the last year or so. He has sent top officials to China to talk to their Chinese counterparts -- Blinken, Secretary Yellen, the Commerce secretary -- and so it does come at this fraught moment and the hope, at least among officials that I've been talking to today is that China will regard this as squarely in the national security space, whether that happens, I think remains to be seen, probably pretty doubtful.",

      "sentences": "Kevin, thank you. Beautifully done to bring us up to date with the events.Now the moves in the United States come as the Chinese economy is experiencing deflation for the first time in more than two years. Deflation is where prices fall and consumer prices fell by 0.3 of a percent last month. The reasons are many, but it include shoppers cutting back on spending, government spending. It is increasing the pressure on Beijing to stimulate the economy, as it faces the possibility of stagnation. The rest of the world is trying to fight inflation, but deflation in many ways is far more dangerous. In fact, economists worry about deflationary spirals. Think about it this way, falling prices lead to lower profits for businesses as margins shrink. When companies have less money, they look to pay their workers less. That leads to falling demand in the overall economy and faced with lower demand, businesses lower prices to encourage sales, and of course, you don't buy things because you know the price will be cheaper next month. That's a deflationary spiral. The problem could extend beyond China. The country is a major exporter and if its manufacturers lower the price of goods, it could force suppliers in other countries to do the same. Shamik Dhar is the chief global economist at BNY Mellon. He used to be chief economist at the Foreign Office at the UK. This is interesting, because you know, we had Japanese deflation. We had worries about deflation in the EU during the great financial crisis and afterwards. We've had flat -- we've have had -- but it's not really been seen in the US. How real is this deflation versus a blip in China?",

Most of the -- I think most of the street, most of the market seems to think this is a relatively short blip that things will come back next year and relatively strongly. I'm not so sure. I think, you know, there are lots of structural factors that point to falling prices, lots of things that China shares in similarity with Japan -- falling population, weak banks, falling inflation expectations, and unwillingness on the part of consumer to spend.

So in principle, yes, it could sort of fire up the engine, if you like and pump money in. I think the problem is that it's unwilling to do so because, frankly, that kind of approach in the past has led them to the situation they're in now. You know, pumping up the property sector, pumping up the SOEs, that's kind of led to a huge capital misallocation, which frankly, the markets are trying to sort out now. So China is caught out a bit.

And so with the rest of the world relatively weak, China's exports and export dependency came home to roost and kept the economy relatively weak. Now, against that background, if you try to -- if you talk about sort of de-risking, even as opposed to decoupling, then it's bound to hit confidence and to some degree, you know, challenge the existing Chinese model, which is very fundamentally dependent at the end of the day on Western demand.",

I think there's nuances now appearing. You know, as I mentioned, there, I think there are good reasons to think that if there's a soft landing, and I still think it's odds against, but if there is one, then it's most likely to happen in the US, whereas the region in danger of doing too much is probably the Eurozone. I think probably rates are where they need to be already, but they're talking about raising them from here.

So why, again, with the Russians say this was not hit by a Ukrainian drone? Why? Because if the Ukrainians were going after high value targets around Moscow, that might be one of them, a factory that the military needs in its war effort, remembering, of course, they have to make everything themselves now, because, in the past, they could buy some of these components in. So what's domestically produced? That's super important. The idea that there could be a third party operating a warehouse in the middle of this site, that was the root of the explosion, maybe. But that would also speak to the potential for sabotage, that someone had rented it and had built a bomb inside of it.
