We are tracking the very latest on the severe weather impacting millions across the U.S. At least 16 storm-related deaths have been reported, including two in Erie County, New York, in what may be the area's worst winter storm since the famous 1977 Buffalo blizzard. Jefferson County, New York, is experiencing life-threatening blizzard conditions, banning travel, and declaring a state of emergency. Jaw dropping subzero temperatures are freezing huge swaths of the country. More than 100 million people remain under windchill alerts. Some cities including Atlanta and Philadelphia are facing their coldest Christmas ever. And nearly two million people are without power. Power companies in Ohio, Kentucky, and Memphis are asking residents to reduce their power usage to avoid widespread outages. People hoping to travel home for Christmas have been met with frustration for three consecutive days now. Road travel in some areas is completely just dangerous. And today alone, more than 2,000 flights have been canceled, 5,000 delayed. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar is in the CNN weather Center. But let's begin with CNN's Polo Sandoval in Buffalo, New York. Polo, the storm there has been unrelenting. I can see you're in the middle of it. What exactly are you seeing right now on the ground? What can you see on the ground in those kinds of conditions?",

It really is incredible what we have been experiencing here for well over 24 hours. These wind-whipped snow piles that you see all over the street.Here, obviously, you see this street cutting through parts of downtown Buffalo. This is drivable, however, authorities are hoping that people will stay off the streets because for the rest of today, into tonight, they want to make sure that first responders are able to get around. You see, what we heard from Erie County officials earlier this morning, they said that they are still frustrated that people are still going out and driving. We haven't seen a whole lot on these city streets. However, they are saying that they're still seeing that on interstates. Reminder, there is still a travel and a driving ban today that will be in place the rest of today. They're going to reassess for tomorrow. But the goal there is not only to keep the streets clear, but to motivate people to simple stay indoors, saying the safest place because of the frigid temperatures, is still at home. Now in terms of what may be hundreds of people that are still stranded in their vehicles along the highways, they are asking people actually remain in their vehicles if they are fairly safe there and make a phone call to authorities, not 911, but a nonemergency line, unless it is an emergency, of course, and at least flag themselves for authorities to potential get rescued. But even that is going to take a while. But again, a reminder that as you see millions of Americans throughout parts of the northeast and other parts of the country as well affected by this, Buffalo, according to authorities here, has been ground zero. It is and it likely will be ground zero for the rest of today.",

Already today more than 2,000 flights have been canceled or delayed, adding to the thousands impacted yesterday.Travelers at Chicago's O'Hare, Denver International, and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson are bearing the brunt of it. I am joined now by Brian Kelly, he's the founder of Thepointsguy.com. Brian, thanks for joining us. What advice do you have for anyone who might be heading home or heading out today. Is your advice just don't do it? BRIAN KELLY, FOUNDER, THEPOINTSGUY.COM: Well, where possible. Travel can be dangerous to so many parts of the country right now. But if you absolutely have to travel, you need to be proactive. Even if you're in sunny Los Angeles, there is a chance that your flight might be delayed or canceled because it's coming from an impacted area. So always download the airline app and sign up for push alerts. But I also recommend Flight Aware. You can download their app, track your flight. And often they will alert you about a delay or cancellation before the airline. And even if your flight is not canceled, I highly recommend packing snacks and food. I have friends who waited for three hours after landing at Nashville yesterday because the ground crews can't be out in the frigid temps. So pack your patience and just know that it's going to be tough traveling this weekend.",

So I use a service called Expert Flyer. And you can actually set alerts. So even if the flight later today is sold out right now, a lot of people who are supposed to connect onto the flight are probably not going to make it. So availability opens up constantly throughout the day. So Expert Flyer will actually show when there is a ticket available for sale.And what you can do, the minute you get that alert, you can book that seat before anyone else. Also, when the airlines cancel or delay your flights, you absolutely by law are owed a refund. Never, ever take a voucher. The airlines will say, don't worry, you can use that credit for a year. But an airline credit is way worse than cold hard cash. So even if your airline can't get you there, rebook yourself using your frequent flyer miles on a different airline and just keep checking.

So that's why I tell people book travel now for spring, summer, even next fall, especially using your frequent flyer miles. So I don't see any signs of travel really slowing down.

That judge now affirms Democrat Katie Hobbs won the election and will be the next governor of Arizona. Lake lost by about 17,000 votes and sued in Maricopa County court in an attempt to get November's election overturned. That trail ended on Thursday. Lake says she will appeal.The House select committee that investigated the January 6th insurrection has released another batch of more than 40 witness interview transcripts. One indicates White House staffers drafted a press release after then Attorney General Bill Barr publicly refuted President Trump's claims that the election was rigged. It ended with, \"Anybody that thinks there wasn't massive fraud in 2020 should be fired.\" The statement, though, was never released and the attorney general was not fired. In another transcript, former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell said \"The numbers we saw on election night simply didn't jibe with common sense.\" Powell claimed that, quote, \"math geniuses\" told her Biden's victory was statistically impossible. Trump nearly appointed Powell as special counsel to investigate her baseless theories. She was eventually pushed off of the legal team. But Trump's White House counsel told the January 6th committee that it would have been a disaster if Trump had made Powell a special counsel. The newly released transcripts come after the January 6th report was finally released and placed the blame squarely on former President Trump.

There are certain things that show that there were inconsistencies, fraud, and irregularities, and those things need to be looked into.The people that are supposed to look into that is law enforcement, whether it be the FBI or states specifically. So would there be pressure on states to go back and investigate to figure out whether the results are, in fact, accurate? Absolutely. That's what we would expect the president to do if he was presented with evidence that the results were inaccurate. So the fact that there is this contact, the fact that there are multiple requests to investigate, that's not incriminating at all. In fact, that's something that you expect the chief executive to do because he is constitutionally required to make sure that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed. The gap that they are going to have is they are trying to make the logical leap to say he knew that the results were accurate and he was trying to push a false narrative they were inaccurate and trying to get people to falsely flip the result.

So how will you rebut that evidence?Because it sounds like I wasn't necessarily that he was just being told that there was election fraud. He was also being told that there was not. He even questioned some of his lawyers, for example, Sidney Powell, Hope Hicks I believe is the one who testified saying that he would cover the phone while she was talking and be like, look, this sounds crazy, doesn't it. It appeared that even he was skeptical of some of the advice that he was being given. PARLATORE: Sure. And that's the thing is that he's being given advice by multiple people. People are telling him differing stories. Some of those people are telling him stories that they are supporting with all sorts of spreadsheets and presentations. And other people, like Bill Barr, are saying, oh, there's nothing there. We are not even going to bother investigating it. And had Bill Barr instead said, you know what, I'm going to show you that Sidney Powell is completely full of it, I'm going to send out a few FBI agents and we're going to show you that, that probably would have resolved the issue. But the fact that you had some people who were saying that this is true, some people who were saying that it's not true, and nobody is doing a comprehensive investigation to actually show what really happened, it's that failure and that refusal to actually go forward and conclusively prove it one way or the other, that's where the ambiguity comes in and where the questions come in.",

It's a strong recovery from a stall in the economy in the first half. At the same time, layoffs remain historically low. First time claims for unemployment benefits in the latest week were below the 2019 average, remarkable considering the Federal Reserve raised rates seven times this year to slow the economy.
