So, really, Judge Cannon's first order of business was instructing all the attorneys to get in touch with DOJ to begin the security clearance process.Now, our Kaitlan Collins is reporting that Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Chris Kise, they have already been in touch with DOJ because, of course, this case is comprised of highly sensitive classified materials. And because of that, these attorneys will need to get security clearance in order to work with all of that material. In another turn here, John, this order is also significant because it shows that Judge Cannon, who has been criticized for siding with Trump in a previous related case and whose ability to effectively manage this case, has been questioned. It does show that she is already getting into motion to manage her docket within days of Trump's arraignment. You know, Judge Cannon is relatively new to the bench. She was nominated by Donald Trump in 2019, but she will be the one running this massive and complicated case, and she is taking charge right off the bat by trying to get the security clearance process in motion. In addition, here Judge Cannon's order, it definitely does put this additional pressure on the former president to get his legal team fully aligned. Trump does have Chris Kise, that's Florida's former Solicitor general. He's on his team. Also, Todd Blanche, they were in court with him during the arraignment this week. But we know that Trump is still looking for at least one other attorney, and his team has been in touch with Florida law firms. But as you're aware, John, you know, attorneys have been hesitant to work with the former president. He really does have this history of not necessarily listening to legal advice and, of course, not always paying his bills. So they have to report to the judge by Tuesday as to whether they've coordinated with the DOJ, which at this point, John, we know that at least two of his lawyers have. We'll see if they can get others on board in the coming days. John?",

Problem is, politically, every time he speaks, it looks like it's favorable. His poll numbers go up, fundraising increases, it energizes the base. This case, as has been discussed so often, is going to be dragged out as long as possible. It is in Trump's best interest to take it past the election in 2024, because if he wins, this case goes away. Not the state cases, if they still exist, but this case does.So he might as well push it out as far as possible. So I think you're going to hear him say a lot of things at the rallies.

If this had been my client, my normal mid-level senior manager inside a federal agency, what we'd say a GS-14 or 15, maybe even a senior executive service representative. They would have been indicted a long time ago.And they would not have been asked nicely to return the classified information the way Donald Trump was over a period of many, many months. So things would have been different, for sure. These cases are rare when it really comes down to it, but they do happen. There are other mishandling cases, or leak cases, but even with mishandling, we've got 37 counts against him. If you looked at everything, you're talking over 300 years. That's not realistic obviously. Most of these cases, which rarely go to trial because the person pleads out. Because there's really nothing to say at the trial itself as to whether they did it or not factually. But they have recently been like three to nine years for prison time as a result. So President Trump is facing real jail time. I'm sure any one day for him is going to be unacceptable, but that's what he's facing. Mark Zaid, great to have you on this morning.

They are traveling with what they are saying is a peace plan that they hope both sides might be willing to endorse. It does ultimately require the withdrawal, though, of Russian forces entirely from Ukrainian territory, which is the position of the Western allies backing President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy, the rest of Ukraine, frankly, as well.So by firing Kinzhal missiles, for example, six of them, these hypersonic most potent missiles in the Russian armory, whilst people like Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president here is a sort of bizarre move by Russia diplomatically, plays into the hands of President Zelenskyy. Because Mr. Ramaphosa's head of military, for example, was a recent visitor to the Kremlin and they've had joint military exercise is recently with none other than the Russian Navy. So in that context, this is if you'll skews the pun backfiring on the Kremlin. But at the same time, I think President Zelenskyy is also preparing the international community and his own people when he describes, I think very honestly that this is a grinding difficult campaign. It's going to be bloody. The anticipation here is that if Ukrainian -- even if the Ukrainians are successful, they are still going to take very significant losses. And their greatest hope, John, is to try to have a sufficiently frightening advance that the Russian military themselves collapsed because political support for this war among the fighting men and women of Russia is dwindling.
