This is what it looks like in Brooklyn today. At LaGuardia Airport, some travelers were forced to wrap plastic bags around their feet just to get through the standing water that had filled the airport. Elsewhere, they had to bring in heavy machinery for water rescues.In New Jersey, this police officer carried a man on his shoulders after he was trapped in his car. There was so much rain, a sea lion at the Central Park Zoo managed to escape her pool when it flooded. The zoo says that she rubbed around for a bit, but she was eventually returned safely to her exhibit tonight. Thank you so much for joining me on this Friday night.

      "sentences": "This is America's debt, more than $33 trillion, and the first time that clock has reached that grim milestone. That is more than a quarter million dollars per taxpayer. Tax cuts, stimulus programs, defense spending, pandemic unemployment, all of them to blame.And any fair person would agree that that is unsustainable. So, the Republican mission to lower that number makes some sense. The problem is their method of drawing attention to it is about to shut the American economy down, the government down, and negatively impact Americans who don't have the time or frankly the money for the poison of today's politics. Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. And in just 24 hours, the clock will run out. Hardliners in the Congress are demanding drastic cuts to spending. They don't want to spend another dime on Ukraine. They want to spend it on the border instead, they say. It's a fair debate, but here is what is at stake here. On Saturday night, if there is a shutdown, while all of this plays out, it is a reminder of the real life consequences of what happens if there is no deal. Your flights will be delayed. Thousands of airport workers will go without pay. More than 1 million active duty troops won't get paid. Border agents won't get paid either. The White House says that the U.S. is left vulnerable. If Pentagon workers are furloughed, small businesses won't get new loans, food inspections, they won't happen either, museums and national parks, forests, all of that closed. Student loans will be disrupted and so is the money that goes to school districts. Children won't have access to head start programs, food stamps may be disrupted. And all of that depends on the shutdown's length. Food banks won't be able to place new orders. Major research programs involving everything, from cancer to the environment, will pause. That's a lot. And it's a lot to discuss with our next guest, Republican Congressman Cory Mills of Florida, who is in the thick of it right now over on Capitol Hill. First of all, Congressman, thank you for being here, but can you give us a sense now, 24 hours almost away from this shutdown, what's the path out of this to avoid a shutdown? What are you hearing from your leadership about what we might see in the next 24 hours? REP. CORY MILLS (R-FL):  Well, first, let me just go ahead and comment on some of these items that you're talking about were shut down. Social Security payments do not stop. Medicare and Medicaid does not stop. V.A. benefits do not stop. Post offices do not stop. Our military is paid on the 30th, which means that we do have time to get our 12 appropriation bills across within the actual specified timeline. So, there are actual things that are being moved. And I'm flabbergasted that we're continuing to try and talk about what we need to do to try and cut our way to prosperity when the reality is that we need to come up with an actual economic growth strategy that gets our GDP to national debt ratio under control. Look, simple math, we have to spend less and make more. And we don't have a plan for that, haven't. And our $33 trillion has been driven not under just Democrat and Republican, but both alike as leadership. So, it's killing our middle class and that's why we have to get a grip on it.",
