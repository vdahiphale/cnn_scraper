This time last year when she attended the Munich Security Conference just days before the Russian invasion, that was also touted as her most consequential foreign trip and I think this one trumps it a year into a war which shows no sign of ending. The official White House statement says that the purpose is to demonstrations resolve, U.S. global leadership and enduring commitment to support Ukraine.I think it is clear that the relationship is increasingly important. Germany unwilling to consider sending its own Leopard tanks until the U.S. had also pledged its tanks shows that the U.S. role in the provision of military aid is still critical and still by far the largest donor to Ukraine. So, Kamala Harris will be looking to coalesce that support for Ukraine even as the costs mount. We've heard from NATO saying that Ukraine is burning through ammunition faster than it can be produced by NATO allies. So now is the time to firm up that commitment and this is a major show of force really from the United States ahead of the anniversary of that invasion. We have Kamala Harris in Munich, we have the U.S. defense secretary in Estonia. And, of course, President Biden set to travel to Poland on Monday, Christine.
