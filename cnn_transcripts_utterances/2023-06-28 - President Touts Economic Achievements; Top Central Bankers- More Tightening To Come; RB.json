Well, they were up yesterday, it was solid, and now they're down, but not hugely. It's a sort of, I think, just what is going on type of session, and we will talk about what's going on with the main events. The US president makes his economic pitch to a skeptical nation. On this program, in a moment, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers is here. We'll talk Bidenomics in a moment. NATO is shoring up its eastern flank after the turmoil in Russia. You'll hear from the Lithuanian foreign minister on this program. And the president of Restaurant Brand, Burger King and the like, the company's sandwich chain has chosen Switzerland its first part of an international market and we'll assess inflation and labor costs, and how that is taking a bite out of profits. We are live in New York, midweek, Wednesday, June 28th. I'm Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. The word Bidenomics, it is an offensive word to Republicans, and is used as a term of abuse. But now, President Biden is embracing Bidenomics and using it to his advantage to woo voters. He was in Chicago where he defined his economic agenda as much by what it isn't and what it's not. It's not Reaganomics, he said. Trickle down policies have failed America for decades, and his focus is on the middle class to produce results. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As you've mentioned, Bidenomics, building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, stark contrast to trickle down or top-down economics where you give rich people tax cuts and hope against decades of evidence to the contrary, that it is somehow going to uplift the middle class. It doesn't work that way. Bidenomics in action through the pillars the president mentioned investing in America, empowering and educating workers, promoting more competition truly is helping. Now, you mentioned inflation. Inflation is down by more than half. It peaked at over nine percent about a year ago and it has fallen 11 months in a row. That's certainly a strong trend in the right direction, but we have to do more to build on that success to get prices down lower to get inflation down lower.",

You know as well as I do that historically, economies across the globe had been brought to their knees when the independence of the Central Bank is compromised. The prior administration was much less scrupulous about that than we are. Now look, I think what matters here from our perspective is doing all we can to help lower costs. I mentioned promoting more competition as pillar three of Bidenomics. Well, that does directly mean lowering costs. Lowering costs for prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to compete. You know, a lot of people went up against Big Pharma to win that fight, but President Biden won it. Lowering the cost of insulin, lowering the cost of clean energy, getting rid of junk fees and overdraft fees.

Now, not only is the public investment pillar one of Bidenomics, I told you about investing in America, it is crowding in private investment. This is another way in which trickle down had it backwards. They thought if they did less public investment, they'd get more private investment. What the president said today is they had that backwards. That is if we do smart public investment, we crowd in private investment, which we have done to the tune of almost $500 billion in the manufacturing sector.",

I mean, I hear so many people talking about personal vibes or looking at whatever animal entrails they're looking at to declare recession. In fact, a recession means something technical. It's a set of variables that the National Bureau of Economic Research designates, and if you look at those variables, where they are in real time, they are all pretty clearly flashing non-recessionary. So we have an economy that certainly doesn't look anything like it is in a recession, but more importantly, when you have a strong consumer, a strong labor market, when you have Bidenomics, building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, our investment agenda, empowering workers, promoting competition, I like where that momentum can take us.",

Listen, all of the central bank governors, the Fed the ECB and the BoE, they were all asked the same questions: When is inflation going to hit two percent? When will the rate hike cycle? And they all managed to dodge it beautifully saying they're looking for the evidence. But from Powell, he said, well, policy is restrictive. It might not be restrictive enough, and it hasn't been restrictive for long enough. He says just because they paused rate hikes in June, don't take your eye off the ball, it could happen two consecutive months again.

Some people see development or strategy from a top-downstrategy and some see it from a bottom-up strategy, but I will say it's a combination. You need to get your people in your community involved, because they are one of the main factors and the other one of the main beneficiaries of this development. Once they understand the blue economy, they understand the contribution of the blue economy in their life, the contribution of the ocean in their life, this is when they will participate actively in the development.

European intelligence officials are telling us that Russian security forces and potentially the military might have had some prior knowledge of the Wagner rebellion this weekend and could even have welcomed it. As for Wagner itself, Belarus has issued an invitation to set up their tents. That's a prospect not welcomed by neighboring European countries.
