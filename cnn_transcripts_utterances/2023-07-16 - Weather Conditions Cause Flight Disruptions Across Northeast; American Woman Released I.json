Right now, a travel nightmare across the Northeast as major airports issue ground stops because of severe storms moving through the area. More than a thousand flights have been canceled so far today, and thousands more have been delayed. Let's go straight to CNN's Polo Sandoval live for us in New York. What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "And I hate to be the one to say, too, Fred, but it is bound to get worse, especially when you look at what the National Weather Service is currently saying in terms of what is expected in the coming hour or two.In fact, all you have to do is look at the radar to see a large presence of rainfall slowly making its way to the northeast, and that's why weather officials have issued a flash flood warning in effect for at least the next hour, it certainly wouldn't be surprising if there is any sort of modification there in terms of an extension. The thing here though, is that that has potential to affect at least five million people in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tristate area. This is why officials are essentially trying to get us up ahead by issuing that warning. I can tell you from our perspective here in Manhattan, except for a small drizzle, you wouldn't really know it. But again, just looking at that radar shows that large weather presence that's making its way here and also a reminder that these warnings are being issued after what was a deadly last 24 hours in Pennsylvania where at least four people have been confirmed dead in floodwaters. The concern at least for now is that the situation will certainly get worse. So there is the human toll, but also just the logistical nightmarish travel that is certainly going to be in store for many people. When you look at the rate of flight cancellations and delays at major American airports, that's certainly going to add up for some -- for some further trouble. So this is certainly going to be something to continue to monitor in the coming hours. Of course, our weather experts can be tracking this as well as this large weather system continues to set its sights on the New York, New Jersey areas as far as Philadelphia potentially affecting at least five million Americans -- Fred.",

Wear protective clothing, wear a hat, always wear shoes, and don't just trust socks, and be very careful when you touch anything.

Among them, a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan, who had already traveled hundreds of miles just to risk the boat crossing from Libya. CNN's Anna Coren follows his journey and the desperation that drove him to risk everything for a better life. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The lush plains of Gujarat in Punjab Province are home to some of the most fertile land in all of Pakistan. he mighty Indus River and its tributaries, the lifeblood. But not everyone here prospers from its richness. Fourteen-year-old Mohammed Abuzza (ph) felt the heavy burden of responsibility. His father, a school van driver earning less than $90.00 a month, was struggling to provide for the family. Abuzza (ph) worried about the future of his younger brothers, especially six-year-old Hassan (ph), who is severely disabled. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) COREN (voice over): \"My son pleaded with me to be sent abroad,\" he explains. He said, \"Look at how we live. We'll die of hunger. It's best for me to leave so I can support our family.\" Many older boys from the village had already made the trek to Europe through human smuggling operations, sending hefty remittances back home. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) COREN (voice over): Abuzza's (ph) uncle had decided to go, and the teenager knew this was his chance. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) COREN (voice over): \"The people smuggler said it would cost more than $8,000.00 to send my son to Italy. I said, I can't afford it. He told me, Your kid will earn that in a couple of months.\" At the beginning of May this year, Abuzza (ph), his uncle, and a small group of teenage boys from the village set off. Human smugglers organized for the group to fly from Karachi to Dubai, then to Egypt before transiting to Libya. From Tripoli International Airport, they drove to the Libyan port city of Tobruk and waited in a cab filled with other illegal migrants for the next month. The day before the group set sail for Italy, their final destination, Abuzza (ph) sent a video to his brothers, hoping to make them laugh. He then recorded the group's final prayers. That night, he called his father. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) COREN (voice over): \"My son was really happy. He said, 'Don't worry, Dad. It will be okay. We'll have lifejackets. It's a big boat. Once I'm there, you'll have nothing to worry about.\" On the 9th of June, Abuzza (ph) boarded the Adriana, a fishing vessel with a capacity of 100. Instead, 750 illegal migrants were crammed aboard, of which almost half were from Pakistan, according to the Pakistani Interior Ministry. Within days, the trawler would capsize off the coast of Greece, as a Greek coast guard ship watched on. More than 600 people drowned, in what would become one of the deadliest migrant boat tragedies. Among the survivors, only 12 Pakistanis. Abuzza (ph) was not one of them. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) COREN (voice over): \"Dying of hunger is better than this. Don't send your children away. For us, life and hell are now the same.\" But this grieving father's warning is falling on deaf ears. According to UN Migration, last year Pakistanis weren't even among the top ten nationalities arriving in Europe. This year, however, they're ranked number five, with economic migration fueling the surge. A financial crisis in Pakistan and record-high unemployment is driving many families to make these life-altering decisions.",
