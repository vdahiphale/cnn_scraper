But with so many Americans buying into Donald Trump's election lies, it's going to be tougher than ever. According to one analysis, since 2020, 35 local officials have refused or threatened to refuse to certify their election results.So what exactly are state officials doing to safeguard this election? CNN's Sara Murray is here to explain as part of our regular check in about election threats, which is getting even more important because we're getting even closer.",

And, you know, I think that one of the big changes this time around is we have so many more elections skeptics who are going to be a part of this process in a way that they weren't necessarily in previous presidential elections.And so when you look across the battleground states, whether it's Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, you see these instances where there were officials who refused to certify the results and believed in some cases there was voter fraud, problems with the machine, that kind of thing. And our colleague, Fredreka Schouten, has some really interesting examples of that in our digital story on CNN.com. And I think that what election officials are doing is they're trying to be really aggressive to head off these threats this time around. So that means going to judges in their communities and explaining if you have an election challenge like this, we need you to take it up quickly. We need to be decided quickly. We have deadlines where we need to certify local results, state results where it needs to go on to Congress. So we need fast movement. And also honestly warning these local election officials that they have a duty to certify these results. And that if they fail to do so in many of these cases, state officials are going to take them to court. They're going to sue them. They're going to potentially face criminal charges. And so they're trying to be very aggressive in getting that message out ahead of voting.",

Jasmine, I want to start with you, and I want to read a quote from your story, and this is a Democratic strategist, Stacy Pearson, who told you, \"The enthusiasm is as high as it could possibly be for Harris, but there is a numbers problem in Arizona. There is just a mathematical complication in Arizona that other states don't have. None of the other swing states have lost Dems the way Arizona has.\" Which is really interesting.

And that is why we see the Harris campaign reaching out to Republicans, are reaching out to Independents, not because it's a virtuous thing, but because in Arizona.It is a necessity, particularly because we know 100,000 registered Democrats have left the state since 2020, which puts Democrats at a deficit, not just with Republicans by over 200,000 registered voters, but for the first time since 2020, also with Independents. Meaning that they have to get their numbers from somewhere. Now, to be very clear, 140,000 Republicans voted for Nikki Haley after it was very clear that she was not going to win the Republican primary, right? That kind of gives the Harris campaign and folks who are aligned with Democrats hope because it provides a new pool of potential Republican voters who are kind of created in the image of John McCain. But they're very clear that not all those 140,000 Republicans are going to vote for a Democrat. And that is kind of the uphill climb that they have in the state.",

It's called, it's to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution.There were some 800,000 signatures from all over the state collected. 500,000 were accepted. In that number, though, there are some Trump supporters, and we found one, Candy Purdue. She believes a woman should have the right to choose. She supports that and voting for Donald Trump. So, the question, abortion is literally on the ballot. Immigration, there's a measure there as well. But the Harris campaign knows that not all the supporters for the abortion measure support them.

And for every Candy voter, there may also be a voter like Crystal Price (ph), which was a woman that I spoke to. She was a Trump voter in 2020. She's voting for more abortion access and she's going to vote for Kamala Harris. So this is one of those voters where abortion was so important to her. She had an abortion pre-Dobbs years ago. And she's really concerned that women are now going to be facing a landscape where they wouldn't even be able to have an abortion like her, which was medically necessary because she thinks that she would have died if she had not had that abortion. And, you know, it's not necessarily something that totally aligns fully with her faith. She doesn't agree with abortion in a lot of circumstances, but it's something that is clearly compelling her to support Harris.

And Kari Lake opened up her debate with Ruben Gallego, the Democrat, saying it's country over party. That's pretty new for her. That she was betting more on the Trump base carrying her, and it's clear. Trump has some appeal, and this has been true when Biden was leading the ticket, especially when he was leading the ticket, that doesn't stretch down to other Republicans. So there are some Republicans running behind Trump with that same messaging. And a lot of them, they were on the record for very strict abortion policies just two years ago, and they're struggling to update, just saying, vote your own way on the abortion issue, don't consider it in my race.",
