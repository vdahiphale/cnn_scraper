The former president is now the president-elect after coloring in the blue wall MAGA red.This is special live coverage CNN election morning in America, and we are still counting votes in some places, but the Electoral College math is certain. Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. He has 276 electoral votes, that's as of now, and it's almost certain to grow as we get closer to projecting, you know, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada. The popular vote, too, is tilting toward Donald Trump, and that would be the first time since 2004 that a Republican president-elect would come out ahead in the popular vote nationwide. The math really leaves no doubt the country is saying it trusts Donald Trump to lead and to lead on a range of issues for the next four years. Now, we have yet to see Vice President Kamala Harris yet today, but we do expect to see her at some point. And when we do, we will find out if she has called the former president to concede. The new Trump era will begin with Republican control of the Senate. That much is certain. What is not yet known if the Republicans will maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Let's get right over to Phil Mattingly at the Magic Wall. You've been manning it for hours and hours, and we've been trying to process what happened and how it happened. So much focus on these swing states, the key battleground states. And you've had a chance to really dig in and see how and where. Things went Donald Trump's way.",

Here's the interesting thing. We've spent a lot of time talking about the seven battleground states and the places where Harris underperformed, where Democrats need to run up vote, and where Trump overperformed and kind of his critical strongholds.There were also a ton of counties across the country that were very close in 2020. In fact, I want to pull them up right now. And just to give you a sense of what happened in terms of Donald Trump's strength with close narrow margins that he ended up pulling out. Now, again, this is full county, this is all 3,000 plus counties in the United States of America. So, the counties may look small. But every county you see highlighted red or blue, those are counties that were decided by two points or less in 2020. You see about three in Michigan, two in Wisconsin, two in Pennsylvania, a handful in Georgia, in North Carolina as well. But across the country, what is the consistent color of all of the counties with the exception of two? Red. In the closest counties from 2020, separated by two points or less, Donald Trump won the vast majority of them. They broke his way. Not only was he able to run up margins in his stronghold counties and cut into Kamala Harris's margins and her stronghold counties, he was also able to pull out the closest counties back in 2020 and win them on a very, very consistent basis.",

In the close battleground counties, the counties that were decided by a few counties that had gone Obama to Trump to Biden, he brought them back.And that's where I want to talk about Pennsylvania, dig a little bit deeper into here. Two of the counties that President Barack Obama won, that Donald Trump won in 2016, that Joe Biden won back in 2020, well, one of them is Erie, kind of a bellwether county back in 2020. Joe Biden was able to narrowly, and very narrowly, win this. Back in 2016, Donald Trump was able to win this, kind of working class, blue collar. It's got some urban, elements of it, but mostly manufacturing, or former manufacturing, Trump able to win it back and actually add to the margin from where he was beforehand. Most importantly though, and this is what I was kind of digging into back in the office, is we talk constantly about where Vice President Harris underperformed Joe Biden in 2020. [09:05:07] Let's talk about where Trump overperformed. what he did in 2020. And right here is wild. These are counties that Trump was expected to win, and it starts right down here in York County. Donald Trump, 62 percent, Kamala Harris, 36.5 percent. This is a county Trump was expected to win. He won it by about a half point to a point more than he did in 2020. What about Lancaster County? 57 percent to 41 percent. What was 2020? Bumping up the margin a little bit. What about Berks County? 53 percent to 45 percent in 2020. What did he do in 2024? Bumping it up by a point, a point and a half. What about Schuylkill County? 70.6 percent to 28 percent. In 2020, he's at the 69 percent. And I can keep doing this and I will as long as you let me. But every single one of these, this was 2020 in Carbon County, 32-point lead for Donald Trump, bumping it up a little bit. And I think throughout the course of this kind of blue collar area that Joe Biden was able to chip away at Donald Trump's margins from 2016, Trump rested them back with a level of consistency that made it clear this wasn't just about Philadelphia. It wasn't just about the collar counties not exceeding their 2020 gains. This was about Donald Trump securing his strongholds and then doing better in some cases than he did even in 2020, John.",

So, a group that flipped in, of course, the all important battleground.We kept saying Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. It was one in the center of the electorate by Donald Trump, but it's also the disenchanted voters. Those who did not vote back in 2020, look at this. Donald Trump here. winning among them by seven points. That's some young voters. There's some older voters who decided, hey, you know what? I didn't vote last time around. I am going to vote this time around. Those disenchanted voters came out and supported Donald Trump by as high single digits. Then finally, how about we jump over to Wisconsin, which was the state that, of course, put Donald Trump over the top in the Electoral College. I remember that call that you made earlier on this morning. It was hours ago, but I still remember, it did not like either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Look at that margin, Mr. Berman, my goodness gracious, 67 minus 22, that's a 45-point margin. That was the key group. We always talk about the double haters. We talked about them in 2016. They weren't as big of an issue in 2020. But in this particular election cycle in which there was a majority of folks who didn't like Kamala Harris and a separate majority who didn't like Donald Trump, this neither group was the key group and it helped put Donald Trump over the top in the pivotal battleground state. of Wisconsin and gave him the presidency.",

The House, I think it may stay Republican but it's going to be very narrow. And we're going to have to work together for Trump's agenda to move forward, for that mandate to move forward.Yes, he's going to get his cabinet through as he should. But at the end of the day, we have to work together to try and solve these problems. And that's where the real call is going to come in terms of being able to actually deliver on the many things that he called for. So, yes, we're going to have give and take a little bit. But at the end of the day, we know that these issues have to be solved and we, we know, too, that there's going to be an election only two years away. We're all glad that this one is over.

It's please get the world under control. That's the mandate.

We're a center right country, and we want people with central right philosophical ideals to govern. And so to Scott's point, the mandate is to accomplish those things, figure out a way to address cost and the economy, figure out a way to address immigration so that most men who don't have college degrees aren't competing against illegal immigrants for jobs that they once didn't have to compete for 10, 15 years ago.
