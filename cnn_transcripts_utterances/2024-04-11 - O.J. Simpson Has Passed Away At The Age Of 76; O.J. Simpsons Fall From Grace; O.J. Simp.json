It was a very tempestuous time here in the city where you had the Rodney King beating in 91, and right after that, the acquittal of all four of the officers. And that led to the Los Angeles riots. And then shortly thereafter, a couple years later, then you have O.J. Simpson's trial and then his acquittal. So while a lot of black people didn't really care about O.J. Simpson in particular, they were happy to see that the trial, that this justice system could sometimes work in their favor. So you saw some cheering at that time. But it's also worth noting some of the people who've spoken out about O.J.'s Simpson's passing, including who was known as the most famous house guest ever, Kato Kaelin, who at the time of the murders was staying at a house guest in O.J. Simpsons home. He has put out a statement. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATO KAELIN; AMERICAN ACTOR AND RADIO TELEVISION PERSONALITY: I've been asked to comment on the death of O.J. Simpson. Foremost, I'd like to express my condolences to the children, to Sidney and to Justin, to Jason and Arnelle. They lost their father, and that is never easy. I wish to express my love and compassion to the Goldmans, to Fred and to Kim. I hope you find closure. And finally, to the family of the beautiful Nicole Brown Simpson. May we always cherish her memories. Nicole was a beacon of light that burned bright. May we never forget her. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then in 95, I started in a broadcasting career, which included radio. So this was the big thing to be covered as the trial started going from January or I'm sorry, November of 94 and October of 95.

Well, O.J., the letter that you wrote to Robert Kardashian that was read by the police officials when they declared you a fugitive of justice, who writes a letter like that, seemingly a suicide note, if they're an innocent man with the kind of wherewithal that you have to defend yourself and the standing you have, good standing with the American public prior to this? And what are you doing with a gun to your head in the back of the Bronco if, in fact, you're an innocent man?These things don't add up. And whatever his response to that was, it would have been what it was. And then I would have done in my own way, I guess I would have tried to do what Tom Langmeier, who I thought was heroic in his role as a policeman. You played the audio earlier on CNN, in the way he calmly and compassionately tried to talk O.J. out of doing what he apparently was on the verge of doing, which was killing himself. I would have had to kind of try to do the same thing. So, O.J., whatever it is, you'll have a chance to mount a defense, put the gun down, think of your family.

You know, whatever the outcome of the case was, what you think about what it does to his legacy, because as he was saying to Bob there, kind of, you know, I would have wanted you basically to speak positively of me, maybe sort of lacking some awareness of what something like this does to someone's legacy, even if they built such an amazing one in sports.",

Well he never showed up and the lieutenant in charge of press relations, Gascon, told the press that O.J. Simpson was in the wind. And it took me a moment to like underst-like in the wind like and I asked again and he said yeah the guy's a fugitive and we're looking for him. So literally every police officer and federal agent in California and maybe even the country were now looking for O.J. Simpson as well as every reporter. So I turned to my crew, we had our helicopter in downtown LA and I said we're going to go find him. So once we were in the helicopter the discussion moved to you know, where would somebody, a malignant narcissist ,where would that person go. And I thought he would go to the grave site of his ex-wife and I flew down there.It was about a 20 minute flight, normally it takes about an hour and a half by car. And I went over to the grave site and he wasn't there. There was an undercover unit there so they had pretty much the same idea. Then I got a phone call in the air from our assignment editor Mary Helen Campos who told me that they were listening to some FBI frequencies. I tuned in and sure enough O.J. Simpson was spotted at the El Toro Y which was literally right below me so I looked through the helicopter chin bubble and there was a white bronco. And to confirm that it was O.J., a sheriff's unit pulled up, another sheriff's unit pulled up, another and another and the vehicle didn't pull over and we had our man. And so with the flip of the switch we had almost 100 million viewers around the country and parts of the world watching this infamous slow speed pursuit. This surreal spectacle on television.",
