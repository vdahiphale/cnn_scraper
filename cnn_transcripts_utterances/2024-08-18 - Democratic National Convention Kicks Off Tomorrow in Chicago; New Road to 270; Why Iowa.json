Tomorrow night, the former candidate, President Biden, will give a keynote speech finalizing the transition to the new candidate and presumed nominee, Vice President Harris.She is heading here from Pittsburgh tonight after spending the afternoon on a bus tour with running mate Tim Walz through some of the surrounding towns west of the city. The two visited with firefighters and a fire dog in one locality, reporters traveling with them, so they brought baked goods. They also went to a campaign office not far from there talking to staffers and working the phones, and later to convenience store. She goes into the convention with a batch of new polling to point to. In one, from \"The Washington Post\" and ABC News, she's now just outside the margin of error leading the former president in a multi- candidate race. CBS's new polling shows no clear leader with Robert Kennedy Jr. in the mix but has her also ahead and beyond the margin of error in a two-way matchup. Our CNN Poll of Polls still shows no clear leader, but a two-point gain for the vice president over the last two weeks. She was asked about her apparent polling momentum before leaving Pittsburgh tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's going to be speaking on the second night of the convention. also filling in some of those blanks about who Kamala Harris is. Yes, she's the vice president. She's well-known somewhat among Democrats, but not to the country as a whole. So I'm told that that is what they're going to try and use this week to do.

There weren't a lot of, you know, entrees to independents and to moderates who are watching. Democrats I don't expect are going to make that same mistake. She says she's the underdog. She has everyone who's been on a Democratic ticket before. She's got Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama saying there is room for anyone here. If you're more of a Bill Clinton Democrat, don't worry, I'm not too far out of the mainstream. You can be with me.

Look how close this was, look how close this was. 49.9 to 48.6. So what the Democrats believe is if you take Trump and then you take Robinson and then you'd go here and here and you try to improve your standing in the suburbs, right?You try to improve your standing in the suburbs by saying they are so extreme. Now, Biden did pretty well in the suburbs last time. But if you just come into the Raleigh-Durham area here and you bring it out, come on for me. There you go. You know, 62 percent. That's pretty good. Move over to Durham, 80 percent there. So the question is, can you boost those numbers where the Democrats are just a little bit more because the state is so close.
