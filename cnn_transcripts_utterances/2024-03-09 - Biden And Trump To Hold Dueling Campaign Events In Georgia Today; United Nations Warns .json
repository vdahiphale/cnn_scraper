Fresh off, his State of the Union address. President Biden is now on his way to the battleground state of Georgia. And that's exactly where a presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump will be today. Their dueling campaign events will be happening in just a few hours. Biden is holding an event in Atlanta, and Trump is holding a rally in Rome. That's located in the northwest part of the state. Now, Georgia is a key battleground state that Biden won in 2020 by less than a percentage point and is the only swing state among primary contests happening on Tuesday. We do have a team of correspondents covering today's dueling campaign events. Steve Contorno is with the Trump campaign. But let's actually begin with Camila DeChalus. She is in Wilmington, Delaware. That's where the President is about to head to Georgia. Camila, good to see you. So, what can we expect what messages do we think Biden is trying to highlight in this first campaign swing after the State of the Union? CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Biden really wants to convey to voters some of the big things he's done while he's been in office. He wants to talk about how he's created thousands of jobs in the U.S., how he's tried to lower the high cost of prescription drugs, and how he's invested in public safety. Those are some of the things that he wants to highlight. But he also wants to lay out some of the things he wants to do if he gets reelected for a second term. Now, another thing you're going to see Biden talk about is his former predecessor, and just really stressed what's at stake in this next upcoming election cycle. And he is going to talk about Trump. He did that yesterday. He mentioned him about eight times when he gave a speech in Philadelphia, and he's going to talk about how he thinks that Trump poses a threat to democracy and how Biden himself -- how he's better suited to be reelected for a second term.",

This is a very conservative part of the state. It's represented in Congress by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who of course, is coming off of those clashes during the State of the Union address with Joe Biden. She will be here at this rally today which the Biden campaign criticize.

Air drops, which, you know, have been one way of getting aid in, but we've seen how difficult and frankly dangerous they are. Yesterday, five civilians were killed when the parachute for one of those airdrops did not inflate correctly, and five people on the ground were killed. So, it's a dire situation. And what's interesting on the ground in Israel, is that people are divided about the best way to respond to the situation in Gaza with regards to the humanitarian catastrophe with regards to the hunger crisis, which is growing worse by the day. And we actually spent the day with a group of protesters who for six weeks now have been doing everything in their power to stop aid from getting into Gaza. Take a look at what we found. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice over): They march with determination to the Kerem Shalom border as they have for six weeks. Their mission, to block international aid from crossing into Gaza. The border police are waiting for them. There is a danger of sniper fire and projectiles, the officer warns. I ask you to leave this place.

They've been trying to push these protesters away for hours now, and still, they are not leaving.WARD (voice over): The crowd on this day is small, but their sentiment is shared by the majority of people in the country. A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 68 percent of Jewish Israelis oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza. On the other side of the border, the situation could not be more dire. 7-year-old Fadi Alsant (PH) is suffering from severe dehydration and malnutrition. Doctors at the Kamal Adwan Hospital say they don't have the resources to properly treat him. Fadi's mother says she's already lost two children. She doesn't want to lose him. According to Gaza's health authorities, at least 17 children have died of dehydration and malnutrition already. And with the U.N. warning that famine is just a step away, there is hardly room for debate. More aid needs to get to more people as quickly as possible. (END VIDEOTAPE) WARD (on camera): And I should add, Rahel, that since our piece was first published, Gaza's health authorities have updated the death toll. They say that there are now 23 children who have died inside Gaza as a result of acute malnutrition and dehydration. And the fear is that this is going to continue to get worse, unless something is done to get more aid in more quickly. We have heard from the Biden administration. They are planning this ambitious project to bring in aid by sea to build this pier. That could take 30 to 60 days. And humanitarian aid workers are saying really, that is too long. That is a distraction from the real issue, which is another crossing needs to be opened up in the north, which is the hardest hit, the most isolated, the most desperate situation. And so far, though, there hasn't been any consensus reached with the Israeli government about opening up some kind of a corridor from the north of Gaza too, Rahel.",

To the more pictures we see of starving children in Gaza, the more pressure will be exerted on the Biden administration and other countries to do something to alleviate the situation, the food shortages in Gaza. So, the Biden administration is responding to this. They find the Israelis to be, frankly, intransigent in this particular regard. And they are trying to work their way through this, where they keep Israel as an ally, but they also do things that will help to protect the local population in Gaza.

And in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, which is what the Biden administration has talked about now, and that is something that I think would be very necessary for humanitarian aid to get in there. But you know, as Clarissa pointed out in her report, it really becomes necessary to not only have this new sea corridor open up with this appear that is supposed to be developed on Gaza's coastline. But it's also important to open up a land crossing, another land crossing, that gets aid in there, because right now, time is of the essence and I -- the Israeli military operations that could happen in the period before Ramadan, that those would be, I think, really counterproductive on many, many different levels.",

But the one that is perhaps the most notable and perhaps the most visible will be the one that you just mentioned will be the increase, the addition of 1,000 more personnel, including not just National Guard members, but also state troopers. You see a couple of those states here at this particular transit stop here. This is certainly going to be one of the steps that the governor is taking. Now, keeping in mind, that last February, New York Mayor Eric Adams did actually implement a program that increased NYPD officers that led to a roughly 50 percent decrease in transit crime. So, there is a decrease, but there have been more notable or at least more publicized also violent incidents. And because of that, one of the big challenges for New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and, of course, local officials is actually combating the perception that the situation may be not so safe on New York City subway systems.

The only calls that are not monitored are those that would be privileged between an attorney and a client, or between a clergyman and Mr. Crumbley. So where these threats were directed, we don't know. But it was severe enough to rescind his privileges, and to limit his communications. So that leads me to believe that they were significant. And that's why the jail took that that extreme measure.",

That's what the statute requires to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. So it's looking at the timeframe before Ethan committed this horrible and terrible act. And looking at what the parents and in this case, James Crumbley, knew or should have known, based on Ethan's conduct.So he said Ethan seemed fine, but I think there's something else in there that really triggered my mind when I was listening to the testimony. It's that James drove Ethan to school that morning, and we know Ethan had that gun with him. So I think that's something the jury is going to pay attention to. But there's a reason that this testimony is coming out. It does speak to foreseeability. And that's the entire argument whether or not they knew Ethan had the propensity to commit such a violent act.",

The families of the victims are furious after an independent investigator found that local police committed no wrongdoing for the 2022 school shooting, despite officers waiting, of course, more than an hour to confront the shooter.

Can you imagine being the parents of one of these victims and sitting there and hearing that?But let's talk about what the report is. The report is a independent investigative report that was brought in by the city, the city executives and city officials for the purposes of litigation. So this is an independent investigator who comes in and does an analysis and create this report that will at some point, be used at trial. There's multiple civil litigations going on, there's multiple, the criminal inquiry is still open. There's no charges yet, but it's still open. So all of that being said that -- what this report really means is that it could be evidence at a trial, it's not dispositive. And by the way, it's at odds with a 600-page DOJ report, which identified significant problems, including what was called cascading failures by the police department. So what happens in the end is these are two competing pieces of evidence in trial. It's more significant, though, for the purposes of terminations of officers that were involved that day. There's 25 officers, none of them were terminated. This report will likely be used to keep them employed. A lot of issues going on to report to me, disturbing, but not as meaningful in a courtroom.",

And there's a lot of fear, both within Haiti and certainly at the State Department that the gangs could end up taking and occupying a symbolic place like the National Palace, or the airport in Port-au-Prince, which has also been under siege, and that would really epitomize Hades total collapse at that point, if you had a symbolic place like that taken.
