Whether the billionaire Sackler family can be shielded from additional opioid-related lawsuits.Their company, Purdue Pharmaceuticals, agreed to a multibillion-dollar settlement that would pay victims of the opioid epidemic. However, the Sacklers insist on immunity from future litigation as a condition of this agreement. Now, a New York court approved the settlement. But the Justice Department branch in charge, known as the U.S. Trustee, is fighting it. Partly, because it keeps individual victims from pursuing their own lawsuits in the future. CNN's Paula Reid has been listening to the oral arguments this morning. So, Paula, explain the two sides here because many that were victimized by the opioid epidemic may lose out, depending on what the decision is.",

Let's take a listen to what he questioned. (BEGIN AUDIO FEED) BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: I think the problem and maybe the discontent between the opioid victims is you're inclined or you're saying, oh, if you reject this plan, there's going to be more money available down the road from the Sacklers. And I don't think you're accounting for the uncertainty of liability, first of all, the uncertainty of the indemnification insurance contribution claims and the uncertainty of recovery.

His alleged attack has been charged with attempted murder. Also, the music streaming service, Spotify, is cutting about 17 percent of its global workforce in its third round of layoffs just this year. That's 1,500 jobs. They're joining a growing list of big tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and X, that are enacting deep cuts. The CEO of Spotify says its decision to slash jobs is a direct result of economic growth slowing dramatically.

The White House telling Congress that if members do not approve more funding for Kiev, the U.S. will \"kneecap\" Ukraine on the battlefield. This is coming after President Biden requested $61 billion in aid for Ukraine back in October. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell insist that support for Ukraine funding is contingent on tightening immigration laws. In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he will soon bring legislation to the floor that ties together aid for Israel and Ukraine. CNN Max anchor and chief national security analyst, Jim Sciutto, is here with us. All right, Jim, so in this latest letter to congressional leadership, it's a pretty dire warning.

They are about to run out of key weaponry and ammunition for that weaponry. So that's an issue. And in them midst of that, Russia is planning to take advantage of that with a significantly ramped-up campaign against civilian infrastructure inside Ukraine in the coming couple of weeks to take advantage of the fact that it's wintertime and to really take out power and to make life miserable for Ukrainian civilians to weaken Ukrainian resolve in this war. Russia sees an opening here. And the administration is concerned that if that aid does not come quickly, Russia will be able to capitalize.",

Some of those trend lines don't look very good, right, for Ukraine and its allies. It's not quite frozen but those frontlines have not changed significantly.

But it says it is really not reflective of the high standard of safety in the national air space system.The bottom line here is something that we have been reporting for months. The air traffic control system simply is stretched to the limit. And controllers say they are overworked and understaffed. This was highlighted again just last week in a massive release of data from the NTSB about in a close call in Austin in February. The air traffic controller in that case said he was working an overtime shift on a six-day workweek. And in that incident, a landing FedEx flight and a departing Southwest flight came only about 100 feet away from colliding with one another. What the pilots on the FedEx flight said today, not the air traffic controller. Now air traffic control staffing is a huge issue that the FAA is scrambling to fix. And the Department of Transportation says that the FAA is 3,000 workers short. And when you factor in retirements and attrition, the workforce issue has grown only by single digits, a net gain of only six employees. And new FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker, said in an interview before this story broke that his focus has really been on getting new controllers through the FAA Training Academy. Listen.

Now it's been extended into next year. So the idea is to make so that the pressure is not so high on these controllers. And there's not too many airplanes going through a very thin funnel of air space, especially in New York and D.C. So we'll see if that works in the immediate. But the big thing right now is that they simply need to hire. And the goat is about 1,500 this year, 1,800 next year. But that does not deal with the attrition. So that's the big thing.
