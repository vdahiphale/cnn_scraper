And there actually had been an impeachment inquiry on the books released since September since Kevin McCarthy and then the Speaker of the House announced that it would move ahead, but it doesn't actually need to be a formal vote. But Republicans contended that there needed to be a vote to give them more power if they had to go to court to get records if they thought they had to fight people who are defying their subpoenas that this vote could help them push back on any of those claims that this was an illegitimate inquiry.But the reality is that they wanted to try to show that the conference was united behind the idea that impeachment investigation needed to happen. But that's not to say that members are united about charging the president with high crimes or misdemeanors. In fact, many of them who I spoke with simply said that they have not seen enough evidence or proof that shows that Joe Biden acted corruptly in any way to benefit his son, Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings. Several of them said, let's wait to see what evidence ultimately is gathered before we make the decision about charging him with the high crime or misdemeanors. Even some top Republicans indicated it is still possible that Joe Biden could get exonerated in the months ahead. REP. RICHARD HUDSON (R-NC): Well, the vote today was a search for facts, and we're going to follow the facts wherever they lead. And if they exonerate the President, then we'll make that known to the American people.",

If Donald Trump can even be tried. He was already tried by the Senate. Is that double jeopardy now that he's charged again in a Criminal Court of law? So they have to decide that. And also they have to decide a question about presidential immunity. Is Donald Trump protected from being charged with any crime for something he did while he was president, something that he may argue was part of his role as the President of the United States?Now all of this is up in the air. There's a lot of wheels turning in the courts right now. What's happening at the trial level before Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC, is Trump essentially wanted her to cancel everything, pause everything. The Justice Department said no, we're actually doing a bunch with appeals. They're going to the Supreme Court. They're trying to get an order very quickly, determining what is happening here. And what Judge Chutkan said is the trial date is still standing. It's still March 4th. But that doesn't mean that the rest of the things that are happening in this case don't have to pause while the Supreme Court determines if they want to do anything. What the appeals court above her might do. And so now, essentially all of the things that Donald Trump's lawyers would have to do to show up in court to determine, to get to trial, they're not going to have to do that right now. But there's still a gag order over Trump, and there's still bail conditions. And this case still exists, and the trial date still is in March. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

On Wednesday, he visited Iowa, where the States caucus in mid-January opens the Republican nomination calendar. He's set to attend events this week in New Hampshire and Nevada, the second and third Republican contest, respectively. Trump is looking to hold onto his lead over his Republican rivals in the polls and blunt any of their momentum less than five weeks before voting actually begins. CNN's Kristen Holmes has the latest from the campaign trail in Iowa.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump's message in Iowa to voters was clear that that it was not just about the primary and the caucuses, but this is about a general election. Attempting to use the unpopularity of President Joe Biden to galvanized voters, to bring them to the polls just five weeks out from those caucuses. Here's what he said when he went after Biden, giving a fairly, fairly clear message. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're just 33 days away from Iowa, first in the nation. I wonder how you got that. You got that because of me. First in the nation caucuses, and we're going to keep you first in the nation for a long time. You know, the Democrats bailed out. And without Trump, you wouldn't be first in the nation anymore either. But we kept you right here where you belong. You're going to be here for a long time. First in the nation. On Monday, January 15th, we're going to win the Iowa caucuses and then we're going to crush Crooked Joe Biden next November, and we're going to very simply make America great again. During this holiday season families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of \"Bidenomics.\" you know, \"Bidenomics,\" it means a lot of bad things.

They are looking at her. They are watching her. And they are watching New Hampshire very closely.

He arrived at the European Council building about half an hour ago. And before the discussions with all of the Member States kick off, he is having behind the scenes meetings with the Chancellor of Germany, with the President of France and with key players within the European Union to try and thrash out these last minute discussions about the future of Ukraine. And that is because the EU operates on a unanimity principle. So if one of the 27 Member States holds out on this decision to support Ukraine, then that means it can't go ahead.Also an interesting timing. Last night it was announced that 10 billion euros worth of frozen funds to Hungary had been unfrozen by the EU. They'd been held back because of concerns over Hungary's rule of law. So some critics in the European Parliament are saying that just looks like bribery and it's allowing Viktor Orban to be a Trojan horse for Putin and disrupt discussions about Ukraine's potential membership of the European Union. But here is what Orban had to say about that specific issue when he was entering the council building about half an hour ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It also doesn't agree with these large amounts of funding to give Ukraine economic and more lethal aid support, because that's also being discussed here, 50 billion euros for Ukraine's economy and around 20 billion euros for more lethal aid to help fight off Russia's invasion. So there's a huge amount at stake here. It will be interesting to see what the results of these discussions are, because there are absolutely no foregone conclusions. There's obviously optimism that compromises can be made, but there's real -- no real confidence that that could actually be achieved at this point. And a potential event which may or may not occur, which could have had quite a lot of import for these discussions, is whether or not President Zelenskyy would actually make a surprise visit to this European Council Summit. Obviously, he's done that in the United States. He's gone to the U.K. when he's needed support, but the chatter is here that that may have antagonized Viktor Orban and actually made it harder for the EU to come to discussions which are favorable to Ukraine's future membership and support -- Max.",

And that's really where things started.Right now you're seeing this is the sort of public questions portion of the event and the moderator -- one of the moderators, said that the main theme, the questions that they got sent in were the special military operation. But they kicked off by asking him about his reelection campaign. He just announced less than a week ago that he's going to run for a fifth term. And he said the main thing that he's looking at is the strengthening of Russia's sovereignty that that has done in part by strengthening its military readiness. He's been talking up the economy even though we know that Russia has a major problem with inflation. He alluded to that, but in general he's sort of emphasizing the positives. And he started to now take questions on the special military operation, saying that, you know, the aims are the same. To denazify, to demilitarize Ukraine, and that there won't be any peace until Russia achieves its goal. So nothing new as of yet. But as I say, this is Putin really, with the wind in his sails. Russia can see what's happening with Ukraine's allies, with the  Zelenskyy trip to Washington, which failed to push Congress into making a deal on Ukraine aid. Now real hurdles in Brussels, as Bianca was saying, over accession talks and new funding. And all of this is strengthening Russia's resolve to do what many believe, including Ukraine, that it's trying to do, which is simply to outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.",
