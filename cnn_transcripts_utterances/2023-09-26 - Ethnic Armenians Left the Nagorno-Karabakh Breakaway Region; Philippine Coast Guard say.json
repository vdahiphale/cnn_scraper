You're watching \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Bianca Nobilo.Just ahead, thousands of ethnic Armenians flee the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh amid claims of ethnic cleansing. Ukraine says it's killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet, along with dozens of other officers. And tensions in the South China Sea. The Philippines says it's removed a Chinese barrier in the contested waters. New details are emerging about a powerful and deadly explosion at a gas station in the troubled region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian authorities tell Reuters at least 20 people were killed and state media has reported more than 200 casualties. Ethnic Armenians have been lining up to get fuel as they leave the disputed enclave in Azerbaijan, which has sovereignty. There's no word yet on what caused the blast, but of course it comes at a very volatile time. Not long ago we learned the number of ethnic Armenians fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh has shot up to 13,500, according to the Armenian government, which they say has been forcibly displaced. Many of the refugees are women, children and the elderly. They're arriving in Goris, an Armenian town near the border with Azerbaijan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator): The gunfighting was everywhere, all the time, not even a five-minute break. It was going on all the time. We could not leave the basement because it was dangerous. We could die at any moment. UNKNOWN (through translator): I'll never ever come back, never in this life. Azerbaijan wouldn't even let us take the dead ones away. And a lot of them are still there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kyiv says a Friday attack on Sevastopol and Crimea has killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet and 33 other offices. It's one of the boldest attacks yet on the Russian- annexed peninsula. Now CNN cannot independently verify that Victor Sokolov was killed and Moscow would only say that one serviceman was missing as a result of the attack.Russia responded by launching drones and missiles at the Ukrainian region of Odessa for a second day today. Ukraine says port infrastructure was seriously damaged and an abandoned hotel was hit. More now from CNN's senior international correspondent Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine dismissed this as a pathetic attempt at retaliation. A Russian bombardment of the port city of Odessa with drones and long-range missiles. Two warehouse workers were killed, an abandoned hotel smashed in what could have been an almost routine attack by Russia. But for this, Kyiv now claims to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Victor Sokolov. Ukraine says it also killed another 33 Russian officers in the missile strike against the fleet headquarters in Sebastopol on Friday. The Ukrainians have targeted senior Russian officers throughout this war, often using intelligence from NATO, and specialist units have been tasked by Kyiv with these killings. They're aimed at sapping morale and undermining command systems. CNN has no independent confirmation of Ukraine's claim to have killed Russia's admiral, but it would be its biggest success in this campaign and part of an ongoing effort to break through Russia's defense lines to ultimately strike at Crimea. They've included earlier attacks on Putin's navy and a bridge to Russia itself. The first batch of U.S.-donated Abrams tanks have now also arrived in Ukraine. But they're not the strategic weapons the Ukrainians say they need. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Defense packages from the United States, including artillery, necessary shells, high-mars munitions, air defense missiles, additional air defense systems, tactical vehicles, and some other types of weapons that will prove themselves on the battlefield. KILEY (voice-over): Kyiv wants these ATACMS, long-range missile systems, to attack deep behind Russian lines, to kill more officers and destroy logistics hubs. The U.S. has yet to announce that Ukraine will get these missiles before the winter freezes over the front lines where they are. Sam Kiley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We have been seeing all of the latest military hardware and arsenal that South Korea can boast, rumbling through the heart of Seoul. So this is quite a sight to see, and they are very well aware. This will be seen by North Korea. This will be seen by the wider region. And we heard, as you say, from the South Korean president as well, directly talking about the issue of North Korea, that if there were nuclear weapons used, then the regime would cease to exist. And that would be the U.S. and South Korean alliance that would make that happen. Now, there are about 330 U.S. troops that will be involved in this parade. So it's not just about the 75th anniversary of Armed Forces Day. They also wants us to know that it's about the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea which is obviously becoming even closer since President Moon took power. So there are many messages really from the arsenal that you can see rolling through downtown Seoul behind me not just to North Korea not just to show the world what South Korea can offer, but also president Yoon said that he wanted South Korea to be the world's fourth biggest arms exporter.

There is mandatory military service. Here, so half the country goes off to this mandatory military service. The other half has brothers, partners, friends who go to military service. So it is a country that is proud of its military. And this kind of display would not be seen out of place for many people. Now, of course, there is always the possibility that there will be some kind of response from North Korea. But there's often a response from North Korea with U.S.-South Korean military drills that have been increasing in number in the past year and a half or so. And North Korea at the moment has made its allegiances clear. It is moving towards Russia, towards China. It has no interest in talking to South Korea and the United States. So certainly there wouldn't be a concern about North Korea's reaction here. In fact, everyone here has a South Korean flag. The defense ministry is giving out free flags just so that everybody can be more patriotic and more passionate as they're -- their troops are going by.

McCarthy says that he thinks he has enough votes from Republicans to make some progress this week, but right now lacks enough votes to push through a short-term bill to fund the government.CNN's Manu Raju has the details for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Congress is running out of time to avoid a government shutdown. 11:59 p.m. Eastern, Saturday night. That is the deadline to avoid a shutdown, and there is just no agreement yet about how to do just that, in large part because of divisions within the House GOP conference. The Speaker of the House tried to convince his members to all fall in line behind a Republican-only bill to keep the government open for just a few weeks, but he doesn't have the votes because he is included in this planned spending cuts the Democrats won't accept border security measures that the Democrats won't accept, but the cuts don't go far enough for some members on his far-right, which means that he doesn't have the 218 votes to get this out of his chamber. He can only afford to lose four Republicans on any party line vote. He at the moment is probably losing about seven, maybe even up to 10 members on a short-term spending bill. So what is the speaker's plan? He is still trying to pressure those same members to come on his side. This as a Senate leadership is working on a completely different plan to keep the government open with hardly any time to reconcile differences. Now I asked the Speaker about what is looming over all this. Threats from his far-right that he could lose his job as Speaker if he were to cut a deal with Democrats to keep the government open. I asked him how much that is driving his decision making over his handling of the spending talks. How much is the fact that if you do cut a deal with Democrats, there could be a vote to push you out? You're driving your decision making right now. KEVIN MCCARTHY, U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: Nothing drives my decision.

But there's talk of potentially foregoing the issue of Ukraine aid, putting that to later in the fall and just simply keeping the government open just for a few more weeks.But there's still no guarantee that Speaker McCarthy will put a Senate passed bill on the floor of the House. If he were to do that, again, he could face that same threat to push him out of the speakership. So huge questions looming over Washington. Will the government shut down? How long could a shutdown last? And how will this play politically? There are a lot of Republicans, including the speaker himself, concerned that the GOP would get the blame for this as they try to move, try to get something done, avert a crisis here in Washington.

Since the 24th of February last year, we've been documenting not only incidents of torture, but also several atrocity crimes, including what amount to more crimes, crimes of insanity and the potential genocide. My specific role is to look at how these crimes intersect with starvation as a method of warfare, and in terms of how starvation is being used, not only in torture, but also how it overlaps with the pillage of grain infrastructure, as well as the destroying, removing and rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the Ukrainian population. NOBILO: The reports as well, the tragic and ancient notion that rape has long been a weapon of war, but of the rape of women between the ages of 19 and 83. is deeply harrowing and just unconscionable. What more can you tell us about the accusations of sexual violence that the Russians have perpetrated? KHAN (on the phone): I think in the context of sexual violence, in the broader scope of my experience, dealing with, again, what amounts to war crimes and potential crimes against humanity, is that putting young men, in particular, on the front lines without perhaps proper training or incentivizing them, or dehumanizing the other, is really what leads or tends to lead to these acts.

Italian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro has spent decades on the run before being captured in January.Ben Wedeman takes a look at his crimes and explains why the mafia days of old are dying. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He reportedly quipped he had killed enough people to fill a cemetery. A macabre boast made to a fellow mafioso turned state's witness. Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro died of cancer over the weekend in a prison outside Rome, almost nine months after police finally captured him in a private health clinic in Palermo. Until then, for 30 years he had evaded capture, living under a false identity in his hometown of Castelvetrano in Western Sicily. Unmolested during all those years, thanks to Omerta, the mafia code of silence. Messina Denaro was tried in absentia and found guilty for involvement in a series of murders, including the car bombings of two anti-mafia judges in the early 1990s. Among the most grisly of those murders, when he and his fellow mobsters dissolved in acid a 12-year-old boy, the son of a mafia turncoat, in front of his own grandfather. He was the last of the old-style crime bosses, the godfathers he so admired, who bumped off those who'd gotten their way. That mafia isn't there anymore, investigative journalist Roberto Saviano told CNN earlier this year, the organization understood well that they have to kill less. The law, albeit after 30 years, eventually caught up with Messina Denaro, and now death has as well. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The police force says those allegations came after British media outlets published a joint investigation against Russell Brand. That report cited four women who accused the actor of sexual assault and at least one case of rape. Brand has denied the allegations. London police are urging anyone who's been a victim of sexual abuse, no matter how long ago, to contact them.Australian activists are challenging an offshore gas project that's not only threatening to pump deadly fossil fuel emissions into the air, but may deafen the whales that live off Australia's west coast. CNN's Anna Coren explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is seismic blasting. It's a method fossil fuel companies use to find gas and oil under the sea. Air guns launch sound waves towards the ocean floor. How long it takes them to bounce back gives an indication of the fossil fuels trapped under the sea bed. The bubbles and bangs may look harmless, but Greenpeace warns they can be deadly to marine life. RICHARD GEORGE, GREENPEACE SR. CAMPAIGNER: And they're louder than an atomic bomb. Now that's really problematic if you're a whale, because whales depend on their hearing for everything, to navigate, to find their mates, and to look for food. So a death whale is a dead whale. COREN (voice-over): The Western coast of Australia is a whale superhighway. It's also where energy giant Woodside Energy wants to blast this southern spring, searching for gas for a huge new fossil fuel project known as Scarborough.",

The Australian government continues to back the project saying it will be good for jobs and energy security. That is despite also pledging to be carbon neutral by 2050.
