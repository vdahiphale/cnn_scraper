Democrats are riding a wave of momentum right now, and it's not measured just by crowd size friends. Just three weeks ago, Donald Trump was besting President Biden in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Take a look at this.Now, new polling finds that Kamala Harris is leading Trump among likely voters in each of those battleground states. Harris, for her part, said this to donors last night about the polling. She said, whether they're up or they're down, the stakes are so high, and we can take nothing for granted in this moment. Donald Trump is fighting back against this new polling trend in a very 2016 2020 way, coming up with a wildly false attack on Harris about her rally crowds. CNN's Jeff Zeleny leads us off this hour. He's joining us now. Jeff, for Harris and any campaign really, the mission, number one, is create the momentum and then keep the momentum. For the Harris campaign, what does that mean? What does that look like now?",

That is, you know, a week that happens only once in a campaign.Now, of course, it's back to some of the basics, actually saying what she would do as president. So we are going to look for that later this week. But, look, this momentum is something that clearly, as you said, has gotten under the former president's skin. I was at that Detroit rally where he was talking about, there was no crowd. There was a crowd, a very large crowd, thousands of people were streaming out and streaming in. But look, what the Harris campaign is trying to do is not respond to every one of these sort of outrageous claims from their rival, and really try and focus their base and keep their base energized and excited. The vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, he's out fundraising all week long. Vice President Harris is back here in Washington after her swing last week. They simply are trying to keep their base energized, of course, leading into the Democratic Convention next week. But it is about policies and proposals that we are expect to hear later this week, because she really has not answered questions at all or say why. In fact, she is running for president, or what she wants to do as president in her first term of a Harris administration. So, of course, they have to put some more meat on those bones, Kate.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. Look, any hopes from Donald Trump's campaign and his allies that he would be a more diligent message, or that he would focus on policy and going after Harris' record was dashed yet again this weekend, when he pushed these false conspiracy theories about some sort of artificial intelligence -- excuse me, artificial intelligence being used to create a fake crowd at her rally in Detroit.And I also, think just maybe even more ominously, he also continued to push the idea that Democrats can only win by cheating, arguing that this is a form of cheating. I'm going to read for you just a little bit of what he said, and then I'll break it down for you, Sara. He wrote \"Has anyone noticed that Kamala cheated at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she AI-ed it and showcased a massive crowd of so-called followers, but they didn't exist.\" Now again, let's just be very clear about this. The crowds at Harris' events, including the one in Detroit, you heard Jeff just say this previously as well, are real. We have, you know, many people from different outlets have been there, including CNN. Thousands of people are showing up to her rallies. But I think it's very clear that this is getting under Donald Trump's skin. It's no secret that he has long been obsessed with crowd size. It's something that honestly has been a point of pride for him in the past years. I mean, of course, he does embellish his crowd size often, but there's no secret that he draws thousands of people to his events. And over the past, you know, Democrats have not really been able to do that, particularly when you look at Joe Biden and the crowds that he was, you know, drawing to his own events. But that has very much changed with Harris and the surging enthusiasm that we continue to see around her. And it's very much frustrating the former president. It's not just from what we're seeing publicly. I know this from my conversations with his allies and people close to him that this is really getting under his skin. Now, another quick thing I just want to point out is that, this isn't necessarily happening in a vacuum, Sara. This isn't Donald Trump just making this up on his own. Instead, he's really buying into these far right conspiracy theories online and then amplifying them. And honestly, I haven't seen this. I don't think we've really seen it to this level since the aftermath of the 2020 election, when he was pushing similar far right conspiracies online. And this is something that the Harris campaign has pushed back pretty fiercely on as well. But clearly this is something that's bothering Trump, and he continues to amplify. Sara?",

So thank you both for being with us.Matt and Scott, I want to read you what Ezra Klein wrote this morning about how the Harris team is approaching Trump may be differently here. Ezra wrote, Biden's communication strategy was designed to make Trump bigger. Harris' strategy is to make him smaller. And then Ezra Klein goes on, the result is that Trump is starved for the resource he craves most attention, as is often the case when he loses control of the headlines. He's making linear and more self destructive arguments. How do you think that describes where we are this morning, Matt?",

I mean, I think they sold out their credibility on the age issue here.There is no question that Trump's got to find a frame for this election. He had one down against Biden. He had one down against Hillary Clinton the year that he won in 2016. He is capable of it. He's got to find it here, though, because if he doesn't, it's going to be a dicey fall. It exists, the evidence there to prosecute the case exists, but it's on him. It's on his shoulders. The campaign can do what it can do, but it's really on him to find it and not get off of it.

People are still very upset about their own economic anxiety, which they believe were brought about by the policies of Biden and Harris. So all this smorgasbord of stuff exists that can be run on, none of it, none of it is what you just said. So yes, Republicans want Donald Trump to focus on what matters. And what matters is what people are upset about. 70 percent of the American people think the country is off on the wrong track, use that.

She's going to talk about the economy coming up later this week. But remember, she's only been the candidate now for a few weeks, and she's the vice president, which means she's been carrying the Biden agenda for most of that time.But the other thing to keep in mind is that, in 2016 Hillary Clinton had 295 policy proposals on her website, Donald Trump had seven. One of them was respect the police, which is not a policy proposal. So policy doesn't necessarily win elections. In 2020, the Trump campaign ordered the RNC not to have a policy platform. So I don't think Democrats need to be lectured by Republicans about being detailed in their policy proposals during a campaign. I think it's pretty clear where the vice president stands on the big issues that voters really care about, and she'll do more to talk about her vision for the future.",

When she ran for this office, she laid out a clear set of proposals that were as far outside the mainstream as you can get. Now, through anonymous press spokespeople, she claims to have repudiated all that. I'm not interested as much in white papers as I am as interested in her explaining, how can you be for defund the police here, but not here? How can you be for the most permissive border policies here, but not here? That's what most Americans need to hear.

It's part of a network of missile defense that the U.S. and its allies, and Israel have in the region to be in position to shoot down Iranian missiles and drones, and Hezbollah missiles and rockets as well.We saw that work very well in April when Iran launched that large scale attack then. And keep in mind, it's a number of players involved. It's not just the U.S. -- although the U.S., you could say, is the principal asset here, certainly Israeli missile defenses, but also allies such as Jordan. They don't like to advertise their participation, but they have missile defense systems on their territory, which worked well in April, and the hope is that they could do the same this time around. The trouble is, Sara, that Iran is wise to that and will attempt, at least, depending on their goals, to try to overwhelm that system. And we see Russia do the same in Ukraine, it's about firing a lot at the same time, even timing those attacks to when those systems reload. That's the biggest concern here.

It took a little bit of time for Ukraine to say, yes, indeed, our forces are there, and now for Russia to acknowledge it. There is no one, Sara, that I speak to who follows this war closely. On the U.S. side, European side, who saw this coming a couple of weeks ago. In fact, I was having conversations with folks on the state of the war just prior to this operation, and they consistently described it as a stalemate in the east, that bloody conflict we've seen along the eastern front for months, really years now. So this was a surprise. It was intended to be a surprise, very close hold among Ukrainian officials, and now it appears to be a success. The question is, what is the intent there? It's unlikely Ukraine intends to stay in large parts of Russian territory for a long period of time, that's just hard to defend. Do they move back and occupy some of that territory as a potential trade in any peace agreement remains to be seen. But right now, it just seems they're enjoying their success.",
