NASA scrubbing its plan to launch Boeing Starliner spacecraft today. You're seeing the aftermath live right now on your screens. Apparently, an automatic hold was triggered by the Ground Launch Sequencer. That's the computer that launches the rocket. It stopped the countdown clock with three minutes and 50 seconds left to go. NASA says it is not clear what caused that automatic hold. Space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher is live at the Kennedy Space Center for us. Also, with us, we have Colonel Chris Hadfield, astronaut and retired commander of the International Space Station. OK. So, Kristin, what's the latest? What are you learning on the ground?",

CHRIS HADFIELD (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION: Well, it's nothing new. I mean, that happened on the space shuttle, as Kristin mentioned, many, many times. That's why you have an automatic ground launch sequence or an automatic computer, because there are thousands of things that you have to check to make sure the vehicles healthy. And there is not enough people that could check them all fast enough. So, you set up an automated system, and it's you go and check, check, check. And one of them, if it's out of family, or if I've got bad data, it says, hey, by our rules, we're not safe to launch today, we got to stop the launch count until we can figure out this problem. And I think, it's not nearly what it seems for astronauts the way that Kristin was describing it, Suni and Butch have been trading for years. The training is super realistic. And today, they got closer than they have ever gotten to launch. But it's just one more day of training. I had my launches delayed. The first space shuttle launch was delayed for years and years. So, it's hard, you know, to launch a spaceship for the very first time with people on board. You want to get it right. And it would be nice if we got a launch today. But it's far nicer to make sure that we know what the problems are, and wait until we have a higher probability of success. So, yes, disappointing. But one more day in the life of two astronauts.",

None of all -- you know, all the flight controllers, all the people watching the data, they all thought, hey, everything looks ok. The computer saw something, and now, we need to figure out exactly what it saw.And it might just be like a bad sensor. But, you know, you don't have time to troubleshoot it. Part of the problem is, the world is turning. And Florida comes underneath the orbit of the space station. And so, the only time you can launch is when Florida is perfectly underneath the orbit. So, as soon as the world turns a little more, you can't go today, got to wait until the world turns once more. And maybe, in the time that the world is going to turn here, 24 hours, all the smart folks will figure out, that was what the problem was, and give it another shot tomorrow. Or on the 5th, trough the 6th. You know, it's just how it goes. It would have been great to see them launch today. It will be even greater to see them launch safely. CAMEROTA: Commander, Kristin was just explaining to us how it's complicated to get the astronauts off the rocket now, you know, you don't just open the door and they hop out. There's a whole team that has to get them off. So, what are they doing right now?",

That's sort of what -- what's you're on there.And so, before you go and have the crew climb out, you want to make sure that all of that fuel, the solid fuel and the liquid fuels, the hydrogen, the oxygen, the kerosene, that there is no chance of a stray spark or ignition or procedure getting screwed up. So, so, they want to check all those things. And you've got carefully written procedures to back out of a launch and safely extract the crew out. And, you know, they climbed in when it was fully fueled. So, it's not like there was a sudden change, but you just have to follow the procedures, and they're very methodical. There is no great hurry right now. The priority is to get the crew out safely. And the crew is like, yes, great day of training. Sorry, we disappointed everybody.

Thinly veiled message to China, which of course, the United States has accused of flouting international law, especially when it comes to freedom of navigation in the seas and in the air.Now, Secretary Austin also emphasized the importance though of military-to-military communications with the Chinese, remaining ongoing, saying that, that is what responsible nations do and there is no substitute for that kind of direct dialogue between the U.S. and their Chinese counterparts. [13:10:06] To that end, the Secretary did, in fact, meet face to face just the other day with his Chinese counterpart for the first time since 2022. And importantly, Secretary Austin reiterated to the Chinese that there are going to be consequences not only for their actions, potentially, in the South China Sea, and in the region around Taiwan, but also for their support -- and their ongoing support for Russia's defense sector and how that is fueling the war in Ukraine. Secretary Austin said that if China continues to provide that kind of support for the Russians that the U.S. and its allies will be forced to take further measures. Now, that is undoubtedly going to be on the agenda for Secretary Austin's meeting with a surprise guest here at the Shangri-La Forum, which is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who showed up earlier on Saturday night, and he is expected to meet on Sunday with Secretary Austin alongside his defense minister, Umerov. They are expected to talk about the battlefield situation in Ukraine as well as what Ukraine needs to defend itself against the Russians right now. And so, expect that meeting to be very significant, of course, for Austin, and for the Ukrainian leader, at a moment when the Chinese, of course, are here as well. And they have continued to provide very significant support for Russia's defense sector. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, in Singapore.",

And this is based upon an assessment that Hamas has been degraded to a point where it cannot conduct the kind of horrific attack that it did in October 7th, to start this whole war. And I think, the president sees a window of opportunity. And so, what he did yesterday, is he spoke publicly, in a very clear, clean, way to the Israeli people, and say, look, these are the stakes, here is an opportunity, I believe that we have a pathway forward. And he's putting the pressure on the prime minister, to continue to lean forward on negotiations. And remember, I want to add, the Israelis did propose this three-step process, and they agreed to it.

There are factions within Israeli politics. For example, Benny Gantz, he is a member of the war Cabinet, is calling for new elections and trying to get into Parliament dissolved. Prime Minister Netanyahu has to look in the mirror at this moment and decide, does he want to be on the side of long-term security for Israel?

Now, after that, we expect that the Trump team will ultimately file an appeal. Throughout the course of this case, they have been preparing for the possibility of an appeal if there was a conviction.

And is now being held responsible for that. Instead of accepting that responsibility or any kind of remorse for that, there's an attempt to turn against the jury system, one of the hallmarks of democracy. And then we go forward. After this conviction, we have indictments now for the 2020 election, when that peaceful transition of power was not agreed to, the only time in history that a president has not agreed to that. When instead, unlawful means are indicted, or at least suggested that he used in order to obstruct a position in -- in January 4th, an official proceeding, unlawful means to count the electoral votes in a different way. And it's all part of a story, really. And elections are at the center of what a democracy is. And I think that story has to be a narrative. There's competing narrative out there. And in many ways, the other side has won a competing narrative in terms of January 6th. It's not the same way it was, it seemed, in January 6th. It's been turned into a stolen election.

There's a vision of the future that you want to present that we are something that we can be even better than we are. And maybe there's a gap between where we want to be and where we are. But there's a sense of moving forward and a sense of -- I mean, that's why, even in the midst of the Depression, you have FDR as the happy warrior. It seems crazy, but he wants to project a confidence in the future, even in a really tough time. So it's a very unusual thing to be talking so badly about a country. And the question is, are people really feeling as badly as he thinks they are? I mean, we've got an economy that's better than any in the world. Yes, there are problems with inflation. Yes, there are problems with the mortgages. But it's hard to argue that we're in a terrible state economically. It's hard to argue that we're in a terrible state in so many ways.

When -- when you feel democracy in your blood, in a certain sense, when you feel it viscerally, emotionally, it's when you go in the poll and you close that curtain behind you, if they still have those curtains in some places, and you mark your ballot and millions of others are doing the same thing, and you're making that decision. You feel democracy when you see a jury trial that's worked for days and hours, put themselves forward and managed to somehow come up with a unanimous verdict. And those are the moments that I think people have to be made to feel, what is democracy? If they feel that, then I think the railing against the electoral system, the expert system in science, the expert system, and now the jury system, it's going to seem too much.

And it seemed like, what country do we have that this can happen? And yet ,the conscience of the American people was fired. We got a Civil Rights Act that changed the face of the south. We've got a Voting Rights Act that finally made voting free and fair for many black Americans. And the system worked in that sense. Yes, you had assassinations. And, yes, you had anti-war -- the anti-war movement even worked at the beginning with the McCarthy campaign, and it led to the withdrawal of Lyndon Johnson, his willingness to say that the bombing would stop. His willing to say I'm going to negotiate with the North Vietnamese. And then things got out of control. Martin Luther King died, Robert Kennedy died, and it seemed like the system was undoing itself. And that led to the violence at the Democratic convention in 1968. So we remember that last part. We've got to remember the other part, that there was a decade that was powered by individuals believing that they could change things, that they could make a difference. And when you feel that, when citizens are empowered -- and that's what I think has to happen again now. It's now up to the citizens to determine in that election what kind of an America we want and what kind of a candidate do we want? You wouldn't even have to mention the former presidents name to say, do we want a candidate for president or do we want a president who cannot accept loss with grace, who cannot acknowledge errors, who does not have resilience. Who, most importantly, is unwilling to put ambition before self. You have to put the greater good above ambition for self. That's the critical thing you need in a leader. You look at all the leaders I've studied, and all of those qualities, those emotional qualities are what we're looking for. And we have to ask, does this man, has he shown us qualities?

This is the highest punishment that was given by this jury just moments ago, saying that all of the aggravating factors in this case essentially justify the death penalty.So you mentioned the sex, the power, the money, the apocalyptic beliefs. This is a man who was convicted of killing the two children of his second wife, Tylee and J.J. It's a 16-year-old and a seven- year-old child that we're murdered by Chad Daybell, and his first wife, Tammy. And so what prosecutors here said was that the aggravating factors would include the fact that this was done for money, that this was utter disregard for human life, that this was cruel and atrocious, that he had essentially been a threat to society. And that's why the jury decided saying yes to all of these aggravating factors and saying yes to the death penalty here. Youi know, he was staring at the judge essentially the entire time. There was no reaction from Chad Daybell. This is a man who was a preacher, who spoke about his beliefs and his religious beliefs. And now he was, you know, motionless as he was told that his penalty essentially is death -- Alisyn?",

Scott Peterson was convicted in 2004 of the murder of his wife, Laci, and their unborn son. Now, in an effort to get a new trial, his legal team requested 14 pieces of evidence be retested for DNA. This week, the judge approved just one of those. It's a piece of duct tape recovered from the body of his wife at the time of her autopsy. Human DNA was found on the tape, but at the time, not enough to generate an identification. Joining me now is Beth Karas. She's a lawyer, former prosecutor, and also former Court TV reporter. Beth, great to see you. So what does all this mean?",

You know, in the past 20 years since it was tested, DNA testing, the technology, has become more sophisticated, so maybe there will be an opportunity to get a profile. But the question is, will it be Laci's profile, Scott's profile or someone else? But this one piece of duct tape is -- it was already tested, as you mentioned, and it is the only piece that the judge, of the evidence they wanted retested or tested or for the first time, that the judge found was connected enough to Laci and the crime, that it warranted further testing. But everything else was just -- it was just too speculative. And so she did not allow any other items to be tested.",
