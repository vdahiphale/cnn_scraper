And that is going to take us down a very volatile road in the middle of an election, in a country that is deeply polarized, and we're going to see justice -- Trump attacked the integrity of the electoral system in 2020.

And the other thing that I think we need to take the look at is while lots of Republicans, the majority who support elected officials, who support and to your point, Kasie, they're coming to his help right there helping him saying that this is a witch hunt, the majority of voters don't believe that this was a witch hunt and believed that these were legitimate cases.This one in particular, even as people say, its the weakest one, but it was a legitimate case being brought against the president.

Because right now, that's set to happen before the Republican National Convention. Do you think its possible we're going to see a delay, and what are the factors that the judge here is weighing in terms of deciding whether or not to send since Donald Trump to jail time?",

If there's something very specific on that day that there's just logistic with his campaign and such, I think the judge will cut him some slack.But -- and the idea that they might be put off past the convention or even later, that's just not going to happen. This judge has been very good about really trying to maintain this case on an even keel the way they normally would be done, despite who the defendant is. So I don't think that attack is going to work here. With regards the sentencing factors. The New York state sentencing is a little bit different than the federal one. The federal has this very complex scientific matrix. Wider discretion on a judge's part here, Trump's a first-time offender, not likely. He's going to send him to jail for a long time under these statutes. But the one random factor to think about is the gag order violations, which judge didn't really address during in trial. That's going to factor in, even though Trump's a first-time offender. Also, he's a first-time offender who has several other pending cases. So it's not as though here's a completely clean criminal history right now. All that's going to be factored in.",

Welcome back.We have seen reaction to former President Trump's guilty verdict from Republicans, Democrats, plenty of pundits here in the United States, but it is making headlines way past Washington. The former president appeared on the front pages of newspapers and tabloids around the world. Joining me now from London is CNN international anchor Max Foster. Max, good morning at what are we seeing in reaction? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, those papers here in the U.K., here in Europe came in quite late. [05:15:02] So the verdict was about 10:00 London time, for example. So I think the papers were pretty surprised by the scale of this verdict across the board. And so, guilty really is that overriding headline across Europe. And today, they're trying to sort of decompress it a bit more to see what it means. In terms of allied countries, countries like the UK, prime ministers, ministers, they're not really saying very much because they don't want to get involved in all of this until after the election, probably when they know who's going to be the prime minister. But there are certain countries, Italy, for example, with a very strong right wing where we have been hearing from the government. So, the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, who's seen as a right winger, said solidarity and full support for Donald Trump, victim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature. In Italy, we're sadly familiar with a weaponization of the justice system by the left. So it really depends on where you sit in terms of his narrative. If you're bought into it, like many other right-wing are your supporting Donald Trump. If you just want to get on with whoever is the U.S. president, you're probably staying quiet.",
