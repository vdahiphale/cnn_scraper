Those are live pictures. Lebanon's health ministry says that at least four people were killed and 23 wounded. And as you can see there, rescue workers in the densely populated area are still searching for survivors. Now Israel did not issue a warning before this strike and, in another attack, one building was flattened. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON (voice-over):  CNN has geolocated this video that shows an Israeli missile striking a building in Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday. As you can see, the building was completely destroyed. The Israeli military earlier issued an evacuation warning to people in the neighborhood. CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us in Abu Dhabi.

He went to Lebanon, followed by Israel, trying to see if he could hammer out the final details of this ceasefire. Now when he was in Beirut, he did say that that things were close. But it did rely really on the two parties to be agreeing. So he said, it is within our grasp now. We haven't heard an awful lot since he went to Israel. And what we have actually been seeing on the ground in northern Israel and also in Lebanon is once again an escalation of the Israeli airstrikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Now Israel says that they are targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. They say they're targeting weapons caches. And what we have seen, though, overnight is another airstrike in central Beirut. Now this is becoming more commonplace. It was certainly, up until a couple of weeks ago, quite rare for these strikes to be hitting in the center of the capital. It was more in the southern suburbs, which was a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon and also in the east of Lebanon. But you see these pictures which show the clear-up of that targeting of a building, a residential building, we're told, by Lebanese health officials, in the densely populated Basta area. Four have been killed. We understand 23 wounded, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Now the IDF did not issue an evacuation order for this particular airstrike. And we are waiting for a public comment from them for this particular strike. And it is, as I say, the latest in central Beirut, which is an escalation in itself. Also, another strike I need to mention is in the eastern part of Lebanon. This is near Baalbek. And we understand the director general of the Dar al Amal University was killed in a strike along with six of his colleagues. This coming to us as well from the ministry of health in Lebanon, calling it a treacherous Israeli aggression that targeted Dr. Alam's residence next to the hospital. [03:05:00] Now we have asked the IDF about this. They say that they are looking into the report. They haven't given a reason at this point as to why they struck that particular area. But they have been saying consistently in the past that they are targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. Now they also say that over 16,000 rockets have been fired from Lebanon into Israel over recent months -- Paula.",

Appreciate it.Now an avalanche of cabinet choices from Donald Trump have been announced as we head into the final weekend before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Among them is Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary. That's Scott Bassett. He is a stark contrast to some of his earlier, more controversial selections and Wall Street seems unfazed, with some really applauding this move. Trump has also chosen a more controversial figure from his first term to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Russell Vought is the president-elect's former budget director who oversaw a widespread push to deregulate. Now meantime Dr. Janette Nesheiwat is picked as surgeon general. That was just announced today by the former president as well. She is a family practice doctor and FOX News contributor. Now sources tell CNN that Trump's pick to lead the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, was briefly placed on air -- on air transport watch list. That was earlier this year. It appears Gabbard's overseas travel patterns and foreign connections triggered a government algorithm. But she was quickly removed from the list after she publicly claimed she had been added to a, quote, \"secret terror watch list.\" The TSA says Gabbard was placed on a little known list called Quiet Skies, which they say -- and they stress -- is not a terror watch list. Now amid the turmoil around Tulsi Gabbard, Trump and Trump's team is pushing ahead with a controversial choice for attorney general. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Of course, we knew he had resigned from this current session of Congress but he had just been elected to serve again. This, of course, coming as this ethics report looms over Matt Gaetz's head. Now one thing we do know that Matt Gaetz is now doing is that he has set up an account on Cameo. We'll see if this is the only thing he does. He said he would support president Trump in whatever way he could but it would be from a different perch as speaking about, specifically, not serving in Congress. Now when it comes to Pam Bondi, I've spoken to a number of Republicans who say that they are thrilled with this pick. They are relieved. They believe that she has a much better chance of getting confirmed and even some of the diehard MAGA loyalists, who maybe don't think that she's as much as a firebrand as Matt Gaetz was, they are still happy that she will be there. They do believe she is loyal to the former president. She will follow through on his plans to gut the Department of Justice and make sure that the White House oversees the Department of Justice -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

So that's not a name that Republicans like very much. So the sheer fact that he had this in his background and he got picked for one of the highest honors within the cabinet, I think my hat's off to president Trump for, you know, president-elect Trump for choosing such a guy. And he is going to be entering in this position if he gets confirmed, which I think he will, with a lot to tackle. You know, the national debt. He's got the tariffs. He's got a lot of things to unpack and the promises that Trump economically has promised, you know, the voters. He's promised these things to the voters.
