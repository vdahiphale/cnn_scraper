And look, Donald Trump started this rally by saying -- asking this crowd, are you better off now than you were four years ago? That is certainly much closer to the message that they would like to be talking about going into the final five days of this election, especially one where they actually have a jobs report that looks like would be unfavorable to Vice President Harris. Just 12,000 new jobs created over the past month. And yet I don't know, I haven't heard Donald Trump mention that yet in these remarks that he has given just now.And that's the problem they have, a free willing candidate who will say just about anything. If you're not talking about Liz Cheney, do they want their closing message to be RFK Jr.'s being in charge of women's health and promising that he will look at vaccines or attacking Senator Mitch McConnell, which Donald Trump did yesterday, or suing CBS for $10 billion. So, now we do -- I should point out that this is message being delivered today is in Macomb County, Michigan. This is a county that Donald Trump won with 53 percent of the vote four years ago and he is trying to win it back. This is the second time he is in this very room over just the past month, Jake.

I think Trump doesn't like the sense that he -- the intimation that he needs Nikki Haley's help. There are a lot of people who are very resentful about the race she ran. And look, there were primaries, Indiana is the one I'm thinking of, that was a closed primary where she was off the ballot and she still got a significant segment -- or not off the ballot, but she was out of the race and she still got a significant segment of Republican votes.

This is the biggest of the battlegrounds, 19 electoral votes. This is a dead heat race.And these counties right around Philly, Jake, you know it well, you grew up here, they decide competitive close races in this commonwealth and they are likely to decide this one as well. So where am I? Let me bring up the map right here. I'm in Delaware County. And you say, well, why is that important? Joe Biden got nearly 63 percent of the vote there in 2020. And then you move up here and you go to Montgomery County and you say, well, he got 63 percent of the vote there. What's the big deal? And you say -- and then you go to Bucks County. Look, that's close, more competitive. Joe Biden gets 52 percent. But you see these margins for the Democrats. People say, so why is it important? Well, let me just zoom out. You know, the Commonwealth. Look at all that red, right? You see all that red? Trump runs it up in the rural parts of the state. So Democrats must match those margins in the fewer places that they went. And in these counties, Joe Biden surpassed what Hillary Clinton did in just these three counties by 76,000 votes. His margin was bigger than hers over Donald Trump by nearly 80,000 votes, 76,000 votes. How much did he win Pennsylvania by? Look at the top of the screen, 81,000 votes. So these suburban counties are absolutely critical. And Jake, we're here today, we were here about a week ago. I've been here four times over the last year or so as we come through this state. What do you find here? You find a lot of Democrats, number one. Some of them are a little anxious. Some of them are hearing echoes of 2016. Some of their friends, they say it's a tiny number, but only takes a tiny number, saying, well, is she ready? Can we have a woman president? But what else do you find here? You find a lot of Nikki Haley voters, 155,000 people in the Commonwealth voted for Haley in the Republican primary long after she was gone from the race. So that's a protest vote. They want to vote against Donald Trump. Can Kamala Harris win them? We've met some who say, yes, she can win them. So that's the complicated math we're trying to do in the final four days. Where does she lose a little bit? Where can she gain a little bit? And the bigger -- perhaps better way to look at the question is this way, can Donald Trump run better in the suburbs than he did in 2020? Because the suburbs became his kryptonite when he was president. That's why Republicans lost the 2018 midterms. That's why he lost in 2020. Can he improve his standing a little bit, get back to 2016? Then, he's in play here in the Commonwealth. If he performs in the suburbs like he did four years ago, Kamala Harris is probably the next president of the United States.",

And you know, Kamala Harris has been on message and Donald Trump has spent a week reminding everyone of the things they don't like about him, whether it's how he treats Latinos, minorities, women. He's out there talking about violent political rhetoric.There's -- you know, Mike Johnson's talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act. He's talking -- an then just now Donald Trump was out in Dearborn talking about he wants to put RFK in charge of a big public health role which is going to remind people of, you know, Donald Trump mismanaging the last public health crisis we have, and now we're going to put a crank in charge of public health. So, it's just astounding to me that in his last week, and of course he still may win, right, like it's a toss-up race, either of them could win.
