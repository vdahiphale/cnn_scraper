With its focus on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the president will seek to reassure leaders who are talking about how to insulate their economies against potential challenges posed by President-elect Donald Trump. Now in particular, Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi on Saturday.CNN's Steven Jiang is following developments live from Beijing. And Steven, I have to say it is fascinating to think about how a country like China that has really been a centerpiece of a lot of the rhetoric in the U.S. campaign will now handle Trump 2.0. I'm wondering what you've been learning about how China will begin to approach this in the months to come.",

But also they have to potentially deal with quite a few China hawks as Trump has picked quite a few of them for his new national security and foreign policy teams.But Chinese officials have been telling us that they are fully prepared to deal with a second Trump administration, which they expect to be quite different from the first time around. But they were saying they are not going to take what Trump throws their way lying down. They think they are capable of fighting back, even faced with a sluggish economy at home. But the more immediate concern from some Chinese officials may be the potential disruption or even complete halt of just resumed bilateral talks on numerous topics. But that's why going into this meeting, Biden administration officials stress that no matter who is in the White House they -- both sides still need to find ways to manage this tough and complicated relationship. And that's why they say Biden is expected to mention some of the progress they have made recently as well as continues to mention a lot of U.S. concerns on multiple fronts. But from China's perspective, of course, they are trying to project this image of stability and global leadership. And some say the kind of multilateral settings like APEC also gives them a good opportunity to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies and partners because if there's one thing China likes less than potential tariffs, it is this Biden approach of forming a united front with allies and partners against China on many different issues. So the setting of this meeting, of course, Peru, is also interesting because China just unveiled a multi-billion dollar megaport built by one of its state-owned companies. So that really is a testament of China's growing economic clout in that part of the world, which is long considered to be America's backyard. So now China has replaced the U.S. as the number one trading partner with a growing number of Latin America countries. That contrast between China's continued and growing investments versus what many see as America's neglect or at least disinterest in the region is definitely something Xi wants to highlight and take advantage of as well.

(VIDEO PLAYING) And those are the Maori members of New Zealand's parliament who staged a haka to disrupt the vote on a bill that many claim would undermine their rights. The measure is based on an 1840 treaty between the British Crown and Maori chiefs, and it still guides policies today. Now, this bill would limit interpretations of the treaty, as some argue it's led to discrimination against non-Indigenous citizens. Protests are ongoing right across the country, but with little support from political parties, the bill is unlikely to become law. Okay. A bizarre insurance scam that wasn't as grizzly as first believed. Details on a wild fraud scheme. You want to see this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Caribbean wildlife authorities are now taking care of the animals. Now former water polo player, Jhoen Lefont, has set a new world record for ball control from a swimming pool. The challenge is to balance a soccer ball on your head wearing a weighted belt, yes it gets more tough, while treading water. The Cuban athlete beat his own world record set last year by over a minute, keeping the ball on his head for eight and a half minutes. Referees from FIFA and the International Swimming Federation certify his record. Lefont has accomplished other aquatic feats and that includes swimming 750 meters with a ball balanced on his head. Oh, goodness, my neck hurts just looking at that. Okay, conservators at a Dutch museum are in the middle of a painstaking process to restore Rembrandt's Night Watch painting. Now, a small team is working to remove a layer of varnish on the giant piece, which is several meters tall and wide. As you can imagine, it's a slow process where they apply a small amount of solvent to tissue, which dissolves on top of the paint. The experts studied the painting for five years and restretched its canvas before getting to this point. The museum's director says it is time well spent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
