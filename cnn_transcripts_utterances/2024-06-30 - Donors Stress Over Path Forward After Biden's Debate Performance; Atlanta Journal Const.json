As it relates to the classified documents case, Isabel, those actions took place after his presidency. And so, I think we'll see none, but the issue in terms of implications of this decision. But I think the major issue, though, is the delay, delay, delay. And what the court does here and we know there's an election pending, there's a Republican convention pending, that because the court even entertain this, we may not even get to any of these cases.

All we do know is from this senior U.S. Administration official is that this language is designed to try to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas that have been preventing this deal from getting over the line. Now, it's been almost a month to the day since President Biden made that announcement to much fanfare about a ceasefire proposal that he said that Israel had already signed off on. Since then, there has been pressure from the U.S. on the mediators, the Egyptians and the Qataris to put pressure on Hamas to agree to this deal so that those hostages can be released, around 120 of them, about a third of whom are believed to be dead already, and also, of course, to get a ceasefire in Gaza.But that just hasn't happened, and so we do seem to be going around in circles here. For months now, these conversations have been taking place. And then a month ago we had this plan announced by President Biden but we just don't seem to be getting over the line. Now, we heard from a Hamas spokesman on Saturday in Beirut saying that the proposals outlined by President Biden still don't meet their demands, and that any discussion that doesn't incorporate those demands, namely a complete cessation of hostilities and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, any discussions would be a waste of time if they don't include those demands. Israel for its part even though it says it has signed up to the language and to the to the proposal that President Biden announced, still insists that that proposal doesn't preclude it from fulfilling its war objectives of destroying the military and governance capabilities of Hamas. And the problem right now really seems to be that Israel is sticking to its red line of still being able to uh destroy Hamas militarily and its governance capabilities. Hamas obviously doesn't want to be destroyed military -- or militarily or have its governance capabilities destroyed either. And so, you have these kinds of mutually opposing red lines from either side. And as a result of that, we still are not seeing any sign of a breakthrough. The U.S. Administration will be hoping that some kind of revised language may be able to plug the gaps. But history shows that whenever we get optimistic about a deal being done, those hopes are very quickly dashed. Victor, Isabel?",

Israel is saying trust but verify, we want to see that you actually give more of those hostages back before we get into discussions about demilitarization and an eventual permanent ceasefire.Plus, Netanyahu is still saying that he hasn't given up on the complete destruction of Hamas. What you've got are two sides each trying to make sure that they survive. Hamas needs the demilitarization and the permanent ceasefire so that every last one of its leaders doesn't get hunted down by the IDF. For Netanyahu's part, if he agrees to either a ceasefire permit permanently or a withdrawal, his government coalition will collapse.

Others say that they've seen these lapses like we all saw on the debate and that sparks concern.But they're even more afraid of a Donald Trump presidency, those that I've spoken to because of what it might mean for Ukraine. They're afraid that Donald Trump would be too close to Russia, maybe even do deals with China that would leave many of the U.S.'s Western allies holding the short end of the stick in charge of uh defending Ukraine themselves and possibly facing Trump strong-arming Ukraine into giving up territory to make peace with Russia.",

In the last month, we've actually reported on five different incidents involving shark attacks from Florida to California and Hawaii. Here's an overview of those latest incidents.Last Sunday, on the North Shore of Oahu Hawaii, professional Surfer, lifeguard, and actor Tamayo Perry died following an apparent shark attack. That same day in North Carolina, a 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark. About a month ago, a 46-year-old man required surgery after he was bitten multiple times by a shark while swimming off the coast of San Diego. Soon after, in Walton County, Florida, three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring beaches. Here's what officials had to say about the incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of those, over half of them were in the U.S., two of which were fatal. The Florida Fish and Wild Conservation Commission says the increase we've seen in shark bites over the years is more related to an increase in human visitors than an increase in shark populations or activity.
