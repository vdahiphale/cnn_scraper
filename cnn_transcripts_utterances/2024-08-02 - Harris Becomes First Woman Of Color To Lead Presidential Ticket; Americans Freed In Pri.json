Now, here the caveats, and, Pam, you know, this as well as anyone, anyone that actually knows the decision has been made here is not necessarily talking to reporters.

Josh Shapiro is not Barack Obama. He's not the real McCoy as they say to use that phrase. But, look, Pamela, I'm looking at this differently as a strategist here, right? \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" resurfaced some old remarks from Governor Shapiro where he stated Palestinians will no, cannot co- exist peacefully. Younger progressives are warning against choosing Shapiro. That will absolutely become a problem for the Harris campaign in states like Michigan, where they're going to need about 60 percent of the Muslim population in order to carry that state. So, they have to be very careful here if they're going to try to maintain that 2020 Biden coalition going forward into November and it's clear that progressives want someone else because of the issues going on between Israel and Hamas and Gaza.",

I think Josh Shapiro is -- he's incredibly popular. People like him a lot. I think, particularly given that Pennsylvania borders Ohio, that's not insignificant. And look at, you're right, it's a do-no-harm situation, but I'd just bring it back to J.D. Vance and just suggest that does anybody really think that he should be president of anything anywhere ever?

And one of the major breakdowns here was communications and what Ron Rowe revealed today was that the radio communications seemed pretty scattered. Some people were using the radio, some people were using text messages, some people were making phone calls.And the problem here, Pamela what we learned today was that there were basically two command posts. There was a single command posts where the local law enforcement was. They called that the unified command post, but there was another room, the security room where the Secret Service at a Pennsylvania state trooper were stationed. Those two rooms were not on the same radios, so they weren't hearing in real time. That local law enforcement was looking for that suspect. And what we know is that that is critical because there was a radio transmission that went out about 30 seconds before the shooting, but that was on the local radio channel. That information never got to the Secret Service, and that information was critical because that's when local law enforcement realized that man had a gun. So that was critical information that never made its way to the Secret Service because they were not on the same radio. We also learned today, Pamela, that that rally was the first time that Secret Service snipers were accompanying former President Trump to a rally like that. And then finally, Pamela, there's a big question about experience and accountability here. And Director Roe made very clear that no ones going to be disciplined or placed on administrative leave until after these investigations are finished and only upon information that warrants being either on administrative leave or discipline. [19:35:06] Our Holmes Lybrand asked more specifically about the experience of the Pittsburgh field office, and that's really critical, Pamela, because as you know having covered the Secret Service and covered the White House, that those events are run by the local field offices.
