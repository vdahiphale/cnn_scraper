So 34 percent have a favorable view of Joe Biden, overall New Hampshire 53 percent unfavorable. That's a net negative of 19 points. But look at Donald Trump, 27 percent favorable, 63 percent unfavorable. That's a net negative of 36 points. That is a problem in a state that has four electoral votes, but one that you're going to see both sides compete at.Why is Donald Trump so unpopular? Well, maybe his legal woes because among New Hampshire voters, 58 percent say legitimate prosecutions are taking place that this is a legitimate effort, 41 percent say they're politically motivated as Donald Trump asserts, 62 percent of Granite Staters say that Trump didn't commit crimes for which he's been charged, 34 percent say no. So nearly two thirds in New Hampshire do believe he is guilty and committed a crime. And take a look here about by party if you break down, 98 percent of Democrats believe he's committed crimes, 61 percent of independents believe so. And even, Sara, one in five Republicans in New Hampshire think Donald Trump has committed crimes.",

This is especially significant given the fact that the Committee report didn't include any recommendations to expel George Santos, the argument being that continuing their investigation to get to that point would have taken so much more time.But obviously this is a very important step, given who the messenger here is. There have been previous attempts to expel George Santos from Congress, those attempts coming from his colleagues, Republican colleagues from the state of New York, but this is significant because now there is an ethics report. And as members are reading it, they are changing their minds about how to proceed with a vote if and when it comes to the floor to expel George Santos. At this point, CNN's count has at least a dozen Republicans who have now said they are willing to try and oust Santos from Congress. And this is a really high bar. It would take two thirds of the House of Representatives to pass it in assuming all of the Democrats support it. That means that you need about 50 Republicans to back that resolution. Now, we won't see what is going to happen until after the Thanksgiving recess. Lawmakers are away for the holiday next week. But when lawmakers return, you can expect that this could come up for a vote. And we should also know that George Santos is going to have more to say he is holding a press conference on November 30th on Capitol Hill. That is when we could hear any additional news that he has about his plans. He said yesterday in a tweet, he does not plan to run for reelection. But given the pressure he's getting, does that mean that he could step aside? Obviously we'll be watching very closely. Kate?",

That's tied with Bob Taft, who of course, was convicted of a crime just before this poll was taken. Bob Menendez, who's obviously right now in some major trouble in some federal cases at 8 percent. And of course, Rod Blagojevich, who of course, was a infamous convicted criminal at 8 percent. So he is amongst the lowest at this point.",

So the fact is, George Santos is less popular than a bunch of conspiracy theories that no one should believe. He is below the Mendoza line. You can pretty much get 10 percent of Americans to agree on anything. But even in New York's Third District, you can't get 10 percent of voters to say that they like George Santos.",

The head of the burn unit at Al-Shifa told Al Jazeera, most of the ICU patients on ventilators have died now due to a lack of fuel and oxygen. And the IDF operation there continues today. Among with the IDF says they have discovered is this, the bodies of two Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas, they are 65- year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old Noa Marciano, a corporal in the IDF. Their bodies have now been taken back to Israel.The IDF estimates around 237 hostages are still being held by Hamas inside Gaza. And the IDF also has released this with regard to their operation at the Al-Shifa Medical Complex. Video of what they say is an operational tunnel shaft at the hospital. The IDF has said for years, Hamas hides its operation underneath has hid and shielded its operation by hiding it inside and underneath that hospital there. U.S. intelligence from the Biden administration, they say backs up that claim. Joining me now for more on this and some perspective on this ongoing operation is the former director of communications for U.S. National Intelligence, Shawn Turner. It's good to see you again, Sean. I want to ask you first about -- SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Good to see you, Kate.",

One, you know, we've known for a very long time that there is a vast tunnel infrastructure underneath Gaza. Its military and intelligence imagery has shown us that there are entry and exit points. And there's been clear understanding that Hamas operates underground. What has not been clear to this point is exactly where the major command nodes are.That's something that not only has U.S. intelligence struggled with, but certainly Israeli intelligence has struggled with, understanding that as well. So when I look at these images that have been released, I'm not terribly moved or surprised that they found this this tunnel entrance there. What I'm more interested in from an intelligence perspective, is where exactly -- what exactly are they finding in that space? Because what's there will tell us whether or not there is actually a command center there, whether or not that space has power and has internet access. I mean, all of those sorts of things that we know are underground. Until I see those things, I think it's difficult for us to make any claims other than there's a tunnel infrastructure and there's an image of a space underneath there.",

But I think that we're at a point where the likelihood that we will see a negotiated release of hostages is diminishing every day. And I think it's -- that it's diminishing faster every day. And I know that is a grim assessment. Well, look, here's the bottom line, as we continue to learn more about the situation on the ground, as we continue to see images of what's happening in Gaza, not only at Al-Shifa but other places. Those images, that situation will have an impact on the terrorists who are holding these innocent civilians, these innocent hostages.They are going to make decisions based on what they are seeing. And unfortunately, you know, those decisions are going to be as the result of the pressure that they feel. I think that we're at a point where the most likely scenario for the release of these hostages will come through intelligence, where the Israeli Defense Forces are able to learn more about where these hostages are in to carry out precise military operations for the release of these hostages. Now, again, that's not an assessment that anyone wants to hear. But we have to be realistic about the situation on the ground and the impact it's going to have on the terrorists who are holding these hostages. I do not think there is a good, you know, reason that we would see a large scale release of hostages at this point, considering what we're seeing happening on the ground in Gaza.",
