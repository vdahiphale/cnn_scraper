Right now, and that`s afterhotter than expected inflation numbers, booking investors earlier in the day. Well, those are the markets, and these are the main events. Dramatic scenes out of Donald Trump`s civil fraud trial, the judge rebuking the former president for speaking out in court. Inflation rose faster than expected in December, dimming hopes for an interest rate cuts in the near future. And it can`t happen again, the FAA formerly tells Boeing it`s under investigation. Live from Dubai, it is Thursday, January 11th. I`m Eleni Giokos. I`m in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening to you. Welcome to the show. Prosecutors are presenting their closing arguments right now in a trial that`s testing Donald Trump`s legitimacy as a businessman. The former president was in a New York courtroom for today`s proceedings. The state accuses him of committing business fraud and is seeking $317 million in damages. Trump speaking from the defense table, saying the case was a political witch hunt that went outside the facts. At one point, the judge presiding over the trial told Trump`s lawyers to control your client. Trump also said this in the last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, first of all, its important to know at the outset, this is a civil case, this is a lawsuit,this is not a criminal case. Donald Trump does have four criminal indictments against him, but this is just looking for money damages. This sort of goes to the heart of the Trump organization and their ability to continue doing business. The heart of this case, the allegation made by the attorney general`s office is that Donald Trump and his businesses systematically and vastly overinflated the value of their assets in order to get loans that they wouldn`t have otherwise been entitled to. Now, Donald Trump hasn`t offered up much of a defense to that. On the subject of whether his numbers evaluations were reasonable and accurate, it`s really been, I think, an unconvincing case. These overvaluations weren`t just by 10% or 20%, they were by sometimes five or 10 times the amount. What I think is the better argument that Donald Trump`s team has made throughout this trial is that there were no real victims here, that the parties that were receiving these inflated numbers were very sophisticated multibillion-dollar banks. They made the loan to Donald Trump, who then repaid the loans in full plus interest. So that`s an argument that Donald Trump`s made, I think, to sort of mitigate the damages against him. Important also to note, finally, this is being heard by a judge. There`s no jury here. The judge already has ruled in favor of the AG against Donald Trump on one of the seven claims here. What we`ll see in the future, at some point, is the judge ruling on the other six claims and also giving an award of damages.",

If Donald Trump is convicted on any of those four cases, he faces the realistic possibility of being sentenced to prison. Now a lot of things have to happen. He has a trial, he has to be convicted, then it will go up on appeal and have to hold up on appeal. So there`s a lot of steps between where we are now and a potential ultimate outcome.

You see transportation, airline tickets, things like that going up. That`s predictable. But there are other things like health insurance, auto insurance, housing that have also stayed a little higher than what were expected. So it`s not something to be alarmed about, but I would say that this is going to make it harder for the Fed to make a case to start cutting in March.

We were already on track to have a slowdown at the same time that you might have seen some higher inflation because of a re-industrialization that`s been in the US and Europe. You know, we`re in a decoupling world. All of this throws a lot of vectors into play. There are demographic shifts. There are technological shifts happening right now.

The math on that is I had a look at what happened with the first US placed gold ETF when that came out in November 2004 to quite a few years for the ETF inflows, about seven or eight years in total. But over that time, the gold price multiplied by 4.3 times. And if you think about bitcoin price, right now, if you multiply that by 4.3 times, that gets you to around about a 200,000 mark. I think that happens a lot more quickly for bitcoin than it did for gold. So I`m thinking about by the end of 2025, so just under the two-year mark. And that`s because the bitcoin and the digital asset markets more broadly are much faster moving. There`s been this buildup for demand.

But we ourselves as being one of the first movers in this area from a traditional financial institution. Now, we`ve got BlackRock and other ETFs out today that also sees more, let`s say, trustworthy traditional financial institutions in the sector. And now with the spot ETFs and hopefully some proactive regulation, that should put those issues that you mentioned into the past and see this sector come much more central as we move forward. And I suspect that`s where we go. Don`t forget, of course, that most or if not all of the ETF inflow to bitcoin is going to be then held in custody by Coinbase, which is, of course, the largest US-based and US-listed cryptocurrency exchange as well.

They showboated in front of the world`s media. It`s only a few generations ago they were exterminated. And yes, it was a real proud moment to see them swimming around here in this main pond of paradise feels again like they had never been absent.

MCCORMACK (voice-over):  So we`re in almost a low lying basin, surrounded by urban landscape and hard standing and roads and things of that. In high rainfall events, we`re getting flooding of this area and the water is basically gushing through. And it`s going into the storm drain systems and into the sewers. And it`s gushing out in urban Greenford downstream. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  Sean McCormack from Ealing Wildlife Group believes that nature has the answer. MCCORMACK (voice-over):  So here is their magnificent creation. Their first dam. So absolutely incredible. This started as just a couple of twigs across the stream bed. And as you can see now, we`ve got almost a meter difference in height between the water upstream, the water downstream. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  Beavers create dams under the cover of darkness, not because they care about urban flooding; they have an instinct to create pools of deep water to hide in. The happy consequence for us is that their refuge systems actually slow down the flow of water. MCCORMACK (voice-over):  The land will actually over time act as a giant sponge and it will absorb those high rainfall events and it will release it slowly. Even if you`re not interested in wildlife or nature, it`s a win for the urban community in Greenford to not have so much flooding. So they build resilience in the landscape, especially in times of climate change. I`ve been in a very privileged position to be coming in here every day on my own or with a pair of volunteers at a time and seeing it for myself. But I think the real proud moment will come when we`re showing the urban community here in Ealing just what beavers can do. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
