Jean Carroll speaking out Donald Trump's accuser talking to CNN this past hour, one day after the Former President's loss in court. A New York jury is finding Trump liable for sexual assault and more, Carroll saying she feels vindicated, Trump's team saying he will appeal. The very latest just ahead plus, debt ceiling dismay. You talk set for Friday after negotiations between President Biden and Republican leadership Tuesday went nowhere fast. Where is the urgency? Will be discussing and from low expectations to inflation revelations, fresh U.S. inflation data saying the cooling continues. But of course not fast enough for consumer prices rising 4.9 percent year over year last month that are down from 5 percent in March and does represents the 10th straight month of soft inflation. Core inflation also coming slightly lower year over year too, but of course the progress is still frustratingly slow. The big question for markets is the price right for a Federal Reserve pause. U.S. futures higher and European markets are all relatively unchanged after that, data stock investors taking the data and the debt ceiling debacle in their stride. Bond investors though seemingly more alert yields on short term U.S. debt are significantly higher, as investors demand heftier yields or return to compensate them for the higher risk. President Biden saying he has considered other avenues for raising the debt ceiling, including a way to use the constitution to bypass Congress. But of course, even that has risks.

There'd been a three kilometer deep retreat by some parts of the Russian Military. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade was the initial claim. Now that was first aired by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Head saying that he'd lost 500 men fighting for that area. And again, he used this example as another moment to poke at the Russian conventional military saying that it was the Russian conventional troops who departed this area, and essentially casting Wagner as those doing the bulk of the serious fighting to hang on to Bakhmut. But it's another display of disunity here, and also an example that the fighting around Bakhmut is definitely not going in Russia's way a stark reversal from a matter of weeks ago, where we persistently heard thoughts that perhaps Russia might have the upper hand might be able to potentially close off and encircle the remain Ukrainian troops in there. Now we've had a week of public comments from Yevgeny Prigozhin, saying he would leave today entirely because he didn't have enough artillery shells, and then saying he would stay then saying he actually wasn't getting enough and now blaming the Russian army itself, for pulling away from a key part of the front. None of this is good for Russian morale or frankly, for the grip of Vladimir Putin on this increasingly disastrous war. We are days away if not already in the early stages of Ukrainian counter offensive and so Russian troops in the trenches are hearing their most probably prominent Russian Military figure Prigozhin speak very disparagingly about the commander's the top brass running this war. And indeed, now this appears to be translating into a small but significant, still a deeply symbolic collapse of Russian positions along this front line confirmed by Ukrainian Military officials who said in fact, their troops managed to push forward. So we're seeing a lot changing here around Bakhmut, so symbolic for Russia. The one thing they said they would take this or they take it by today, finally, that hasn't happened. And instead, we're seeing parts of the Russian Military. It seems eroding small, but still potentially important positions around that city, Julia.",

We do know that in Zaporizhzhia, there's been evacuations called by the Russian occupying forces 3000 the last figure of civilians, they said they've moved away from frontline towns. Certainly that includes the areas, large numbers around potentially the Zaporizhzhia plan, that town being evacuated --. But there is a constant fear here of exactly what we may see in terms of Russian fire power focused on frontline towns. We've seen it ourselves. I'm hearing sirens around me here in Zaporizhzhia at the moment that had been on, off frankly for the past week or so and those evacuations perhaps heralding Russia's Military bracing itself for a potential Ukrainian onslaught or also Ukrainian officials saying being used as cover to let Russian Military pull out to some of those towns as well.

It's all about uptime; you want to run your truck. So if you fuel only for 20 minutes, that's a big advantage. Also, the weight is better. What is important for us for Nikola that we set up the infrastructure at the same time? Now, what are the key advantages of Nikola and why we so much focus on the fuel cell truck is first of all, we have a first mover advantage. I mean, we come with our truck already in July of this year. And there's really nobody else out. And I think this advantage we want to use more important and that's also a lesson learned is you have to set up the hydrogen infrastructure at the same time. Because just having the best truck in the world is not sufficient because all your customers say where can we fuel and therefore we set up the hydrogen infrastructure we just announced also partnership was Voltera to set up 50 stations.

Because think about this, I mean, thosecustomers could not drive our truck because it just comes now in July. So that's a big sign of confidence. And obviously, my intention is now to grow this auto book very, very quickly. But it also shows there are so many advantages. And it feels like the time is right for hydrogen. And also, I mean, the public support through the inflation Reduction Act through the state regulations is enormous. So I mean hydrogen technology is not new. But now we are really on the right side of history. And it's coming through.",

Nikola will produce in Arizona with partners green hydrogen. So if you put all this together, it's really attractive. And that has influenced our decision as well. But truth being said also, I mean, a young company like ours doing business in North America. And Europe is a lot, right, we have limited resources.

For me, there are the benefits that can accrue to students, beyond getting all the homework written for them. But also providing assistance to teachers that, for the most part, are overwhelmed by the number of students that they have to teach, and never mind the content that they're teaching and perhaps, that needs updating to, can you explain to us the obvious benefits that you can see and how this can be implemented to benefit both in education?",

And this isn't surprising, because in every workplace, employers are asking their employees, figure out how you can use this new a tech AI technology to be more productive, if it can save you time. Everybody, it's a good thing. But in terms of helping students, it's not up to just the teachers and students, we need administrations and even governments to think a little bit about how we change how we teach, how we test what we teach, and even the purpose sort of them, what we teach. Because, you know, for example, with the invention of the calculator, it's become much less important to have students learn to become really good at multiplying or dividing numbers. The calculator does that for us. There's a similar level, but with the rise of the Internet, and now artificial intelligence, schools should involve less memorization, less rote repetition, and more creativity, problem solving, collaboration, critical thinking. You know things like that, focusing more on skills, less on just content memorization. And that shift is something that I think the internet already made some reason for it, but AI is really taking it to the next level.",

But I think this is part of also helping students help themselves in many ways. The question is how do we get there? How do we bring together an industry that for the most part, saying, hey, we need to pause to understand what we're doing? Governments that I think, for the most part, are blindsided. And the natural response has been that we have to ban this rather than trying to adapt and utilize it because our education systems, what in the space of 5 to 10 years are going to be deeply outdated by this technology, whether we like it or not.

And then it doesn't end up happening the day he says it's going to happen. So I think this is still a bit of a wait and see. And then of course the same thing with this plan to let users call each other or video chat from their handles. Lots of questions still remain about what exactly that will look like.
