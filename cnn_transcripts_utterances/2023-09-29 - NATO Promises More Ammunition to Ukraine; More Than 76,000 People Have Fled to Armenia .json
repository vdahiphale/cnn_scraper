On the same day, Russian artillery pummeled the city of Kherson, killing at least three people, according to Ukraine. Fred Pleitgen now with more on Stoltenberg's visit to the Ukrainian capital.

In a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he also said that he believes that the Ukrainians are making modest gains. He says they are tough gains, but they are gains nonetheless. One of the things that Jens Stoltenberg said is he said, for every meter that the Ukrainians gain, the Russians lose a meter. Now, there was also some substantial aid that was announced by Jens Stoltenberg, as well. He said that NATO has a plan to provide Ukraine with more ammunition. That's certainly something the Ukrainians need. Stoltenberg was speaking about artillery, ammunition, and tank ammunition, as well. One of the things that we've seen here, as we've been in a major battle around the Bakhmut area, is that the Ukrainians certainly fire a lot of ammo when they try to move forward. The Russians, of course, firing a lot, as well. But the Ukrainians, from what we can see, certainly will need a lot of ammunitions if they are going to stay in the fight and if they are going to continue to make gains. At the same time, the Russians also upping the ante, as well. They're now announcing that they're want to increase their defense budget by almost 70 percent. Obviously, they also feel that they're going to need a lot of ammo and a lot of weapons as this war drags on. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He had his wife and his son by his side. Gambon worked in television, film, the stage and radio. He also starred in the hit series \"The Singing Detective.\" Some described him as a trickster, with fellow actor Helen Mirren recalling his naughty sense of humor. Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling posted, quote, \"Michael was a wonderful man, in addition to being an outstanding actor, and I loved working with him.\" He was a terrific actor. The glaciers in Switzerland are shrinking at a, quote, \"mind-blowing rate.\" That's according to the head of the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network. He tells CNN it is due to a combination of low snowfall and record high temperatures that would have been, in his words, impossible without climate change. Ten percent of the ice volume has disappeared over the past two years, the same amount lost in the 30 years between 1960 and 1990. Even if climate targets are met, recent research finds that up to half of the world's glaciers would disappear by the end of the century. Human-created climate change has also damaged the coral reefs off the coast of Cuba. Now scientists believe they've found a way to not only preserve the vulnerable environment, but also improve the island's economy. CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Porpoises swim off the coast of Cuba. The waters here may seem pristine, but like seemingly everywhere else, this Caribbean island nation is grappling with the threats of a rapidly-changing climate. Now in the first research expedition of its kind, 24 Cuban scientists and crew circumnavigated the entire island to carry out what they say is the most comprehensive study ever done on climate change and the impact it's had on Cuba. Researchers dive from coral reef to coral reef and say what they have found is even more dire than they expected. \"We've seen a bleaching of corals, which is something that is worrying, and that is massive,\" she says. \"The majority of coral is bleached, and this is because of the high temperatures.\" The scientists say it's not too late to reverse the damage, but that we have to dramatically reduce human-caused pollution that is heating oceans to record levels, killing off coral reefs and filling the seas with microplastics. With this study, the scientists say they will be able to measure much more accurately how much harm has been inflicted on Cuba's unique natural environments. \"We are going to have a baseline,\" she says. \"We hope to identify the spots along the coast where the pollution is and how concentrated it is.\" For two months, the scientists carried out dozens of dives, taking hundreds of samples from the bottom of the ocean. Scientists are barely out of their wetsuits before running tests in the laboratory. They hope what they learn can help change how resources on this island are used.",

OPPMANN (voice-over): The change will not come easy, but for Cubans who depend on mangroves to protect them from hurricanes, and beaches to attract tourists, experts say there is no other choice. \"It's not a luxury, it's a necessity,\" he says. \"Even with so many difficulties, we can't stop learning about coral reefs. To protect the beaches, to protect us from extreme weather. They give us sand and fish and the foods we eat.\" The scientists traveled more than 1,800 nautical miles to better understand the incredible natural world off Cuba's shores that is increasingly at risk.
