We begin in Manhattan, where a busy legal day for former President Donald Trump has yielded what you might call mixed results for him, Trump was back in court today for a hearing in his attempt to delay the trial over hush money payments made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, this prior to the 2016 election. The judge though rejected that effort, that trial, the first of his criminal trials set to begin on April 15th. Meanwhile, you might say Trump scored a big financial win in the civil fraud case related to the Trump Organization. He no longer has to post a $464 million bond by the end of the day today. Instead, he owes is still significant, $175 million in ten days. That handed him something of a lifeline as he faced the potential seizure of his properties if he couldn't come up with that money. Trump responded to the outcomes as he has so many times before by attacking the process and the judges in both cases, often with dubious claims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is election interference. If you look at what we just left, you had a -- you have a case which they're dying to get this thing started. The judge can not go faster. He wants to get it started so badly, and there's tremendous corruption. So it's a sad day in our country in many respects. But the good day is that the appellate division was fair. It's a lot of money still, but the judge is corrupted my opinion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That was the date on the calendar for a long time, but they were able to create a bump on the highway to trial in this case in Manhattan. The lawyers for Donald Trump were able to do that because they got a lot of documents at the last minute from federal prosecutors than it looked at Donald Trump, Michael Cohen's bank records many years ago.They got those records. They went to the judge. They said their piece, and the judge says, I'm not buying it. Here's the direct quote from Judge Marshawn today to Donald Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, who was arguing for more delays. You are literally accusing the Manhattan D.A.'s office and the people assigned to this case of prosecutorial misconduct conduct and have trying to make me complicit in it, and you don't have a single cite to support that position. So that's the judge saying, I don't see any legal reason to delay this trial further or to sanction the district attorney in New York for not turning over those documents sooner are finding them sooner. And then the judge came down quite quickly with a decision three weeks from now, April 15th, that will be the first trial date where jury selection begins, Donald Trump as a criminal defendant in Manhattan.",

Alayna, the Trump team is calling this a victory fact is he was found liable, has to come up with $175 million.

And remember, last week Donald Trumps team was scrambling to try to find someone who could ensure the bond for him and his legal team had said they had reached out to three different insurers, none of them were agreeing. And so that was part of the reason why there was a lot of concern behind -- behind the scenes with Donald Trumps team about this.Now, the judge did give them an extra ten days to sort but this out. So again, that is one option to try and find an insurer to put this up for him or Donald Trump could put up his own cash. And I will say that he does have -- we've looked through the records, he does have enough money to meet the $175 million threshold, this new reduced amount that came from the appeals decision, but it's very unclear what he'll be -- he will do. Now, we did hear from him briefly speak about this in those remarks following his hearing in his criminal case today. He said, quote, we'll put it up very quickly as they say, I have a lot of cash. I want to use some to get elected. He also expanded on that a bit. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the sound that I was referring to, he basically was saying I have a lot of cash. You know, look at my statements, I could put this up very quickly if I wanted to.So just to go back to the bond decision, this is something that, of course, is a win for him. This is a lifeline from the appeals court decision. This was something that was really consuming Donald Trump today, even though he had sat in, in court on his separate case, has criminal case, not the civil case where this bond decision deadline was looming over him, but it was something that was really consuming Donald Trump. And from my conversations with his team, he was more concerned about that. And so now really this idea of the threat of the attorney general in New York, Letitia James, may be having to seize properties, assets, all of that seems to be not going to happen now because he will likely be able to meet this new deadline with this with the reduced amount of bond.",

As you've noted, this is a reduction of almost two-thirds. It really is extraordinary and not only that up to $175 million, let's say, for example, he can put up half in cash and then Deutsche Bank can put up the other half or Chubb Insurance.

Those are still ongoing and taking place, meeting with folks like Jake Sullivan, like Antony Blinken as you said, and U.S. officials are making clear that even despite that delegation strip on Wednesday being canceled, the meetings that defense minister Gallant has with U.S. officials today. They will in part focus on some of these alternatives that U.S. officials are pushing for, alternatives to a major ground incursion into Rafah.This is what John Kirby told me just a few minutes ago.

You'll remember very well that initially the Israelis had said that they would go into Rafah at the beginning of Ramadan. That didn't happen. And now were looking at about two weeks left of that holy month of Ramadan. U.S. official well say they haven't seen any kind of plan in terms of the military operation or civilian protection plan. And they say that it would be holy unacceptable for the Israelis to go in without such a plan, though very skeptical as to whether that plan is even feasible, Jim.",
