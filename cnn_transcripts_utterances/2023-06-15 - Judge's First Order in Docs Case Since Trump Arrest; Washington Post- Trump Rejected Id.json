And our law and justice lead, as we hear for the first time from Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointed judge who will preside over the federal criminal case against the former president. Today, Judge Cannon gave attorneys five days to notify her on the status on the necessary security clearances they need for the classified material in the case. This, as \"The Washington Post\" reports, that one of the former president's attorneys proposed a plan to Trump last fall, to attempt to stave off a potential indictment, planning to, quote, quietly approach the Justice Department to see if that he can negotiate a settlement that would preclude charges, hoping Attorney General Merrick Garland and the department would want an exit ramp, to avoid prosecuting the former president. Trump reportedly rejected that approach, \"The Post\" says, at the urging of some of his more combative outside advisers. But one source is casting doubt on the practicality of that proposal, telling CNN it wasn't a real opportunity to avoid charges. Donald Trump continues to lash out at special counsel Jack Smith, and at the Department of Justice, calling Smith on his social media site, deranged. And blaming, quote, misfits, mutants, Marxists, and communists for, the criminal charges, that's a quote, which while not necessarily helping his legal case, is apparently helping his campaign's coffers. His team claims it has now raised more than $7 million since his federal indictment was announced last Thursday. We're going to begin with CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, who is following all the latest developments hope for us. Paula, why is this order from Judge Cannon significant?",

We know the former president and his attorneys have every incentive to try to drag this out at least until after the election. Now we know where they stand on this, but the judge has a lot of control over how quickly this moves. And this is the first scheduling order she has issued.And it's going to move along pretty quickly here. Two days ago, we had the arrangements, saying, look, five days now in an update on where you are with your security clearances. That's an important issue here, right? Because we're dealing with classified information. But she's under a lot of scrutiny, and a big question here is, how quickly will this move? Now in order to get the security clearances, the Trump team needs to know who exactly is going to be on the team. So that's another sneaky way that this could get dragged out a little bit, right? They have to find the lawyers, and then it will take a few weeks to get the clearances. But, Jake, all this feels a little bit in the weeds white.

And Jake, there are so many ways that she could influence this case, everything from jury selection right, which jurors get struck for cause. Two bigger questions like which evidence will those jurors eventually get to see. And I think that's only going to be the first test for her. Because we know the Trump legal team, they want to revisit all of these fights that they've already had in D.C. about evidence that got in. And they want to revisit those in front of Cannon.

But his essential message is that it's time for the Republican Party to pick a new generation leader, in someone who is talking and not shouting or lecturing. So that's the thesis of his running. What you will not hear him talk, about is Donald Trump. His argument is that it's time for this party to stop talking about Donald Trump, and it is something that is very difficult, given that Trump is the pace setter for this entire Republican primary. What he is going to be asked about on this campaign trail though, is his late entry into this race, how he did not vote for Donald Trump, and how he is going to make the debate stage.

It just shows you how influential these bloggers, these military bloggers, who are very pro-war, of course, have become in this country. They've been routinely criticizing the Russian military, and the Russian authorities, but not doing enough to win the war in Ukraine, and for being too soft if you'd like.And so, this wasn't part Vladimir Putin sort of pandering to some of their views, but also trying to moderate them as well. He spoke about a number of issues. You mentioned them there, he spoke about mobilization. He said there were some public figures who were calling for a million, or even two million more men in uniform to fight the war in Ukraine. He said that that wasn't necessary at the moment. He said the mobilization of the country, that wasn't necessarily at the moment. But then he had the sort of very public puzzling cryptic remark that he made about Kyiv. He said that the question was, should we return there or not? And obviously, there have been lots of calls amongst these military bloggers in Russia to have another go at taking the Russian capital, which of course it attempted to do at the beginning of the conflict in February of last year. And he said, only I can answer this myself. So, he held out the possibility that there could be, you know, he was at least considering a further escalation in Ukraine, in the future, and another attack on the Capitol, Jake.",

Saying that with all these mercenaries like Wagner and the other sort of freelance mercenary groups that have sprouted up over the course of the past 15 months or so. Should now effectively sign contracts with the Russian military and become part of the Russian military.And, Prigozhin has been against that for some time, since the idea was first floated by the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu. But now, Putin has come out and said, no, you've got to do this by July the 1st. And Prigozhin, for the first time, has basically defied the Russian president, and said, no, I'm not going to do that. My men are not going to sign these military contracts. And so, on one hand, Putin has in this battle between Prigozhin and the Wagner mercenaries in the defense ministry. Putin has come down on the side of his defense ministry, and it's not clear at the moment what the consequences for that will be for Yevgeny Prigozhin. At the moment, he's being defiant, but it's going to be extremely interesting to watch just how long that defiance lasts, or just how long he lasts in that kind of situation, with Putin.",

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the gunman who killed 11 people during an attack on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, in October 2018.As CNN's Danny Freeman reports for us, this has been an emotional and intense trial. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A sacred house of worship turned into a hunting ground. That's how federal prosecutors describe the Tree of Life Synagogue as they began closing arguments, Thursday morning. The prosecution detailed the brutal executions of each of 11 worshippers, six of whom were shot in the head, and recalled the chaotic morning captured by 911 calls and body camera video. All to prove their case that defendant Robert Bowers killed Jewish people just because they were Jewish. The prosecution brought up a testimony of worshipper Dan Leger, the nurse who said he instinctively rushed toward the gunfire that morning but was shot in the stomach. He lay on these stairs pretending to be dad and prayed his yarmulke falling off his head. Body camera evidence showed first responders carrying Leger to safety. The prosecution also spoke about 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, and how the grandmother had with her daughter Andrea underneath the pew, Bowers sought them out and deliberately shot both of them, killing Rose. The prosecution said motive stemmed from years of anti- immigrant, in antisemitic online posts, made by Bowers, leading up to the shooting. And his admission to police that day that, quote, all Jews had to die. In his closing argument, the defense did not dispute that Bowers killed the 11 worshippers and wounded six other people. Instead, Bowers' attorneys attempted to reframe his motives, saying Bowers killed these worshippers not because they were Jewish, but because one congregation supported a refugee resettlement group. The defense argued, hatred of immigrants motivated the attack, while acknowledging his statements to police about those motives were unexpected, shocking, and irrational. While the most graphic pieces of evidence were not made public, the pictures released tell the story. Bullet holes in a memorial wall, shattered windows, a gun near a bloody children's book. And this prayer book, pierced by the gunman. (END VIDEOTAPE) FREEMAN (on camera):  Now, Jake, as jury deliberations began, we've actually got a statement from one of the congregations who lost three members that day almost five years ago from New Light Congregation, I would like to read part of it. It says: There can be no forgiveness. Forgiveness requires two components that it is offered, by the person who commits the wrong, and that it is accepted by the person who was wronged. The shooter has not asked, and the dead cannot accept. Now, if convicted, the death penalty phase would come next -- Jake.",

And Frances Haugen joins us now. Congratulations on your book. Fascinating stuff. Throughout the book, you talk about how Facebook got away with so much because it's software is closed off to the public.
