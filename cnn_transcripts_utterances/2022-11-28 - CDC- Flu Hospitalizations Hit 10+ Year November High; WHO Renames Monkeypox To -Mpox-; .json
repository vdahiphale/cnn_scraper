The entire city is under a boil-water notice after a purification plant lost pressure due to a power outage.The advisory effects more than two million customers. Water for drinking, cooking, washing hands and faces, even brushing teeth should be boiled for at least two minutes. Water pressure has been restored but the notice will likely remain until at least tomorrow. Do you feel like just about everyone is sick right now? It's not your imagination. The CDC says November flu hospitalizations are the highest they've been in more than a decade. I want to bring in CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen. Elizabeth, we are all about to gather even more for the holidays. Is it about to get even worse? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, it's possible it could get even worse. But, Ana, I haven't heard people say that they are fearful of some huge COVID surge, for example. And they're hopeful that flu will take a turn. Let's take a look at what flu looks like now. If you look at this bar graph, the bar all the way to the right, that is hospital rates at this point in the season for this year. All the other ones it's the same point in the season but for other years. In other words, by the end of November, we're seeing more -- higher flu hospitalization rates than we have in more than a decade. The hope is that this is the peak. The hope is that when we get new numbers next week it will start to go down. But of course, we can't predict that -- Ana?",

There's a concern that monkeypox that the word engendered stigma. I want to read to you a part of the letter that the New York City Department of Health wrote in support of getting rid of the word \"monkeypox.\" What the New York City Department of health said was, look, we are joining \"others expressing serious concern about using the word 'monkeypox' given the stigma it may engender and the painful and racist history within which terminology like this is rooted for communities of color.\" Just another note that monkeys have nothing to do with this virus.

      "sentences": "Right. So flavanols are an element in many different kinds of food. And I will get to which foods in a minute.It's unclear why it could have a good effect on memory. But we know that for individual nutrients, they can have an effect on various things, like memory or sort of inflammation, various processes that happen in the body. So these researchers took a look at large numbers of people, and they found not gigantic differences. It wasn't as if you ate these and, all of a sudden, you were, you know, a genius, and if you didn't eat them, you couldn't remember where you put your keys. It's not anything like that, but it made subtle and important differences in memory. Let's take a look at what the folks in the study ate, the flavanols they ate. A lot of them were eating kale, tomatoes, also high in flavanols, apples, broccoli and tea and wine. So you don't need to go out and get huge quantities of any of these. And certainly drinking huge quantities of wine may have other memory problems for you. But certainly these are healthy foods that are easy to incorporate into your diet -- Ana?",

I know you will keep looking for those answers. And if you get them, come on back. OK. If the economy is barreling towards a recession, someone forgot to tell American shoppers. Despite runaway inflation, higher interest rates, rollercoaster energy prices, online Black Friday sales in the U.S. just topped a record $9 billion. And the experts say to expect another record from today's Cyber Monday shopping extravaganza. CNN's Matt Egan is here with more on this. Matt, is this simply because everything costs so much more or are people actually shopping more?",

      "sentences": "Ana, that's a great question because these numbers are typically not adjusted for inflation. But Adobe analytics track online prices and they say online prices have actually been falling.So that means, if you do adjust for inflation, this does appear to be real growth. And that is good news because consumer spending is the main driver of this economy. On Black Friday alone, as you can see, online sales topped a record $9.1 billion. That was up about 2 percent from a year ago. There's also early signs that in-store sales on Black Friday were surprisingly strong. Today, on Cyber Monday, Adobe expects Americans to spend up to another $11.6 billion. That would be up by a healthy 8 percent from last year. Now, one of the reasons why people are willing to spend more and more money is not just those annoying emails and text messages we're getting from every store we have ever shopped at. It's because they are offering deep discounts. Adobe expects record discounts this holiday season, especially on Cyber Monday, somewhere between 15 percent and 30 percent off the listed price. As far as what people are buying right now, as you might expect, a lot of people are buying toys. We've seen a big increase in spending on toys. Other categories that have been popular include apparel, jewelry, sporting goods. Another interesting thing here, Ana, is how people are paying for their gifts. Because industry experts expect people to lean more on credit cards and to dip into savings. That is not a great sign and that is not sustainable. People are also turning to buy now, pay later, to try to break up those big-ticket purchases into monthly installments.",

They say especially when it comes to children and teenagers. Here is what Riverside P.D. is saying about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OFC. RYAN RAILSBACK, RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, POLICE DEPARTMENT: This is probably a little bit more extreme where you actually have someone travel from across the country to meet up with their victim. But this happens all the time. This is very frequent. This is just a very tragic example of how dangerous those interactions can be. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
