Residents joined a singing group performing carols on Christmas day, with some saying the songs helped lift their spirits. To the South in Kherson, some Ukrainians marked Christmas in church just a day after a deadly wave of Russian strikes targeted the city. And even on Christmas day, the sounds of shelling could be heard in Bakhmut, a frontline city that's been the scene of fierce fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Mr. Zelenskyy issued this warning ahead of the new year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Only a few days of this year left. You must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for us. Russia has lost everything it could this year, but it is trying to compensate for its losses with the gloating of its propagandists after the missile strikes on our country, on our energy sector.  I know that darkness will not prevent us from bringing the invaders to their new defeats. But we must be ready for any scenario. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's according to an interview with the state television.Mr. Putin says he's ready to talk with everyone involved about acceptable solutions but claims Ukraine is refusing to negotiate. Well, Ukraine says it's actually Russia who doesn't want to negotiate. In a tweet, the Ukrainian presidential advisor said, quote, \"Putin needs to come back to reality.\" And that it's Russia who's trying to avoid responsibility. Well, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, tensions with China and climate change. Nic Robertson has a preview of what to expect in global diplomacy in the new year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): This year's war in Ukraine, the biggest land war in Europe since 1945, is both a symptom of diplomacy's limits and a harbinger of potential decay to come. Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression is yet to be tamed by sanction or reason, despite diplomatic outreach. OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator):  I believe it's right to have constant discussions. There must be a moment where Russia realizes that it needs to get out of this situation. ROBERTSON (voice-over): China's Xi Jinping, whose increasingly bellicose diplomacy defying claims to Taiwan is watching Ukraine, learning possible international limits on his own potential land grab. Scholz, who is picking up his predecessor Angela Merkel's peacemaking mantle, used his recent visit to Beijing to try to shut down Russia's war and head off one over Taiwan. SCHOLZ (through translator): It is important for China to use its influence on Russia. It is about principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. ROBERTSON (voice-over): 2022 has tested diplomacy more than any other year in decades. On the upside, democracies have risen to the challenge. Diplomatic unity in the face of Russian aggression. [00:05:02]     EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): As war returns to European soil, we need to become brothers in arms once more. ROBERTSON (voice-over): On the downside, it's shown diplomatic words alone will not work. They need to be backed by military muscle.",

PUTIN (through translator): We will defend ourselves with all available means at our disposal. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Putin continues to tease the threat of a nuclear strike, potentially taking diplomacy in 2023 to its limits. FERNANDO ARIAS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, ORGANIZATION FOR PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS: It has exacerbated existing tensions to a point where unity of the international community cannot be presumed. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Add to this the increasing tensions with China, and 2023 is shaping up to be an even greater challenge than 2022.",

There will be another climate summit, too, but as this year's COP27 in Egypt showed, during global economic hardship, domestic politics trump collective salvation. The G20 in India could be a place where compromises are made. The war in Ukraine would be its 19th month, and by then, battlefield realities hard to ignore, despite Putin's new threats of a long war. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This will end, and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. ROBERTSON (voice-over): So the big diplomatic question for 2023: how to get Putin to agree. The answer may lie in the soaring food and energy costs triggered by the war. If the global situation worsens, collective pressure for some kind of peace will increase. The test of 2023: what to do if Putin ignores the warnings. Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is a very puzzling move. And it just adds to the concern out there that China may be attempting to conceal negative information about this COVID-19 outbreak.As cases are surging across the country, China's top health body has basically stopped reporting daily COVID case counts. On Sunday, the National Health Commission, or the NHC, said that all relevant outbreak information would, instead, be handled by one of the departments that it manages, a sub-department called China CDC. Concern is indeed rising about the true scope and scale of China's outbreak. Official figures have been unreliable, especially now, as China has stopped conducting those mass testing programs as it unwinds from years of zero-COVID regime. But data is still coming in from some provinces in some cities. For example, Zhejiang (ph) province. This is located just South of Shanghai. This is home to 64 million people. Health officials there are posting 1 million new COVID cases every day. And it's important to contextualize that number. According to CNN's calculations, that breaks down to about 1,563 new daily infections per 100,000 people. And health officials there in Zhejiang (ph) also add the peak of this outbreak will soon come. It will happen around New Year's. That's the next weekend when it will reach about 2 million new daily COVID infections. Also getting data coming in from Qingdao, which is the port city that is located in the North of the country. This is a city of about 9 million people. They're reporting about half a million new infections every day. Also, Dongguan. That's a major manufacturing hub. This is a city of 10 million people. It's reporting about 250,000 to 350,000 new infections a day. Now let's us bring up this statement I want to share from you from Dongguan health officials, just underscoring the increasingly dire situation there. They say this, quote, \"The peak of COVID infection is approaching. Infection numbers are increasing at an accelerating rate in Dongguan. Our health system and health workers are facing an unprecedented challenge and immense pressure,\" unquote. And despite that dire picture and despite the surge of infections and deaths across the country, we have heard recent data come out from China's CDC. Chinese officials now reporting zero COVID deaths for the six days leading up to Sunday. Back to you, Laila.",

It only happened three times until the year 2000. Now it's happened two out of the last six elections and both in the same direction, with the Republican losing the popular vote but winning the Electoral College because of their dominance of small, relatively sparsely-populated, predominately white rural interior states that are over represented in the Electoral College.

Obviously, the level of pressure that we have on the border is anonymously difficult for the states that are on the front line of it.But these political stunts, which really seem almost like FOX News programming with real-life consequences, from Republican governors in these states. Both the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. You know, that is not a solution either. Certainly, treating people as pawns in this way. Dropping them off on the sidewalk on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve on a frigid night. So inhumane that, you know, it risks a backlash.  I think Abbott and DeSantis, the two governors who have done this, feel empowered, because they won pretty convincing reelections. And there is a constituency in the Republican coalition for the -- you know, the toughest possible action in every way, which this would qualify as. But I think to most Americans, this seems gratuitous and cruel. And again, it really goes back to that previous answer. How is the Republican Party going to be defined over the next two years? They did very well in this election in states that already leaned in their direction, the so-called red states. But in blue states and in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, where they were hoping for inroads, they were decisively rejected by those swing suburban voters. Even though most of them are dissatisfied with the economy, which is very unusual in American politics. And so the question is, does the party over the next two years recalibrate in response to that? Or does it double down on kind of the Trumpian-style confrontational politics that this is representative of, at the risk of seeing the same thing in 2024?",
