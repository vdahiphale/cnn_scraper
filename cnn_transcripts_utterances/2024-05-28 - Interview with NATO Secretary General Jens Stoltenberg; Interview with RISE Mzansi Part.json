I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Eyewitnesses report Israeli tanks are moving in on Central Rafah for the first time since the assault on the city began in early May. This comes after a deadly airstrike there that killed at least 45 people and injured more than 200, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a tragic error. Global condemnation was swift. France, the E.U. and other governments call on Israel to immediately halt all Rafah operations as the International Court of Justice ordered on Friday. The White House calls the attack heart breaking. But will it shut down the flow of offensive weapons to Israel? Here, President Biden sets out a bright red line when speaking with CNN earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  They're going to Rafah.

It is Ukraine's second largest city, it's less than 20 miles from Russia's border, and it's essentially defenseless against Russian air attacks. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wants that to change at what may be the most critical moment since Russia first invaded. He's calling on allies to unshackle Ukraine from striking military targets in Russia with the weapons they've provided. And he joined me from NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss that.

And then, they tried to launch an offensive last summer, that didn't work. And now, the Russians are pushing. And the Russians are able to make some marginal gains. But we don't expect a big Russian breakthrough. Of course, there's always uncertainty, wars are unpredictable, but we expect the Russians to continue to push, pay a high price.

I welcome, of course, the decision to -- in the U.S. Congress to have a supplemental, to have more money, $60 billion extra for Ukraine. And also, the decision to also deliver more long-range systems, including the ATACMS. This is making a huge difference. And of course, Russian forces are partly inside Russia, for instance, in the Belgorod region, bordering Kharkiv, where the fighting is going on now. But there was an occupied Ukrainian territory in Donbas and in Crimea, and there are no restrictions by any ally. So, again, allies have different restrictions.

And that's my that's my message. Then, of course, I fully understand that NATO's task in this conflict is actually twofold. One is to provide support to Ukraine, as we do, and we have to step up.

Liberate 50 percent of the land, open a corridor in the Black Sea, sink many Russian ships, and continue to inflict heavy losses on the Russian forces. The problem over the last months is that there were some very serious delays, partly caused by the U.S. delay in agreeing supplemental for Ukraine, but also some delays in provision of ammunition from European allies. We need to minimize the risk for similar delays and gaps in the future. And that's reason why I have proposed NATO role, a stronger NATO role in coordinating the supplies.

It was the end of apartheid. Hope was sky high as Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won more than 60 percent of the vote. This Wednesday's election in South Africa could also be historic, but for very different reasons. The ANC could lose its majority for the very first time, as South Africa endures economic stagnation, high crime, and pervasive corruption. Now, among the many parties jockeying to supplant the ANC, one in particular is targeting disillusioned young voters by offering fundamental change. While the RISE Mzansi Party is unlikely to win anything like a majority, it could be a king maker in a new governing coalition. And its leader, Songezo Zibi, is joining me now from Johannesburg.

That's certainly what we had in the first 15 years of our democracy. We've lost it. And as a result, we're not able to deal with the many challenges that we have.

Because what hasmetastasized within and around the ANC are many corruption networks, at provincial level, at municipal level and at national government level, and it is impossible for any ANC president to ascend to power without the support of those networks. So, I hear what he says about successes against corruption, but very few people have been convicted of corruption. There are some cases that are in the courts, but they are moving at slower than a snail's pace. So, we need new leaders to clean house, appoint new sort of senior police officers, give them better equipment, better resources, and make sure that we can investigate corruption and put people in prison.

I think what we need to do, and this is what I and my colleagues at RISE Mzansi have done, have stepped forward, made use of the open democracy that we have, and all of us need to go around convincing people to vote, to vote for new leaders, to support the political reforms that we are putting on the table in order to improve accountability, as well as the opportunity for a more professionalized public service that is going to do the work of the South African people.

And if you've got a problem, let us know. I think that there is a great deal of understanding between parents and schools, and this is blown up out of proportion. The greater problem, and it is a very big problem, are the teenagers and young adults who do not know what consent is, who do think that putting your arms around someone's neck is fun for them. And I'm afraid because in my life, I speak to an awful lot of lawyers who represent an awful lot of children who've got in real trouble, you know, through not understanding what boundaries look like and what it is that they have a right to reject.

And it's also kind of a -- I don't know what to say, like a manifesto about how leaders should be thinking about Latino voters in the current moment. It does a lot of things. What made you want to write this book at this time. MIRANDA JR.:  When I started, it was supposed to be the manifesto part. I was getting increasingly pissed off that I kept reading all of these new experts of Latino politics that I've never heard of in my entire life. And I have been in this space for 45 years. I know a lot of people in this space, but they had read a couple of polls and all of a sudden, they were experts. And I kept complaining to my friends. And my friend said, why, rather than complaining, put them in paper you're 45 years of experience in this area. So, I started doing that. And as I did that, my family became more and more of a protagonist in the story of politics because a lot of what we do, we do it together as a family.

So, the discussions about what is the role of activists and political operatives at that point, we're talking about the '70s, right after the young lords, the debate was it's our job to fight for Puerto Rican independence within the United States, or there was an entire group of people who said, no, our job, because most of us are going to stay here, it's to rejoin other marginalized communities who are our neighbors and fight for the democratic rights and schooling and housing and health care of all of our communities.

But my parents were very much involved in the fabric of the town. Very different. It was the Red Cross, the Rotary Club, Lions International, sort of the kinds of civic organizations that work in small places and that help small places. So, we were always involved in some movement helping someone. So, coming to New York, I could not see any other way than getting involved. In fact, when my wife and I finished settling in Washington Heights 43 years ago, for me, it was important to end up in a neighborhood in New York, where it felt like a small town, where people knew each other, where people will gossip with each other, will fight with each other, but would help each other as well.",

And it's the debate that exists to this day. When Emanuel finished Wesleyan and came back to Washington Heights, and in the Heights becomes a hit. He could go anywhere. Well, he's settled in Washington Heights, where he's still raising his kids. My wife and I decided, after much debate, we're happy here. We're going to stay here and continue to stick it out in this neighborhood and make sure that this neighborhood survives.

So, where do you think that Democrats are getting this wrong? MIRANDA JR.:  That they're treating us as a voting bloc. And we are a bloc but not voting bloc. And you need to understand as Latinos disperse throughout the country, that where we come from, it's important. The political situation of the country, where we come from, it's also important. The generation that we belong to, it's important. The geography, it's important. Where were we born? Two-thirds of Latinos now are born in the United States. So, they are all of these variables that are going to impact our political reality. And as Democrats, we're not doing that. I'll give you an example. In 2000, we spent Latino Victory Fund, of which I'm the chair, a lot of resources in Georgia, even though Latinos are only 3 percent of the vote in Georgia, but we knew that they were right in a purple state. Do we take it? Because Republicans don't have to win the Latino vote. They just need to corrode and take away enough for us to lose those electoral votes. So, we spent a lot of time in Georgia.
