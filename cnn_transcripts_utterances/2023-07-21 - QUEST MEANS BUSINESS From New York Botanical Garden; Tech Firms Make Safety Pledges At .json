The markets were up 73, quarter of a point. Show you the triple stack as well, because the NASDAQ fell so sharply on the back of Tesla and Netflix, and it is a different story there. It is bouncing around the zero level for change for the NASDAQ. We'll watch it in the hour as we move forward. There is so much happening over the course of the hour. President Biden has announced an agreement with AI companies to develop AI more safely. Is that possible? We'll take a look. The heatwave is redrawing the map for tourists. We're going to discuss the economic impact of climate change, Nobel laureate, Paul Romer will be with me for that. And when you want to sweeten things up, the CEO Van Leeuwen Ice Cream on the expansion into summer flavors. Yes, indeed, it is a summer Friday, live from New York on Friday, July the 21st. I'm Richard Quest and at the New York Botanical Gardens, amongst the floribunda and the flowers and the trees, I most certainly mean business. Good evening to you. Summer Fridays, and today we are at the New York Botanical Gardens, where we'll be showing you the best that they have to offer. We'll be taking a look and we'll be talking about how this New York institution is preparing itself for the future. It is a green oasis to be sure, an urban jungle. It is in the Bronx and it is absolutely glorious and beautiful with people coming for all reasons to enjoy the views, to learn science, research, or if you're just like us, you've come here just to escape. We will be putting all of that into context as we have our Summer Friday and the ice cream. Let us not forget -- oh, there was a butterfly. I would -- but I'm sure we'll see plenty more of those before we are finished. We start though tonight with tech and the pledge from firms to have AI guardrails. Now, it was all set by the White House and it involved seven leading firms. All the biggies as you'd expect -- Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Inflection, Anthropic. They are making voluntary commitments. First of all, external testing before release. In other words, don't just dump something on the market and hope for the best. They're going to share risks of AI between each other. Proprietary is one thing, watching the world blow up is something else. They are going to have ways to watermark AI-generated content. Now, as for the US president, he recognized this wasn't the final answer, but it was an important, crucial first step. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Can they use AI for all kinds of malevolentreasons, like, for example, to create misinformation deepfakes? Or are we worried about the machines going mad instead of humans going mad and the machines essentially spinning out of control? And the short answer is, we're worried about both. Meta is incredibly important here for two reasons. One is it actually has released a whole new wave of AI tools very recently that people can use. They're doing this in the name of democratization, which sounds like a great idea until you think it's a bit like putting sort of nuclear power recipes out for everybody to read or nuclear weapon recipes for everyone to read. And the real danger here isn't nuclear bombs don't create more nuclear bombs, but AI enabled machines can create more powerful AI machines, it seems. But the other reason why it's important to think about Meta is that, essentially with the launch of social media, which in some ways was the first point of contact between humans and AI, if you like, the content curation. With a larger social media, there weren't these kinds of controls in place at all. You couldn't get the big companies to come together and agree anything. So in some ways, people are trying to learn from the bad Facebook experience of the past, and do a bit better with the second AI contact between AI and humans.",

And the White House is trying to walk a tightrope between making sure that the US has enough space toinnovate rapidly to make sure that China or even Russia, but primarily China doesn't leap ahead, but at the same time making sure that there are controls. Now, interestingly enough, the Chinese themselves have signaled to White House officials recently in backdoor channels that they would like to talk about some kind of joint collaboration or cooperation around trying to introduce some risk controls. This may just be a faint, but it may also indicate that the Chinese themselves are quite concerned about AI spinning out of control. Yes, they like the idea of using AI tools for authoritarian reasons but they don't like a world where suddenly the AI machines start to all crack jokes about Xi Jinping, or something else. So there is a lot to play for here, and the one thing that is very clear is absolutely everybody I know inside the AI world is concerned.",

      "sentences": "Parts of Southern Europe aren't just uncomfortably hot, but actually in some cases, dangerously hot.Looking at a heat map of Europe, you can see some of those hotspots. The land surface temperature hit 45 degrees Celsius in Rome, Italy and in Bucharest, Romania, and actually it reached 50 degrees Celsius in Nicosia, Cyprus and a city of Catania in Southern Italy. In fact, it is so hot that some tourist attractions like the Acropolis in Athens were closed for afternoons and in Rome, a command center has been set up to ensure tourists queuing to see attractions have access to water, misting stations, and shade. Around eight percent of Europeans surveyed by the European Travel Commission said the possibility of extreme weather was their biggest concern when planning a trip. Last summer, nearly 62,000 people died from heat-related issues in Europe according to the journal, \"Nature Medicine.\" Europe's Mediterranean does remain the most popular in terms of destinations for European travelers, according to the ETC, that may change. They say the number of European tourists planning to travel to the Med this summer and autumn has actually dropped by 10 percent from last year. Some of that may be attributed to issues around affordability given high inflation and a drop off from the post COVID tourism resurgence. However, they are also seeing a surge in popularity for countries like Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Ireland which have cooler climes. For those countries impacted by this heatwave, that kind of shift will be concerning. Many rely heavily on tourism that made up 18.5 percent of the Greek economy and more than 10 percent of Italy's according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. And scientists are clear that due to climate change, extreme weather events like this will only become more frequent and intense. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice over):   A fiesta of exquisite blooms with the hum of bumblebees and breathtaking greenery everywhere, summer is in full bloom here at the New York Botanical Garden. Founded during New York's Gilded Age, this beauty sits at the top of New York City. It is a 250-acre crown jewel. A million visitors flock each year to the Bronx, they come to see ever-changing grounds, bursts of color at the spring Orchid Show, the toy trains at Christmas, and the renowned artists who use these grounds as their canvas.
