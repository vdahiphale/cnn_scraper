      "sentences": "Well, I think it shouldn't come as a total surprise, Jim, that she was the first person that he selected for a major role in his upcoming administration. First of all, remember, Susie Wiles has been incredibly loyal to Donald Trump. As we have discussed, he values loyalty. really above all else. But I remind you that after he left the White House back in 2021, particularly after January 6, a lot of people who were close to the former president in his orbit really tried to distance themselves from him. Susie Wiles did not. She remained by his side and has remained very loyal since. So, that's one thing about one thing to keep in mind.The other thing about this as well is that she is very well respected within Donald Trump's team, and that's very hard to do for someone who has been in a top leadership role and really in power for several years now. People beneath her really like her. They see she's disciplined. They like the fact that she's not really someone who's always on camera or trying to get media attention for herself. She likes to hang back. That's another thing that they cited. But one thing that's very interesting, to your question about how we should think about how she'll operate, I mean, so we had great reporting from our colleague Steve Contorno, who said essentially that, you know, one of the key conditions for her taking this job was that she did not want the clown car going to the White House and said that Donald Trump agreed, and that's really kind of been Susie's motto this entire time, which is that she wants to control the chaos and really cut off access to some of the controversial figures trying to reach Donald Trump. So, I think keep that in mind as well as we look ahead to how she'll kind of control things from the inside. Jim.",

It has taken this long, but it's amazing -- it's great that Donald Trump did make history that way.Look, I've known Susie for a long time. She's as tough as they get. She's as compassionate as they get. What's amazing about Susie is that she's one of these people that if you are going to go to her with ideas and solutions to try to drive the ball forward, she'll have an open-door policy. If you want to go and just gossip, if you want to just start trying to get into the tit for tat games that have plagued a lot of politics, a little bit of the first administration, she has no time or business doing that. She's no interest in that. She just wants to drive the ball forward. And that's one of the reasons that Donald Trump trusts her. As he's gotten to know her, she's the longest serving campaign manager that he's ever had. And now, I think she's going to go on to possibly be the longest serving chief of staff he ever had.",

This is a continent in which people feel very strongly about what's happening in the Middle East. You have regular pro-Palestine protests. But here, really, what we're hearing from Dutch officials is their insistence on the anti-Semitic nature of what went on last night. And you heard that in the voice of the Dutch -- the mayor of Amsterdam, saying, look, there can be protests about events in the Middle East. There can be anger about what's happening in Gaza. What we saw last night was crime. And when you look at those videos, really shocking for those fans who were essentially chased through the streets of Amsterdam. Jim, hunted down in what Dutch authorities describe as hit and run attacks. Five of them ending up in hospital. All have now been released. And all of those Israeli supporters have now been accounted for. Several planes have been sent from Israel by the government to bring them back to Israel safely. But there are many questions going forward about how these kinds of events and that similar match taking place in Paris next week with the same Tel Aviv football team expected to attend, how Israeli fans can be kept safe and how supporters on either side can be kept from allowing those tensions to overflow and the sort of violence that we saw here in the Dutch capital overnight.

You can't just assume that this is credible information, this new evidence that everybody's talking about.But also, Jim, there's another twist to this, and there's this late application for clemency by the defense attorney that's happening. Now, this clemency request might actually overshadow the resentencing hearing as well. It might stand and take priority, and it came about in a really crazy way. The defense attorney heard Governor Newsom on a podcast over the weekend saying, I've been looking at this Menendez case. In fact, Ryan Murphy, who created the monsters movie came to me nine months ago and told me, hey, I just made this show about, you know, monsters, about the Menendez brothers. You need to a heads up because people are going to talk about it. There's just going to be a lot of attention. And so, Newsome has had this on his radar for nine months. He said, my kids have been asking me about it because they're seeing it on social media. And he said, it's going to eventually come to me. I've been watching what the D.A. has been doing, I know that the D.A. has made a recommendation, now the court has to make -- you know, decide if it was going to be resentenced, if it goes to the parole board, then it comes to me. Well, Garagos, the defense attorney, said, why should I wait for all of that? I'm just going to make a direct request for clemency right to Newsom because clearly, it's on his mind. And so, he did and he got Gascon to make the same request. So, there's two requests for clemency for the Menendez brothers on the desk of the governor right now.
