It's the latest stop on his whirlwind diplomatic tour to boost support ahead of his country's expected counteroffensive against Russian forces.CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak joins me now live from Hiroshima, Japan.

      "sentences": "Yes, we did see him land here around 3T-shirt, descend the stairs and now he is in a motorcade of cars, heading here into the Hiroshima city center, where he will meet with G7 leaders tomorrow. Of course, he is bolstered as he enters these talks by this decision from President Biden, to allow the transport of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. That, of course, had been something that President Zelenskyy has been asking for, for quite a long time. He called it a historic decision ahead of these talks. So he is really entering quite an important moment in the war in Ukraine. Now President Zelenskyy just tweeted a few moments ago, saying that he was here for important meetings with partners and friends of Ukraine and that peace will become closer today. Of course, you cannot separate his arrival here in Hiroshima without the backdrop of what this city means and the significance that it lends to his warnings about Russian escalation. Of course this is the city that was leveled by an American atomic bomb in 1945. And so certainly he is eager to harness the symbolism of this moment. The Japanese government said earlier today that President Zelenskyy and the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, had spoken and that Zelenskyy expressed a strong desire to come to this meeting face to face, in person, to talk to these leaders and talk about the importance of maintaining unity in Ukraine. But it's not just the G7 itself who are here in Hiroshima. There are several other leaders who were invited to participate in the summit, including from India, Brazil, other nations, who have not been as forthright as the members of the G7 in condemning the Russian aggression. And I think it will be hard for them to maintain that stance potentially as they hear from Zelenskyy himself, see him face to face. That will be quite an important moment. You know, it really is so interesting; it was only less than 10 years ago that Russia was a member of then the G8. Of course, it was removed after it invaded Crimea. Now less than 10 years later, it will be President Zelenskyy, who is sitting around that table, really quite a historic moment, historic time here in Japan, Laila.",

We have issued now 10 sanctions packages. But you are also asking for, where does this lead to? We are working very hard together with Ukraine for a just peace. This is our goal. And, therefore, we are supporting the peace formula of President Zelenskyy. I think this is an excellent starting point to work toward a just peace that Ukraine really deserves.

This is extraordinary.And most importantly, we have cut completely Russia's access to technologies. And we see already degradation of the military base, the military industrial base. We see effects on the economy. We see the shrinking revenues that Russia has from its fossil fuels. For example, the oil price cap has a strong effect. And what we also see is, of course, that there is -- if you have sanctions, there are always some who try to do a sanctions circumvention or evasion. And therefore we now issue the 11th package of sanctions that focuses on circumventions. So we are discussing how to target companies, entities, where we see literally that they buy goods in the European Union and, by a third country, bring them to Russia. But we also target the transit via Russia that might contribute to circumvention of sanctions. So there's a whole package that looks at these evasion, this sanction evasion, and this is a package we're going to issue in a few days.",
