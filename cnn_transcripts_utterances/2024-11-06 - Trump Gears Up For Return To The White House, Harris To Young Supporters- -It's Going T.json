Mr. Trump will assume the presidency for a second time with Republicans in control of the US Senate, aiding his agenda. Still undecided whether the GOP will keep control the majority of the House of Representatives, or whether Democrats will win it back and gain a check on the Trump administration's power. We could get an update on that this evening. Anchors Kaitlan Collins and Abby Phillip are covering every angle of the Trump victory and the Harris defeat and what might happen next. First to Kaitlan in West Palm Beach, Florida near Mar-a-Lago. Kaitlan, what is happening inside Trump world nearly 24 hours after his historic victory?",

I've talked to people who have been around him who say, essentially his phone has been glued to his ear as he's been having conversations, not just with tech leaders, with Republican allies, also world leaders have been making their phone calls, knowing that they are not bracing for a Trump return to the Oval Office and what that is going to look like.And while he is on the phone, his aides have been working on the transition process and what a return to the White House is going to look like and I am told that what Trump is seeking to do in part of this is reward those who have been loyal to him over the last two years. His access to influence has changed greatly since he last left Washington. He is going to be seeking to reward those people. People like Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Howard Lutnick, and others and Kristen Holmes, we have been talking to sources all day about this at really what this process has looked like behind the scenes. It has almost been frantic to a degree as people are either jockeying for positions, or seeking to gain influence, and also just still processing that this race was decided as soon as it was.",

They want to tiptoe around Donald Trump in the sense that they are trying to figure out ways to say they want to serve him without looking like they want something. Donald Trump does not react well when people come to him saying, they just want something.As you noted, there are a lot of people in line to be rewarded by the former president because of their loyalty when others were not there, and because they were by him on the campaign trail, Elon Musk, RFK, Jr. RFK, Jr., there was a lot of negotiating behind the scenes before he endorsed Donald Trump and dropped out of the race. What exactly he was promised seems to vary, depending on who you talk to. He obviously has said, he has been promised some kind of Cabinet position or overseeing all of these health organizations. We have heard from your interview with Howard Lutnick that that is likely not possible. But there are a lot of people who are seeking rewards and pitching themselves right now to Donald Trump and Susie Wiles and those in his inner circle trying to get traction on a potential administration post.

This was her moment to speak to thousands at Howard University, her alma mater , where they gathered last night hoping for the best and that night ended not the way she wanted, or any of them wanted. And she was speaking to millions of Americans who now, frankly, feel lost. This was a speech that was about fundamentally the path forward and the key part, Jake, of what she said was that, she concedes the race, but she does not concede the ideals of her campaign effectively. Now, the question becomes, what does the Democratic Party do? What role does Kamala Harris have in it? And, Jeff Zeleny, you are here with me here in Washington, as we have been covering the last 24-36 hours for Harris and her aides. It has been incredible whiplash and she had a really tough job tonight, which was to capture the anger, the fear, the confusion, and move people into a forward-looking posture, as they face what she has been telling them is going to be an existential threat to the country. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Abby, it was so extraordinary. This is the speech, obviously, she did not want to give. Concession speeches are not ones candidates like to give. They do not always come. But she did appear at Howard University to her supporters.

The reality is, she has 75 more days to be serving in the White House here behind us.

There are 4,100 something counties and townships across the United States of America, right? So you can look at it statewide like this red states and blue states. But if you look at it, one of the conversations Democrats are going to have after this election is maybe we should stop calling this flyover country. They're hardworking Americans, like David just noted, people who make less than $100,000 a year and these are red states, so are Democrats going to flip them right away? No, but they better learn to understand and to communicate with these people.Now, I want to follow up on one of the points David just made, and ask him a question about it actually. I just want to come down here and show, he was just talking about Trump's growth among Latino voters. So let's bring this in right here. These are counties across the country where the Hispanic population is 30 percent or more, right? That's what you're seeing on the map right now. They are mostly, you see some in Florida, a little bit in the east, but they're mostly, as you come here into the Southwest. If they're blue, Harris won them. If they're red, Trump won them. So I would just want to walk through this, right? Democrats have been saying for years, we're going to make Texas competitive. We're going to make Texas blue. Look at all these counties where the Hispanic population is 30 percent or more carried by Donald Trump in the state of Texas. People at home are saying, oh, well, Texas is Republican, don't make such a big deal about that. Well, let's move over to New Mexico, still a blue state, but a narrower margin that we've seen in years past. If you look at that right there, and again, look at Trump winning these counties where the Hispanic population is 30 percent or more. And then I want to bring David in on this point. Come over here. This is Arizona, right? A battleground state that Donald Trump is -- we haven't called it yet, but he's leading it. And David, you see there, even here, Pima County, it's a big county. Tucson, second largest county in the state, below Maricopa County. Yes, Harris wins this county with 41 percent. But look at the -- look at the difference. Trump gets a little bit of points. And then you come down here to the border, Santa Cruz County, right at the border, right? Trump against Biden gets 32 percent if you round up there and then bam, up to 40 percent. So it's the growth, David, among these Latino voters in Arizona, in Nevada that are making those battleground states trended his way, at least in this cycle. And you see it in other places as well.

So now, you're looking at African-American counties.

Donald Trump winning counties where the African-American population is 30 percent or more. That used to be, the math worked this way, you have 30 percent or more of the black vote, that's a foundation for the Democrats. Then you just got to get to 50, right, in those counties.

First, let's look at the state of play, the balance of power in the U.S. House. Democrats hold 191 seats with two pickups, Republicans 208 with six pickups, 30 seat -- 36 seats remain yet to be determined. You need 218 for control of the chamber. So you see Republicans are only about 10 seats away. When it comes to Democrats trying to take control of the chamber, let's talk about the magic number that they need.Right now, Democrats need eight Republican seats. They need to flip those eight Republican seats to take control of the chamber. They're currently leading in four Republican districts, and that's not really an indicator of the whole picture because Republicans are currently leading in two seats where Democrats hold that district. So really it's a net gain of two seats for Democrats, far below the eight that they would need. Let's look at some key race alerts right now to show you where things stand in two very important races. The first in New York's fourth district, this is in Long Island, a district that Joe Biden won by double-digits back in 2020. There, Laura Gillen, the town supervisor has a lead of about 6,000 votes against incumbent Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, a former NYPD detective. 92 percent of the vote in that district in New York, the Democrat in the lead, poised to potentially flip it. The opposite is true in Alaska's At-Large district. Here, you have Republican Nick Begich currently leading against incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Mary Peltola. Peltola a freshman, the first native Alaskan to ever serve in the U.S. Congress. [20:45:00] She actually won two years ago in large part because Alaska has ranked choice voting, and she went up against two Republicans who effectively canceled each other out. Now, only going up against one Republican, you see where it stands. She's 11,000 votes ahead, 71 percent of the vote in, in Alaska. Jake?",

He's the current number two, the Republican whip.He's had this -- been in the Senate since 2005. He did back Tim Scott, the Republican Senator, for president. He had a bit of a fraught relationship with Trump for some time. He has tried to bolster those ties as of late, but he's also facing up against Senator John Cornyn. Cornyn was a two-time Chair of the Senate GOP Campaign Committee, himself a former Republican whip, used to be the number two in that position. He has spent years trying to build a fundraising apparatus, spending -- pouring millions of dollars into his potential votes, his colleagues campaign accounts over the many years here. But, the question is, will that ultimately help him get the votes at the end of the day? And then there's a third candidate in this race, Senator Rick Scott. He's -- he just won re-election last night to his second term in Florida. He was a former Senate GOP campaign chairman himself, trying to align himself more as being the Trump candidate in this race. He did back Trump before the Iowa caucuses, but he is seen a bit of more of a long shot in this race, Jake, because this is a race that is typically you win by relationship building within the United States Senate.

Well, first off, Jake, when you did my debate back in the 2014 race, we've doubled our votes. We got 6 million votes this time. We got about 3.1 last time, nearly 6 million this time. We won by over a million votes. This state is clearly red. The Hispanic vote, which you've just been talking about clearly was the game changer. La Florida is roja. I've been working to make sure we win the Hispanic vote. We won Miami by 10 points. We won Osceola County, which is primarily Puerto Rican. We won that one. We won all of our major cities, the counties there and except for one, the -- I put a lot of effort in making sure we get the Hispanic vote. They -- I think they -- we did it because they know that Republicans are going to help them. My case, what I always talk about is living the dream of this country, we all need to do it, didn't matter the color of your skin, you ought to have that dream. So I think Florida now has become the center of the Republican Party in the country. And I think the rest of the country can learn a lot about what we've done in Florida. Now with regard to the Senate majority leader race, I think I'm going to win because I'm talking to my colleagues about what they want and here's what they want. They want change. They want to be part of the process. They don't -- they want to be treated as equals. They want somebody who has a relationship with Trump. They want somebody that has a plan.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a diverse community, so they don't usually speak with one monolithic voice. But I think with regard to vaccines, people are in pretty much universal agreement here that some of his comments really stand the possibility of rewinding lots of decades, generations really of public health advances. So, that is a real concern. The challenge, I think, is at the same time, he says things that there's a lot of agreement on, the Make America Healthy Again movement. I mean, he's not the first person to talk about this Anderson, but the idea that as -- in the United States, we spend $4.5 trillion on healthcare and we have some of the worst health outcomes in the developed world is true. Again, he's not the first person to bring this up, but those are true statements and a lot of those negative impacts can be attributed to food. 70 percent of chronic disease in this country probably related to how we nourish ourselves. So, we're spending all this money, creating this disease, and trying to fix it. And on that, he makes a lot of good points. Might he be able to get something done in that area? We're not sure.

I mean, there's a whole process. It's very similar to any other drug. They go through these trials. And then with vaccines in particular, like with COVID vaccine, for example, you have billions of people, Anderson, who've taken it around the world. So you have a lot of post- market data, meaning you follow people over time. He has also talked -- he continues to talk about the link between vaccines and autism.

Kids who've been vaccinated, kids who've not been vaccinated, follow them along and see are there increased levels of autism in those who've been vaccinated, and the answer is no. This has been a widely studied thing. People were concerned, so they studied it for 15, 20 years worth of data. There was one study that came out in 2018 that said the kids who were not vaccinated may have actually been more likely to be on the autism spectrum. So, that issue has really been studied. It was raised, you and I talked to Andrew Wakefield many, many years ago. He was the first person to really raise that. It's been debunked, but he continues to bring this up. We don't know what causes autism, but we know the vaccines don 't, Anderson.",
