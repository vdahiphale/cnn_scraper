This move from Iran comes after several events, includingan Israeli military ground operation targeting militant group Hezbollah earlier that day. A source from a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said the Israeli military staged sporadic raids across the Lebanon-Israel border, but that Israeli troops did not stay on Lebanese soil. The incursion came after hours of artillery fire from Israel across the border into Lebanon. Recently, Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people, destroying homes and displacing an estimated 1 million people in Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a back-and-forth escalation since the war in Gaza began last October. Hezbollah attacked Israel on October 8th and has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave. Hezbollah also said it would choose a new leader as soon as possible after Israel assassinated its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, last week. Israel`s escalation in its fight with Hezbollah and Iran`s direct attack opened a new and dangerous phase in nearly a year of war in the region. The U.S. has put pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah and in the war with Gaza, following growing concerns over a more wide scale war. Ten second trivia. What condiment was used for what was thought to be its medicinal qualities in the 1800s? Mustard, ketchup, wasabi or mayonnaise? Hands up if you said ketchup. Did you know that it was made into pills sent to cure conditions like indigestion and jaundice? All right, we should try to never take moments for granted. Life can be ephemeral. Over the summer, a listeria outbreak sickened and even took the lives of people from more than a dozen states across the U.S. The foodborne bacterial illness was traced back to a Boar`s Head plant in Virginia, where a USDA investigation uncovered issues in the factory like insects and mold. Boar`s Head issued a recall and discontinued some products and closed the plant where the outbreak originated. But now the plant`s closure means an entire town will feel the impact of lost jobs and businesses. CNN`s Meena Duerson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
