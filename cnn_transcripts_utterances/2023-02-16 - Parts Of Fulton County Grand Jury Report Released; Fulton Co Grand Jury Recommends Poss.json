Nine pages, our first glimpse at the final report from the Georgia grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump has landed. Two lines, though, are guaranteed to send witnesses who went under oath into a legal panic.Plus, the president gets his physical and it underlines that uncomfortable question for Mr. Biden, and for the Democratic Party is 82 old to run again. And today, new details in the Michigan State rampage. The students who were wounded, they are improving but they're not out of the woods yet. And the gunman who took his life as officers closed in, and this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A majority of the panel says, at least one witness lied under oath, and should be indicted for perjury. And the panel voted unanimously to reaffirm the clear truth that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.With me to help break all of this down is CNN's Sara Murray, CNN legal and national security analyst Carrie Cordero, and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams. So, all three of you, thanks for being here. I mean, we now know a tiny bit more at emphasis on tiny, this - we knew that this was going to be redacted. But this is pretty bare bones. What does that tell you? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, it is pretty bare bones. And I think that the judge was really clear that he was not going to make a lot of this public because, I think a lot of the report names, names, to be honest. A lot of the report names, names, some of people who did not appear before the grand jury, and perhaps some of people who have not been charged with anything yet. So, in the interest of fairness, in the interest of due process, he didn't want to make these names public, while the district attorney is deciding who if anyone, she's going to bring charges against. But I do think you get a little bit of a tone and tenor of the grand jury in these limited sections. They release, you know, they're very explicit in saying that they have interviewed all these witnesses. They've talked to all these technical experts. And they see, there was no evidence of widespread fraud. And they're also very explicit in their belief that one or more witnesses lie to them. And essentially telling the district attorney look, if you agree with us, if you think the evidence is there, go for it.",

It says, a majority of the grand jury believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it. And the grand jury recommends that the district attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where evidence is compelling. I think it's striking to me also, Carrie, actually that we have this part of the report. Maybe it suggests that the part that we don't have is even more significant than that.CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well. So, it is unusual just to even have this type of report issued from a grand jury. Georgia's rules are a little bit different than other locations. And when the judge had to make the decision whether or not to even release this. What he was most concerned about was the issue of fundamental fairness. And that's why we don't see any names in here. That's why it's such a limited amount of information. Because the individuals who were affected by this, if they are potentially charged, they need to be able to have due process and they need to be able to have constitutional protections and defend themselves. And so, that's why this is so limited. And again, it's up to the prosecutors whether they think there is compelling evidence to move forward at this point.",

Number two, that it was something material that it actually mattered, but also three that they knew that the statement they were making was untrue.So, there's a few pieces of evidence there.

She kept referring to future defendants when she was speaking in court.So, you know, she was definitely sending the signal that indictments are likely to come. And you know, in my previous conversations with her and other interviews that she's done, she's laid out the potential of pursuing, you know, a RICO case, a racketeering case. So, that allows you to say, you know, there was more than just this call between Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, that set this all into motion. There were lots of other pieces at play, whether that was, you know, attempts to harass election workers, whether that was attempts to lie to state lawmakers, whether it was the fake electoral scheme.

Now, it was made known to the former president and individuals around him, and yet they still proceeded with trying to find the extra votes and so on, then, yes. Any number of those charges could be brought, including things that have nothing to do with elections, such as lying under oath, and so on. It just all is going to come down to what it is clear that and that they can establish that the president knew that the president people around the president knew and just how they prove it and bring it in.

The first, a source tells CNN that Smith hit Mark Meadows, the former Trump chief of staff with a subpoena. And sources and court documents hints at the big legal net that Smith is casting a special - casting the special counsel quote, is locked in at least eight secret court battles that aim to unearth some of the most closely held details about Donald Trump's actions after the 2020 election and his handling of classified materials.With us now is CNN's Paula Reid, along with Carrie and Elliot who are still here. So, Paula, you're breaking a lot of this reporting. Tell us about what you think this is showing about where we are in Jack Smith's special counsel investigation. He's on the scene now and he's making his presence known. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, and Mark Meadows is not just a witness, he is the witness, particularly when it comes to January 6. We know from the House investigation. We know from our own reporting that all roads, all questions eventually end with Mark Meadows. He is the man with the information and the answers. He was in the Oval Office on January 6. He was at these meetings, key meetings in the course of this timeline, even starting before the election and past January 6, trying to push false claims about election fraud, pressuring the states. But we know this is setting up a legal fight. And the question is what form will that take? Former President Trump's lawyer told me just a few days ago, they will assert executive privilege over any key top Trump adviser who goes into testify. So, there'll be a privilege fight. And it's unclear if he's going to bring his own claims or his own legal fights. And he can also ultimately try to take the fifth if he does have to testify here.

Because they just would not issue a subpoena to somebody that they were actively working with getting testimony from. So, there's that.Number two, he probably might have provided documents or something useful before. And maybe they want to now get him sworn and put on the record in some way.

So, we have all these different branches of government that where they are asserting privileges. And that process will play out. One of the questions I've always had, Abby, when it comes to the Trump administration is, even though he claims have strong executive authorities, and they are trying to push the bounds of those, whether the end result will actually be a weakening of the institution of the presidency. If the justice department is able to push through the courts, and actually compel testimony from the former chief of staff, from the former vice president. That actually in the really longer term is going to weaken the institution of the presidency and future presidents and executive branch officials' ability to use these privileges.",

So, the elephant in the room. And can we even call it that because it is being talked about so much, is President Biden's age.

EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Right, this isn't like breaking news, Joe Biden is 80. We know it. And the question that we went into this with was, how are they going to make this into, for them strength rather than a liability. One Biden adviser said to me, I've got two words for you, wisdom and experience. That was a thing that was pressed by a lot of people that we talked to. Other people talked about how they would try to make him out as the guy who's been around, who's calm and competent, knows what he's doing. And have that be a contrast to the chaos that they're going to try to play up from the Republicans. There's a story in there from Mitch Landrieu, the White House infrastructure coordinator, who was meeting with a bunch of Democratic mayors who were really feeling antsy about the age question. And he said, people want to talk about one number that the president is 80, but we got to talk about all these other numbers, like the number of COVID shots that have been put in arms, jobs, unemployment rate, where all those numbers are and talk about the record. But all of that is with this very clear thing that is very much showing up in a lot of people's minds and focus groups and polls. The president is old. It's a concern for people. I talked to one person who did, who was part of a number of focus groups that were done last year all over the country said that words like brain musher that he's not up to the job, come up all the time.
