The judge ruling that he will not be focused on as a producer. Now, what the jurors will have to grapple with here, Kate, is one hand, it can still be criminal for someone to be engaged in an accident --ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I am Erica Hill; this is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead this hour, one day after Russia carries out a deadly daytime bombardment of Ukraine, NATO leaders set to gather in Washington, where all eyes will be on U.S. President Joe Biden as his re-election campaign is under increasing pressure. We are live in Kyiv and at the White House this hour. Plus, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting a warm welcome in Moscow, but criticism from other world leaders for that visit. And Alec Baldwin on trial, jury selection about to get underway later this morning in the Hollywood actor's involuntary manslaughter trial. We do begin this hour with some major developments and of course, all of this unfolding amid the political uncertainty here in the United States and so many questions about President Joe Biden and what will happen for him moving forward. This, as in Ukraine, the nationwide death toll from Monday's Russian attacks has now risen to 39, search and rescue operations still continuing. The U.N. Security Council is gearing up now for an emergency meeting, we are told that will happen soon, all of this of course, after the attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv. This is some footage that you're looking at here, of the moment when that missile struck. The war in Ukraine expected to be top of the agenda, of course, as the NATO Summit begins in just a few hours in Washington, D.C. But of course, that is coming alongside intense scrutiny of U.S. President Joe Biden after his faltering debate performance against Donald Trump last month, which just triggered a slew of questions which have not abated in this country. Mr. Biden, of course, hosting the leaders of NATO's 32 member countries as they mark the 75th anniversary of the world's largest security alliance. Let's take you straight to Kyiv now. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is on the scene there at that children's hospital. Massive damage behind you, Fred, bring us up to speed on where things stand this morning and what we know?",

In fact, I am going to get out of your way and asked for Cameraman Alex to come forward. You can see the full extent of what happened when that missile struck. I know you were just showing that video of that missile apparently coming in. What you see over there, that is where a building used to stand. That was a large part of the largest children's hospital here in Ukraine. But you can see it's just a wide gap there. This has just in the last couple of minutes actually turned into cleanup operations. There's no more search and rescue going on here.The death toll from just this place alone here in Kyiv is two people killed and dozens of people wounded. Of course, we know that in all of Kyiv, 29 people were at least killed in that missile attack that took place. But there's certain things that when you look at them, Erica, you can see just how powerful that explosion was. You can see over there, that used to be a floor in that children's hospital which, obviously, completely collapsed. And if we pan down a little bit, you can see that there's a car right underneath that has been absolutely flattened by that debris that's been coming down. So it was definitely a very powerful explosion that took place here. Some of the initial video that came out from that was the first responders on scene, but then also, the hospital staff who had actually gone into the bunker because there was an air raid alert, they immediately came out and started clearing debris with their bare hands, hoping to find survivors under it. Of course, the explosion itself, Erica, we are right in the middle of Kyiv, we are right in the middle of a big urban center, was so powerful that you can see another building, several other buildings actually, in this very large compound, also seeing massive destruction as well. There are all the windows blown out, large parts of the facade also destroyed. The Ukrainians, of course, are saying that they will respond to this, but they also say that this once again showcases the fact that they need better and more air defense systems from their western partners, Erica.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think there's two views on this, obviously, (inaudible) acutely aware of the domestic political interest that President Biden is experiencing right now over his health because they get similar types of scrutiny back home over all their moves. So there'll be very familiar with the predicament that he's in and the indications are that they will be to a degree sympathetic, certainly in personal conversations with him and that's the indication we've heard from Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, who saw President Biden at the G7 Summit in person just about a month ago now.That summit -- fair to say, President Biden arrived half an hour late on both days, kept all the other leaders waiting for him and appeared almost to be sort of ticked off by the host, the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. So these leaders are familiar with him, familiar with the pressure that he's under. But I think the overarching thing for them is what is happening to the United States more broadly, is it tending to become more isolationist, which leaves the 30 members of NATO, 30 leaders of NATO who are from European countries, does it leave them look into themselves more to establish their own security rather than depend wholly on the Transatlantic Alliance, knowing that if Donald Trump was to win the presidency then that would be a bigger and more serious and perhaps more immediate question. So, you have the British prime minister, first time that he'll be meeting with President Biden. They will be having a bilateral, his foreign secretary who's traveling with him has written about this quite recently saying, clearly, you know, the U.K. and Europe need to look to their own security as the United States -- it's attention becomes increasingly focused on the Indo-Pacific, and that will be a component of the NATO Summit. So I think that there's two levels. But I don't think you're going to find any other leaders speaking publicly against President Biden at this time. They wouldn't expect visiting dignitaries to their own country to do that of them, whatever the domestic political pressures. But yes, for sure, those concerns are genuine and exist about the future the direction of the United States foreign policies.",

Well, this afternoon, there's been a fascinating exchange where the two delegations, the Indian and Russian ones with their leaders sitting side-by-side, Vladimir Putin makes a few cursory remarks about friendship and about deepening the relationship and then Narendra Modi spoke at length, perhaps three times as long as Putin did, covering a number of different issues. And then going on with what I would only describe really as a lecture about peace, about how heartbreaking it is to see innocent children killed, and then he went on and said this.

It is up to them how long it will go then for their deliberation. Interestingly, here in court yesterday, there was a significant development, a win of sorts for Actor Alec Baldwin. All along, prosecutors had not only wanted to focus on his role as the actor who was holding that gun when it went off killing the film's cinematographer, but also his role as a producer on the set, saying that there was this culture of unsafe practices that he should have been aware of. The judges today ruling that, that producer role will not be part of this prosecution, so a significant loss there for the prosecution. One thing that we are going to be watching for as this goes on is what the judge does as she is trying to keep control between these two sides. We've seen in these pre-trial hearings a lot of frequent clashes between both sides. Interestingly, I think Erica, we are all used to watching trials and you'll hear a prosecutor or defense attorney object in court. The judge says that no, we are not going to have any that, that itself could be seen as theatrical. And so, if either of those attorneys have an issue, they'll have to approach the bench and then explain what that issue is, and the judge will rule. So she is going to keep a tight grip on both sides as this gets underway. Again, jury selection starting here, just a short time then the trial itself.

A source telling CNN, Rubio will be at the event tonight.CNN's Alayna Treene is tracking the Trump campaign, joins us now. So, there is the whole lot of speculation, of course, about what could happen tonight at that rally, what we could learn.

Donald Trump has really been trying to lay low over the past week and let Joe Biden and the hand-wringing in the Democratic Party and the questions over whether or not they believe that the president is fit to serve for another four years really take center stage, but that is changing today with this rally at his Doral resort in Miami. Now, Miami is home to Senator Marco Rubio, it is where he is from.And so, the location of this rally has definitely led to a lot of speculation that perhaps this will be his vice presidential announcement. Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's team, they say not to read too much into it, even though Senator Marco Rubio will be there. I am told he is the only top contender, and we know that there's three top contenders right now that Donald Trump is considering on his, what I'll call his shortlist, which is Rubio, but also Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Rubio is the only one of them those three who will be present at this rally. But look, even from Donald Trump himself, we heard him last night in an interview with Sean Hannity, say that he is still deciding and mulling this decision over. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I haven't made final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we are going and a little bit. We wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest, because you know, it might make a difference. I don't know, I'm not sure that it would, but there are those who say Trump's waiting until he finds out what is going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.

I can tell you from my conversations with Donald Trump's top advisers that it, of course, is impacting who he may pick. But remember, Erica, Donald Trump set a self-imposed deadline of announcing who his running mate will be a little bit before or at the Republican National Convention next week. I starts just one week from today, and I am told as well that he could announce as late as July 15, the start of that week. And so we are still waiting to see.I also think it's important to note that this weekend he has another rally. It's in Butler, Pennsylvania. It's essentially on the border of Pennsylvania and Ohio. And remember, Ohio is where Senator J.D. Vance is from, so that's leading to some questions as well. But from my conversations, Donald Trump is still thinking this over, as he told Hannity, and it's unclear when he will ultimately make that big announcement.

So we will have to see how France sets up and how Mbappe comes out and how Didier Deschamps, who said in his press conference earlier this week, that he didn't care if people thought that France's football was boring, you could watch something else. As to Spain, it's their young boys you've done all of the hard work for them and upfront, in particular, Yamal and Nico Williams, in particular the two real youngsters and standout stars for the Spanish team.
