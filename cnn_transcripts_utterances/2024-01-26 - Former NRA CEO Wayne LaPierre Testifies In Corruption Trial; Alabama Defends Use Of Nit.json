Let's discuss with CNN chief law enforcement analyst, John Miller. John, what are you learning about his testimony? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, he's been on the hot seat today in the State Supreme Court, being examined by an assistant attorney general from New York State. This is the case that was brought by the New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Parentheses, that's the same New York State attorney general who has the case against Donald Trump and his business in the same courthouse. But as this unfolded today, LaPierre was called to answer from the assistant attorney general, John Conley: What about the trips to the Bahamas? What about the safaris and Africa? What about the private yachts that were paid for by NRA vendors? Most of his answers were boiled down to yes or no, until he was put on the hot seat about why he declared bankruptcy from the NRA. And that got into a testy exchange between, he, the prosecutor, and the judge, who overruled some of the testimony. Where he said this was all for political purposes and the New York State attorney general considers the NRA a terrorist organization. But, Boris, this is an existential trial for the NRA, not just Wayne LaPierre, who has already resigned from his position that he's held since 1991. This is about how the organization will come out on the other side and if it will still exist in its current form.",

Now the big question here is, will other states follow Alabama's lead and how quickly? We know Mississippi and Oklahoma have allowed the use of nitrogen gas in executions. We did hear back from Oklahoma. A spokesperson from the Department of Corrections, who says, we should not expect -- they are not planning for nitrogen gas anytime soon. That is because of the way that the law is written there in Oklahoma that only permits the use of nitrogen gas if they can't find the drugs necessary for a lethal injection. We did ask them whether there is a shortage, as we've seen so many other states struggling to find those drugs. They said they do not have a shortage. The only other path, too, is if lethal injection is suddenly deemed unconstitutional -- Brianna?",

Currently, there are no federal laws against sharing or creating fake images. Though nine states do have laws against non-consensual deepfake pornography. Let's discuss with technology journalist, Laurie Segall. Laurie, thanks much for being with us. Let's take a step back, because I think deepfake technology is still so relatively new that a lot of folks may not be familiar with it.

We now have A.I. and A.I. image generators that essentially mimic our most human qualities. They can imitate our voice. They can imitate our words. They can imitate our bodies. And the bottom line is, it's becoming increasingly -- the perception of truth is just it's there. You might see something and it might be, quote, \"fake,\" but it really looks real.

The FAA has since ungrounded the planes pending inspection by Alaska and United Airlines.Take a look at this. You can see Alaska Airlines has 65 Max-9s. United has 79, which the airline is planning to fly by Sunday. Boeing's recent issues bringing to the surface what has been years of quality and safety issues at the company. Some of these concerns leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and a halt in deliveries of others. And when it comes to the 737, its Max-8 design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes. The first happened in Indonesia back in October of 2018. Lion Air flight JT 116 was carrying 189 people, including three children, when it went down over the Java Sea. And the other in Ethiopia in 2019. Ethiopian Airlines ET 302 crashing soon after it took off. And 157 people were on board in that case. And those incidents led to a 20-month grounding of the company's best- selling jets, which cost Boeing more than $21 billion. And internal communications that were released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as, quote, \"designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\" Joining us now is CNN's Pete Muntean. Pete, before we go any deeper here on the culture at Boeing and some of the bigger picture questions that this is bringing up, what more are you learning about the 737 Max-9?",

Senator Tammy Duckworth says there needs to be real introspection here and maybe a denial of an exemption that Boeing needs to get that airplane flying into the air.The Max-10 is another version of this airplane. United CEO Scott Kirby said, after this incident that that somebody that he's not really interested in. I just want to look at the design of the airplane here, because we can sort of go through the different parts where there have been issues. The door plug is kind of obscured back here by the engine. But also there have been problems with the rudder bolts. There have also been problems with the pressure vessel, which keeps the airplane pressurized, like a big tin can. Those are things that have come up not only at Spirit AeroSystems, the major contractor that built the fuselage of the Max for Boeing, but also at Boeing. So the airplane has been riddled with problem after problem after problem. Now the big question is, will Senators on Capitol Hill really get an answer from CEO Dave Calhoun about why these problems keep occurring in the first place? A lot of these things don't happen in dramatic fashion like we saw on Alaska flight 1282 with cameras rolling and a huge part of the airplane missing. A lot of the things are happening on the production line. We've seen that not only with these incidents, but also on the 787, too. And there have been whistleblower reports of that and production air stuff in 2021 and 2023 because of issues at that South Carolina plant.",
