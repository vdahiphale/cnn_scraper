I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today, Democrats are breathing a sigh of relief after President Biden's fiery state of the union address and his impassioned speech that lasted more than an hour. The president sought to diffuse concerns about his age and draw a stark contrast with the MAGA movement. He lambasted his Republican rival more than a dozen times without ever saying his name, referring to former President Donald Trump simply as my predecessor. Republicans in the meantime sat on their hands most of the night, not even president's call to defend democracy could elicit a unified response, and he had no qualms. The president had no qualms about pointing that out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  History is watching. Just like history watched three years ago on January 6th, when insurrection stormed this very capital and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that. This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, Biden's advisors are feeling pretty good about his performance last night. They believe that he accomplished what he set out to do, laying out that vision for a second term, but also trying to provide that stark contrast with former President Donald Trump. Biden never named his predecessor by name, but there was no mystery about who he was talking about last evening.And one thing that his campaign team has pointed me to is the fact that they saw a real fundraising boost around the president's State of the Union address. The 9:00 P.M. and 10:00 P.M. hours when that address was taking place were the campaign's best online fundraising hours since the launch of their campaign. They argue that's a sign of the enthusiasm and energy around the president's messaging. But the president in his address also tried to quell some of the concerns people have about his age and stamina. You saw him come out with a very fiery political speech, taking aim at Trump, tangling with Republicans in the House chamber there over issues like immigration and taxes. A key question going forward is whether he will be able to maintain that fiery energy as he hits the campaign trail. A bit later this afternoon, he will make his first stop traveling to battleground Pennsylvania. He'll be visiting a suburb of Philadelphia. The suburbs, of course, will be very important for Biden as he's trying to woo moderate, independent and especially suburban women voters in areas like Philadelphia. Tomorrow, he heads to Georgia. Vice President Harris is heading out west to Arizona and Nevada. We are expecting travel from both of them to ramp up in the coming weeks. But, really, what the Biden campaign and the president are trying to do today is try to build off of some of that momentum, some of that energies from last night's address. We'll see how exactly that translates with voters once he hits these battleground states.",

You might not have seen this because you were on the House floor, or perhaps you've seen the video since, where he mouths the word, true, agreeing with the president at that moment. I just have to ask you, if we have some of the videos, we can show it to our viewers, I have just have to you, Congressman, after this speech last night, is there any more of an appetite on the Republican side to get that bill through the Congress?",

It's the most empathy I have heard from him. He acknowledged that over 30,000 people have been killed. He acknowledge that 2 million who have displaced.

But for Lankford to sit there, you know, very attentively and then to nod and say that's true, I mean, that's an important moment because it affirmed to people who care about this stuff. Most of the people in that chamber, they just don't care policy. They couldn't care less. What they're about is staying there and helping Donald Trump, who will then help them get through their primaries. But for people who care about this stuff, that's an important moment to have a Democratic president and a very conservative Republican senator basically on the same page about immigration at the State of the Union in front millions of people.
