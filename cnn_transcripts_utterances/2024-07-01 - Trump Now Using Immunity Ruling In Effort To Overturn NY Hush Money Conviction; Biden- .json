I have new reporting. And Trump's attorney is also here to join me live. Also, President Biden, weighing in, just a few moments ago, in a speech that was watched just for much as how it was delivered, as for what was actually said, coming after that disastrous debate performance that has left Democrats panicked, and his campaign in crisis. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We start with breaking news, tonight, as the impact of today's Supreme Court ruling is already being felt. I've just confirmed that the Donald Trump legal team is now moving to overturn his hush money conviction, in New York, citing today's ruling, from the High Court, finding that presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution, for their acts while they are in office. We have learned from sources that Trump's legal team has now fired off a letter, to Justice Juan Merchan, that's the judge in New York who oversaw his case there, asking him to set Trump's guilty verdict aside, essentially to overturn it. They claim that evidence that was used during that hush money trial included official acts that Trump took, while he was in office. And they suggest postponing his sentencing that is supposed to happen, in just 10 days from now, for those 34 felony convictions. This news is breaking, tonight, as President Biden has offered this blistering take, just a few moments ago, from the White House, on the Supreme Court's ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a fundamentally new principle. And it's a dangerous precedent. Because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even including the Supreme Court in the United States.

The finger-pointing has continued, tonight, over who's to blame, for the 90-minute debacle that was last week's debate, here on CNN. But the President using a teleprompter there, and also declining to take questions at the end, focused on the ruling, and said that he agreed with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who accused her conservative colleagues on the court, of ignoring, quote, settled understanding of the Constitution, of inventing immunity through brute force, and looking to history, and I'm quoting her now, \"Only when it is convenient.\" Days before the July 4th holiday, both the Justice and the President, tonight, hearkened back to the founding of this nation.

I mean, do you acknowledge that there is still a chance he does have a trial here, for the January 6th election interference case? SCHARF: Well, first of all, I would note that Justice Barrett's opinion is a concurrence, and it's not controlling. I think the majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, very clearly sets out the path ahead. This case is going to be remanded back to the District Court. The District Court is going to have to determine which of the acts underlying the indictment are immune, and which are not immune. And then, we'll proceed from there.

And I think you just got some interesting details, out of Will Scharf, there, as to how they're going to argue it. The Supreme Court, today, defined official acts very broadly, broader than I even expected them to. And so, Donald Trump's team is going to say, some of the communications, not many, but a bit of the evidence, used against Donald Trump, in the hush money trial happened in early 2017, when he was president, communications with White House officials. I'm not sure that just using the official Twitter account is enough, to get something over the line. But they're going to have an argument. I think Judge Merchan, given his overall orientation in this case, is going to be skeptical of that argument. I would -- I had to guess, I would guess he denies it.

If Jack Smith hadn't overstated his claims, like Trump overstated his claims, maybe there would have been more examination in the courts below, of what's official, what's not official. In terms of the Jack Smith indictment, the vast bulk of it deals with the efforts, on the fake elector scheme, out in the states, much less of it deals with the Justice Department.

He has constitutional responsibilities, primarily to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

And I think the court missed that. But I think when you look at what the District Court can do, now, to sort this out, I think there's still some possibilities there.

In that scathing dissent that was signed on to, by two other liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it this way. She said, quote, \"The relationship between the President and the people he serves has\" now \"shifted... In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\" My source, tonight, is President Nixon's former White House Counsel, John Dean. And it's great to have you here, John.

Because presidents don't handle all these things. They give orders and others carry them out. This opinion doesn't address that question. He's got to have willing conspirators, if you will, who are ready to go to jail, because they're not immune unless the court comes back and starts even saying well, White House staff or anybody in the agencies, and follows an illegal order is somehow immunized.

We were met by the Captain. We walked inside, met with Lieutenant. And it was a very civil handoff. Steve and I went back into the back room. We talked. I reminded him of all the things that he needs to remember, and really focus on while he's there, because this is a chance to remove himself from everything that's going on outside. He's not going to have internet. He's not going to have limited -- very limited phone time. His emails will be monitored heavily. His phone time will be monitored heavily.
