We'll bring you back up to speed on what their positions are and where they see the conflict going next. First, your headlines this hour. New CNN poll show U.S. President Joe Biden is struggling against former President Donald Trump in two key swing states. Democratic incumbent chose a Republican front runner in Michigan and Georgia, two states he barely won in the 2020 election. U.S. college campuses and presidents dealing with the fallout from last week's congressional hearing on anti-Semitism. Hundreds of Harvard faculty members have signed a petition urging officials to resist calls for removing the university president that is after the resignation Saturday of Penn's President Liz Magill. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be making his third visit to Washington since his country was invaded by Russia. He'll meet Joe Biden on Thursday along with several U.S. senators, it comes as U.S. aid to Ukraine is on course to dry up. Welcome back to what is our second hour of Connect the World here at the Doha Forum in Qatar. I've been speaking to key decision makers over the weekend here including the Qatari foreign minister, he also was the Prime Minister here, his country having played a key role as far as a mediator. The Jordanian Foreign Minister has been unequivocal of his criticism of Israel. And the Palestinian Prime Minister who told me that Hamas will remain an integral part of the Palestinian political mosaic and I quote him there. You'll hear from each of them over the next hour along with our regular analysis of this ongoing conflicts. First up, I want to start with my conversation here earlier with the foreign minister of Iran. I asked him about the prospects of a two state solution in the Middle East, here is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: The only one that we have in common between us and the occupying regime of Israel is that neither of us believe in the two state solution, because there is -- Israel doesn't believe in a two state solution.

The self-determination should be done by the original Palestinians, Jews, Christians and Muslims. They should take part in a referendum and after 75 years, they can decide their own future. They can participate in a referendum by the United Nations, they can express their opinion and they can vote and then based on the results of this referendum, then the conflict will be over.

And so, there was a lot of hope around that crossing potentially opening today, but it hasn't. There are some conflicting accounts of exactly why that is with COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for getting that aid into Gaza, effectively blaming the United Nations, but a humanitarian aid officials saying instead that it was the Egyptians who were not -- who were keeping the Rafah crossing clear in order to allow for a VIP visit that was happening in Gaza today. But there are efforts that appears in the coming days to try and get that crossing open, at least for the inspection of those trucks, which should speed up the flow of aid into Gaza. But even then, it is clear that the need is enormous in Gaza right now. Whether you hear from the U.N. Secretary General or from other humanitarian organizations, they are describing absolute desperation inside of Gaza where shelters are overcrowded, under resourced, and also hospitals are being overburdened at this moment. Only I believe it's 16 out of 34 of those hospitals -- I'm sorry, 14 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza are partially open at this hour and Rafah the city -- the southernmost city in Gaza, where Israeli officials have been telling Palestinians to move to, not only is that city still facing bombardment from Israeli war planes, but also where civilians are able to find safe shelter. They are finding overcrowded and under resourced situations there as well. So, it is a situation where Palestinian civilians are really facing impossible choices as they try to navigate these Israeli evacuation orders, sometimes getting just you know, very short notice to actually move and then the capacity of actually getting to a safe place where they can have shelter and food and water is a whole other question in and of itself.",

Israeli officials are showing no signs that this offensive particularly in the south is going to slow down at any pointand in fact, they are continuing heavy military operations r Right behind me here in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, you can see smoke billowing from the area near the Jabalia refugee camp. We've been hearing heavy bombardment in the northern most city of Beit Hanoun as well. And so, clearly, Israeli military operations are continuing to go with full force, including in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where Israeli officials believe that Yahya Sinwar the Hamas's leader in Gaza, is believed to be hiding underground. As you mentioned, Tzachi Hanegbi, the Israeli National Security Adviser, saying that this military offensive is likely not to be counted in weeks, and perhaps not even in months. Suggesting a very long term Israeli military operation in Gaza. Despite the fact that in the last week or so, we've been hearing from U.S. officials in particular that Israel would potentially ramp down this current phase of military operations by the beginning of next year, which is, of course, just a few weeks away. And in fact, Tzachi Hanegbi also said that the U.S. hasn't given Israeli firm deadline by which it has to end its operations. We've heard the same from U.S. officials, saying that even though they are bringing pressure to bear on Israel, encouraging them to take more precautions as it relates to civilians, they are also certainly not directing another sovereign nation when they can and cannot end their military operations. So, we will see whether over the coming weeks that pressure comes to a boiling point whether it triggers more action beyond just the rhetoric that we have seen from the United States, but for now, at least very little has actually changed on the ground.",

Here's what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUSAM ZOMLOT, PALESTINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.: It says to me that he is 17,000 innocent people killed late, too late. He is a quarter of a million houses demolished too late. He is really needs to focus on two things now. And I mean, Mr. Blinken, I mean, the U.S. international community to stop this carnage immediately. Because every minute and I mean every minute counts in shaping the future, we can no longer discuss the day after because we don't know what next morning will look like. The plan, the Israeli plan is very clear, it is to turn Gaza unlivable. And they're doing the same in the West Bank at a slower pace but it's the same blueprint, if you may design. And therefore, this is a time for action. I think the international community needs to regain respect for its own rules and order because it has been undermined, it has been tested to the max. This is a time when accountability needs to be on the table. So, this is never again. Because if we end this tragedy and wait for the next tragedy, we have failed humanity for generations to come. And we need to not think about the day after only, we need to think about the day before, because the world has not just failed the Palestinian people after the seventh of October, the world has failed the Palestinian people before the seventh of October. And you know very well, Becky, that almost the Palestinian issue was nonexistent in Washington and in London and key international quarters, the Netanyahu agenda for quarter of a century has been the dominant one, which is primarily killing off any opportunity of a two state solution, he's public about it today.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, this is all about how these university leaders have handled anti-Semitism on campus. And it really cameto a head last week when they appeared before Congress, and they sort of fumbled a response to questions that, you know, a lot of people thought would be an easy question to answer, which is whether or not calls for genocide of Jews on campus, whether that violates university rules, and they botched that response and the uproar has been ferocious. So, we did see the University of Pennsylvania's president stepped down over the weekend. And now there's a lot of pressure on Harvard President Claudine Gay, who I would note she did apologize on Friday for her handling of this. And we have heard from lawmakers and more than 70 lawmakers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called for Harvard to part ways with Claudine Gay. We do know that over the weekend, the governing bodies at Harvard, they did meet for a regularly scheduled meeting that's according to a source. Now, this was not an emergency meeting and we don't know whether or not Claudine Gay's employment was a topic of discussion, but you got to imagine that that was an elephant in the room. There are some interesting differences though, between the situation in Harvard and the situation at Penn and one of the biggest difference is that Claudine Gay is got -- she's got a lot of support from faculty and that is very notable and different from what we saw at Penn. At last check, we have almost 700 faculty members who have signed a petition in support of Claudine Gay. Let me read you a key line from this petition these faculty members wrote and I quote, \"We the undersigned faculty urged you in the strongest possible terms to defend the independence of the university and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay\". Two other key differences here, Becky, unlike Penn's Magill, Gay, she did apologize for how she handled the hearing last week. And another big important difference is that at Penn, those leaders were under fire for months over issues of anti-Semitism. At Harvard, this has been a little bit of a more recent issue. Again, mostly related to the hearing.",

It's something that's been building up over the past couple of days, they tried to check in with him on Friday, there was a team of lawyers that went to the prison that he's supposed to be in called IK-6, which is a couple hundred miles east of Moscow and they were brushed off, they were told that they could not speak to him. And then today, he was supposed to appear via video link at a hearing. So, from that prison, he was supposed to appear via video link to a court. And he didn't show up for that either. Apparently, for a while they were saying there might have been a power failure at that prison. But now his lawyers have found out that he's actually no longer listed as even being in that prison. And that, of course, seriously raised the alarms for the folks that support him. And of course, for his legal team as well. They then went and asked around other jails in that direct area, whether or not he might be there and have not found him. Yet, one of the things that we do know is that he was supposed to be transferred to a different penal colony, which has an even harsher regime than the one that he's already been facing. Of course, we know he's had a very tough time in jail with a lot of days, weeks, even in solitary confinement there, he's supposed to be transferred to an even tougher jail than he has already been in. But again, right now, they don't know where he is. They have no idea whether or not that this is something where he could be in the middle of a transfer. They don't know whether or not this could be some sort of health issue. He of course has had some health issues in the past and in fact, right now as we speak, I'm hearing that Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman said that he reportedly became dizzy at a hearing two weeks ago and had to lie down on the floor where prison staff gave him an I.V.

My mother has been more than just any mother. She chose to fight the government for me and my sister so that my sister could have the same rights as me. K. RAHMANI (through translator): Of course, at times in my life, I wanted her by my side. At puberty, your body changes, it's the kind of question you would ask your mom. I had no one to ask, so I learned by myself. I would have loved if she could have taken me shopping, taught me how to wear makeup and how to handle my body. Frankly, I'm just glad she's alive, because others have lost their loved ones and I can't even imagine what that feels like. KARADSHEH (voiceover): The family says Mohammadi hasn't been allowed to call them in nearly two years, and they're worried about her deteriorating health. K. RAHMANI (through translator): I'm not very optimistic about ever seeing her again. My mom has a 10-year sentence left, and every time she does something, like send out the speech we'll read out at the ceremony, that adds to her sentence.

It's -- I've covered thestory from Israel, from Jerusalem, and Qatar over the last two months. And in my time spent here in Doha, this time around, I've heard from many global leaders about the need to change our approach as an international community to acknowledge how the guardrails of international law have failed to put an end to human suffering. Let's take a step back for a moment and put things in perspective. In a small piece of land where 2.1 million people have been besieged for 16 years, life can settle into a grim routine. Over the last 65 days in Gaza. That routine has looked and felt like hell on earth. We've seen destruction, fear, misery, anger, and death. So much senseless death. One description of the enclave has become akin to an old adage, nowhere is safe in Gaza. Well, 18,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Israel's assault on the Strip. It came in response to the horrific October the 7th Hamas attack where 1,200 people in Israel were killed and over 240 taken hostage. Well, since October the 13th, the Israel has opened up what it calls safe corridors from Northern Gaza to the south, ordering Palestinians to evacuate or risk death. Proof it says of its commitment to protect civilians while targeting Hamas. But for those who make the journey every day, they say it feels more like forcible displacement. What safety they ask? There were shelters or bunkers for ordinary people in Gaza to seek refuge from Israeli air strikes. They traverse narrow roads so badly ruined and scattered with the debris of destroyed buildings. Whether you're heating the so-called safety calls or sleeping inside your home, you are at risk of being struck from the sky all the time, everywhere. Nowhere is safe. No one is safe. Well, on December the 3rd, Israel ordered gardens in the south to evacuate even further south. But where are they supposed to go? They are moving to areas that cannot accommodate them. Areas that don't have food, water, sanitation, basic services, areas where at night there is only darkness and so very little to see, but plenty to hear with the relentless sound of airstrikes. What the Secretary General of the U.N. put it recently? \"The people of Gaza are being told to move like human pinballs -- ricocheting between ever- smaller slivers of the south without any of the basics for survival. And here is how he drove home that point earlier in Doha. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS: This month marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But we are not living up to the promise of these landmark documents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, for most people in Gaza today, the last 65 days are just another chapter in their decades long static struggle for freedom, peace, and dignity. Off times, as a story becomes part of our daily reality, we become numb to it in the language we use to describe it. Can you imagine what that feels like for the people living that reality?
