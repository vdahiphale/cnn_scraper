They'll be relying on Congress to pass a spending bill and avoid a government shutdown by a midnight deadline next Saturday. That's right. It's just next. If Congress fails, those workers' paychecks will be delayed possibly for weeks. Federal agencies have begun the process of preparing for a shutdown and it looks more and more likely at this hour. Today, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy conceded he has to win over a handful of GOP hardliners. But he's hopeful they'll eventually vote for a stopgap spending measure to prevent a shutdown. Meanwhile, here on Capitol Hill, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez is pushing back against calls to resign even from his fellow Democrats and those Democrats are growing in number by the hour. Federal prosecutors say Menendez and his wife took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes including gold bars, cash, home mortgage payments, and a luxury vehicle. Also this week, a growing crisis at the Mexican border. Federal officials are sending more resources to help with the surge of migrants crossing into the U.S. Let's bring in our panel of political experts to talk about this. Some faces you're going to recognize here. Joining us now, former Fox News host Geraldo Rivera in the flesh, as well as former senator -- excuse me -- senior adviser for Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign chuck Rocha, and Republican strategist and former RNC communications director Doug Heye. Geraldo, it's great to have you on the show. Great to talk to you. It's 5:00 here in Washington. We'll have to call this the four as there are only four of us, if you'll pardon that little news pun.

And the reality is, what people are hearing back in their congressional districts, whether they're working with leadership or they're standing against Republican leadership here -- it's only Republicans who sort of matter in this context -- is their constituents are telling them, keep doing what you're doing. Whether it's working to keep the government open but don't work with Democrats because that's somehow bad. Or fight your own Republican leadership. That's exactly what they're hearing.",

Whether you live in Colombia or Venezuela or Mexico or you know, Azerbaijan or France -- you want to live in America. You have to have some control. Now, I am all for a liberal, comprehensive immigration reform. But you have to admit, when you see -- if it weren't for the drones, we wouldn't know. Now we see with these drone cameras, we get an idea of the scope of this misery. When I was growing up, it was always the Darien Gap was stopping, you know, an unbridled flow, a tidal wave from South America. The Darien Gap now, they have tour guides, they give out knapsacks, sneakers, they give a package deal. We'll get you across Central America, get you into Mexico, you get on the train, then you cross the Rio Grande, and presto, you're there. There's got to be some kind of order. There's got to be Mexico, Central America, Colombia have to work together to help re-establish order on the border. You have people dying in the desert and so forth.

Another thing I want to point out, Jim, all those names of the women he attacked, I want to tell you something about them. I know every single one of those women individually. And they're all very different people, who had very different politics and came into the Trump administration from very, very different careers. And you know what, they all ended up in the same place. They were exposed to the man in person. They were horrified by what they saw. And they've spoken out some may wish they had done it sooner.

But leaving cases aside, judges sit in a unique position of publictrust. I mean, they're -- they have lifetime appointments to insulate them from the pressures and influences of politics as usual. And the judiciary has really lofty ethics rules meant to preserve judges. In part, impartiality, and independence, political activity is banned. So is participation fundraising for instance. We talked to a federal judge appointed by George Bush, who found this shocking that Thomas had done this and said, if he'd done the same when he was a district court judge, he'd have gotten a letter of starting a formal disciplinary process. But you know, this all I think gets to the root issue, or one of the root issues in this story. And in all the stories we've reported, which is that these ethics rules only apply to the lower courts. At the Supreme Court, the justices have little or no binding rules on their conduct, and essentially little -- essentially zero oversight, and they ultimately decide what's appropriate for themselves.",

That's the irrational part. What we're trying to do with this story is really show the human effect the effects on families and on American people, these conspiracy theories. And the reason we met him in Dallas actually was because repeatedly over the course of a number of years, he was bringing people back to Dallas, telling people that, you know, one of the Kennedys might show up, of course, surprise, surprise, they never didn't.
