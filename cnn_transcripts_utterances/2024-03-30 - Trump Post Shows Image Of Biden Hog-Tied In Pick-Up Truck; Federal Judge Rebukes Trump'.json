I'm Alisyn Camerota.Tonight, the Biden campaign is calling out Donald Trump for, quote, \"inciting political violence\" after he shared a video on social media that shows President Biden tied up like a hostage in the back of a pickup truck.

      "sentences": "Alisyn, former President Donald Trump once again facing accusations that he is encouraging violence against a political opponent, this time for a social media post involving President Joe Biden. We're only going to show you a clip of this briefly, but take a look at this video captured on Thursday in Long Island.It shows two trucks decked out in Trump flags and decals. And on the second truck, there's this image of President Joe Biden hog-tied on the back of the truck. Trump posted that video to his social media site, Truth Social on Friday. On Saturday, his campaign defended it, telling CNN in a statement, quote, \"That picture was on the back of a pickup truck that was traveling down the highway. Democrats and crazed lunatics have not only called for despicable violence against President Trump and his family, they are actually weaponizing the justice system against him.\" The Biden campaign, meanwhile, wasted little time responding to this. They told CNN in a statement, quote, \"This image from Donald Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a bloodbath, or when you tell the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by. Trump is regularly inciting political violence, and it's time people take him seriously -- just ask the Capitol Police officers who were attacked protecting our democracy on January 6th.\" Now, Alisyn, these are images that we are used to seeing from Trump supporters at his rallies, certainly online, and yes, sometimes even on vehicles. But it is striking to see the former president and someone who aspires to be president once again, amplifying these kind of images. Of course, that has become commonplace for Trump going back to his 2016 campaign and through this week, Alisyn, when he attacked the judge who is overseeing one of his New York cases.",

But really, DOJ should make an inquiry. They should make sure that these things are being checked out.

I mean, Donald Trump is the dominant figure in the Republican Party.There are a lot of people who support him for a lot of reasons, including legitimate policy disagreements with the current administration. But part of the package that he has presented throughout his political career going back to 2016 when he when he offered to pay the legal fees of people who beat up demonstrators at his rallies, if you remember, is that he brings a threat of political violence into the day to day life of American politics in a way that we have not seen probably since the run up to the Civil War. You know, I remember one of the experts on domestic terrorism saying to me toward the end of Trump's presidency that we could be heading toward a period like the troubles in Ireland, not at the same level of violence, but where there are threats routinely. I mean, you know, it's not just January 6th. I mean, there was a kidnap plot on Gretchen Whitmer. What we saw during the, COVID pandemic with public health officials and school board meetings, there is a whiff of violence that has now been introduced into our politics in a way that simply was not there before. Maybe in the Jim Crow South to defend segregation, but on a nationwide basis, we have not seen anything like this. And no one, no one is responding fully to the magnitude of what we are seeing.",

You know, for good reason, there's been a lot of attention to the polling this spring showing Trump not only winning more support among black and Hispanic voters than he did in 2020, but more, Alisyn, than any Republican presidential nominee since the civil rights era.I mean, he's running consistently in polls around 20 percent to 25 percent nationally among black voters, 45 percent or so among Hispanic voters. George W. Bush didn't do that. Ronald Reagan didn't do that. But for all of the deserved attention that is getting the other side of the racial ledger has largely been ignored, which is that Joe Biden in the same polls is somewhat surprisingly running as well, or maybe even a little better than he did in 2020 among white voters, despite all of the headwinds he's facing. And if Biden can do that, can hold that support that he now has where he is at or above the 2020 number with whites, it kind of turns around. It flips the main question in this election. I think the decisive question becomes, can Trump continue all the way through November to maintain the elevated historic level of support he's posting now among black and Hispanic voters, given everything else that he is talking about. Mass deportation, internment camps, unilateral military action against Mexico, pardoning the white supremacists who attacked the Capitol on January 6th. I mean, he, at this moment, is getting the best of both worlds. He is energizing his social conservative base with some very polarizing ideas about race and policies and also winning an unprecedented number of nonwhite voters on other issues, primarily the economy. And the question of whether he can stay on that tightrope all the way to November could be decisive if Biden stays where he is now among white voters.",

The fear that the threatened Israeli ground invasion would have a huge cost for the civilians that are seeking shelter in that part of the Gaza Strip.That, of course, will be at the heart of conversations that will now take place. We expect as early as Monday when an Israeli delegation finally makes its way to Washington to hear the U.S. administration's fears about what that ground invasion would mean. These talks will come at an extremely delicate time, of course, because it's also the hostage talks that are picking up again. We know that an Israeli delegation is on its way to both Qatar and Cairo to continue those indirect conversations with Hamas to see how close they can get to negotiating the release of the remaining more than 130 Israeli hostages in exchange for some 700 Palestinian prisoners. We understand those talks could start as early as Sunday in Cairo. Meanwhile, in Tel Aviv, huge emotion as family members of the hostages gathered with many thousands of people, very angry scenes that spoke really to the frustration and the fear here in Israel that these hostages may not come home at all.

But I would also look at the people in Gaza that they should go to the elected officials, Hamas, which is similar to ISIS, and tell them, we demand that there will be a ceasefire. And the way to get to a ceasefire is the release of all of the hostages, and Hamas have been so difficult in just trying to talk to them, and have been so stubborn in their negotiations. This has been going on for six months, and I'm looking at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which I feel for, as well.

I would like to also reach out to the Muslim viewers on the show and wanting to wish them a Ramadan Kareem for their celebration, and would like to approach them and ask them the way in that Hamas are dealing with the deceased, is this part of Islam? To use dead bodies as bargaining chips? I am pretty sure it is not and I would be more than happy to hear the Muslim leaders in the United States calling to Hamas to have some dignity for the deceased and maybe start negotiations around the deceased and let the families, US families where over 40 US citizens were killed on October 7th to have the minimum, which is being having a place to mourn for our son, a US citizen, as well as many others.

I don't know if you remember, but he did the same thing last year because it was a particularly cold evening in Rome, and again, Holy Week is very packed with Holy Thursday and then the Easter Vigil, which he celebrated tonight and tomorrow and Good Friday services at three o'clock, he was there.So I think it was just prudent for a man who is 87, to just say, you know what? This is a little bit too much. I think I am going to watch. He wrote the meditations for the evening and just like last year, he decided to sit the evening out and just let it go on as it would.",

I mean, there is conflict we see in our own country here.I mean, people are at their wits' end with the division right now, and I think the Pope tries to take all of this into his own heart in prayer and pray for peace, and pray for justice. And so I think what the message to the world will be is that Good Friday is not the final word. That suffering and death is not, that the hope of the resurrection gives us a newness of life that we all desire. And so I think it is a really important message right now, especially with what has been happening in our world.",

Anyone shopping for chocolate bunnies and Easter eggs has noticed that the price of cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate has soared to levels apparently never seen before.

She is tasked with making chocolate confections of different flavors, shapes, and colors. But this year, since the price of cocoa has gotten significantly more expensive, she is rethinking the kind of treats she makes and how she makes them. Like this marshmallow chocolate bunny. DUBUKE: It is a chocolate cookie with a vanilla bean marshmallow, and then it is covered in milk chocolate. So for the you know, 30 grams that you're getting, only 18 grams of that is chocolate, which means it is a much lower ingredient cost for me, much lower labor for me as well, which means that I can pass along those lower costs. RODRIGUEZ (voice over): In January of 2023, Dubuke was paying $13.50 a kilo for chocolate. This week, she has paid $15.71 a kilo.",
