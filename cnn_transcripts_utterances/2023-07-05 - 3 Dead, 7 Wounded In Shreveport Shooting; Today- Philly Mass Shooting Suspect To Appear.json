Three people were killed, seven others were injured when gun fire rang out at Shreveport's annual July 4th celebration.In Philadelphia today, the suspect accused of randomly shooting at victims while roaming through a neighborhood is expected to appear in court for the first time. Five people were killed in that rampage Monday night. The youngest victim was just 15 years old. A toddler and a 13-year-old were also hurt after being shot multiple times in their legs. CNN's Brynn Gingras and Ryan Young have the very latest for us. Ryan, the details are still coming in about that terrifying scene in Shreveport. What are you learning?",

And the big update right now, Kate, is we're expecting a news conference around 11:00 a.m. Eastern to give us the information about this. Now, I can tell you, Shreveport has been dealing with crime and gun violence for quite some time. And this increasing gun violence in that city has put a lot of pressure on the police department. I can tell you, neighbors in this area have told us before, have actually talked to CNN about the increasing gun violence in this city. But right now, at that block party, no one's sure what set this off, and how many shooters there were, or the motive of this crime right now. We just know that people started running, shots were being fired. Again, seven injured, three dead. We know that there'll be that news conference at 11:00 a.m., so hopefully we'll get some more information on this. But another shocking amount of gun violence in this country. Kate?",

And, you know, I'm not in the business of both sides seeing, you know, for -- without merit, but you look at Republicans.I mean, law enforcement still is, you know, concerned about this attachment to guns, particularly these very deadly weapons that we've seen, these high powered assault style rifles used in some of the deadliest mass shootings across this country. We know that meaningful legislation on that doesn't move forward. Obviously, there are people out there who are strong supporters of the second amendment. But you hear from police chiefs, especially across the country saying, look, it's our officers who are on the front lines who are on the receiving end of some of these bullets. And, you know, after these shootings, we hear Republicans talk a lot about mental health, saying that these are mental health issues, but we haven't seen, you know, meaningful legislation really addressing those kinds of issues. And then on the left, I mean, there was criticism as well, particularly with progressive DAs. The Philadelphia district attorney was on CNN this morning talking with our colleagues Phil Mattingly and Poppy Harlow. And, you know, he said he was, you know, focusing on, well, I'm prosecuting shootings. I have, you know, resource issues I have to prioritize, but there's been criticism about what about prosecuting those who are illegally possessing weapons in the first place, trying to get ahead of potential crimes and potential violence. And so that is certainly a concern that we've heard as well. The police don't want to just be waiting around to stand over, you know, dead bodies after the shootings happened, but they want to go after people in advance, even if they're so called lower-level crimes. A lot of times we've seen crimes escalate. And so, you know, certainly there are things to be done across the board, according to law enforcement officials for folks on both sides of political aisle.",

The new round of violence erupting just hours after Israel said it completed the largest military operation in Jenin in more than 20 years.Take a look at the video of troops leaving Jenin late last night in the Israeli occupied West Bank. The Palestinians say, the Israeli operation left at least 12 people dead and more than 100 others injured. And this morning, we have new images of the community preparing a single grave for all 12 of those killed in Jenin, among them a 16-year-old boy.

What was even more extraordinary was to see that many of those armed Palestinian factions that the Israeli military says it was targeting. They were sweeping through these streets, armed shooting, celebratory gunfire, continuing to say that this is defiant. I spoke to some residents who, again, believe it or not, looking at this here, were telling me, we won. This was victory. This was resistance. And that's the cycle of violence. That means families could be caught up in another round in another round -- in another raid. Remember, the Israeli military said this raid is over, but it reserves the right to attack again.

The federal sentencing for the gunman who killed 23 people at the El Paso Walmart back in 2019. Patrick Crusius pleaded guilty in February to 90 charges, half of them federal hate crimes. Authorities say that he carried out the attack with the sole intent of killing immigrants and Mexicans.As part of the plea deal, he will not face a possible death sentence but has agreed to accept 90 consecutive life sentences. He will face victims and their families today in court. Former Smallville Actress Allison Mack has been released from prison. Mack was a high-ranking member of the cultlike group Nxivm. The group claimed to be a self-help organization. But prosecutors say that women in the organization were branded and coerced into having sex with the group's leader. The group's founder was sentenced to 120 years in prison. Mack pleaded guilty in 2020 to racketeering and conspiracy charges. At the time, the judge called her an essential accomplice. And a terrifying ending to a fun day at a festival. Just look at this. A mechanical glitch on a roller coaster left eight riders stuck upside down and stuck there for hours. This happened in Northeastern Wisconsin on Sunday. Authorities there say the fireball roller coaster, it stopped mid-loop. And because of how high they were stuck, special equipment and specially trained teams had to be called in for the rescue, leaving the riders suspended upside down in their seats for three hours. They were all safely rescued. One person was taken to the hospital. Sara?",

In fact, they've previously said that the International Atomic Energy Agency, they have inspectors, they have employees who are working at the site right now.And it was last week, actually, that the IAEA put out a statement saying that they have seen no evidence of any bombs or any mines located on that site, though, the caveat is they say that they still would need more fuller access to the site itself in order to say that with 100 percent certainty. The Russians say that, look, the threat here is from Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson said this, and I quote earlier today, \"There is a great threat of sabotage by Kyiv which can have catastrophic consequences\". For the record, Sara, President Zelenskyy isn't putting out any specific evidence of his allegations here, of these explosives on site, but he's saying that this would essentially be a false flag operation, echoing what the Ukrainian military has said before, and that any explosion would make it look like this was the result of Ukrainian shelling, but wouldn't be powerful enough to actually damage the reactors themselves. Still, the Ukrainians say that their emergency services have been preparing for this kind of possibility. Special Forces from Ukraine are on alert as well. And the Russians say that they are also prepared for this. So everyone here is on high alert. I just want to show you a satellite image as well, just to kind of better illustrate this, Sara. So the reactors themselves, which you should be able to see on the top of this image, those red circles there, they're housed in these containment buildings, which are designed to be able to withstand the force of an accidental plane crash. How they would hold up against the weapons of war? We don't have a good answer to that. But also keep in mind that at the bottom of your screen there, you see those rectangles there, those dark rectangles, those are cooling ponds which store the spent nuclear fuel rods. And they are right out there in the open. They have no protection at all. So there's not a whole lot of margin for error that we're talking about here. The good news is that we are getting some reassuring signs from nuclear officials on both sides of the front line and the Ukrainians say that the situation is stable. The Russian backed officials and the occupied parts of Ukraine, where this plant is located, say that the background radiation levels are normal. They also call Zelenskyy's claims garbage. One other thing to quickly mention, Sara, and that is that the Kremlin today is denying a report in the Financial Times that Chinese President Xi Jinping had warned Russian President Vladimir Putin against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Kremlin calling that report, quote, fiction.

So they've got to conduct some kind of a penetration, you know, to get through the weakest point on the line and then hope that they can conduct some kind of an envelopment or flanking maneuvers.But my problem with -- this could be very, very difficult fight. I mean, you got, as you say, a couple of 100,000 now troops that are dug in for over a year preparing, you know, tank mines, all kinds of minefields, all kinds of tank ditches. It's very, very difficult defensively. They don't have air superiority. We would -- we, in the United States, would never conduct an offense without air superiority. They don't have the long range artillery. They don't have a lot of the equipment they need. They probably don't have the manpower they need. So this is going to be, you know, a very, very difficult fight. What they've got to do is find a place like that in the line, a weak point, and then hope to conduct some sort of a penetration and successful envelopment, and then hope that the Russians surrender in mass because they cannot go toe to toe with these guys.",
