So the rules that are enshrined in martial law, things like the ability to forcibly move, civilians, that very likely already happening, seizure of property already happening, all those kinds of things.But it does, of course, reveal that President Putin is trying to do what he can't do militarily through the sort of sham illegal, or what he would say, as legal means as for Russia itself. I think it's perhaps more impactful that you see the sort of slow creep of authoritarianism through this means of declaring what is essentially martial law light in those regions that you see those border regions and slightly less a rules in the -- in the areas just to the west, and south of those regions as well. He has, of course, also given more powers to all regional governors. And if you read the decree on martial law in the illegally annexed regions closely, it does leave itself open to expansion. It does say that they can expand this under the constitutional law on martial law. So that has made a lot of Russians very nervous that just like with the decree on mobilization, it could go further than initially expected. As for what happens to the Ukrainians who are being evacuated in the words of the Russian-backed authorities, they're out of Kherson, we don't know exactly where they are going. A correspondent in Russian state T.V. said yesterday that they were heading for the -- some of the border regions in Russia, Crimea, perhaps Krasnodar, Rostov. Some of those regions that are now under that martial law light but we don't know exactly. And this of course, very concerning given Russia's track record in this war of moving civilians.",

Suella Braverman is the second high-ranking official to exit the Truss inner circle since Friday. She's been replaced by Grant Shapps who earlier this week said the prime minister had \"A Mount Everest to climb to remain in power.\" Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party is seizing on the anti-Truss momentum.

But, you know, she's been seen as having the critics on the softer side of the party, should we say, the Jeremy Hunt side, the Rishi Sunak side, she now made a absolutely, you know, fervent enemy, if you want to call it of somebody on the other side of the party.

But Liz Truss wanted to flip that particular position in order to try to drive growth and now without having the taxes. But you get to the key point, Rosemary, which is the exasperation, you might say, for many Conservative M.P.s, which is who would replace her.Given that you have a party that is deeply driven between those who supported Liz Truss's growth plan, and those like Rishi Sunak, who thought it was a frankly, crazy idea, and he was, you know, made his views very clearly on the stomping trail to become the leader of the Conservative Party. You're left with -- choices that would favor one wing of the party or the other. Strangely, the only person who might not do that would be Jeremy Hunt, only say that not because he isn't associated with the softer wing of the party but because he came last in the hustings for who would take over from Boris Johnson. But he's already been made the chancellor and has done a very good job to this point where the markets trust him deeply. Once you start to go beyond Jeremy Hunt, you start to pick one one side of the other. And it has to be the question, how would this be acceptable to the British people which would then drive you to an election? So honestly, all of us, including myself are struggling to think how she gets through this mix. I think people might have rallied around it. If it were not for the chaos of yesterday evening, not just the sacking of the home secretary. But this botched vote, who knows if it was a confidence vote or not. That incompetence on parliamentary management on top of incompetence financially, I think could be the doing for her but frankly, I don't know who will take over.",

Sweating profusely, exhausted under the weight of his hazmat suits. He's wearing layers and layers of them. This is a demonstration from a Chinese citizen all the way in New York City's Times Square, a metaphor for the suffering zero-COVID policy many people feel in Xi Jinping's China.

China's draconian zero-COVID policies have descended millions of lies into chaos. Fights with COVID enforcers, screams for freedom from locked in apartments. Protests for food and supplies. During the snap lockdown in an airport in southern China, security even held guns near travelers. Entire cities are still being locked down over a handful of COVID cases.
