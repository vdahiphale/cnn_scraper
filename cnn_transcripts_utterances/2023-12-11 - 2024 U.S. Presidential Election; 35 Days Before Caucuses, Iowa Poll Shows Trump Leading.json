It doesn't matter who, you know, the kind of the leadership of the party wants and the leadership of any party in any state. You know, the base voters out in the rank and file and the hustings across America, just still want to see Donald Trump as their nominee.

That -- you know, there's room for the other candidates to grow and go.
