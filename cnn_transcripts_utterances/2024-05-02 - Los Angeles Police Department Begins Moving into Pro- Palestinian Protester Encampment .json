Across the country, there have been confrontations between protesters, pro-Palestinian protesters, and police, the latest on the campus of UCLA. We have been watching as police have finally moved in, smashing down tents, taking down some of the encampment and arresting those who were inside.At this hour, we've been watching them move in very quickly. They've been standing there since about 1:00 this morning waiting to push forward after telling the encampment that they were there illegally, the university sending out an alert to students there. The students have been pushing back. We have seen them use, for example, fire extinguishers on police. We have seen them using lights to try to blind the please so that they can't see very well as they're trying to push in on an area that is a little bit smaller than the size of a football field that has been covered with tents and protesters for a week now. I want to give you a view from just minutes ago as police started pushing in trying to get the pro-Palestinian protester encampment and the protesters out.

But you are describing what is going on on UCLA's campus.I am standing out in front of Columbia University, which is really the epicenter of where these campus protests began a couple of weeks ago. That went on to UCLA. We are seeing some serious police action there, using sun grenades and all manner of things to try and make this a smaller and smaller and smaller encampment, until they are going to, what it appears, arrest those who are left. We have seen at least a half dozen arrests just in the past 30 minutes from watching the video there where you're seeing them detain protesters. We also have Ben Camacho who is on the line, a freelance journalist who was there last night as all of this was starting to go down. You said that you were watching this happens of around 5:00. There were police on the scene from several different agencies. And then what? When did you really the police start to move in? Because for a very long time yesterday they were on the outskirts of this encampment, and they were not moving in. They were just sort of holding a line.",

I appreciate you and our Camila Bernal who is on the scene there.And just to wrap things up, just to give you some sense, we are still watching these pictures of police trying to push in, making the encampment smaller and smaller and getting closer and closer to the core group of protesters who have decided to stay. But as you heard from Camila, the number of Protesters has really diminished. Police have been arresting people throughout the last couple of hours.

I'm going first to take the barricades, make arrests for people who have been warned under 6407-Aa and 602, the laws of trespassing there, that if you remain here, you're going to be arrested.

So kudos to you for knowing all of the details there being a New York guy.I do want to ask you about comparing and contrasting because John is bringing up, you know, all of these other places where we have seen these arrests. In Wisconsin, we saw battles between police and protesters. That never looks good to the public when you see students and police sort of in a battle. We saw the same thing at UT Austin with professors complaining about the heavy-handed tactics they thought had happened on that campus, and then you saw what happened here at Columbia where police went in en masse to try to get protesters out of Hamilton Hall here in Columbia. Can you compare and contrast what you're seeing here compared to what you've been seeing across the country with how police have dealt with this versus what you're seeing at UCLA, which seems to be much slower and much worth methodical.",

The idea that they were able to amass a thousand or more to handle the Columbia situation, was based in the idea, if that you show up with overwhelming show of force, you probably won't have to use force and they didn't.There was, I think, out of 282 arrests, there was one injury to one person and that is remarkable. And the situation where you're taking that many people into custody. In Los Angeles, you've only got 9,200 or so police officers for a city half the size of New York with a third larger geography, so that makes deployment decisions much more difficult where you can't really call up a thousand cops and say, if we need another thousand, we will just call them. So what you see is a carefully stitched together mutual aid program where its California State Highway Patrol, its LAPD, its Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and all the cities around it contributing people, it makes command and control a little more difficult because it is not one agency one set of orders, but you do have the incident command system where there is an incident commander who is calling the shots and everybody is going to toe that line. So one of the reasons they are going so slowly is, they know the numbers of people that they have on the other side of those barricades, they know the numbers of people they brought and frankly, speed here is not on their side. This methodical approach is going to allow them to go slower, but ultimately to use less force.",

The violence began as soon as this protest arrived.The day that the USC protest was shut down was the day that four giant buses arrived with people that we have no idea who they are, who came in and together with some students started to set up this encampment, which grew. By Friday, I went down there and I reported on the fact that Jewish students and really anybody that didn't agree with the purpose of this protest were being harassed, bullied, intimidated, physically assaulted. There was a counterprotest actually on Sunday, which was an organized permitted protests by supporters of Israel and Jewish students and that protest was basically attacked by the Palestinian protesters. So there was -- and many people were injured. So the violence really didn't start Tuesday night. It had been going on for days and days. What happened Tuesday is despicable. People that we don't know who they are basically came in and created a war zone and that is what happens when there is no law and order. I went to the police on Friday, and again on Monday and begged them to go up there because I myself was assaulted on Monday when I was giving an interview, and the police basically told me straight out that they have been given an order not to go up there directly by the leadership of the university.",

The latest thing that we saw, violence was on two nights ago, however, you're saying this has been going on for a while.So what are your thoughts about how the university and police have handled this?

Some thugs donning Palestinian Keffiyehs basically told me to stop walking and that I am not allowed to go there.I tried to ignore them and walked around them, one of them tackled me to the ground. My ear pod flew out. Apparently, he stole it because I tracked it later into their quad, and when I went and filed the police report and told the police I can track them, I know exactly where he is, please go and arrest him. They basically told me, we are not going to go in there to save your ear pod. We had a private security guard that got kidnapped and put into that encampment. He was an old man who was injured, pepper sprayed, beat up, and we barely got him out. Now, yes, I am very disappointed in the police response, but I don't blame the police. I mean, the police put out a statement basically stating that they are not responsible because they take orders from the leadership of the university. The leadership of the university did not want to do anything about this, and in fact, I believe that it wasn't the melee that broke out Tuesday night that made them decide to disband this. I think they already made the decision earlier on Tuesday, which is why they issued a statement that the encampment is illegal. They decided to break down the encampment when they got called in front of Congress to testify, May 23rd. That's I think what led them to finally shut this down.",
