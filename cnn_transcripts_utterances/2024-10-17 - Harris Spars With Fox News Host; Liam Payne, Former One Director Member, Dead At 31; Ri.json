It started in a flat line and she needs to win over some of these Republican and Republican leaning voters.",

So someone who is very acutely aware with how this process goes. This has been the whole big question about his mass deportation plan, every time he's asked, you know, how does this actually work?Do you go knock on people's doors? How do you find them? What does this mean to the economy? There's some studies out showing that this would be a massive blow across the board. Not only people who'd be deported, but that's the economy that wouldn't be able to function. So this has been really not a great interview for him. He took a lot of really pointed questions, was not able to answer on specific other questions he was asked directly. Do you really believe that the migrants in Springfield are eating pets? And he just said, yes, essentially that's been reported and dodge. So this is, you know, when he was asked some very pointed questions from undecided voters, you know, wasn't really able to meet that moment.",

You know, its interesting, Kasie, I find that this moon, the moon has been this very constant in a lot of my live shots over my career, whether its the total solar eclipse where the moon blocked out the sun or talking about the tides or a lunar eclipse. But this morning, we're talking about a supermoon. And if you're lucky enough, you still can get outside and enjoy it this morning, don't leave yet. Let me explain it first. So pan up to the moon for you what were talking about, what in the world is a supermoon? Well, it all happens when the moon makes us closest approach to the Earth. Think about its path around the planet as more of an egg shape or an elliptical shape. So it is at its perigee, which means that its closest approach towards the planet. And that's roughly about 363,000 kilometers away. So what that means for us here on the ground is that the moon is going to appear about 14 percent brighter and even about 6 percent larger. So its saying something if you step off side and look at it this morning because that supermoon is about to peak at its brightest point at 7:26 this morning. And you have another opportunity to see it after sunset tonight and again early tomorrow morning as well. This is third -- four supermoons this year. It's moon known as the super hunter moon. And of course we need the clear skies just like we have here in Atlanta to enjoy it. Much of the east coast and into the Midwest are enjoying the clear conditions. So you do have that opportunity if you're waking up bright and early this morning/ But beware, it is called. I am freezing. We've got over 84 million Americans under some sort of frost and freeze alerts this morning. So if you are stepping outside, make sure you have the coat, and perhaps a scarf to keep herself all bundled up nice and warm -- Kasie.",
