And that`s because right now to get to the magic number, that`s 218 seats. They only need Republicans due to five more wins. That`s it. And then under the majority. Democrats, however, need to flip five Republican districts, much more difficult, especially since they are only leading in two Republican districts. Republicans meanwhile are leading in two Democratic districts. So if that holds the Democrats are most likely going to be in the minority. And that of course would be a huge letdown for their party. They thought they were going to carry districts from Iowa to Nebraska, to New York, to California. They left a bunch of Republican wins pickup opportunities on the table. And that`s what`s going to cause a lot of hand wringing, blaming -- blame game of sorts, potentially at the top of the ticket to some Democrats, down ticket outperforming Kamala Harris` performance in some of those battleground districts. But at the moment, those votes still yet to be counted. One thing is for certain though, Republicans will have the majority in the Senate 52 seats, at least a couple of seats yet to be called, potentially adding one more seat and see how the Pennsylvania Senate race turns out here. And another big question for Republicans, who will lead this new majority? Because Mitch McConnell`s longtime Senate Republican leader, the longest serving Senate leader in the history of the Senate is stepping aside from his leadership post. That means there are several candidates who are vying to replace him three specifically that Senator John Cornyn, Senator John Thune, Senator Rick Scott. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Next, we`re going to take a look at a situation happening in Southeast Asia where two neighbors, India and Pakistan are dealing withextreme pollution that`s affecting the lives of millions of people. Air quality typically worsens in that region in the winter time because cold air traps, particulates billowing up during crop burning or those that come out of vehicles and power plants. And that air just stagnates. The pollution recently got so bad that it registered three times higher than levels on the IQAir index that are considered hazardous. Pakistan`s government is calling for climate diplomacy with India. So the two countries can address the issue. CNN`s Sophia Saifi shows us more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over):  The traffic is still flowing in Lahore. The government officials are urging people to stay at home. The smog too toxic for a city that often ranks as one of the worst in the world for air pollution. Face masks are mandatory, a thin shield against the skyrocketing amount of pollutants in the air. The city`s air quality index topped 1,000 again last week. That`s an unprecedented level as the IQAir Index defines hazardous as anything over 301. Many public spaces like zoos, parks and historic monuments have been closed, along with many schools which have shifted to online classes for at least another week.",

But the smog is a recurring problem, especially at this time of the year when particles from low grade diesel fumes and crop burning get trapped in the cold air. And some residents say that the aren`t stopping that. MOHAMMAD QASIM, LAHORE VISITOR (through translator):  They have closed schools that don`t create the smog. They have not closed the factories and brick kilns. They are now closing the things which create the smog. SAIFI (voice-over):  Delhi`s air has also reached hazardous levels in recent days, though some residents are still exercising outdoors. The World Health Organization says breathing toxic air is harmful and can cause strokes, heart diseases and respiratory infections. One clinic in New Delhi says there is a 20 to 25% rise in patients, especially after the Diwali holiday when people set off illegal fireworks. Sore throats, burning eyes and trouble breathing are common complaints. BALRAM KUMAR, FACTORY WORKER (through translator):  I have a severe cold and cough. No medicine seems to be working. I have been taking medicines, but there is no relief. SAIFI (voice-over):  Officials in New Delhi began a trial program recently to spread spray water from drones to clear away dust and pollutants. But critics say this is just a band aid. And the smog problem in South Asia is in need of more long-term solutions. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But thanks to a massive renovation project worth more than $300,000 that includes cleaning and scrubbing up of calcium rust and dirt, this iconic fountain is dry. You know, where the water should be is this metal walkway that is going to offer the tourists who come here a rare opportunity to take an intimate look at this 18th century masterpiece. The fountain`s last cleaning and repair began in 2014 and took more than a year, but increasingly hot temperatures and a steady growth in tourism traffic have also led to the erosion of some of the basin. The Trevi project is one of many conservation and renovation projects slated to finish in time for the kickoff of the Vatican`s Holy Jubilee year of 2025, which will draw millions more visitors than usual to the Eternal City`s popular sites.
