More than 800 guardsmen are currently deployed for debris removal, but DeSantis said there will soon be up to 4,000 available. We also heard from Florida Senator Rick Scott, who said that Milton has the potential of causing much greater damage than Helene, which pummeled Florida less than two weeks ago. With Helene, Scott said, over a million households were left without power. Milton has the potential of having an impact that will be much worse. SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  It seems like a lot of our storms have become water events. We got it all with this one. We`re going to have storm surge, we`re going to have flooding, we`re going to have massive winds. And guess what it means? You`re going to lose power.",

Your answer here is the Vatican City, often called the Holy See, which has a population of 510 inhabitants, and it`s just shy of half a square kilometer in size. Now to big news coming out of Vatican City. Pope Francis made a surprise announcement during a speech in the Middle East in the anniversary of the October 7th attacks, where he announced he has chosen 21 new cardinals. The pope, who is the head of the Roman Catholic Church`s central government, makes decisions on issues of faith and morality for over one billion Catholics around the world. He also chooses cardinals, senior members of the church who elect and advise the pope. As pope, Francis has made the group of cardinals who will elect his successor more representative of the worldwide church, choosing bishops from Iran, Ukraine, Indonesia, Japan, and the Ivory Coast. CNN`s Christopher Lamb has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Pope Francis on Sunday causing a surprise in the Vatican when he announced he`ll be creating 21new cardinals. Now, choosing cardinals is the closest thing a pope has to succession planning because it is from the cardinals that the pope is chosen and it is the cardinals who will select the successor to Pope Francis. The 87-year-old pontiff choosing cardinals from across the globe and significantly, the Archbishop of Tehran in Iran, a sign that the pope is seeking to push for dialogue and peace in the Middle East. And by choosing a cardinal from Iran, he is bolstering the work of the church in this area. Before announcing the names of the cardinals, the pope commemorated the one-year anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attacks, calling for the release of hostages and for peace across the region, including in Lebanon, and for an end to retaliatory attacks. Now, throughout his pontificate, Francis has thrown out the old unwritten rule book for when it comes to appointing cardinals. In the past, there were cardinals chosen from specific parts of the world, including in Italy, but Francis has changed all that. He chooses cardinals from the far-flung peripheries of the church. And today, Francis chose cardinals from Indonesia, the Ivory Coast, Algeria, Francis seeking to, in a way, reward the unsung heroes of the church with his choices. And he has, over his pontificate, changed and reshaped the body of cardinals and men who will be choosing whoever comes after him. So a significant decision by the pope today. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
