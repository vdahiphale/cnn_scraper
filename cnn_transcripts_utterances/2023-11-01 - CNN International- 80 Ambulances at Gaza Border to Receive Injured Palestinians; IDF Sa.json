I'm Bianca Nobilo, live from London.It's Wednesday, November 1st, 8:00 a.m. here in London and 10:00 a.m. at the Rafah border crossing where some 80 ambulances have arrived to bring seriously injured Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt. You're looking at live pictures. We're told that the patients are being discharged from hospitals in Gaza that can't provide the surgeries that they need. If all goes as planned, these would be the first Palestinians permitted to leave Gaza since the start of the war. And minutes ago, word from the British Foreign Secretary that a first group of foreign nationals might also be allowed to exit through that Rafah Crossing. Meanwhile, the Israeli military is revealing new details about the extent of its bombardment in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces say that more than 11,000 terrorist targets have been hit since the start of the war. That makes an average of more than 440 strikes per day, and that includes the recent bombing of Gaza's largest refugee camp, which has triggered concern and harsh condemnation from around the world. The and has resulted in significant but as yet unknown casualties. But the Israeli military is defending the surprise attack. The and joining us now to discuss this is CNN's Scott McLean. So Scott, let's begin with this breaking news. About 80 ambulances, we understand being allowed through the Rafah Crossing and now even more reports that we're hearing that possibly foreign nationals might be able to leave. This is a huge development. What's the diplomacy going on behind the scenes?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that that last bit is certainly new. And you know, it's not really clear exactly how this deal came to pass. A, it's surprising that they're allowing even any -- excuse me -- any Palestinians to cross the border into Egypt because Egypt has been extremely reluctant since the outside of the war to take Palestinian refugees. Figuring there might be, you know, if they let a few in there, there might be more and more and then suddenly the conflict reaches -- reaches their territory instead. But as you said, these are Palestinians who require specific surgeriesthat simply cannot be done in Gaza, so they're being taken to a field hospital in a place called Sheikh Zuweid City. This is basically the first community that you reach in Egypt outside of Gaza. And what's not clear is whether this will be a sign of things to come. Whether there will be more Palestinians who will be transported to Egypt for medical treatment. We know that the hospitals inside of Gaza have been piling up with patients, some of them being treated on the floor, some of them being treated without anesthetic. Obviously far from ideal conditions that they have there. They have gotten warnings and threats from Israel to evacuate. They have said, look, we have nowhere to go and these other hospitals simply cannot them in either. When it comes to the foreigners who may be allowed out. This is according to the British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who tweeted just in the last couple of minutes really. He said the Rafah Crossing is likely to open today for a first group of foreign nationals. UK teams are ready to assist British nationals as soon as they are able to leave. What we do not know at this stage is when it might open and who is going to be left out. Obviously, there are a lot of people who would like to get out. There are some 400 or so American citizens alone who have been unable to leave. Obviously, many, many more Gazans with foreign passports or foreigners who were there for whatever other reason there, who are -- who have been desperate to get out. But for the last 3 1/2 or so weeks have been unable to.",

Scott, the desperation of those who want and need to leave Gaza is put into sharp relief by attacks like what we've seen on Gaza's biggest refugee camp, the Jabalia camp. What more are we learning about the casualties? The weapon that was used. And how Israel is justifying attacking this civilian area?",

      "sentences": "Obviously, a lot of criticism that's being leveled at Israel, justifiably based on the evidence. Pertains to the proportionality of their response to the attacks on October the 7th. When it comes to laws and norms of war, protecting civilians as much as possible and also a proportionate response are very important things. Do you feel like there are other ways that Israel could be approaching this in order to dismantle a terror organization that works underground and uses civilians as human shields, as they claim, in a way which was more proportionate. I mean, what options are actually available to them? RYANare they dealing with an enemy who hides among the people, Hamas deliberately uses these kinds of facilities to shield themselves. Now proportionality is a very important consideration for these kinds of strikes and -- but so too is the timing and the military effect. So if Israel wanted to minimize these kind of civilian casualties -- which are -- which are awful. They may need to look at, do we need to strike now, and are there other ways we might be able to get this individual later on when he's not surrounded by so many civilians?",

And that is according to Turkish state media.Bolivia is cutting diplomatic relations with Israel because of its war on Hamas. The Bolivian Agency of Information says Israel has committed crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people. The announcement came one day after Bolivian President Luis Arce met with the Palestinian ambassador to his country. And Bolivia says it is preparing to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. Plus, violence is escalating in the West Bank between Palestinians and Israeli settlers. How it could affect Israel's war on Hamas just ahead? (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
