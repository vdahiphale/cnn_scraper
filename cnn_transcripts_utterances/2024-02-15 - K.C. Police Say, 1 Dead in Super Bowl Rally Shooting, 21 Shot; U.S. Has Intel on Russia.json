But we do know that this kind of system, in theory, is designed to target America's vast network of both commercial and military satellites, to include the satellites that provide vital command and control for the United States over its nuclear arsenal. Now, also important to note, as you mentioned, that we are told that this system is not yet operational, it's not in orbit, and it's not clear at this point how far the Russian technology has even progressed. And so officials describing this to us as a concerning long-term strategic threat, something important, something America should be responding to, but not necessarily an immediate emergency, as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee had originally portrayed it in his very cryptic public statement yesterday that he had information on a national security threat.

I think potentially even this revelation is potentially damaging from that standpoint.

This is a very critical day for the former president because he is likely to learn whether or not he's going to have to sit through a criminal trial during the campaign season ahead of that November 2024 election. Now, his lawyers are calling on the judge to dismiss this case entirely. They argue that it's political, but I'm told by legal experts that that's not likely to happen. The other crucial thing that we are learning today is whether or not that March 25th trial date is going to stand. That is the big question. Are Donald Trump and his team going to have to try and figure out how to navigate a campaign for president while he is also sitting in a courtroom in New York? So, let's talk about what exactly this case is. Just a reminder, this is one of the four criminal cases that he is facing. It is the hush money case. He is accused of alleged cover-up scheme and it is falsifying business records essentially to hide reimbursement payments to Michael Cohen, payments that Michael Cohen allegedly made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an affair ahead of the 2020 -- 2016 -- excuse me, I used to say 2024 -- election. Now, Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 charges. He has denied having the affair. But, really, the big crucial thing today, does that trial date stand?
