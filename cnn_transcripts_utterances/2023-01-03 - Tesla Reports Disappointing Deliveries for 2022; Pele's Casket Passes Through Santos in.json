Plus, shocking scenes at a professional U.S. football game in Cincinnati, Ohio, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsing and going into cardiac arrest in the middle of the game. We are live at the hospital where he is being treated. Also on financial markets and important day for global Investors with the opening bell on Wall Street about to sound for the first time in 2023 it is looking like certainly all the green arrows that are across the screen setting looks like a positive start to the New Year with all the futures pointing higher. European stocks on the rise as well let's take a look here the Wall Street bulls hoping for more profitable year after the S&amp;P 500, almost 20 percent drop in 2022 its worst performance since the financial crisis back in 2008. Rahel Solomon joins us live now. So Rahel, let's talk about 2023. What reasons should I say to Investors have to be cautiously optimistic in 2023? What are they looking for this year?",

      "sentences": "Well, Zain good to be with you, I think a few themes will emerge for 2023 right? If you think about the last year,the huge themes were, of course, Central Banks and their fight to tame inflation. We spent a lot of time in 2022 looking at overall inflation. Of course, we had that peak of 9.1 percent in consumer prices here in the U.S. in June and we have suddenly come off of that. Looking ahead to 2023, there is going to be a lot more focus on non-shelter services inflation in fact Citibank putting out a note this morning, saying that hat will be the key theme for 2023. So less focusing on things like delivery times and commodity prices, which we focus on a lot for goods inflation, inflation on physical items, durable goods, and that sort of thing, more focus on labor market tightness, how much is the strong labor market here in the U.S. driving the current inflation? So to that end, we're going to be looking at labor turn over. We're going to be looking at, certainly the unemployment rate. We're going to be looking at how many jobs are being added? And Zain, on that and we'll actually get a few pieces of key data this week. We get the jolts data, which will tell us about job vacancies. We'll get the all-important monthly jobs report, the expectation there for this month, or for the month of December rather are an extra 200,000 jobs being generated, being added and wages increasing 0.4 percent. Both of those things, they still suggest a strong market, but a cooling labor market, which I think, markets would like to see.",

I mean take a look at the DOW that was the best performer of the major averages and that closed off about 9 percent. The S&amp;P closed off 19 percent. The NASDAQ closed off a whopping 30 percent. So you could certainly argue there is a lot of bad news already priced in and the Fed, of course, has done so much in 2022. They raised their benchmark policy rate 425 basis points or 4.25 percent, just in about nine months or so. So the Fed has already done a lot. There's already a lot of bad news baked into the markets that said the catalyst for growth. Looking ahead, you get earnings season that starts later this month. The labor market data as I pointed to. And Zain, expect the first time we hear from Chair Powell or I would argue any major fed speakers any dovish language. You're likely going to see market surge, they've been waiting for a sign from the Federal Reserve that they are starting to slow on their interest rates hike and may actually start to stop once we get that you do we do expect to see at least a short term rally for the markets.

And that the company has had this revolving door of many other high profile executives that have risen through the ranks only to wind up leaving the company. And again, that just leads to the perception that it's all Elon all the time, having Zhu take over more responsibilities. To me this sounds like a could be analogous to what's going on and has been going on for years at SpaceX where Gwynne Shotwell is the widely respected number two at that company. You don't have to worry Zain at SpaceX like you do with Tesla about Elon Musk being exclusively the one person running that company. Alright, Paul R LA Monica live for us there thank you so much.

Right today that is the first thing people think about but he wasn't like that he built this. That is his legacy and people came after him. He just opens that path for this kind of culture to blossom and for me to see that was an inspiration as well. I mean, I didn't grow up watching football. I'll be quite honest with you but he doesn't matter because he transcended that he went far beyond that and to see little kids, kids of color, black children, poor children have an idol that in the 1960s was able to have achieved that kind of notoriety to get that kind of recognition from the world.

And of course, 10 year rates have come down off its peak. So we would expect long rates over the year to come down as the economy goes through a slowdown or maybe even a contraction by the middle of the year. Now, with regards to businesses, we have to expect there to be some type of a default cycle, there are going to be businesses that are exposed that are only viable in a very low interest rate environment and now that they have to roll over debt are less viable. But if you look at what's gone on in the markets, S&amp;P 500 that was down 25 percent peak to trough high yield bond indices yielding something close to 8 percent. That's pricing in a lot of the pain the markets go first than the economy. So the question for Investors is have we priced it all in? Or is there more to come? I suspect that if we do have a recession, it'll likely be a milder one, a more mild default cycle. And it's probable that we've already priced in a lot of the pain or maybe all of the pain.",

So remember, the FederalReserve's goal here was to make us feel less wealthy to slow down the economy. And, and they've certainly succeeded in doing that and so, policy operates with lagged effects. So we're still going to feel the brunt of that policy tightening as we move through the first half of this year. But remember, the markets are already down peak to trough 25.4 percent, on average, in a recession, the last 10, you're down 31 percent. But you've got more mild recessions like 1991, 1981, where you're down around 25, 27 percent. So we've likely price a lot of it and so what Investors should be focusing on is not the lagged economic data lag. Lag economic data is going to show a weakening environment, what they should be focusing on are leading indicators that suggest signs of a recovery. Good ones to focus on, of course, would be what's the tenure doing? What's the dollar doing?

But again, Pele is heading back for a private funeral after lying in state for 24 hours just yesterday.

And Zipline is hoping the deal convinces governments and other countries to enter similar partnerships with them, of course, as well. Joining me live now is Zipline CEO, Keller Rinaudo Cliffton, Keller, thank you so much for being with us. So your company essentially delivers whole blood, frozen plasma platelets to sort of rural locations where a distribution network is harder as a lot more tricky. For your delivery company for this drone sort of delivery Network Company, why did you think that a strong medical delivery or health care delivery component was an important aspect to your business?",

We've expanded from there into today, we deliver over 250 different kinds of medical products, we've delivered 2 million doses of vaccine of COVID vaccine, 5 million doses of traditional vaccine. We deliver 75 percent of the national blood supply of Rwanda outside the Capitol today. We started with health care, because we believe that where you live should not determine whether you live. So we think that as you start to see these kinds of transformations in logistics toward zero emission, instant autonomous delivery, really, really important to make sure that that delivery serves all people equally. And that ensures equal access to health care products for every person on earth.",

One done by University of Pennsylvania in Rwanda demonstrated that not only has this new kind of logistics been able to reduce National Blood waste by 66 percent, but it's also been able to reduce maternal mortality in the hospitals that have access to this kind of service by 88 percent over the last two years. So it turns out that logistics and healthcare are inextricably linked and making wide variety of products more readily available at every primary care facility in hospital in the country has a big impact on patient health.",

So anybody in the U.S. if you've used any kind of instant delivery service, whether that was you know, door dash or grub hub, it's not totally dissimilar than that. But instead of using a 3000 pound gas combustion vehicle driven by human Zipline manufacturers, these light, fast electric autonomous aircraft that you can see behind me.

Today he will be arraigned that means he will go before a judge and be asked to enter a plea on those eight federal charges that he's facing. Those include counts of wire fraud and multiple counts of conspiracy. The sources tell us that Bankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty to those charges. And of course, later down the road if he is convicted, he could face up to 115 years in prison. Now prosecutors have called this a fraud of epic proportions. Bankman-Fried is accused of stealing billions of dollars from customers and using it to cover debt by a related hedge fund called Alameda Research to make political donations and to buy real estate. Now he has maintained interviews that he gave before he was charged and arrested in this case, saying that he never intentionally defended intended to defraud anybody. He's denied that there was a fraud at all. So he will appear in court today. He's not expected to say much usually the defendants are not required to say anything other than enter their plead in this case; which we understand will be that he will plead not guilty. That will take place a little later today. And of course, Bankman-Fried is out on bail. So we are waiting for his arrival at the courthouse. He is out on a $250 million bond. He also is at home confinement at his parent's home in Palo Alto, California. They of course are Stanford law professors, Zain. So we're just expecting his arrival sometime in the next few hours for this court appearance later today. And of course, you know, this drew a lot of public attention the last time he was here since he was had to be extradited from the Bahamas. So this will be the second time that we will be out in public since facing these serious, serious charges, Zain.",
