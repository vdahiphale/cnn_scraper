We're getting new details out of St. Louis. Thank you so much, Brynn.I want to turn now to a new report that is showing that the Coronavirus pandemic caused historic learning setbacks for children across the United States. Fourth and eighth graders falling behind and reading and also showing the largest decline ever in math. CNN's Gabe Cohen joins me now. He's been looking into this.

These test results from an exam known as The Nation's Report Card show a significant drop in reading and math scores for fourth and eighth graders from 2019 to 2022. And the students that were already struggling in school saw the most dramatic drop-off.Let's take a look at the numbers and they are troubling. For reading, 37 percent of fourth graders and 30 percent of eighth graders performed below the basic level. That's the lowest of the three achievement levels that they track for the test. For math, 25 percent of fourth graders and 38 percent of eighth graders were below that basic level. And the math numbers are historic. It is the largest decline we've ever seen recorded on this test. Now just last month, we saw similar results showing math and reading scores for nine-year-olds fell by a level not seen in decades. And the federal government is trying to act. They're pumping billions in relief funds into districts and requiring them to spend at least 20 percent of it on learning loss. And just this morning on \"NEW DAY,\" education secretary Miguel Cardona said they're proposing a 21 percent increase in the education budget but in the short term, Kate, with teacher burnout and fewer new teachers, a lot of schools are struggling to hire staff and it's only making this issue worse.",

More than 7000 cases were reported, according to the CDC. Now, this only included a 9 percent of the population, and yet the CDC says that this was the most cases reported in a one-week period in the past two years, so very alarming there.According to HHS, three in four pediatric hospitals around the country -- hospital beds, excuse me around the country are in use right now. Here at Texas Children's Hospital, over 40 children are hospitalized with RSV including over 10 who are in the pediatric ICU. So as a parent, what do you do? What doctors are recommending is for you to be informed to know the symptoms. Here they are, first of all, runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. Doctors say that parents know their children best and so you want to observe your children. If they have any sort of change, if they're not themselves, then you have to pay attention. Now, according to doctors here, there is no vaccine for RSV, but they do ask parents to do the following again to reduce the strain on hospitals. And, Kate, these are simple things. First of all, teach your children to wash their hands well and often, and also get them the flu vaccine, Kate.",

The former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, he was speaking out and he had a warning for parents. Let me play this for you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: For parents who have children who have an upper respiratory infection, many times they're testing them finding out it's not COVID and feeling relieved, I think they still need to be vigilant that it could be RSV, it could be early flu.

The judge came in and he wanted to make sure that this was free and voluntary. He asked him all of these questions if he was aware.
