      "sentences": "Hello and welcome. I'm Christina Macfarlane in London. This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Ahead -- it's in the public interest. America's top lawman appoints an independent prosecutor to oversee criminal investigations into Donald Trump. Then, millions of Ukrainians face power outage fears as winter sets in. We will take you to Kramatorsk where sunflower seeds are being turned into heating logs. And a ten-year-old climate activist gets a standing ovation at COP27. But the adults in the room are wrapping up the conference with few achievements to cheer for. Now, it's a blockbuster move that's already showing a fiery response from a former president. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel to investigate Donald Trump for possible criminal actions. And he has named veteran Justice Department and war crimes prosecutor, Jack Smith, to head up the probes. The announcement comes just days after Trump announced he's running for president in 2024. Garland is assigning Smith to tasks to look into potential illegal interference in the certification of the presidential vote following the 2020 election. And Trump's retention of documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency ended. Trump says it's political and he won't participate. CNN senior legal affairs analyst Paula Reid is joining us from Washington. Paula, as we said, this comes just days after Donald Trump announced he'd be seeking reelection. So, tell us what this really means for the former president, and the timeline we're going to see him moving forward?",

      "sentences": "For the former president, it means his investigations are far from over. We knew that justice officialswere considering possibly appointing a special counsel, if the former president announced a third run for the White House. They were trying to insulate the Justice Department from political attacks or suggestions that the Biden Justice Department was pursuing, if, potential campaign rival. But under the regulation, a special counsel still ultimately reports to the attorney general. So, it's unclear if this is really going to insulate the Justice Department from questions about political motivations. A Trump spokesman has already attacked this, calling it a, quote, political stunt. In terms of the day today, the special counsel will operate separately from the justice department in the day today, again, not interacting with the attorney general on a regular basis. And we'll continue these investigations that have been underway for quite some time. Now, they will oversee two separate investigations. One, into the possible mishandling of classified information, when that president and others brought documents down to his Mar-a-Lago residents. The other investigation is into any role that the former president may have had in January 6th. Now, speaking to his attorneys, they definitely see the Mar-a-Lago investigation as the greater legal threat. That the fact that they were pulling out a special counsel suggests it's likely to go on for quite some time. There was some hope among the former president's lawyers that perhaps this is wrapping up, but clearly, it's not the case.",

Paula, thanks so much for bringing up this.Well, it's still unclear whether Donald Trump will regain access to this one's favorite platform for airing grievances. Twitter's new CEO Elon Musk said Friday the site will restore a number of controversial accounts that were previously banned, but this the company still hasn't decided what to do about Trump 's. Musk said previously, no decision will be made until the new content moderation council is in place. North Korea is stoking more anxiety and triggering more harsh rebukes after its latest provocation with its nuclear program. It carried out another long-range missile test Friday, with leader Kim Jong-un overseeing the launch. This one, an ICBM that experts say could reach the U.S. mainland. It flew to an altitude of more than 6,000 kilometers before landing in the sea west of Japan. It's a North Korea's second missile test in two days, and the 34th this year. In response, U.S. and South Korea fighter jets conducted joint drills in a show of force. Well, CNN's Will Ripley is joining us live from Bangkok, Thailand. Will, this now a record number of missile tests in one year. Talk us through the concern around this latest ICBM and what this says about North Korea's progress and developing weapons of this nature?",

So, what can be done here? And unfortunately, we have lost Will. But thanks to him for bringing us that. Okay, let's move on. Ukraine's foreign minister says experts from his country are working at the site where missiles killed two people in Poland on Tuesday. TVN24 shot this video of Ukrainian vehicles at the site. Poland and some of its allies have said it was likely a Ukrainian air defense missile, that was meaning to stop the Russian attack. Kyiv says it has evidence of a Russian trace in the explosion and has demanded to be part of the investigation into what caused the incident. Meanwhile, the United Nations is warning of a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine, as Russian attacks leave critical infrastructure under strain. And millions of people without power. Our Nic Robertson is standing by for us tonight in Kyiv. And, Nic, it's not just energy, its communication and gas supplies that have been targeted as well. So, what are you seeing of how average Ukrainians are coping right now?",

But great to be able to go out, the possible fact that they'll be possible aerate sirens going off, the cold winter weather to go and get food. There were fewer places to buy food. For them, it's getting more expensive. So, all of that becomes much, much harder. And the further away you get from the bigger cities, it, again, gets particularly hard. We were in the east of the country in Kramatorsk, close to the front line there. That town is sort of, if you will, the end of electricity supply line. So, it has more outages than many other towns. Kyiv has some rolling outages, but Kramatorsk, in particular, suffers a lot. We spent some time there talking to residents about how they're trying to prepare. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Gas just came back to Kramatorsk, a boon of battlefield games. Maria, a 70-year-old pensioner was not expecting it. It brought her wood burning stove. It was hard without gas, she tells us. And now, thanks to God, we're okay. But for how long? When the government turned the gas back on here at the beginning of November, they did it without any big announcement because like every other critical service here, gas depends on electricity, and that's what Russia's targeting. When I met the mayor here three months ago, he was urging residents to leave ahead of winter. OLEKSANDR HONCHARENKO, KRAMATORSK, UKRAINE MAYOR (through translator):  We do not have gas at all, and it's not possible to repair our gas lines.",

Mostly, pensioners, mostly for, bundle off against a cold, a free bread distribution, tempting them out of frigid homes. If they help us likely to hear, it would be fine, 84 year old Julia tells us. I am a child of World War II, she says. We were cold, hungry, but we survived. Across town, another pensioner, 82-year-old Alexandra, shows us the basement she shares with neighbors, already stockpiling food for winner. No gas for warmth here, just an old electric heater. When there is no electricity, you have no heat, how do you stay warm? We just have to put on our coats, wrap ourselves and blankets, and go to bed, she says. That is how we live, that is how we expect. Born into war, she says, probably die in war. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera):  And that's what worries the mayor that he has some 80,000 people, and in that time, this is a situation replicated all across the country. The poor, the elderly are the ones that are going to suffer the most. Most communities here are strongly rallying around and helping each other. But the ability to actually sit in a cold basement and withstand the winter chill, with temperatures getting down to many degrees below sub-zero. They already are right now. It is snowing right now here in Kyiv. And this is going to be particularly for the elderly, a very long and very, very hard winter.",

We have known for years, of course, that MBS was and is the crown prince. He will likely be king of Saudi Arabia someday. But his father, King Salman, made and the as the prime minister only a few weeks ago at the end of September, a move that has been criticized by activists and even some legal experts as a ploy to give MBS this cover, to give the U.S. a justification to provide him with immunity. And that is exactly what happened. In the Department of Justice filing that came last late last night in the 11th hour, almost literally on the day that they had to make their suggestion, the Department of Justice said that MBS should get immunity because he is, for now, the prime minister of Saudi Arabia and therefore, the head of the Saudi government. Of course, the ultimate power, Christina, lies with King Salman, as we were noting. There is a fierce backlash to this, including on Capitol Hill, lawmakers, including Democrats, really criticizing the Biden administration. I also heard from Jamal Khashoggi's fiance who told me that she was devastated today. And that President Biden himself betrayed his word, and betrayed Jamal Khashoggi - Christina.",

An agreement was previously made that would allow alcohol to be sold at the games during limited hours. But instead, Qatar will only allow beer sales during the fan festival and other licensed venues. The Muslim country normally tightly regulates alcohol sale and usage. We will have much more coverage of the story at World Cup -- at \"WORLD SPORT\", rather, coming up in ten minutes time. All right, let's take a look at the other key stories making international impacts today. Hundreds of university students in Sri Lanka clashed with police Friday, demanding that release of two detained student leaders. The two played a major role in anti-government protests earlier this year. Human rights groups have criticized the government for cracking down on peaceful protests. Thousands of people formed a ten kilometer chain through Budapest Friday to support teachers. Teachers across Hungary are demanding higher wages amid a deepening shortage of profession. Protests were held in more than 40 towns across the country. Kazakhs are preparing to pick their next president on Sunday, but the outcome seems really inevitable. About 78 percent of voters tend to support Kazakhstan's current leader, according to a recent poll. A Ghanaian climate activist received a standing ovation at the COP27 summit on Friday, after an emotional speech. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
