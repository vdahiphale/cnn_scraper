It looks like he probably has some degree of training.You see the stance there with the shoulder-wide separation at the feet. He's got his arms raised up to the level of his eyes. He's got two hands on the grip of that weapon. These are all things that you learn when you're learning marksmanship. His elbows are bent a little bit, which is not perfect but I'm nitpicking a little bit here. Bottom line is he looks like someone who's had training, maybe law enforcement training, maybe military training, or maybe private training. You can learn those things that way as well. It's striking to me also that he is so calm. He gets to the set just before within five or 10 minutes before his victim arrives, which also suggests to me that he had some degree of intelligence about when the victim would arrive. Now, there's many ways that you could get that. You could get that from an insider, which I think is probably unlikely or simply from doing your own surveillance. He may have seen the victim leave his hotel and then, you know, hustled to get out in front of him. He waits for other people to walk by before he comes out and then he lets the victim pass him before he engages with the firearm, which enables him to set up and take his shots carefully without the victim looking at him and protesting or making, you know, drawing attention or anything like that. So, all totaled, Anderson, it looks to me to be very disciplined, very organized, well trained, possibly even professional, although we don't know that at this point. But it's chilling.

Nevertheless, he's on an e-bike, which again shows to me a really high degree of planning. It's in many ways the ideal getaway vehicle for Midtown Manhattan, when there likely would be traffic. Hard to get a vehicle -- park a vehicle on the street, move it out of there quickly. On the city bike, he can really make some, you know, pretty good time there pretty quick. And he can get into the park, which is clearly his chosen mode of escape quickly, blending in with the crowd. He's got the large backpack on which is a very interesting item. It's a backpack from a small company that makes very kind of specialized equipment for outdoor enthusiasts and travelers and things like that. It's not very common. And it likely is full of clothing that he can use to change his appearance once he's got a second, maybe in the park, maybe behind some cover.

It's been described by investigators as a brazen, targeted attack. It certainly appears that way. For a perspective, I'm joined by Emmy and Peabody Award-winning Journalist, Geraldo Rivera. Also, John Miller is back with us as well.Geraldo, you used to work near this part of Manhattan. There's often a lot of pedestrian traffic early -- even early in the morning. When you see this video of the shooting, what we're learning so far, what stands out to you? GERALDO RIVERA, EMMY AND PEABODY AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST: Well, it is extraordinary that a brazen murder would take place in such a busy part of New York, the heart of Manhattan. I haven't covered a mob assassination or any kind of assassination in New York since Paul Castellano 39 years ago outside Sparks Steak House. Having said that, it's pretty clear that this killer was a pro who had a plan. Those side entrances locked this guy staying across the street, which is to your left, crosses the street. There's only one way to walk to the main entrance of the Hilton on Sixth Avenue, and that's the way he's walking. So it's easy for this killer to get behind Brian Thompson, and he takes his time to put that first bullet in him. But that's what look -- looks like 20 feet away, so he must have been confident. And then of course, as you and John have been discussing, the gun jams because of the silencer probably and changing the weight of it, but a cool customer, everything bespeaks a mob hit -- I mean, a hit, an organized killer for hire, not a mob. But I think that really you have to explore more about Brian Thompson's background. It really seems that there were a lot of people very angry at this guy for insider trading and alleged fraud and making $15 million by keeping a Department of Justice probe of the UnitedHealth quiet, selling his stock, getting out, pocketing that $15 million when the stockholders went home broke. So, this was definitely a lot of people with motive and a pro with opportunity, Anderson, did this dramatic murder in Midtown.",

It just -- this was -- this really takes balls when you consider that this guy know exactly what he is doing. He has the silencer, he gets behind, doesn't rush it, takes the shot, hits him in the back, and then, as the weapon jams, and I know you've decided not to show the cool, calm, deliberate manner in which he unjams that weapon. But man, I'm telling you, it was a pro at work there and a cold-blooded one, because then he puts the coup de grace, the killer shots or the insurance shots in the victim standing over him and where did the guy over there in the right against the building, isn't that a person also?

Israel threatened Tuesday to go deeper into Lebanon, that came a day after intense Israeli airstrikes, a response to Hezbollah rocket attacks themselves, a response to Israeli attacks.Today, Secretary Blinken said that, now, they mostly want to see is \"people being able to return their homes.\" Clarissa Ward has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the balcony of his apartment, a man gazes out at his city, Tyre, once renowned for its glittering waters and ancient ruins, now in ruins itself. Moos Assad (ph) has lived through many wars in Lebanon, but none like this. 25 years, we have been here in Tyre, he tells us. An Israeli strike pulverized the next door building where his neighbors once lived. Their clothes still hang ghost-like in the closet. Imagine a person was sleeping here. The building collapsed on them, everyone died, a woman and her children, all of them dead. Why? For what? He says. America did this to us, not Israel. It's America that goes like this, like she didn't see anything and she didn't want to know anything. Lebanon is a country where loyalties are divided, but bitterness towards the West for its support of Israel is everywhere. In villages around Tyre, Hezbollah flags fly proudly. No community has been spared. The Melkite Greek Catholic church had been a refuge for displaced people when it was hit by an Israeli missile on October 9th, eight people were killed. 81-year-old church caretaker Milaad Ilia (ph) has prayed here as long as he can remember. This is my house, he says. Next to the church a mosque, connected by a shared hall for events. If our homes were hit and the church stayed, it would be better, he tells us. If the church is gone, there is no coexistence between people here. Tyre is one of the world's oldest inhabited cities, mentioned several times in the Bible. As the light falls, Kamaal Istanbuli (ph) does what fishermen have been doing here for thousands of years. For 60 days during the war, Israel's military barred boats from going out on the water. Of course, it was tough, he says. We fishermen must work every day to feed our families. WARD: What's your dream for the future? WARD (voice-over): We don't have a future here, he tells me. With Israel as your neighbor, occupying your land, there's no future for you. There's just war after war, destruction after destruction, and the country collapses and collapses. A bleak outlook shared by many in this historic city, even as a shaky ceasefire continues to hold. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
