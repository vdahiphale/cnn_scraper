      "sentences": "Now, of course, the two nations are, when it comes to the geopolitical front, aligned in terms of those tensions with the West. And that was certainly the message once again from President Putin, saying that the two nations and the relations and cooperation between Russia and China would serve as what he described as a stabilizing factor with the backdrop of increased geopolitical tensions.He also went on to say that this would serve the goal of creating a fair new world order. So clearly there, a clear emphasis on deepening those relations. President Xi, for his part, according to Russian state media, said China is ready to increase military cooperation with Russia. And, of course, as we heard from President Putin, he has now extended an official invitation to President Xi to visit Moscow in the spring.",

This meant that people were trapped in their rooms. And so, they've had to go blow-by-blow through each of these rooms to look for the missing. And we know that is one of the reasons the death toll has increased is because they have been finding people who would have died as a result of smoke inhalation. We also know that at least two people died when they jumped out of windows from the burning building when it was engulfed by this fire that started on the lower level and very swiftly moved up. There is some indication, according to local officials, that potentially, it was high winds as well overnight that resulted in this fire absolutely ravaging this facility. What happens now remains a little bit unclear. We are at this actual time, with our teams, in the area trying to discern whether that search and rescue effort is going to continue. There are indications, though -- and, of course, the families that have lost loved ones want to know what caused this fire. We know that the Cambodian government has set up a committee that will investigate this. And so, now the focus is shifting a little bit to answering some of the most important questions around this. The how and the why, Whitney.",

      "sentences": "Sunlen, thank you for that.So, let's bring in senior political correspondent from The New York -- for The New Republic, Daniel Strauss. So, Daniel, you just wrote a story that sort of broke down how it happened. That this information didn't come out until basically too late -- until after the election. And one of the things that you point out in your story is that some of the opposition -- the people who were handling the opposition research said that people just didn't seem very interested in these -- in these stories and that there was a lot more interest in this narrative that there were two gay candidates. And I just wonder if you might expand upon that a little bit. What does it say about the state of journalism? What does it say about the state of local newsrooms? DANIEL STRAUSS, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW REPUBLIC (via Skype):  I mean, I think the bigger indication here is that this is an example of what happens when there are fewer local newsrooms and there are fewer local investigative journalists. The narrative through most of this campaign cycle was on election interference and election denialism, which is not an unimportant thing. But the holes in George Santos' resume did not match or fit into that narrative and there really weren't enough aggressive newsrooms in this -- in and around this district to uncover this until after he was elected to Congress. WILD:  It takes a lot of commitment in newsrooms. I mean, I came up through local news. I worked in newsrooms where there really was a commitment to that. I mean, KUSA in Denver, where I worked -- we had someone who was committed to fact-checking. The same thing was true at WUSA-9 where I worked here in Washington. Newsrooms have to commit to having at least one person who is solely responsible for doing that because you can't let up. You can't take your eye off the ball and then -- I mean, look what happens. One question I have is how did it happen that it was later on that the national media did start to pick up? What was the catalyst for starting to dig in a little bit more -- at least the level -- at the level of The New York Times?",

These are -- I mean, just -- I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen someone fabricate on this level -- just everything. I'm not really clear at this point what he said that's actually true because every -- because day in and day out we keep learning that he did not go to a prep school. Did not go to Baruch College. Did not work for elite financial companies.
