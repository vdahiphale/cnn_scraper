Now, the eyes of the world areon Washington D.C. right now on the second day of NATO's 75th anniversary landmark summit. Russia's war on Ukraine is at the top of the agenda with the alliance aiming to showcase its ironclad commitment to Kyiv. Earlier, the NATO chief said he expects allies to agree to what he's calling a substantial package for Ukraine and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made this announcement just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  As we speak the transfer of F-16 jets is underway coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands, and those jets those jets -- those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.

The U.S. President is hostingthe three-day event under intense scrutiny amid deep divisions on how to move forward within the Democratic Party. In the last hour, we learned actor George Clooney, a major supporter of the Democratic Party is calling on Biden to step aside in an op-ed for \"The New York Times\" and one lawmaker is urgently sounding the alarm -- the first Democratic senator to publicly do so, but stopping short of calling on President Biden to step aside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO):  Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House. I think that we could lose the whole thing. The White House in the time since that disastrous debate I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.

His speech is being described as quite forceful at a time where everything he says and he does is under the spotlight. So, what's happening behind the scenes? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, you're absolutely right. This is a hugely significant moment for President Biden as he stands on the global stage at a moment of real political turmoil for him here at home. You know it's been just about two weeks since that CNN presidential debate where his performance on that debate stage really shocked a lot of people including his supporters and advisors and a lot of Democrats in his party. And the questions that have come out of that debate performance about his age, his fitness to serve, those have come not only just from folks here at home but have also been questions that have been raised by world leaders and world diplomats. And, of course, underlying all of that is the broader question of what does this all mean for the election that is coming up here in November and could this ultimately all lead to Donald Trump having a second term at the White House which a lot of global leaders are nervous and anxious about. And I think we saw last night when the president delivered those opening remarks here at NATO just how much scrutiny he is under. He did deliver remarks that were first forceful as described by some and really touched on the themes that are really central to his foreign policy. He was talking about the importance of protecting democracy all across the world and how he believes in the importance of the U.S.' role in leading those efforts. But again, coming at a moment of real peril and political peril for him here at home and it was not surprising that there was so much attention being paid to just his delivery and whether he was able to get through those remarks without having a serious stumble.",

I mean, he has said that, you know, the world -- the world is waiting, the United States is waiting, Europe's waiting, everyone's waiting. President Putin, he said is waiting for November to see what happens in the elections. He says President Putin can sort of hold out his fighting until the end of the year. But President Zelenskyy has said, look strong U.S. leadership can help Ukraine win the war and that winning happens with the support of NATO. So, we understand his view. He said he's not against, you know, the United States people -- people of the United States voting in Donald Trump but he said he's not somebody that he knows very well. He is clearly anxious. We heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken today I thought interestingly at the NATO forum kind of laying out something that, I say this, that it was at the NATO forum because it seemed to be something for sort of domestic U.S. consumption. He said, look, United States is 20 percent of global GDP. If we add in then our NATO allies, we'll bring that up to 40 or 50 percent of global GDP. And if we add enough Pacific partners like New Zealand, Australia South Korea, Japan, you bring that block -- that committed block of democracies up to about 60 percent of GDP. So, what he's really saying here is look, we are more powerful when we have other countries on our side as allies. It's not really a zero-sum game of who is paying how much although undoubtedly, no one -- NATO, you know, ignores the fact that the United States puts in, you know, financial terms much more than they do in percentage terms they're all committed to these increases of GDP and may increase them further. So, I think you know that's part of the takeaway in the context here that the message, the pre-message is trying to load domestically and internationally, domestic for the U.S. that NATO is more than perhaps Donald Trump at least says publicly that it is, but the concern's absolutely there.",

So, there's no shortage in need to build the Ukraine defensive capacities and by assisting them in moving from sort of a Soviet-era MIGs and Sukhois and into very modern equipment also in the air, we supplement, you know, the brave and very committed, the people in Ukraine with equipment that will be -- we believe be very helpful this has been aircraft that has been extremely useful in protecting Norway and Belgium and Netherlands and Denmark from all these years.

Good to have you on the show, much appreciated.Well, new developments now in that horrific strike on Ukraine's largest Children's Hospital as volunteers work to clear the rubble weapons. Experts tell CNN, it is highly likely a Russian cruise missile caused Monday's death and destruction. Russia is denying it was responsible saying the hospital in Kyiv was hit by a stray Ukrainian air defense missile. Across Ukraine, at least 44 people have died as a result of Monday's air strike. In the meantime, we have live pictures coming through from Capitol Hill for NATO summit. As you can see, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meeting up with senators as he tries to rally more support for Ukraine. The U.S. and other countries have pledged more weaponry for Ukraine and of course this is one of the most important stories. This, after we saw multiple strikes around Ukraine earlier this week and of course that Children's Hospital very much being top of mind not only for the leaders in NATO but also for what we've been seeing in Ukraine on the ground. We've got Fred Pleitgen standing by who is in Kyiv for us. Fred, as we're covering the NATO summit that's dominating headlines.

Obviously, the strike here on this Children's Hospital, the fact that the Ukrainians are saying that they need better air defense systems. But of course, also in general, better air capabilities and that interview that you just did Eleni, with the foreign minister of Norway was really exceptional because it's one of the things that does showcase why the Ukrainians believe that those F-16 jets for instance are so important. The Ukrainians have said that they believe that F-16s will help them to bolster their air defense capabilities. Obviously, those jets capable of taking down for instance cruise missiles out of the air, but also as the foreign minister was just saying in your interview, to help Ukraine guard its own airspace better than it is able to right now with the old Soviet era jets that they currently have. And one of the things that Ukrainians have been saying, Eleni, is that the Russian Air Force is now much more capable at attacking Ukrainian frontline positions because they've developed bombs with which they can strike those positions further away from the actual frontline and the Ukrainians hope that those F-16s with their more powerful radars are able to engage those Russian Air Force jets and hopefully keep them away from Ukrainian frontline positions. So, that definitely is something where the Ukrainians hope that all that could make a very big impact. And then of course, you have the suffering really of the Ukrainian civilians you see behind me that destroyed hospital complex that was hit, the biggest Children's Hospital in all of Ukraine. Of course, President Zelenskyy, whom we just saw there at the NATO summit, very angry about all this. I want to listen into some of what he said earlier about the bombing of this hospital.",

And again, on the back end of this, and I think for many people on the ground in Ukraine remembering what atrocities have occurred over the last two and a half years, but also that Children's Hospital as more pledges come through to support President Zelenskyy. All right, Fred, you were saying that that the people you've been speaking to on the ground have harrowing stories to tell you about the realities as I guess many people meet in the boardrooms and on stage to discuss what kind of support they'll be giving to Ukraine they're living, it's in real terms, and they need urgently to see a lot more support.",

And just to give you one example, Eleni, as we've beenspeaking right now, we've been speaking about the death toll of those attacks that occurred on Monday and the Ukrainians now coming out and saying actually right now the death toll has changed because now a little boy has been confirmed to have been killed on the strike here in the hospital that you see behind me. This just came through from official Ukrainian politicians just a couple of minutes ago. So, the death toll in this area where I am right now has now risen to three with a small boy now being confirmed dead and that's of course one of the reasons why so many Ukrainians are also looking to that summit that is taking place there and some of the pledges that are happening. Of course, aside from the F-16s that we were just talking about, air defense, really, is the name of the game. We heard the speech yesterday from President Biden where he pledged additional Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, other types of long-range surface-to-air missile systems, as well. But one of the other things that the Ukrainians were looking at were the dozens of intermediate and short-range surface-to-air missile systems that President Biden was also speaking about because one of the things that the Ukrainians have said is that the hospital complex that you see behind me was bombed yesterday, they say, by a Russian cruise missile and of course those intermediate range surface-to-air missile systems very capable of taking those kind of missiles down. So, the Ukrainians are saying all the things that are happening at that summit are absolutely key for them not just to keep their population safe now, but of course, at the same time, you've also had the Russians drastically increase their attacks on civilian infrastructure and critical infrastructure, like heating plants, like electrical plants. And, of course, the Ukrainians say, if they're not more capable of defending that, a lot of people are going to be freezing and be without electricity once the winter comes here in Ukraine, Eleni.",

George Clooney is not arandom celebrity weighing in on the 2024 campaign, but Clooney was one of those key stars who headlines that Hollywood fundraiser for President Biden just about 10 days before his debate against Donald Trump. And in this new \"New York Times\" op-ed, Clooney bluntly says that he does not believe Democrats will win in November with President Biden at the top of the ticket. He said that the Biden that he saw in Los Angeles in mid- June is not the same Biden as he had seen in the past, and that it was time for party leaders like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and also former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to encourage the president to step aside from this race. Now, George Clooney has been a long-time Democratic donor. He supported former President Barack Obama, supported Joe Biden back in 2020, and helped Biden bring in a significant amount of cash, more than $30 million at that Los Angeles fundraiser alone. As we're still waiting to gauge, like, how exactly the Biden campaign is impacted by this announcement, the Biden campaign spokespeople simply pointed back to the fact that President Biden has repeatedly said that he is remaining in this race. Now, Clooney adds to the growing chorus of concerns within the Democratic Party about keeping Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in November. The president, behind the scenes, has been working to try to shore up support with key groups, calling in to a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus, calling into a meeting of his donors, another one with Democratic mayors. Today, here in Washington, he met with union leaders at the AFL- CIO, saying that unions are critical to this economy, critical to American voters. And so, the president is trying to shore up that support, but, at the same time, you have these pockets within the Democratic Party who are speaking publicly and privately, calling for the president to step aside. Now, moments ago, another Democratic House member called for President Biden to step aside, bringing that number to eight people publicly saying that there are many more behind the scenes who have expressed concerns about whether Biden can win in November. So, for the president, he's insisting that he is remaining in this race, but still there are Democrats raising questions about whether that's actually his final decision, and some are still pressing him to drop out of this race to give Democrats a better shot against Trump.",

We've already learned F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands will begin arriving in Ukraine this summer. As you can see, there's live pictures coming through from Washington, D.C. The current U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, also says that there's plenty of attention on the U.S. and Joe Biden. He's hosting the Washington gathering, which is shaping up to be a test for Mr. Biden to try and show he can handle another four years in the White House. It's time now for our Exchange. Joining us is Kurt Volker. He is a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and he's also served as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Ambassador Volker is currently a distinguished fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and a senior advisor at the Atlantic Council. So great to have you with us. Thank you so much for taking the time. I want to start off with one of the biggest questions around this war, which has been going on for two and a half years. The big concern remains that Ukraine isn't getting weapons quickly enough and the type of weapons that it actually needs. Give us a sense of whether you believe, if NATO had been far more decisive in its approach, whether we'd still be having this conversation today. And do you believe that there is a consensus to do that? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO:  First off, there could have been consensus if the U.S. had been willing to lead more a year ago, a year and a half ago, even two years ago. What we've seen is incrementalism and hesitation, saying that we would not provide certain weapons before deciding to provide them later, providing them slowly, not in the numbers needed. So, a lot of half steps along the way, all because of fear of escalation. Well, Putin took advantage of that fear and escalated anyway and has created the situation that we face today. I think back particularly to last winter when the Russians were able to dig in and put in place massive defensive fortifications along the front line in Ukraine that blunted a Ukrainian counter-offensive. That could have been prevented had we acted more quickly.",

But NATO is not unified when it comes to ending the biggest war in Europe since World War II, which is raging on right now. We have to be able to give Ukraine what it needs to win the war, and that is something that the U.S. and others still hesitate about. There are still restrictions on the use of weapons that the U.S. provides, and other weapons are still off-limits. So, we've got to get over that. As far as concerns about the future of U.S. leadership go, those are very serious concerns, and you might say there's unity there in NATO because everybody has those concerns. They saw the debate performance of President Biden. It made them wonder whether he is capable of leading the United States and the alliance right now, let alone six months from now running for re-election.

We have adjoining NATO territory in Poland and Romania, and we can project forward to protect Ukrainian civilians, critical infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and so forth.

And NASA and the Russians, Roscosmos, and all of their European partners, they plan for contingency upon contingency. So supply-wise, at least for now, they're good. Although I'm sure for those two Starliner astronauts, Butch and Suni, there are probably a few personal items that they would have liked to have brought with them if they knew that they were going to be up there for several weeks, if not months, as opposed to the original eight-day mission, which was the original plan. A few things that we learned. This was the first time that those two astronauts have really taken any kind of questions from reporters since arriving at the International Space Station and since we learned about those problems with the Starliner spacecraft, helium leaks and issues with the thrusters. So, during this press conference, we heard that both Butch and Suni say that they remain confident that this spacecraft will be able to get them back to Earth safe and sound. The big question, though, is when. And so far, we still don't have an answer to that, Eleni. Right now, NASA and Boeing officials are holding a press conference, so we may get a more targeted date in just a few minutes. But as of now, the work that's being done is to continue to test those thrusters, not just in space, but on Earth. They're testing replicas of those thrusters in White Sands, New Mexico, right now.

So they will get back to Earth eventually. The question is when and on what spacecraft. If it is not on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, that is going to be a massive, massive blow for Boeing and for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. But in terms of, you know, how serious the helium leak and the thrusters are, NASA has already given the Starliner spacecraft the green light to return those astronauts to Earth on Starliner in an emergency. And, in fact, they did take shelter in there in an emergency situation when debris from that Russian satellite got too close to comfort to the ISS. So, it's been given the green light in an emergency. They just haven't been given the green light in a nominal or normal situation. Eleni.",
