There was no deal before a midnight deadline. The studios claim they were willing to improve on their offer, however, it would not meet some of the union's demands. The strike could halt the production of several television shows and could possibly delay the start of new seasons as well.Kate.",

      "sentences": "Six people are dead this morning and dozens more are recovering after a dust storm triggered a huge pileup involving more than 70 vehicles. This all happened in Illinois on I-55 near Springfield. The dust blinded drivers almost instantaneously. And the images coming out afterward, just look at this. I mean you not only have mangled cars, but you have piles and piles of semi-trailers. You have vehicles and looks like also some cargo catching fire in the midst of all of this.CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is on the scene for us, how it looks today. Adrienne, a very different scene today as crews were clearly working around the clock to clear the scene, but what more are you learning about what happened here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, I'll start with the crews who worked overnight and through the morning to get this stretch of Interstate 55 back open. I am going to move out of the frame of the lens so you can see what is left behind. To the right, on the southbound lanes, you can see where the road is charred. When those more than 70 vehicles crashed, some of them caught fire and first responders who were handling this scene said that was one of the most difficult tasks, going to each individual car to make sure nobody was inside, even if they weren't involved in the crash, and it was especially difficult when the two trucks were on fire.Now, to answer your question in regards to what caused this. You see how windy it is today. The wind gusts were at least 45 miles per hour. That excessive wind picked up soil, dirt from neighboring farmland, as well as debris, and created those blinding conditions for drivers. Six people were killed, at least 37 others were sent to the hospital with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. The youngest victim, according to members of law enforcement, was a two-year-old. The oldest, an 80-year-old. Kate.",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple reasons, Sara. The first is that this balloon does not appear to have been maneuverable. So, it doesn't appear that it was being maneuvered by any kind of foreign government or any kind of external actor.It also, according to our sources, was not emitting any kind of signals. So that means that it was not being used likely for intelligence gathering or surveillance purposes. That Chinese spy balloon was emitting signals when it was flying over the United States, suggesting that it was being used for spying. In addition to this, the balloon that the U.S. military observed flying over parts of Hawaii did not actually transit over any sensitive government sites or any kind of critical Defense Department infrastructure. Just to remind viewers, the balloon, the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier this year, it did hover over sensitive military sites. So just the contrast there really suggested to U.S. officials that this was not necessarily a balloon that posed any kind of national security threat. The balloon also, according to the Defense Department, did not pose a risk to civil aviation. It was flying at around 36,000 feet, but they say that they did not determine that it was posing a risk to aircraft at that - at that height. So, bottom line here is that this is a very different situation than what they observed with the Chinese spy balloon, but, still, we have to recall that just earlier this year the U.S. military did shoot down three other unidentified objects. Of course, they do reserve the right to do so in this case as well. Right now no indication that they will. And we should note this balloon is now out of Hawaiian air space and out of U.S. territorial waters, though the Defense Department is still tracking it with the FAA. Sara.",

An Arkansas judge ruled that Biden must answer more questions about his investments in art sales, saying, quote, this cryptic, hide-the-ball game isn't going to cut it when we get to trial. So, that decision comes as part of a paternity case which has now morphed into a battle over Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings, his laptop and other financial issues. With us now, Katie Cherkasky. She is a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Again, this is a paternity suit in Arkansas that was reopened at Hunter Biden's request because he wanted to pay a lower amount in child support. So, was that an unforced error?",

BERMAN: All has to line up. So, we read in the intro here what the judge said, the cryptic hide-the-ball game, accusing Hunter Biden and his legal team there. What does that all mean? He basically said, you've redacted too much in the documents we asked for.",
