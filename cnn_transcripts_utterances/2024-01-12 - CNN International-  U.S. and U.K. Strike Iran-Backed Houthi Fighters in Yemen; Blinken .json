More now from CNN's Alex Marquardt and MJ Lee.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The United States and the United Kingdom have announced that they have carried out what they call precision strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, more than a dozen of them because of the attacks by Houthi forces since late November against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. This is the Red Sea right here. It is a critical waterway that sees some 15 percent of the global shipping trade pass through it. So, there were more than a dozen strikes, mostly in the western part of Houthi-controlled Yemen, in and around the capital, Sanaa, over here on the coast. And then up here in Saada, we saw this video of the night sky glowing after these strikes. In just a moment, you'll see another strike right there. In terms of the targets that were hit -- this is both according to the Pentagon as well as the Houthis -- air bases and airports, camps, radar systems, drone storage and launch sites. Drones have been central to those Houthi attacks. You have ballistic and cruise missile storage and launch sites that were hit, as well as coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities. Now, in terms of what was used in these strikes, you have fighter jets from both the U.S. and the United Kingdom. This is one of the British fighter jets that was taking off in order to carry out an airstrike. You also have ships and submarine platforms that were used, according to the Pentagon. One of the submarines that was named was the U.S.S Florida. It's a guided missile submarine. The ships and submarines are able to fire tomahawk missiles against those targets on Yemeni soil. Now, to what extent the U.S.S Eisenhower carrier strike group was used, we don't know, but it has been in the region to try to deter any regional actors, including the Houthis and Iran, from expanding the conflict that we are seeing currently between Israel and Hamas. The Houthis warning that they would retaliate against any international strikes, and the U.S. saying that they and their partners are prepared for that. In the wake of their strike, saying this may not be the last word in terms of military action against the Houthis. Alex Markward, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "President Biden saying Thursday night that the U.S. is sending a clear message to the Houthis that their ongoing attacks in the Red Sea will no longer be tolerated.He said in a statement that he will also not hesitate to direct further measures to protect U.S. personnel and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. U.S. officials, of course, have been warning for weeks that the Houthis must stop its attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. And last week, we saw a U.S. official give what they said was a final warning. And what we are learning tonight is that the attacks that we saw from the Houthis on Tuesday -- this was just two days ago -- had targeted some U.S. vessels. And what we are told by sources is that, had it not been for this defensive coalition called Operation Prosperity Guardian that was already set up by the U.S. and a number of its allies in the Red Sea, that we may have seen situations where ships were sunk by these attacks, and that there was even an instance within the last month where a commercial vessel carrying jet fuel may have been hit. The senior official saying that some of these were basically close calls. Now, it was after these Tuesday's attacks that President Biden, we're told, convened his national security team, and asked them to draw up a number of possible plans for retaliation. And that is what ultimately culminated in these airstrikes conducted by the U.S. and the U.K. with the support of a number of other nations. And what one senior military official said Thursday night was that while it's not possible to say exactly what the damage was, that the damage to the Houthi rebels and Houthi assets for the time being could be described as significant.

If we in the United States and the U.K. deal with the escalation in the Red Sea as events, short-term events, I think we will have wrong answers to this problem. I think the strikes will not deter the Houthis' attacks. On the contrary, I think they will increase. The problem here is in which direction. And Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and all the partners in the Middle East have been cautioning against expanding the scope and the direction of attacks in the Houthis' strategy as an answer to the strikes. In addition, I think it will have implications on the peace negotiations inside Yemen, and the Houthis may be actually emboldened by these strikes, not deterred.",

And I think we might have fallen for that for a central reason, which is the Houthis want to be seen and dealt with and recognized, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, as a central component of Iran's axis of resistance in the Middle East.Additionally, they want the world to speak directly to them. In that, they see some legitimizing that they can gain from that internally in Yemen, but also regionally. I think the partners in the Middle East are so concerned about the long-term implications. This could take the shape of resuming the strikes by the Houthis against the UAE and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain now, having joined the coalition, but also striking the United States and the British military bases deployed in the Gulf. Additionally, they might attempt to block the south, the southern Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandab, completely justifying that on the back of the strikes that happened today. But also, I think we have a double problem here, or a complicated one. On the one hand, the regional countries agree that these attacks should stop and they shouldn't be allowed to happen again. But at the same time, they are very concerned that instead of stabilizing the security in the Middle East, these strikes might actually make the situation worse. And I think that means also in the long term that the Red Sea will be a militarized region. The insurance premium for shipping will go higher and inflation might be also boosted because of the conflict in this area.",
