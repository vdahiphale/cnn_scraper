This is \"Connect the World\" here on CNN. Happening this hour reports of a large fire and multiple casualties at Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, where thousands of people are said to be sheltering, the very latest on Israel's military operation there. Also this hour Russians prepared for six more years of Vladimir Putin after he's secure a landslide victory in the country's presidential election. We'll have reaction from Moscow for you, later this hour. Well the stock markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now if the futures are any indication, it looks as if the markets at least on the NASDAQ's front will be higher investors do seem to be updating their expectations on interest rates given recent inflation data that has come in slightly hot, of course, more on that bottom of the hour. Well, Haiti is in the midst of an uprising not seen in years, gang members have been launching coordinated attacks against government institutions there for weeks and now control 80 percent of Port au Prince, according to the United Nations, also choking off food supplies, fuel and water, pushing Haiti into a humanitarian crisis. Or as you can imagine, it is very difficult to get in out of the nation's capital as it is the epicenter of the gang violence. CNN's, David Culver has been there. And just a short time ago, he filed this report from inside a police station. Have a look.",

And you can see a lot of them are following us around and are curious to what we're doing because for them, it's a distraction, really. And you talk to a lot of these folks, and they've come here in the past couple of weeks because of the most recent surge in violence and gangs taking more and more territory here in the city. But these folks have also been on the run from their own homes for months if not years. She just got this small bag of rice and she's going to cook it up for seven people, a lot of them tell me they don't know where their next meal is going to be one little girl eight years old, saying she goes to bed every single night hungry. And a lot of that is because in the past two weeks in particular, supply lines, especially for programs of international aid, like the World Food Programme had been severed. So while these organizations are trying desperately to get food in, it's not just about getting them into Port au Prince. It's been about giving them into communities like this. The challenges logistically are immense. They're dealing with this at a level that they have not faced prior. I mean, it's unprecedented.

And of course, this has stoked concerns because as we know, tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be sheltering in this hospital complex. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, there are some 30,000 civilians on the hospital complex and we have been hearing from civilians and eyewitnesses on the ground communicating with CNN, one eyewitness telling us that the siege the raid on Al Shifa Hospital is still ongoing, it said to have started at around 2 am local times in the very early hours of the morning. And of course, there is a state of panic and fear for many of the civilians there and the reports that we have been hearing are concerning to say the least we are hearing that there are now military vehicles edging into the hospital complex bulldozing and excavating around the hospitals perimeters. We have heard reports of live fire targeting the windows of the hospital building where there are people believed to be in sight. And some have told CNN that they are afraid to move within and between buildings fearing for their lives that they are hearing loudspeakers from the Israeli military calling people out. And of course, we are still waiting for more confirmation in detail around the situation on the ground. We did hear earlier in the day from a doctor at the Al Shifa Hospital who was sharing posts on X formerly known as Twitter sharing updates. They're saying the hospital had come under attack by four Israeli strikes, he said and also that the surgical building of the hospital complex had caught fire. And of course, this is a huge concern. There are concerns of course as to whether or not this could be considered a war crime as well considering the level of civilian life at risk at this stage. The IDF, the Israeli military has said that is carrying out a raid on the Al Shifa Hospital that it has called on civilians to evacuate and has allowed for safe evacuation routes. That doesn't appear to be the case, according to civilians who have spoken to CNN and they have also said that, as you mentioned, Becky, they believe that there are senior Hamas officials are operating within the complex. Of course CNN is not able to independently verify this claim. But this is really painted a picture of what is the situation on the ground, particularly in and around Central and Northern Gaza. It is so difficult to get those updates and as we know the vast majority of Gaza civilians are now concentrated in the south, but there are many still stuck, still stranded in the besieged areas of Central and Northern Gaza. Many of those in Al Shifa are also wounded, of course, desperately in need of medical care and simply unable to evacuate. This is a situation that we have heard and seen time and time again now with Gaza's hospitals. But it appears that once again Al Shifa has become a target, despite the fact that it is housing tens of thousands of civilians.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, we know from a source close to these talks that the Mossad Director David Barnea will bediscussing today this Monday with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Qatar's Prime Minister, Egyptian officials, and the Head of Mossad. So there'll be discussing what Hamas counter proposed last week on Thursday of last week Hamas gave what it says was a logical offer for this ceasefire. And that is what will be discussed today here in Doha. Now we know yesterday on Sunday, there was a war cabinet meeting. There was a wider security cabinet meeting and they lay out, so we understand from an Israeli diplomatic source, the red lines that the Mossad Director is able to go up to, and he has a strict set of rules. We understand that how much he could negotiate what he can agree to and then where that red line is? We don't know what that red line is. We can speculate. Certainly we know that Hamas said that it does want an eventual permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And we've heard repeatedly from Israel, that they are not ready for that we heard just on Sunday, when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Israel will go into Rafah, the part of Southern Gaza where more than half the population is currently sheltering, saying that he didn't give a time line of when it would start, but once it does start, it would last several weeks. So what we hear from these talks right now is that first day of last week, Hamas laid out what their idea was they wanted according to officials and sources, some 700 to 1000 Palestinian prisoners released in return, they would potentially give female hostages including IDF soldiers back to Israel, including the elderly, the sick and the wounded hostages, which is believed to amount to around 40 hostages. Of course, the major sticking points are still that Hamas wants the Israeli military to pull out of Gaza, which Israel refuses to do. And they want a permanent ceasefire, which Israel says it is simply not ready for. But the hope is, they can at least agree on this phase one. And then they potentially have six weeks of a ceasefire in order to work out the rest, Becky.",
