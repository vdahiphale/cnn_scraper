And according to the U.S. military, typically carries a crew of about 87. Can transport more than 200 troops. Now, the Ukrainian military and armed forces as well as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcome to this as a sign of progress for the Ukrainian military. Zelenskyy congratulated his troops on the strike earlier today. And we received this statement, or rather had this statement issued by a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force. Take a listen.

He acknowledged this attempt was carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces, he says, using guided missiles for that attack. And of course, as we've heard from President Zelenskyy, he has reiterated that Ukraine will continue to push back and push forward with its counteroffensive. In his message earlier today, he said, \"There will be no place of peace for occupying forces in Ukraine.\"",

Certainly symbolic anytime you see Ukraine take on these ships near Crimea, which they've done time and again now, Cedric. How strategic is this in terms of the value this provides in the war? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Brianna, this is a significant propaganda victory for the Ukrainians. And from a strategic standpoint, what it does is it at least puts at risk the supply chains that the Russians have. So, in this particular case, if the reports are accurate, that drones were on board the ship, then it not only to get the ship, but it also took out a number of drones. Not sure exactly how many drones yet. But the capacity of this ship is around 10 main battle tanks. That's a pretty significant number of drones that could fit in a similar space. Given that particular fact, it is certainly a strategic importance that the Ukrainians were able to do this. And it also makes it very clear that the Russians are basically in a dangerous zone all over Crimea at this point.",

Because it does give the Russians certain advantages. They would control about 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, if things were frozen in place. And it would also allow them to regroup and resupply, do the kinds of things that they would need to do in order to not only maintain that territory but also to use that territory as a potential staging area for future operations. I don't think it would be an offer of a permanent ceasefire at this particular point in time. But it does it also potentially show there's some weaknesses in the Russian military strategy right now. And that could be the reason that Vladimir Putin wants a pause. If these reports are accurate.",

This latest chapter actually concerns a meeting that happened back last Tuesday, just as actually some those plagiarism allegations were continuing to rise to the forefront. The meeting was between, as far as we understand, some Harvard faculty members and also members of the Harvard Corporation, which is the main governing board for the university. Now \"The New York Times\" characterized the meeting as a grilling of the corporation members. But one faculty member who was actually at the meeting told CNN that it was \"cordial and frank.\" Jeff Flier is the former dean of the Harvard Medical School. He told CNN that he said to the members, you need to be more out front of this, meaning recent controversies. And he continued, telling CNN, he said, \"If people are saying the university is making mistakes, they are talking about you.\" He was referring to the Harvard Corporation members. Now, Jessica, Brianna, the other notable headline to come out of \"The Times'\" reporting of that meeting is that one corporation member allegedly said that the university needed \"generational change.\" But people who were at the meeting told both \"The Crimson\" and CNN that that was a bit out of context. Jeff Flier, the member, or that faculty member we quoted earlier, he said the corporation members said, \"Addressing ongoing concerns at Harvard University could take a generation.\" Again, as of now, there's still no movement publicly when it comes to any sign that the school will not stand by President Gay. She, at the moment, has the support of the board. But again, a challenging few weeks for sure.",

That is why we reiterate publicly that the university is still standing behind President Gay. And I will say it will -- in fact, I was on campus last week and it does still seem at this point that the bulk of the criticism facing Gay is still centered on that congressional testimony earlier in the month.

So that is some strong reaction there. Let me read part of it to you. They say, quote, \"After causing untold damage by using his fast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious anti- Semitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew might be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community, and all those who he has hurt.\" They don't want to say that, 'Ultimately, actions speak louder than words,\" as I said, but that they do welcome this and initial post. Now we also have to point out that Kanye's words have caused a lot of damage. Last year, after he first posted that he was going to go Death Con 3 on the Jewish community, we then saw there were posters hung on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles that said, \"Kanye was right about the Jews.\" So a lot of the damage has already been done.

You certainly won't see it online. I just checked myself not too long ago. It says \"currently unavailable.\" What this really focuses on, the technology that Apple uses in its watches, its newer watches, to read blood oxygen levels, a light-based technology. And it's a technology that Masimo, a California-based company, says is rightfully theirs. It is covered by their patent. So this is an issue that Masimo and Apple have sort of been in dispute over for the last few years. Fast forward, guys, to about October and that's when the U.S. International Trade Commission essentially sided with Masimo. It gave sort of 60 days of review period, which is standard, which technically, the Biden administration could have sort of intervened, could have vetoed the ruling, but it did not. So it takes effect today. Again, it will affect those two watch models, the Series 9 and the Ultra 2. Apple cannot sell those models. They cannot import those models. If you are looking for them, if you are a consumer and looking for them and you have your heart set on them, you are not completely out of luck. You can perhaps find them at a retailer that sells Apple Watch products. Because if a retailer has it on their shelves, already has it in inventory, then they can actually sell it. They just can't really stock it. They can't sort of import it again. So that is the sort of issue here. But as you said, guys, Apple said this isn't over until it's over and we are appealing.",

I should say the U.S. trade rep put out a statement today saying they had carefully considered it and carefully consulted with different entities. Then they decided to not intervene here. The decision became final December 26, 2023. Today. So whether this is truly final, like the U.S. trade rep office says, or whether it is pending the appeal like Apple says it's going to do, then there might be a different outcome there.
