But first your headlines this hour, an airstrike on a medical facility in Dnipro has killed at least two people and wounded two dozen more. The attack comes after missile strikes in the Kyiv and Kharkiv regions overnight. In Turkey incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces the fight of his political life and a runoff election this weekend the first in the country's history. White House officials and Republican lawmakers are getting closer to an agreement to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. The time is running out by Thursday they may not be enough money to pay all the government bills. And later this hour it's dubbed the richest game in football. The Championship playoff final is this weekend and will the tiny club Luton Town pulls off the fairytale ending? Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade. Welcome to the show. We start with an extraordinary report shedding light on one of the murkiest questions surrounding Russia's war on Ukraine. Who is helping Moscow with its weapons supply and how? Well, it turns out many are coming from Iran along what might be the perfect corridor for illegal arms trade. It's according to experts who spoke with CNN's Salma Abdelaziz she explains how it's happening with impunity in this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): These calm waters are home to a secret Russia doesn't want you to know. Experts say Iran is quietly sending weapons on ships like this one across the Caspian Sea to replenish arms for Moscow's war on Ukraine. Concealing movement at sea is considered nefarious and potentially a violation of international law. But in the Caspian Sea, there are a growing number of gaps in vessels tracking data known as AIS, with a more than 50 percent increase in ships hiding their movement between August and September of 2022. According to maritime trafficking data, most of the vessels going dark are Iranian or Russian flag tankers. The timing is suspicious too, this practice picking up the last summer, just as White House officials revealed that Russia had purchased hundreds of drones from Iran. So why would these ships want to hide their movements? Maritime Security Analysts Martin Kelly tells us it is likely because of what these vessels are carrying.",

There is no footprint there for NATO. And that's exactly why it is such an easy avenue for Iran and Russia to evade sanctions. And what is highly concerning to authorities is that this relationship between Iran and Russia only appears to be coming closer and closer. For Russia this is an opportunity to revamp re-up its arsenal, which has been severely depleted. Of course in Ukraine for Iran, this is a chance to rebalance the relationship with Moscow on a more equal footing. Now we did give our reporting or asked questions about our reporting to U.S. officials, they did not acknowledge the Caspian Sea route. But what we did find out is that there appears to be a very timely visit that took place just last month.

And with this war, Iran grasps the opportunity to have Russia closer to itself, and essentially, use Russia's isolation to its own benefit. So for Iran, closer ties with Russia, it's a critical component in the Islamic Republic strategy of looking eastward towards Asia, towards other markets than the West and to balance the pressure emanating from the U.S. and at times from the European Union.

Similarly, on May 9, Mr. Imran Khan's followers under a very pre planned strategy attacked very critical, vital national buildings, military installations, military air bases, they burned schools, they burned ambulances, they burned public infrastructure. Now this kind of arson, no society would permit and all those people who were involved in burning or doing loot and plunder or arson at Capitol Hill, they were arrested in thousands. And they were also punished. Likewise, in UK when there was arson on the streets, thousands of people were arrested by British authorities. The criminal justice system was put to work 24 hours, they were caught during nighttime. They were punished so that there is a deterrence of law people do not indulge in such behavior. So Mr. Imran Khan was free to do all his opposition activities for almost one year in which he carried out number of long marches, protests and all sorts of activities.

So I think no one can expect from this government that we would be allowing any attack on democracy. Secondly, what you know, Mr. Imran Khan and his followers have done as they said, they have attacked very critical military installations. Now, the law of the land of Pakistan's constitutional system has laws that when there is an attack within military jurisdiction, it is covered by an army law. And when there is damage or crime against civil institutions or within civil territories, there are anti-terrorist laws in the civil courts. So these laws are not new. They exist from 1952. And mind you, many civilians were tried under Imran Khan's own government under the same military act, and through military courts, which now Imran Khan is saying is some kind of a martial law. No, there is no martial law. We believe in rule of law. And under the army act, any trial that will take place, it will have an overview of the High Court and the Supreme Court.

And earlier Financial Times ran a story in which it was alleged that he has been also using the charity money for his political party. It has been eight months, he has not challenged that Financial Times story in any UK code. So there are questions which Mr. Imran Khan has to answer, and he himself has been arguing that there should be one law, everyone should be accountable. And we hope that Mr. Khan, who actually put a lot of false cases against us when we were in opposition, and we all face law courts, we did not indulge in any violence on the streets. Mr. Nawaz Sharif, the current Prime Minister, Mr. Shahbaz Sharif, all the leadership in opposition at that time was put in jails by Mr. Imran Khan, but we never burn buildings.",
