Schools are closed, a shelter is open, and about 35,000 people are without any power. It could be days before it's restored.So, let's get to CNN is Whitney Wild in Moore County, North Carolina. Whitney, I know you've been reporting there all night, so what's the latest on the investigation? WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, as you mentioned, the FBI as well as local law enforcement combing through all of the evidence they can to try to figure out who did this crime and why. The social media had been buzzing over the weekend that this was somehow connected to a drag race -- a drag show that was supposed to happen in Moore County around the same time the power went out. That was supposed to happen Saturday at 7:00 p.m. That's shortly -- just before, rather, when the power went out. So, again, social media buzzing with rumors, those two things are connected, although law enforcement saying they have no evidence to connect these two incidents. Meanwhile, the crews here have been working in 24-hour shifts. You can see them behind me trying to get this grid and another one in a place called West End North Carolina back up and running, try and get people back online. The good news, Victor and Alisyn, is that since last night, Duke Energy, the energy company responsible for these power grids says that 7000 people have been able to come back online. The bad news is they think that people won't be fully restored -- that all customers will not be fully restored until Thursday. So, working through this. The temperature is supposed to drop into the 40s tonight, so this is a dire situation. Meanwhile, we spoke with a man who's trying to fix that situation for his neighbors. His name was Davis Clark. He owns a company called McNeill Oil &amp; Propane. Here's what he told us about the attack on his community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVIS CLARK, VP, MCNEILL OIL &amp; PROPANE: It's very emotional and it's -- you know, I know that the police, FBI -- maybe FBI are looking into it. And I hope they find who did this because it's senseless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are multiple homes within 100 yards of the substation, so law enforcement certainly hoping that somebody here saw something and they will be able to get to the bottom of this crime, which is extremely serious. The other big concern for law enforcement all across the country, Victor and Alisyn, is that people will see this crime and do the same thing somewhere else. The Department of Homeland Security has been warning since 2020 that -- or excuse me, since earlier this year that since 2020, there has been social media chatter about attacks on critical infrastructure. That warning was re-upped just a few days ago in a bulletin in which DHS said plainly, there is a chance that there will be attacks on critical infrastructure, that chances of lone wolf-style attacks pose a lethal threat to the United States.

The second thing is, I think the others -- there's -- the real strategy for Democrats here is, you know, it is not Democrats' job to save the Republican Party over congressional Republicans from the extremism that seems to have taken over. So, in that mode, I -- you know, they, I think will stand back. Let them nominate whoever they're going to nominate and let that unfold as it may, which I think most of us believe is going to be utter chaos, given the tensions within the Republican Party, and in many hearings, we're going to hear about a laptop.",

They wanted the Republicans there.The real thing that we all know, as much as we might want to be optimistic is that what's going to happen is in the Senate, they're going to pass a lot of judges because that's what the Democrats can do. In the House, they're going to do a lot of investigations because that's what they can do. And Joe Biden is going to do a lot of executive orders because that's what he can do.
