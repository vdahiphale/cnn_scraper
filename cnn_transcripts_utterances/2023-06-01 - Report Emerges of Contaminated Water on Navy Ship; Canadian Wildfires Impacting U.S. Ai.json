He is having discussions with some members on that Senate floor, including Senator Lindsey Graham and others, who are demanding certain things. One thing that Lindsey Graham wants is he wants some sort of insurance from Democratic leaders and Republican leaders that they will move on a Ukraine funding package sometime later this year. There's also some concerns about defense funding and the level of defense funding in this plan. The deal that was cut between McCarthy and the White House would essentially level out funding, provide the funding that was under the Biden proposal, the Biden administration's defense spending proposal. That is not far enough for a number of these hawks on the Republican side of the aisle, who believe that it needs to be much further, believe it has not kept up with the pace of inflation. And all these concerns are significant, because one senator, single senator can delay matters until past the Monday default deadline. They need to get all 100 to agree to actually schedule the vote, and, at the moment, they don't have that agreement. Now, this all comes as senators are raising concerns. Lindsey Graham told me today that this deal was a bad one that was cut, and others are also uncertain about whether they're going to back this plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

The bill reads that the pause shall cease to be effective 60 days after June 30. And that would mean that roughly 44 million people will have to resume making payments on their loans. And there is some concern if this process is going to go smoothly, as you can imagine. There are so many people who may be confused about how much they owe, when to pay, how they're going to pay, especially when you consider this, that two million borrowers will have a different servicer handling their loans since the last time that they made a payment. In the meantime, all eyes are going to be on the Supreme Court. Justices could rule as early as this month on a separate student loan forgiveness program. And under the Biden administration proposal, individual borrowers who made less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and also married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 per year, they would qualify for up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt being forgiven. And if a borrower got a Pell Grant in college, if they got a Pell Grant in college, that individual is eligible for up to 20 grand in debt forgiveness. If the Supreme Court allows this program to take effect, it's possible the government moves quickly to forgive the debts of 16 million borrowers who are already approved for relief. If the justices strike down Biden's student loan forgiveness program, the administration could make some modifications. They could try again. But that, of course, could take months, Jim.",

The Justice Department has audio now of the former president discussing a classified document that he kept after leaving office, the recording made during a meeting at his New Jersey golf club in 2021. Multiple sources tell CNN the tape indicates Trump knew the document in his possession was classified, and he knew that designation limited his ability to share it, which would undercut the defense his lawyers have presented in the ongoing special counsel probe of his handling of classified documents. Our senior legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid, helped break this story. So, Paula, a couple of key questions to begin with. What exactly did he say?

In the summer of 2021, the former president was in the habit of having his aides record any conversations with journalists, writers, people working on books. So we know that in this meeting were two people working on an autobiography of former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. And Meadows was not in the room. But that's one of the ways we know this was recorded. It is unclear whether that is how investigators got it, from the autobiographers or if they got it from the aides or even a warrant for the cloud. We know that these files were uploaded. That, at this point is unclear. But we have learned from our sources, even though we haven't heard the recording, that, on this, he can be heard talking about a document in his possession. This is a classified Pentagon document discussing a possible attack on Iran. Our sources describe how, on the tape, you can hear some laughter.
