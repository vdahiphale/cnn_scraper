You know, Trump said he was embarrassed, and then he was worried about what his family would think. But after the campaign, it was -- or after the election, he was more worried about those coming out because of how it would look for him, you know, outside of his family. So, it really speaks to sort of how Donald Trump was sort of, you know, taking in all of this information. The one time that he actually did give a smirk inside the courtroom was when they discussed that meeting inside Trump Tower after President Trump was President-elect Trump. And David Pecker walked into the room and he was surrounded by a number of these people who were advising the now President-elect. And Donald Trump made the comment that this is David Pecker. He's the publisher of the National Enquirer, and he knows more stories about me than anyone else in this room. And Pecker sort of said, nobody really laughed at that, but that did get a laugh from Donald Trump. But quite honestly, he has been just really taking in word for word how Pecker is testifying, and he really is just kind of pulling back the curtain on every single detail, sometimes having to be reminded about some of the details, about how this catch and kills worked. And we didn't quite yet get to the Stormy Daniels. It was touched upon, but we haven't yet gotten to the depth of the Stormy Daniels story, which, of course, is at the core of this case.",

Now, just to recap, it's important to note that in order to make this a felony, it's -- prosecutors have to establish not just catch and kill payments, but also the falsification of business records to hide things from American voters in the context of a campaign.And Pecker says at one point, once the former president started campaigning, it was basically what the impact would be to the campaign and the election. Now, I don't want to leave the impression that that's some kind of smoking gun, and the president gets convicted on account of that. What I'm saying is that that is, you know, a direct nexus to talking about the campaign where suppressing these embarrassing stories wasn't just about the president and his wife, but actually the president's campaign. It'll be useful for prosecutors, but again, it all comes down to what the jury does with it.",

Let me just say, the way that you will feel about a witness, as a prosecutor, as a defense lawyer, as a juror, after the end of direct examination, is often very different from how you will feel at the end of cross examination.Here's what I think we could see in the cross examination. First of all, they will say to David Pecker, this catch and kill stuff you were doing at the Enquirer, sleazy, right? You knew it was sleazy, but you never believed this was criminal. And, in fact, it's not criminal. Start with that. I think that they're going to go to the limitations of his knowledge. They don't necessarily need to paint David Pecker as a liar, but they could say essentially to Elliot's point, the crime here is falsification of the Stormy Daniels business records. You don't know anything about the logging and accounting of the Stormy Daniels business records. And then finally, they may sort of go after David Pecker on the fact that he's been given a free pass here. He's been given a non-prosecution agreement. You're given a walk. Donald Trump's on trial.

He also invites him to the inauguration. David Pecker said he didn't go.And then there's one more meeting that prosecutors have flagged. So this is what I expect David Pecker will be asked about when we return soon for after lunch was that it was in the spring or summer of 2017. After Trump has been president, he invites David Pecker to the White House. Keith -- I'm sorry, not Keith Davidson, Dylan Howard goes along with him. And it was the thank you dinner and he thanks him then. Trump thanks David Pecker for everything he's done for the campaign. So that is what we will then hear. And I think that brings us toward the end of the direct examination and then it will be Trump's attorney's opportunity to cross examine David Pecker. And I'm told that's going to take a few hours.",

They're painting a picture, they're painting a broad picture and they're giving jurors details that they're going to use down the road. So I -- my guess is if you ask the jurors, of course, this couldn't happen, but hypothetically, which side are you favoring? Or do you think that there's some wrongdoing?I think most jurors would say, yes, I kind of lean in favor of the prosecution at this point. And there was probably some wrongdoing. But there's so much left. When I talk to jurors after they've served on cases, it's very rare when they say that something clicked with them and they made up their mind or something really significant happened in their outlook of the case just during the direct testimony of the first witness. So I think it's going well for the prosecution but that can change quickly.",

But at the end of the day, I still don't see the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
