Less worried about his own well-being, according to his son-in-law and asking more about how his family is doing. So that gives us an assessment of at least one of them. As you say, the IDF is saying that both are in good medical condition. The IDF said this operation had been some time in the planning that they were waiting for the conditions to be right. That it began at about 1 a.m. in the morning in Rafah. It was a covert military operation that involved a distraction maneuver, as the IDF calls it, attacking, they say, a Hamas battalion in that area of Rafah. And we know from the Palestinian Red Crescent that right around about that time, there were reports of aircraft rocket, and bomb strikes, helicopter, gunship strikes in that area. And the local hospital in Rafah is reporting 60 people dead and killed, including children, in this attack that took place around about the same time as this rescue operation was underway. It's not clear if these two events are directly connected, but it does appear at this time, at least, that there's a lot of correlation between these two different events. The IDF saying that only one of their soldiers was injured in this operation, which required putting troops into the second floor of a building. Now this is only the second time since October the 7th the IDF has been able to free, by military operations, any of the hostages. The last one was a young IDF, serving -- a female soldier who was released right at the end of October. So this is a long time coming. Huge news here in Israel that the IDF has had a success in bringing out two hostages. Absolutely going to be a big moment for these families, directly involved and gives some hope to the other families that their loved ones can be freed, as well. But at the moment, we have not yet heard directly from medical officials about their specific medical conditions, but we do understand that they're undergoing checks at a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv here, Michael.",

It's the second time ever that it's happened. And Patrick Mahomes, he got the ball with the champs down three, had to go 75 yards to win his third Super Bowl of his career. And he did just that, leading the Chiefs right down the field and in the -- I'm standing right now in the famous end zone where Mahomes, on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII, found Mecole Hardman for the touchdown to win the game for the Chiefs, 25 to 22. And what a story is for Mecole Hardman. It's been his first four seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. Left to go to the New York Jets this past off-season but in the middle of this season, came back to the Chiefs. And certainly -- they certainly are glad that he did, because he got the game-winning touchdown in the Super Bowl. The celebration on the field right behind me was just great. Taylor Swift came down on the fields. He was almost in tears when Travis Kelce was on the podium, accepting the trophy and talking about just what the Chiefs went through to get back to this Super Bowl championship.

And that's really led a lot of European countries to question whether Donald Trump's potential return to the White House could mean not just the abandonment of the war in Ukraine, but a broader American retreat from the continent. Now, I do think it's important to point out the context of these remarks. It comes as many Republicans have been pushing back against aid to Ukraine, and also as some European countries have raised the alarm about Russian aggression. Now the White House immediately criticized Trump's remarks. A spokesperson for the White House said, quote, \"Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged; and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home.\" Alayna Treene, CNN, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

The Senate voted on Sunday to advance the critical bill, with 18 Republicans backing the package, despite opposition from former U.S. President Donald Trump. It comes after Republicans blocked a wider bill that included a bipartisan border deal. If the bill is eventually passed by the Senate, it's unclear whether House Speaker Mike Johnson would even allow a vote on it. All right.

We know he wanted to remove U.S. troops from Germany and South Korea. There's no question there would be a significant retrenchment of America's engagement with its allies, with potentially enormously destabilizing results all over the world. The reason I say it's still an open question is because, to me, his attitude toward NATO is indicative of a much broader truth about the 2024 elections, which is partly because of the way the Republican race has unfolded, partly because of what Democrats have been focused on. Donald Trump's agenda for a second term has really not been part of the discussion almost at all. And if you go to his website and look at his agenda, 47 videos, he is putting forward a much more specific and much more militant agenda on a lot of issues that he ran on in 2016 or 2020. And to me, it is a critical question, the extent to which all of these ideas -- mass deportation, internment camps, repealing the ACA, sending federal forces into blue cities to fight crime. Any of these ideas -- 10 percent tariffs -- are going to be part of the debate between now and November. It's a critical question.",

You know, I would say 75 percent of the Republican Party is comfortable with him as a leader. But what Haley is showing is that there's roughly a quarter, maybe a third at the most, that is uneasy about that. And what they do in November, that minority of Republicans who are responding to her arguments that Trump -- which, you know, she's really making only now after New Hampshire, that Trump is unfit -- what do they do? On the other side, you have enormous concerns among Democrats, many of whom even think that Joe Biden has been a good president, but worry that either he is not capable of executing the job in a second term, or even, if they don't even worry about that, they're worried that the country won't view him as capable. And so we are -- we are in this situation as I've said to you before, where I think it is highly unlikely that, by election day, there will be a majority of Americans who go into the booth affirmatively excited about giving Joe Biden four more years. But that doesn't there might not be a winning plurality or majority that does not want to give Donald Trump four more years.

There's a lot out there that Donald Trump is saying he would do it a second term that simply hasn't been part of our dialogue yet.Friday afternoon, speaking to the National Rifle Association in Pennsylvania, he said, that within moments of taking office, he will pursue the largest deportation program in American history. His top immigration, Stephen Miller, has put out extraordinarily -- extraordinary detail about how they plan to do this. They plan to do -- he says they will pursue mass -- mass roundups of undocumented migrants in big cities, transfer them to internment camps in Texas, and then have constant flights out of the U.S. To do this, a former chief of staff of ICE told me, would take 100,000 to 150,000 law enforcement personnel plus another 50,000 people to staff the camps. And Miller has said that Trump will provide -- you know, obtain this manpower by transferring people from other federal law enforcement agencies, deputizing sheriffs, and police officers, and most explosively, by requisitioning National Guard from red states to send into blue states that don't want to cooperate. And that is a recipe for a level of conflict we have rarely seen in American politics, if they really go down this road, Michael. Imagine the scene in Chicago or L.A. where a massive deportation program is going through a heavily Hispanic neighborhood. People flock to a church to seek safety. The local Democratic mayor orders the police to ring the church. And on the other side are National Guard from Arkansas or Texas. What happens next? I don't know, you know? And there are some Americans who will support this vision. But it's not clear to me at all that this is a majority view.",
