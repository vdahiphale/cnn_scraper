This has been one of the main focuses of the ground operation there inside the Gaza Strip and the focus of much attention. Israeli forces have been saying, for weeks, that the Hamas military operation really survives and is executing its plan from inside that elaborate and sophisticated tunnel system underground -- the underground, these -- in these residential areas. And that's why they believe it is crucial to reach these areas to be able to take out the Hamas military leadership. And that appears to be what we're seeing tonight here in Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (voice over):   The firefight on the ground between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters has intensified for days. And now, Israeli military leaders say its forces have entered Gaza City. Israeli Defense Forces released these video images of soldiers moving through the war- ravaged streets of Gaza. REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (through translator):   Our soldiers have been operating in Gaza City for the past few days, surrounding it from several directions, deepening the operation. Our forces are in very significant operations of Gaza City. LAVANDERA (voice over):   Israeli forces have made their way into the northern and central areas of Gaza as well. This is where it says Hamas military leaders are believed to be operating from a sophisticated system of underground tunnels. Israel defense force officials say more than 10,000 munitions have been fired into Gaza, striking thousands of targets. HAGARI (through translator):   Fighters of the IDF continue to progress in Gaza, holding battles face-to-face with the Hamas terrorists, deepening their combat. LAVANDERA (voice over):   Hamas released this video of what it says are its fighters emerging from underground tunnels, attacking Israeli soldiers inside Gaza. The video does capture the dangerous nature of this ground fight. The military wing of Hamas also says it released this video showing the moment of an aerial drone dropping munitions on a gathering of Israeli forces in northeast Gaza. The fighting has taken a deadly toll across the Gaza Strip since October 7th, over 9000 have been killed here, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Israeli aerial strikes have left massive craters in residential and refugee areas as the military says it's trying to dismantle Hamas military operations underground. The Israeli military says 20 IDF soldiers have been killed in the Gaza operation, one of those was 20-year-old, Roei Dawi. Dawi's funeral service brought out hundreds of mourners, near Jerusalem, on Thursday. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the talks behind the scenes to get this agreement on this evacuation have been painstaking, and they've been complicated for the negotiators. They've been dealing with competing demands from Hamas and Israel, on the one hand, on who gets out and how, and then, from Egypt, which has very real security concerns about who makes it into Egypt and for how long. And it's interesting to note, the families that CNN has spoken to in the states have reported that some members of their families, who have made it on to the list to evacuate, have had some people on the list, and others in Gaza have been left off. So, families, it seems, is sort of being split up as far as these lists are concerned. That's being described by one attorney of one family in Michigan as either callousness or incompetence. I think if you spoke to those who have been involved in the negotiations, Julia, they will admit that it's been very chaotic. I don't think there's necessarily anything callous about what is going on. And examples of people's families being split, some getting on these lists and some not, I just think the -- you know, that the overall communication has been so chaotic. Remember, at times, there's been no internet connection, no phone lines in Gaza. So it's been really difficult to ensure that people understood how they get on to these lists to evacuate, where they need to go, when, and how quickly this process will happen. But we do know that this process is now open, and ongoing. If it's upwards of 6,000, 7,000 people, it's going to take days, at this point, Julia.",

Bush got -- set freedom (inaudible) to get the US citizens out before entering the war in Kuwait. I was a US citizen, and he took my family completely.

We're talking about months over months, something in about a year that very high powerful entities from government with telecommunication, IT, and banks, in different places around the Middle East, even an NGO in the United Arab Emirates were targeted by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security. And during this campaign, they emergently managed to infiltrate inside the systems, get a lot of information from these entities, and infect them with a virus which is extremely powerful. And if you go back a bit, a few months before that, you can see the exact same operation attacking the Albanian government in Albania. And there they really took down critical systems in the country.

They're not allowed in terms of quantities, but they have a lot of qualitative information inside of them. And this is one of the characteristics of this campaign. They're really looking into specific targets that if they can get inside on formation, it's very valuable. Now, at this stage of this attack, it's mostly about grabbing information from these entities and making sure that they have some sort of surveillance, spyware, into what's happening there. But, as it always happens in cyberattacks, once you infect an entity with a virus, it can easily transform into something else. And during this war that we're suffering from now, we have seen entities in Israel that were infected with the same virus, but are now being attacked by much more severe cyberattacks, something like we call it wiper or ransomware, which really take down an entire network. Now, as of now, the targets were more low profile, but it's just in terms of a click of a button. Our attention from the Iranian side that it would escalate much, much further than this.

Itworks automatically by different kind of actors working for the same cause. So to your first question, in terms of vulnerabilities, so there are numerous vulnerabilities that are out there and they are being patched. But the patch are not necessarily automatic. And it only takes one vulnerability that isn't patched for whatever reason for the entire system to be basically in jeopardy. So here, the vulnerability was known for a while, but it was a very, very - - it was a vulnerability that was very, very dangerous, but not very easy to fix. And for whatever reason, it wasn't fixed at the entities that were infected, but it can really be anything else. Now, there's also another term in cybersecurity. It's called a \"zero-day\", a vulnerability we're not even aware of. And actors in the scale of Iran, which are nation-state actors that are very, very powerful and they have a lot of budget, they can try to find new kind of vulnerabilities that are not even published yet and try to infiltrate through that. And that gets into your second question. It can really be anybody. So we have clear visibility for around 10 attack groups. They're affiliated from -- by Iran, either sponsored by Iran or operating from Iran. We're talking about the MOIS, which is the Ministry of Information, Intelligence, and Security. There's also the Revolutionary Guard in Iran. These are the institutions that are working against Israel in terms of cyberattacks. But there are other groups that are working from within Iran, whether they're getting paid, or outside of Iran, that can also be threat actors that are more about business affiliations. Let's say they are entering the criminals that are being used by these countries, and they're being -- they're operated as proxies. The range is very, very large, but you can see the common denominator. The interest is the same. The goals are the same. They're looking for very, very specific victims, and they are trying to make large-scale kind of effects. And if you look back a bit, not just from this war, let's say two or three years backwards, you would see that the biggest cyberattack that happened in Israel was the biggest amount of victims of cyberattacks. They were against an insurance company and a service company, not government ones, but the ones who are using data of millions of Israelis. So -- because in our country, we call it very digital, we have a very wide range of protections. Some of us are protected very well, some of us are not protected very well. But the amount of information is in so many places that the Iranians understood that they can attack the more softer areas of the country, which still have a lot of information and can create a lot of damage.",

It comes about 10 months after Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was violently beaten by police officers and died from his injuries. In New York, FBI agents have searched the home of a key fundraiser for mayor Eric Adams' campaign. Sources say FBI agents working as part of an investigation with its public corruption squad took devices and files from the home of fundraiser Brianna Suggs. The specific allegations behind the investigation are unknown. Adams has cut short a visit to Washington, D.C., to return to New York. The Texas Rangers have won their first ever World Series title.
