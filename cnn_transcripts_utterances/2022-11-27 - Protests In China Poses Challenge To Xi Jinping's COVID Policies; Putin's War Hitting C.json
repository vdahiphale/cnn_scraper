Protesters are out in force across the country risking the wrath of the regime, whose strict lockdown policies have kept people holed up and isolated. All came to a boiling point over this, a high-rise apartment fire that killed 10 people last week, where video appears to show lockdown measures delaying firefighters from getting quick access to the scene.Many protesters are openly calling on Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down, holding up pieces of a blank white paper symbolizing censorship. Shanghai residents confronted police and sang the national anthem in protest. (VIDEO PLAYING) Some are already facing consequences for peaceful displays of protest. This video shows police beating and dragging a protester across the ground. Amnesty International warning we could see more of this in the coming hours and days.

Now, in this district as well, around here, there are many foreign embassies, including the American Embassy over there. So notable that they chose this site for this protest. Now, this protest has been going on already for several hours. It's very late. You can see the policeman right now is telling me to move back a little bit. But there is a large police presence there actually on this whole row, a whole row of policemen, but it is a peaceful protest so far.

There have even been some of those Shanghai protesters who have said, you know, Xi Jinping resign, things like that. That is completely unusual. It is unprecedented. And for it to be happening in Shanghai, at Ching Hua University, the University that Xi Jinping went to when he got his chemical engineering degree in the 70s. That is what makes this quite unusual. They are almost certainly going to crack down over time. They are unlikely to allow this to spread. But the very fact that is happening should remind us that you know, China is not just this big black box out that there are real life people in there who have aspirations and ideas and ideals, and they're getting more and more educated. And one of the things Xi Jinping has to deal with, with this COVID locked down, it's one thing when you have a herd of, you know, peasants and things like that.

And they have -- they've been trying very hard, essentially reverse engineering, the Western vaccines, but they have not so far been able to do so.And it's a kind of extreme version of vaccine nationalism. So, they're hoping that they will soon have that and then they'll (inaudible). We know they can vaccinate people really fast in China. But it's -- so far, they haven't been able to. As to the longer term, look, it's hard to imagine that this would dislodge -- the Communist Party is so deeply entrenched and Xi has further entrenched it.

I think that that these are movies that sometimes we saw with our families. But even if the movies are different, it's the act of seeing movies with your family.And even if in my case if my parents aren't around anymore, but I'm watching a movie with my daughter.
