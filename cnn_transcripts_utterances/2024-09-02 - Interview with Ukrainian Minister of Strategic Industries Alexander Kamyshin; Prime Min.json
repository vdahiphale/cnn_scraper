      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour\" from Kyiv. Here's what's coming up.Ukraine bombarded as it pushes into Russia's cursed region. My report on cutting edge technology that's providing a lifeline in this war. And I speak to Ukraine's Minister for Strategic Procurement, Alexander Kamyshin. Then, pain and anger on Israel's streets after the recovery of six hostages killed in Gaza. Bianna Golodryga speaks to Meirav Leshem Gonen, whose daughter Romy is still held there. Also, ahead, a far-right surge in Eastern Germany. We explore what's behind it and what it means for Ukraine and beyond. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, where children have returned to school for the start of another year in the throes of war. At least four people have been injured in Russian strikes this morning, three of them here in the capital, which Ukraine's Air Force says was the main target of this latest barrage. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says that his country is being, quote, forced to fight with its hands behind its back. Once again, urging allies to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons. It's as Russian forces pushed towards the strategic town of Pokrovsk. And across the border, Ukraine is almost four weeks into its surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Over the weekend, Kyiv carried out one of its biggest ever drone attacks on Russia, hitting a refinery and a power station. In this multi-pronged war, accelerating technology to respond is critical. Like, for instance, ramping up the production and the military use of land drones and other kinds of drones. Here in Kyiv, I've been visiting a privately owned factory that's directing its efforts towards the Ukrainian army. And also, I've been assessing the current state of the 30-month war with residents here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  The evidence keeps growing, even here in Kyiv, far from the front, memorials occupy ever more space. And since Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region, the war has returned to the cities with a vengeance. Last night, ballistic missiles hit Kyiv, destroying infrastructure, tripling the energy grid, raising fears. Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk tells me it's been a tradeoff.",

Here, we follow along behind. They can deliver everything from ammunition to water and also remove the wounded from the front lines Their production has ramped up since the full-scale invasion of 2022 and the company insists Ukraine must develop more technologically advanced systems for asymmetrical warfare to counter Russia's overwhelming manpower. And they want to be much more self-sufficient for the long haul.

Now, clearly, it hasn't changed fully the dynamic on the ground. And maybe the military believed that it would draw Russian forces away from the most fiercely contested bits of the front line in the east, but it actually hasn't. And Putin has, you know, started, you know, for want of a better word, to play psychological warfare, trolling the Ukrainians, saying, see, they tried this and they failed. But he does that all the time. Here, you hear that they did this, they wanted to show the west that they could do it. They wanted to show that they could really put their weaponry and their ammunition to good use. They wanted to show that they have the manpower to do this kind of operation, and they're still there and they're still hanging on in Kursk. Maybe they think it might be for a little bit of diplomatic negotiating, a bargaining chip, so to speak. But they kind of see the Pokrovsk thing and the Kursk thing as somewhat, you know, two different sides of the same coin. Then, they know that Pokrovsk is under huge pressure, and they probably think they're going to lose it, and they are retreating at the moment. But then, they say Bakhmut was meant to be a key logistical hub, and we've sort of survived that.

And this could all end if they release these hostages right now. But I will tell you who I trust, and that is mothers like yourself, mothers like Rachel Goldberg-Polin, who I know fight every single day to do everything you can to not only tell the world how important it is to bring your loved ones home, but to tell us a little bit about them. In these last few seconds, I just want to say, you've said all along that you have hope that she is alive, you know that she's alive. That she is alive. I was even listening to a vigil last night for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, where Hatikvah, the national anthem called The Hope was played, and I know that that is where our trust is right now and talking to family members like you who never stop hoping, who never stop fighting. And we are looking forward to the day where you will be reunited with your beautiful Romi. Meirav --",
