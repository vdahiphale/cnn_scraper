Just ahead, CNN speaks exclusively to the Syrian rebel leader taking the city of Aleppo from the government and vowing to overthrow the Assad regime. We're going to have that incredible interview for you shortly.Plus, why even party colleagues of South Korea's President are calling for him to be suspended? And in New York City, a fresh clue in the ongoing manhunt after that murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO. Now, as I mentioned, we're going to begin in Syria, where the leader of the rebel coalition is not holding back about the goal of his group's stunning offensive. Now, in an exclusive interview with CNN, his first with any media in years, Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani said their ambitions are to ultimately overthrow President Bashar Al Assad. We're going to have more, really, the extraordinary sit down with our Jomana Karadsheh in just a moment. And it comes as the opposition continues its advance south towards the city of Homs. Now they've also captured an area near the Jordanian border to the south. The move raises the prospect that Damascus is facing assault from both the north and the south. And Friday's gains come a day after the fall of Hama to rebels that it had held during more -- during a long time, really, over years. All of this as Foreign Ministers from Syria, Iran and Iraq plan to meet in Baghdad today to discuss the crisis in Syria as rebel forces continue their advances. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is the first Western journalist to report from Aleppo since the rebels took over. She spoke to displaced Syrians who are returning to their hometown for the first time in years, despite fears that the battle isn't over yet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And you look around here, and it seems like business as usual. Never left Aleppo, and she says their homes were destroyed. Herchildren are in Turkey, and she hasn't seen them in years. And she's hoping, now that the city has changed hands that this means that she could see her children again. Abdul was in Idlib. He's been there since the start of the war, and this is his first time back to a city. He says they trust the rebels who are now returning them to their cities, and he says he's not afraid. Syrians have gone through so much and their resilience. Just in the last few days, people have painted over this with the colors of the free Syria flag, and this is something you see around the city where people are trying to remove any signs of the Assad regime. This is the Basel roundabout, named after the deceased brother of the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. And one of the first things that people did when rebel forces took over the City of Aleppo, which toppled the statue of Basel, a symbol of the Assad regime. This is an area where there were fierce battles with regime forces, and since then, in the past few days, there's been an air strike that killed many people. You can still see the aftermath of that, the blood on the floor here, and speaking to people in the city, this is what they fear. They fear that there will be more Russian and Syrian regime air strikes, that they will be back for the City of Aleppo. Mohammed, this is your first time back to Aleppo in 10 years?",

This discipline allowed them, with God's guidance, to engage in a battle in an organized manner.

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So that moment the suspect is checking into the hotel, he presents the driver's license, he's got the hood up in his jacket, even though he's indoors and it's warm in there, and he's got the mask up. And the woman who is behind the counter is talking to him, looking at the driver's license, and she says, let me see you. Let me see your face, pull the mask down. And he pulls the mask down, gives the big smile. I mean, we have to try to go inside his head, because the video canvas teams of the NYPD have been all over the city finding different images of him during the 10 days he's been here, from the moment he got off the bus. He never takes the hood down. He never takes the mask off. So, he may have just calculated I'm going to stand out as more suspicious if I don't do this.

The society says it had to recently evacuate U.S. doctors volunteering in Northern Syria due to the escalating violence.Right now, I want to bring in Dr. Bachir Tajaldin, Turkey Country Director at the Syrian American Medical Society. Thank you for being here, doctor. I really appreciate the time. Can you just explain the nature of what you and your group have been doing in Syria and how maybe that's changed in recent weeks? DR. BACHIR TAJALDIN, TURKEY DIRECTOR OF SYRIAN AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETY: Hello! Good morning and thanks for this interview. Actually, Syrian American Medical Society is medical organization based in the U.S. and established by Syria American physicians who have that world citizenship in the U.S. It has over 1000 of volunteering doctors, leading the organization, participating in the health care in humanitarian context, most obviously in Syria. Me and my colleagues are providing health services in northwest Syria, it's in a very challenging situation through a network of about 40 health facilities distributed between Idlib and Aleppo Governorates. We are covering the humanitarian needs and essential needs for the population. We were accessing about 5 million population in northwest Syria during the last couple of years. Last week, we had our medical mission consist of about nine volunteering U.S. doctors were providing services in northwest Syria and but due to the escalation and starting of the military wars, we evacuated them and ended that mission. And starting from Friday till now, actually, it was very challenging situation as now SAMS among other health care providers, other NGOs, have access to more than double of the population last week. So, this week, we have to deal with a lot of population who been also deprived from many of the essential services, including clean water, food and also essential health services during the last decade. I was in Syria and Aleppo city during the last week, met with my colleagues, with the community, and actually there are a huge lack of the essential health services, the people who have the non-chronical diseases, or the chronic diseases, like hypertension, diabetes, cancer patients.",

Unfortunately, we were dealing during the past years with the government or regime who has polarized the population.You cannot even provide the services impartially to the population. So, whenever you are providing services to any geographical location, out of the control of the country you are identified as an enemy. We lost a lot of our colleagues, our friends, our classmates, either they have been killed or arrested. Personally, that I left Aleppo since more than 13 years and 6 months, and I lost the physical communication with my father, with my family. So, when I went to Aleppo city, I saw my father after 13 years and 6 months and 8 days. I was counting them by hour, actually. So, it was very hard touching feeling I went to my old places, my -- in the city, my old house, my schools. Unfortunately, one of the very sensitive and very concerned that I had seen that one of my schools where I did in the elementary schools, and also the medical school and the University Hospital, who I have learned and trained in.

CNN has learned that senior aides to Joe Biden are discussing whether the president should issue preemptive pardons to people who might be targeted for prosecution by Donald Trump. Now Trump and many of his closest allies have openly talked about going after those who oppose him.Among the names being discussed are Congressman Adam Schiff, Former Congresswoman Liz Cheney and Jack Smith, the Special Counsel who brought charges against Trump, but Biden's aides are concerned that pardons could imply that the recipient has actually done something wrong and needs to be pardoned. So, let's talk more about this with CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent, Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, good to see you. So, can you just bring us into the latest reporting here? What is expected to happen? What are the implications? Just bring us in.",

But this is a discussion that's taking place in the Biden White House, where senior aides are deliberating, should there be pre-emptive pardons that protect people that Donald Trump and his incoming Justice Department may want to investigate.There is a lot of concern across Washington, Omar, about what Trump and his administration will do. And there's a lot of fear of investigations, not only those bold-faced names that are so recognizable, but also what might happen to lower-level career people within the Justice Department, within the FBI, in other agencies? Will they be investigated? Will they face congressional probes? And how all, all of that would play out? So, there's the discussion at the White House separately, Omar, I've talked to quite a lot of lawyers across Washington who are fielding calls from people just getting, trying to get advice on what they should do, what they might want to prepare for with the turnover of the administration and this coming environment. Potentially of retaliatory investigations, and there are lawyers across town talking about working together, maybe offering low cost or no cost legal services to Biden Administration officials and others who may face investigations. There's at least one progressive group that's trying to put together a more formal program. So, we are in just a climate of fear and bracing for Trump to come in as president. But Omar, it's the holiday season. It's the end of the Biden presidency. It's also a season of discussion of pardons. We're going to be talking about this until Trump takes office. What does Joe Biden do with pardons? That discussion extends even into the Democrats in the Senate. Here's John Fetterman on the view yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): It's undeniable that the case against Hunter Biden was really politically motivated. But I also think it's true that that the trial in New York for Trump that was political as well, too. Now is that and in both cases, I think a pardon is appropriate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You may remember far right Ultra nationalist Calin Georgescu, won by a narrow margin. Well, the court said the entire process has to be rerun, which means a second-round run-off, which was supposed to be held on Sunday.May, what will now not take place. We're going to bring you any updates as they become available. Meanwhile, in the United States, the U.S. jobs report for November was just released moments ago, and it shows a massive rebound after hurricanes and striking workers impacted October's numbers. CNN's Matt Egan joins us to break it all down. So Matt, what are these numbers show? Or what is the significance of these numbers?",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, this is really exactly what we were looking for. It's clear evidence of a significant bounce back from that weakness that we saw in October. So, today's report shows that the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in November. That was a little bit more than expected.And the unemployment rate, it did take higher to 4.2 percent from 4.1 percent but that remains pretty low historically. Now, remember, a month ago, the Labor Department alarmed some people by telling everyone that the U.S. economy only added 12,000 jobs in October. That was the fewest that we've seen since COVID. But we knew that was driven by some one-time factors. Notably, there were the back-to-back hurricanes and also striking workers at Boeing. And so, today's report does strongly suggest that, that really was an anomaly. It was a one off, because clearly these are very solid numbers. Nothing here that would alarm anyone about an imminent recession or anything like that. I mean, really, there was across the board strength. When we look at sectors on leisure and hospitality, those are bars and restaurants and hotels. They added over 50,000 jobs. Health care also added another 50,000 jobs last month alone. Government had healthy hiring. We also saw transportation significantly increase hiring as a result of the striking workers going back to work. Really the only weakness that we saw in this report was retail, which lost 28,000 jobs. When you put all this together, though there's a lot of positives here, the market seems to like what they're seeing here. The U.S. stock futures were down a bit before these numbers came out. They've turned around. They're now up modestly. And also, you can see, right there, you see DOW FUTURES up 33 points before the report, they were down around 50 points. So not a massive move, but still a positive one. And the last point here, Omar, is what all this means for the Federal Reserve, because the Fed is meeting later this month, less than two weeks from now, and they've got to decide whether or not to cut interest rates again. And the latest betting in the market is that today's report increases the odds of another interest rate cut from the Fed, Omar.",
