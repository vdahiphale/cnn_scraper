News correspondent and author Jonathan Vigliotti tells Hari Sreenivasan why asmall-town America could be the canary in the coal mine. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel's war cabinet met again today to weigh up a response to Iran's strike over the weekend. In Tehran, President Ebrahim Raisi warns even the smallest of actions would be met with \"a severe, extensive, and painful response.\" The United States is urging caution and calm from both sides along with the E.U. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin telling his Israeli counterpart that the U.S. goal is regional stability. President Biden is trying to avoid being dragged into another war in the Middle East especially in an election year. His chief political rival Donald Trump is trying to use this crisis to his own advantage saying that it wouldn't have happened if he were in office. Of course, he isn't in office or even on the campaign trail. These days he's in a Manhattan courtroom as jury selection continues for the hush money trial against him. Joining me now on all of this is Mark Esper, former Defense Secretary under President Trump. He currently serves on the board or as a strategic adviser for a handful of aerospace and defense related companies. Secretary Esper welcome back to the program.",

You also know, your viewers do too, that Israel said before the Iranian attack that if Iranattacked Israel proper that Israel would respond and attack got Iran proper as well. So, look, I think they've drawn a hard line and that means they're going to have to respond. If not, then this unprecedented attack by Iran, and going back into 45 years since relations broke down between Iran and really the rest of the world, in 1979, this being the first-ever attack, Iran will change the paradigm forever and Israel will face a new type of threat, not unlike what they've been undergoing with Hamas for the last 10, 20, 30 years where they're under the constant threat of some type of barrage of rocket assault. So, I think they have to respond. They have to respond forcefully. I suspect it will be a combination of kinetic strike strikes, probably cyber. And -- but at the same time, they're going to want to hold this loose knit coalition together as best they can, because when it comes to Iran, this is a long-term play against the Islamic regime which has been, you know, sewing mayhem throughout the region now for 45 years.",

Number two, Ithink President Biden made a mistake by taking a military option off the table and made the mistake publicly calling -- telling Iran -- or telling Israel, I'm sorry, to not act, to take the win. I think it shows lack of resolve. And that plays into how Iran will be thinking about this. So, I think that's the second item. Now, the third thing is this. If Israel responds, and I don't think it's a matter of if, really, it's really a matter of how and when, then one should expect that Iran will respond as well and will move up a few rungs on this escalation matter. And, yes, indeed, at some point, the United States could get dragged into this as well, supporting Israel. And by the way, so could some of the Arab states as well, if they get caught in a crossfire. Or if Iran deems that they're supporting Israel to Iran's disadvantage. We've seen some of that talk already because of Saudi Arabia's and Jordan's shooting down of Iranian missiles. So, yes, look, I think this could get very big very quickly, but I also think that Israel has to take a long-term view of what it could mean for them, the security of Israel, and the vulnerability of the Israeli people if Iran is allowed to change the paradigm the way they have?",

But, you know, you know yourself that successive American administrations since the Islamic Republic have refused point blank to get involved in either on behalf of Israel or for themselves in a war in Iran. You remember -- I don't even know, maybe you were defense secretary, but under the Trump administration, he refused even to come to the aid of Saudi Arabia when Iran hit the oil installations at Abqaiq.

And ofcourse, President Trump's killing of Soleimani in Baghdad was very aggressive. But you're right, nobody has want to kind of strike the territory of Iran in the past because we all want to avoid a regional war. And again, I would say it's now Iran that is broken that taboo by striking Israel directly, disproportionately, I might say. Now, look, we know that -- or we believe that Israel is the one that killed the IRGC generals at the consulate in Syria, lobbing a few missiles, but that is in stark contrast to what Iran did. So again, I think we want to avoid the wider war. But clearly, what's happened over the last, not just six days, but really the last six months, going back to October 7th, is a new level in terms of hostility in the region and Iran's ability to fire up its proxies and really, they try to undermine the Israeli State and push the United States out of the region, which are their ultimate goals, right, is to destroy Israel and get United States out. So, I think, you know, we have reached a historic inflection point in the region with regard to relations between at least these three countries. And it's unclear where this will go. Again, it could erupt into a wider regional war. I've been saying for some time, you know, the root cause what happened October 7th and everything proceeding it always goes back to Iran. You're never really going to solve the problem of Hamas, Hezbollah, the militias in Syria and Iraq, and now, the Houthis, which are a new player until you really deal with the undermining -- underlying problem, which is Iran's support of all this nefarious activity.",

The similarities being that both countries are democracies who are fighting todefend themselves against aggressive neighbors who are not democracies. And as a Reagan Republican, I'm somebody that believes we should help those types of countries. On the other hand, the relationship between the United States and Ukraine goes back just a few decades. With Israel, it goes back 70-plus years, right? So, there are big differences between the security relationships, the political relationships, et cetera, between the two. Look, I think one confounding part of this is it goes back to the Biden administration's policy. I've given President Biden credit in the past for rallying the NATO allies in defense of Ukraine after Putin's invasion. I've given him credit for the support of Israel. But in both cases, I think he's been too self-deterred in terms of taking action in both scenarios. In Ukraine, it's always been too little, too late, too often when it comes to providing Ukraine with the arms and ammunition that needs to defend itself, let alone when. And when you think about HIMARS, Patriots, F-16s, tanks, you name it, the list goes on and on. I mean, they still don't have long-range attacking missiles. They've been asking for two-plus years. Same thing with -- in the Middle East. We suffered. We, the United States, suffered attacks at our -- against our troops throughout the Middle East over 150 times before President Biden finally decided to respond forcefully. And that happened in early February. It's been pretty solid since then, surprise. And so, again, I think he's had it too cold of a hand, too deterred, too concerned about escalation, when actually a stiffer, stronger, more resilient U.S. response might have helped kind of our side, if you will, in both scenarios. And I think that's the shortcoming of this administration that I think needs to be remedied really quickly. In this case, obviously, the latest challenge has been Republicans in Congress, specifically the House. I think they've been neglectful in terms of providing this aid. Hopefully, it will happen this week. I know a bill is supposed to be going up in the House this week to provide that $95 billion package, that includes $60 billion for Ukraine.",

If we don't lead, a vacuum will be created and either Russia or China or both, two authoritarian states will step in and over time, try to break down the international rules, order, and norms and install their own values. And that's not the world we want to live in. So, now, is a moment for leadership. And I think we have to step up in both cases -- in all cases, actually, Ukraine, the Middle East, and in Taiwan, support our friends and allies and do the right thing. And stop with this with this type of talk. It's inconsistent, not just with President Reagan, but with really the history of the GOP and frankly U.S. foreign policy now going back at least since the end of the World War II.",

In his first comments since that meeting, the Iraqi leader talked about whether a wider regional war could now be avoided. Prime Minister, you've been meeting with President Biden at a moment of extreme tension. Do you believe that Israel will respond? What have you heard in Washington? And what do you think that will cause in your region? What will happen? MOHAMMED SHIA AL-SUDANI, IRAQI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In the name of God, my visit absolutely comes in a sensitive time, a critical time for the bilateral relations between the two countries and also regarding what's happening in the region. We have an agreement about stopping the escalation of tension and not to allow us the conflict to spill out or to keep escalating, to maintain the safety and security of the peoples of the region, which started on October 7th. Since the events of October 7, we started warning about the possible dangerous consequences, and that's what happened actually. Now, we are facing a situation in the Red Sea where there is a hindering of navigation in the Red Sea.

And the difference is not really minor. We have significant difference. But we both agree that there is an international law. There is international humanitarian law and war -- law of war, which provides for the protection of civilians and diplomatic institutions.

AL SUDANI (through translator): What happened on October 7th and the consequences of that was what led the way to the recent events that we witnessed, which we had warned about, as I said. And we are afraid of the consequences of such escalation. The aggravation that took place against the diplomatic -- the consulate in Damascus was a blatant violation to the international law, which pushed Iran to retaliate. And that's what we are working on controlling now. Now, we are facing a real problem regarding what's happening in Gaza. This is what is affecting stability in the region and the whole world.

But alongside that condemnation is a call for restraint, and because the region needs stability. But Ireland will continue as a country to speak truth to power, just like my predecessor did in the Oval Office with President Biden only a few weeks ago, in terms of calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Ireland is extraordinarily clear in its condemnation of Hamas, extraordinarily clear in the need for the release, without condition, immediately of all hostages. We're extraordinarily clear of the right of Israel to be able to live in safety and security. But we also believe that reason has now been replaced by revenge. We believe there needs to be an immediate cessation of violence. And quite frankly, I don't have any time or truck for any distractions or diversions being put forward by the Nanyang governments that take away from that fundamental point.",

Hurricanes, storms, and wildfires are forcing Americans to abandon their homes as nature lashes out against human made climate change. Over 3 million Americans have already moved due to a risk of flooding, and climate experts expect some 13 million coastal residents to be displaced by the end of this century. Our next guest, Jonathan Vigliotti, has reported from the front lines of climate change and he's speaking now with Hari Sreenivasan about how American towns can become more resilient and why it's crucial to listen to the science.

And we're seeing this unfold in big cities. And I cover big cities in this book as well, most notably following Superstorm Sandy. I was there on the ground working for WNBC at the time and saw firsthand the impact that storm had in knocking offline New York City, one of the greatest cities in the world for not just days and weeks, but months. And it's a story that we continue to tell all these years later. In smaller communities, which are right now on the front lines, in real- time being impacted, these stories are being forgotten. And it's important for people to pay attention to these small towns, to learn from their lessons, and to take action to build more resiliency.",

I was basedas a foreign correspondent there when the fire hit and then moved to the West Coast a few months later. And six months later, I visited Paradise. And I had seen the destruction through the lens of the camera remotely and was struck by the disaster zone that I had arrived to. And most struck by the people, the survivors that I had met who made the decision very early on, instead of leaving town, moving elsewhere, made an effort to move back in and to rebuild. And the lessons from these survivors offer survivor guides, if we listen to their stories. How to prevent a disaster, and God forbid, if one happens, how to navigate through the red tape to rebuild. I was most struck by Kelly -- Kylie and Ellie Warble, a mother and daughter team who moved back immediately. And while their family and friends thought that they were crazy, they saw an opportunity to rebuild their town in a resilient way. Power lines today in Paradise are all built underground, and every home that's rebuilding has to create what's known as defensible space by removing dry grasses, shrubs, trees from around homes, building with more fire-resistant materials. They saw a way to create a more resilient community, and I think that their story is very powerful to other communities who have time to take action and those communities that have been impacted how to navigate through all of the bureaucratic red tape to rebuild and to create a new start over for these towns.",

Going back to Paradise, we're seeing the same thing in nearby Chico, about 20,000 people from Paradise moved into Chico. And you're seeing this friction when you have communities that are suddenly starting to mix where voters today are opposing affordable housing measures. And this is a similar conflict that we see time and time again. Two and a half million Americans were forced from their homes last year, according to the U.S. Bureau -- Census Bureau, two and a half million forced from their homes because of extreme weather. And new research out last month show that half of all American homes are threatened by climate change. So, as the climate continues to fuel the kinds of weather events that we're seeing, we're going to continue to see more of these migrants and fault lines, and other communities as they deal with absorbing new people moving in who have lost their homes.",

And unfortunately, Lahaina is a perfect example of that. My team and I were one of the first network crews to arrive. And what was left of Downtown Lahaina, 80 percent of the community was destroyed and more than 100 people were killed. I equate it to an environmental holocaust when we finally arrived. We chartered a boat to get there to this cindered shoreline where home after home was destroyed, business after business. In the immediate aftermath, we listened to local leaders as they described this fire as an explosion. It was like a bomb going off. The implication there being there was no time to take action. But there was, as we learned, a nearly decade long fuse that could have been put out at any point because scientists on the island 10 years earlier, in 2014, came out with a report that said the warming climate had increased the vulnerability of wildfires there on Maui and specifically in Lahaina. They even recommended steps that could be taken to avert disaster, including conserving water, restoring wetlands, removing dry invasive grasses, and building and updating homes with fire resistant materials. Unfortunately, that report was filed away and action was not taken in time. But in the miles on path of destruction that we witnessed firsthand, there was this home with the red roof. The homeowners, prior to this fire, had updated that home, implementing those scientific remedies, including removing bushes and trees from around the house and putting a metal red roof on top of the house, which qualified for tax credits and reduce the insurance costs. Unfortunately, every other home in that neighborhood was destroyed. But across the country, we're seeing examples of other homes with the red roof that have survived other storms by other names. Really, the message here, people as individuals have the power to protect their properties. And as individual communities, we all have the power to protect our communities, to build more resilient communities that can withstand the impacts of climate change.",

I think more and more as I talk to people on the front lines, especially those impacted by extreme weather, they recognize that the weather is changing. All of them, and many people I have spoken with never even once really considered climate change as a threat until they saw it visualized and in action in extreme weather. So, I try to point out, whenever I'm in the field, I try not to hit home climate change to these people who are oftentimes going through the worst moments of their life, but they all recognize that something has changed, the weather is no longer what it used to be, and they can't just rebuild business as usual.

And she found at the center of this all was a beaver dam that had been recently built, that was able to contain the water and build a resilient ecosystem there, a wetland that was able to resist fire. As a result of this discovery, more and more communities across the west are now welcoming the beaver, which historically has been seen as a nuisance critter because they created flooding through their dams. I was in Coalville, Utah, where a rancher that had eradicated beavers from his property, asked for them to be brought back in. There's a group of people now who are building what are known as analog beaver dams to help reintroduce beavers to create more resilient ecosystems. And today, that Coalville ranch has a thriving, lush ecosystem because of two beavers that they brought in, and these are animals that are working free of charge and are helping restore a community and an ecosystem in a way that even engineering and all the money that we have, perhaps can't do nearly as well.",

And we take steps to build back safer and to update our communities that are in harm's way. There's the Inflation Reduction Act and the infrastructure deal, which offer billions of dollars in funding to help communities across the United States. But you don't have the federal government going and knocking on doors of each of these towns saying, take this money. Local leaders need to listen, and they need to listen to their communities and they need to help get access to that funding. Grants are available, but it's up to each community to identify the risks and then to apply for those grants. And I think the first step is listening.
