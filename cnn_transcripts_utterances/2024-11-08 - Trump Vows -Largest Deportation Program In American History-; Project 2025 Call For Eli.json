In just 73 days, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath office in his second inauguration. And just days after cruising to victory, his White House team is starting to take shape. I was just talking about that with Jim. Trump has named his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, as his chief of staff. She will be the first woman to serve in that role.And the jockeying among Trump allies vying for jobs in the administration, this new administration has already begun. On that note, I want to bring in Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration as acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Thank you for joining us. Appreciate your time. First off, have you spoken to President-elect Trump or members of his transition team about a potential role in the administration? KEN CUCCINELLI, FORMER ACTING DHS DEPUTY SECY. UNDER TRUMP: So even if I had, I wouldn't say yes to that. You know, you've got to leave all of the discretion and control in their hands. And if you don't, you're messing up the -- the whole process. And I wouldn't do that. And -- and I do think they're more buttoned up as you and Jim were talking about this time than last. And -- and one really, really good way to know that is President Trump is not, you know, no president is ready to admit mistakes. But on the campaign trail, he said his biggest mistake was how he brought in personnel and who he brought in. He is keenly focused on doing this correctly. I do know they had some of a head start, even if they weren't using the governmental transition pieces that are in place by law. But I know they were working on it themselves and they are not in the same place they were eight years ago. They are way, way ahead of that game and they're much more organized. And -- and what that means in terms of choices, I think we'll see pretty quickly. Susie Wiles is a -- is a outstanding choice. And you can just look at how she ran the campaign. She was behind the scenes, but very effective. And that's really what you want out of a chief of staff. The idea, as Jim suggested, that a chief of staff should control Donald Trump is -- is that may be true of other presidents. That is not true of Donald Trump.",

So what we wrote about was essentially going back to the direction of INS, so that you just have one immigration agency to make things run more smoothly so it's a unified agency dealing with the subject matter instead of three agencies.That's -- that's what that was really about in summary. And every form of efficiency within the Department of Homeland Security helps you achieve these very lofty logistical goals that the President has set out for himself, deporting more illegals than anybody in history. He will do that. I think his opponents believe he'll do that. That's part of why they're so upset this week, is because they know he's serious and that it is doable. It really just takes the political will and people of adequate capabilities to do the job. And he surely has the political will.

That's 500,000. There's about 1.3 or 1.4 million outstanding removal orders right now today. People who have been all the way through the very extensive due process, you're literally just with those two groups. You're almost at 2 million people right there.So I don't agree with whomever you were talking to. And I also think, you know, I think of the \"60 Minutes\" piece on this subject, and they were tagging along with ICE folks who had a target that they were there to deport, who they picked up. But then at the time they picked them up, there were four other illegals there, and they said, no, no, we're not getting you. Well, that isn't going to happen in the Trump administration. That -- that's inefficient as a simple matter of logistics. If you come across lawbreakers, illegal aliens, in this case, while pursuing another lawbreaker, you route -- you -- you pick them all up and you move them all through the deportation process. So there'll be a lot more efficiencies this time than there were last time.

But the fact of the matter is, those who commit other crimes bring themselves to your attention. As you noted, it's hard to do arrests on the interior, but if someone enters the criminal justice system, even at a very low level, then you have found them. That's a very hard part of this whole process.So it isn't just because, oh, we're -- that -- that, you know, President Trump is out to get jaywalkers, it's that by entering the criminal justice system, you have put yourself on the radar in a way that makes it easy to identify you and move you into quickly into the deportation process. So don't just think of it as some moral judgment on the crime. It is an efficiency mechanism to speed along deportation. And it will be used that way. And with a cooperative Congress that actually allows you to use the appropriations process to require state and local governments who are getting federal funds to cooperate will massively increase that efficiency level.",

Undocumented immigrants make up an estimated 5 percent of the workforce. What do you say to economists who point to how mass deportations cause inflation can add to the deficit, given the cost of what it takes for deportations, which is estimated to be 11,000 person, that was from 2016, from ICE, it's gone up and actually a loss of jobs among Americans because companies would potentially rely more on technology and downsize.

If you've been convicted of a felony in the United States or you entered the United States illegally, but you have criminal felony convictions back in your home country, we should not be saying, well, you're a criminal, but because you have children, we're not going to put you in prison.

And that's literally what this is. It is a compete -- complete transition of the management and senior leadership of the federal government. But having been there in 2016, you know, it's much different now in 2020 because many of the people like the folks I work with at the America First Policy Institute were some of the senior leaders in the White House right up until the very end of the first Trump term. They were also some of the policy experts there. And so they've been writing not only on policies and potential policies, but they've also been providing a roadmap to the next administration of here are the lessons we learned.If the President signs an executive order on something, it then goes to the agencies to enact it, to enforce it, to make it actually real. And how do you do that? Having that experience, both with the President having served in the White House, with many of his senior team that he's going to name having been there before, and even in the Cabinet agencies, they now know what to expect and they know how to move the levers of government. I think he'll be much better equipped to enact his policy agenda, the one that was just supported by a majority of Americans. And he'll be able to do it quickly because of the lessons learned during the first Trump term.",

So bottom line, do you think Trump's proposals as you know them now will help or hurt when it comes to inflation?JASON FURMAN, FMR. CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS UNDER OBAMA: Yes. Trump was absolutely right that inflation has been a big problem for families. Don't let people tell you otherwise. But where he goes wrong is with his solutions, which would actually make that problem even worse, raising costs for families. And by the way, that's not just my view. That's the view overwhelming of the -- of economists, but also what people are betting on in financial markets. They are placing their bets right now for higher inflation going forward.",
