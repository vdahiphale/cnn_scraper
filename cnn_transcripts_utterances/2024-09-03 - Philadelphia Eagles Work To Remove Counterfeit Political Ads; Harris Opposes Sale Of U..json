We expect Judge Chutkan to offer some clarity on how this case is going to move forward and specifically, how she's going to go about determining whether or not any of the new indictment brought by Jack Smith is covered by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.Now, it won't surprise you to learn that there are still significant disagreements between Jack Smith's team and Donald Trump's lawyers on how this case should proceed and specifically, how the timeline should look going forward. Jack Smith has not offered any firm dates as far as scheduling goes but he has provided a scheduling narrative or at least a rough timeline that would be more quickly resolved than the one Donald Trump is proposing. Donald Trump is proposing a timeline that could stretch into fall of 2025. So ultimately, both sides will have their chance to make their case before Judge Chutkan this week and it will be ultimately her decision as to how this case moves forward and when ultimately it could be resolved.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. The new indictment really does go out of its way to conform to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity by casting Donald Trump as the candidate rather than the former president. That's really the key distinction to try to get around it and conform to the Supreme Court ruling which said Donald Trump wasn't immune from prosecution that could qualify as an official act while he was in office.And it's really in the first line of the introduction. The first change that appears is -- it describes Donald Trump -- the old indictment described Donald Trump as the 45th president and candidate for re-election. The new indictment characterizes him as Trump was a candidate for president at the time of the alleged crime. So really framing this around Trump the candidate. We also see the new indictment really does strip away any reference to Trump's conduct and interactions with government officials and specifically with Department of Justice officials. You'll remember that the first indictment -- a core part of that was Donald Trump's alleged pressure campaign on the Justice Department to help him overturn the 2020 election. One of the co-conspirators in the first indictment was Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official. That no -- the new indictment no longer mentions that element of the alleged crime. And again, it goes out of its way to cast Mike Pence as not the vice president or the former vice president but as the head of the Senate at the time, really trying to separate the distinction between anything Trump could be immune from prosecution for and Trump's role outside of his official acts as president.",

New this morning, unsolicited campaign advice from longtime Democratic operative James Carville in The New York Times, who writes there are three things that Vice President Harris needs to do to beat Donald Trump.Number one, help Trump hurt himself in the debate. Number two, break from President Biden on policy. And number three, display a clear growth mindset from the 2020 Democratic primaries. With us now, Carville's longtime friend and partner, CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, and former deputy communications director for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Bryan Lanza. I thought I'd let James sort of produce this segment for us, gentlemen, because this is an interesting roadmap he lays out. Paul first to you on item number one: help Trump hurt himself in the debates. How do you do that if you're Vice President Harris? PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, yeah, give him enough rope to hang himself. I think it's a real sign of confidence that Kamala Harris wants the microphones on all the time. Joe Biden didn't, right? So she's like hey, if he wants to be rude, if he wants to interrupt, that's fine. Trump is not a likeable guy, let's be honest. His favorable is 25 points underwater -- 25 points. Kamala Harris, in that same poll, three points above water, which is hard to do in this toxic political environment. So people like Kamala; they don't like Donald. Give them the space to confirm what they already think -- that the guy is -- I don't know, he's kind of not that nice. He's just -- I don't like him.",

We recognize that their weaknesses have been their policies for the last 3 1/2 years. And that's what the voters should be talking about because Kamala Harris wants a promotion.

He doesn't know how to react to this. Because now you have a Democrat who is pushing forward. For example, she's going to save you money at the grocery store by taking on price gougers, which Trump said he would do and, in fact, issued an executive order to do it, but never executed on it. She's going to save you money buying your first home. A new proposal of $25,000 towards your downpayment. She's going to save you money on your cost of health care by taking on big pharma and prescription drugs to lower the cost of insulin and other medications. These are all forward-looking. And even -- Trump is so wrapped up with pretending that he's still president. He makes his aides and advisers still call him President -- Mr. President. He's always looking backwards.

Those values want to shut down fracking -- and they don't care at the cost. And if you look at what Kamala Harris said during her press conference -- or during her interview with Dana Bash, who did an excellent job -- at least I felt she did -- she didn't even answer the question directly about fracking. She said she's defending her position that she said in the debate in 2020, which was the VP debate where in that debate herself she said Joe Biden will not support -- will not -- will not end fracking. So her position is clear. She's trying to lie. She's trying to have it both ways. We see the lawyer in her come out because she doesn't want to answer the question.

This recurring theme of having to question the political messages we see, whether they're endorsements by celebrities or entertainers infiltrating the sports world.A series of fake political ads popping up on bus tops around Philadelphia depicting Democratic presidential candidate and VP Kamala Harris in an Eagles' helmet, calling her the team's official candidate. A web address leads to the team's official site to a page that encourages voter registration, but that page does not endorse any particular candidate. Now, the Eagles posted on social yesterday that they were aware of the counterfeit ads being circulated and were working to have them removed. The media company responsible for the advertising on the bus shelters said they were vandalized and that people occasionally find a way to unlock the ad box to insert unauthorized copy. All right. Now, we had a huge upset in college football last night when the favorite for the College Football Playoffs this season, number 10 FSU, taken down by unranked Boston College. The Eagles crushing the Seminoles hopes led by new head man, former NFL head coach Bill O'Brien. He has his squad looking strong. Quarterback Thomas Castellanos rumbling for a touchdown and 73 of their 263 yards rushing. He also had two passing TDs. And FSU, just 21 yards on the ground. And quarterback DJ Uiagalelei, intercepted by Max Tucker, completed just 50 percent of his passes. Florida State now 0-2 following their previous loss to Georgia Tech.
