A manhunt is underway, and another community terrorized after mass shootings at a bowling out alley and a bar and grill in Lewiston, Maine. State officials say at least 18 people are dead. All from gunshot wounds, 13 others are injured, at least three are in critical condition. The shooter is still at large and considered armed and dangerous.People across multiple Maine cities are being told to shelter in place and lock their doors. Police are searching for 40-year-old Robert Card who is now facing multiple murder charges. They say, he's a military trained firearms instructor and a member of the army reserves who was recently committed to a mental health facility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. WILLIAM ROSS, MAINE STATE POLICE: If you come into any contact with this individual or someone that you think looks like this individual, you would call 911. Lewiston Police Department, federal state county and other local municipalities are involved in a coordinated search at this moment for this individual. So is the ongoing investigation and there's a search to apprehend this person both happened simultaneously. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have his car, but where he went after that. If they know, they're not saying. They told everyone to stay indoors, because they're worried for people safety, indicating, you know, for most people here who are worried for their safety that they don't know where he is. And really law enforcement not really giving much information as to where they think perhaps, he went after he dumped his car, did he use another car to somehow get away. The area where they've been searching for him is a wooded area. But we're not seeing the law enforcement presence that we normally see when there's a manhunt. They're not in the woods searching. As far as we know, it's the local police department, the 17-person police department on the ground, they're doing the searches internally. There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes that we're not seeing. But in terms of where this individual is, in terms of whether people should feel any safer today or at this moment than they did, you know, yesterday before this happened. It's certainly clear that's not the case that there is still a danger in these communities as law enforcement continues to search for the suspect.",

And we should underscore that while this manhunt is going on, what we reported at the top of the show, 18 people are dead from gunshot wounds, 13 others, 13 others are injured. Thank you so much for that, Shimon.I want to now turn to CNN's Evan Perez, who has also been talking to law enforcement sources. It was noteworthy at the press conference that was about an hour and a half ago, how few answers that they had or details they wanted to offer. You know, you can understand that they want to keep some things quiet, as they're looking for this man. But a lot of times in situations like this, they are very public. And they're warnings and information that they give to the public in order to enlist members of the public. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think one of the things they've done is already put out the obviously the photograph and pictures of the vehicle. And that's to try to generate tips from the public. People who have seen this person, who have seen this vehicle, people who know him to try to reach out. One of the things that they're really worried about at this point, Dana, is that what possible plans he has in addition to just running away and hiding right and evading. The concern that law enforcement has and why you see the shelter in place, and why they want people to stay out of sight and in their homes, is that the fact is this is unusual, right? Not only is it -- you have a shooter who carried out one shooting at one location, moves about 10 minutes down the road to a second location kills more people, and then manages to get away. Seems to have some, obviously some tactics to evade, law enforcement leaving his vehicle in one location. He's nowhere near there, apparently. And the question that law enforcement has this hour is, you know, does he have plans to try to kill additional people? Are there more possible shooting locations that he has planned? Because there is some level of preparation that he seems to have done. Now, the problem here is obviously, this is a very sparsely populated state. There is a very rural area around Lewiston. There's plenty of places for someone like this to hide, especially someone with some skill. 20 years of law enforcement, I'm sorry, 20 years of military training.",

And also, you know, let's be honest, this is Maine, and a lot of people in Maine go out for days to go, you know, hunting for deer and other wildlife to, you know, again, this is part of what life in Maine is like. And so, people do grow up with a lot of experience, spending time in very difficult conditions, very rugged, it's cold, and they know how to traverse these woods, right?And so, that's why you see the FBI, you know, all of the marshals and ATF, all of them are heading up there. They're bringing in things like, you know, aircraft that can detect any signs of heat, for instance, if someone's hiding in the woods. They can try to use -- try to pick up if he has a cell phone to try to figure out where he last was, where he's been over the last few days. Again, to get any sort of indication of where this guy could be headed next. Again, the big fear is that he's not done with what he's been doing. And that's the biggest concern.",

I now want to go to CNN's John Miller, who is former NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence &amp; Counterterrorism. And John, you have been working your sources in a big way since this happened. As I come to you, I just want to say what our colleague Haley Britzky is hearing, which is that in July of this year, leaders of the Army Reserve's 3rd Battalion 304th Infantry Regiment reported that this individual Robert Card was behaving erratically. And this is according to a national guard spokesperson, and he was subsequently transported to Keller Army Community Hospital for medical evaluation.",

That was to get a running start by saying if we can investigate our way to who this person is fast enough, we can crowdsource it. And that worked. And that's a good thing, because what they had was an extreme lack of information about their suspect.Now, they know a lot more about their suspect, and they're giving out way less information. And that's usually a signal that they have information of value that they are using. And they are trying hard to walk the line between informing the public and not compromising things that they hope will lead them closer to an arrest and capture.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's quite easy, Dana. And you know, the reason this is important after these incidents, we look at access. That's the big question the law enforcement has. How did someone with this intent and capability actually get access to a firearm and then go on to commit this atrocity. As you look at some of the gun laws there or the state of gun safety in the state of Maine, there is no assault weapons ban.Now we know that according to the images that police released of this suspect, appears he has a semi-automatic assault style rifle. That weapon not inherently illegal in the state of Maine. There are also no background checks for private sales. If you go to a federally licensed dealer or a gun store, you do go through a federal background check. But if you're buying, for example, from a friend or someone that you met online, you don't go through that rigorous background check. And then there's no red flag laws, which of course, we've talked about the suspects past mental health issues, these so-called red flag laws allow law enforcement or a family member of someone who might be in crisis to go to a judge and have a gun removed, that doesn't exist in that state.

So rather than going to a judge as they would in a red flag state, what officials in Maine have to do is take a suspect into custody or not a suspect, someone who might be in crisis. Take them to a medical facility for evaluation and a doctor actually has to sign off that they believe that person is a potential threat to themselves or someone else.The police officer then takes that certification to a judge. And then the judge will ultimately decide if the medical evaluation fits the standard. And so, you know, critics of that say that's more steps for law enforcement. It's more cumbersome rather than police going directly to a judge. But that is certainly on the books there in Maine.",

You know, we've heard from gun rights enthusiast who say that, look, law abiding people should be able to have guns.If you look at the numbers in the state of Maine, again, you have a lot of people with guns, but not a lot of violent crime. You can see the statistics there compared to the rest of the nation. Last year 29 homicides, excuse me, 2022, yes, last year in the state of Maine, so relatively low crime, but all that I think gets back to this individual himself. And that is certainly what officials will be looking at. We know according to those past mental health issues that he had, and I will preface this, or I should point out that just because someone has a mental health crisis, does not mean that they will go on to commit a crime. We don't want stigmatized mental health. But it's something that law enforcement looks at because if you have these potential warning signs, according to our reporting, this person underwent an evaluation, regardless of whether he was a law-abiding citizen, you know, two weeks ago or the day before yesterday. The question is, did he exhibit signs that then would have prevented him from having this gun or possibly having a gun confiscated.
