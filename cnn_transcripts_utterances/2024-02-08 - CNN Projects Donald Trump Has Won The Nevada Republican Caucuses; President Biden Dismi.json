You see Trump red starting to fill in on the map. Let's pop it out and show you Nevada.It's very early. We have about one percent of the vote counted. The two biggest counties, obviously Clark down here, 75 percent of the state population lives in Las Vegas and the suburbs around it. Washoe County up here with Reno. Trump's doing quite well in both. You see he's got 96 percent of the votes so far. Again, it's early, but this we expect a romp. We expect a romp tonight. In Vegas, he's getting Clark County, which includes Vegas, he's getting 99 percent at the moment. You come up here to Washoe, he's getting 96 percent if you round up the Texas businessman, Ryan Binkley, the only other person on the ballot. So, to your point, Abby, number one, if you come out to the full map, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, that will make Trump three and O. That's never happened in modern times that somebody wins Iowa and then New Hampshire. Now, he's going to win Nevada, as well, the same candidate three and O. You mentioned 26 delegates at stake. You need 1215 to win. So, Nikki Haley's right when she says, whoa, it is very early in this process. But here's another way to look at it. Coming into tonight -- coming into tonight, Donald Trump was winning 56 percent of the delegates. That percentage is going to go up because it's going to get if not a hundred percent, very close to a hundred percent of those Nevada delegates. So, if you want to prove it's not Donald Trump's party, at some point you need to beat him. You need to beat him in the state so you can start to catch up in the delegate count. That is not happening at the moment. We will click to see if more has come in. Now we're still at one percent, but you can expect, Abby, this to continue throughout the night. Ninety-six percent of the vote for Donald Trump at the moment, three and O. We go on to South Carolina next in 16 days. Nikki Haley says she's in, that's her home state. She says she's in for that and beyond. But Donald Trump made the argument even before that turned red. He thinks it's time for her to get out. There'll be some pressure. And of course, the anti-Trump forces, as you well know, Abby, will pressure her to keep in, stay on.",

The state decided to have a primary, but no delegates were at stake. So, it's essentially a beauty contest, right? And so, Donald Trump did not file for that ballot. The state Republican Party said if you wanted to participate in the caucus, you can't be on the primary ballot.Nikki Haley did decide to file for the primary ballot. Again, no delegates at stake. She didn't spend any money on advertising. She didn't campaign there. So she says it's meaningless. But it's embarrassing when none of these candidates get 63 percent of the vote and you get 30 percent of the vote. Again, it doesn't count for anything, but she would have loved for this to be yellowed to say, look, thousands of voters came out to say they want me, not Donald Trump. That didn't happen. That was the primary on Tuesday. This is where we are today. Only Trump and the Texas businessman, Ryan Binkley. Now, Ron DeSantis had filed for the caucuses. He's long gone from the race. He was going to participate, but he's long gone. So, it's essentially Trump at the moment. And you see what's happening right there. And this is the one that matters. Yes, it can be confusing.

He did not charge Biden with a crime but the report painted a picture of a forgetful Commander-in-Chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. So, that could be a picture that President Biden does not want out there as he campaigns for a second term. An angry President facing reporters at the White House tonight.

In America, we don't charge people when they haven't committed a crime. Please do not take my word for it.Listen to the words of Special Counsel Robert Hur, who spent over a year investigating this matter, reviewed thousands of documents, talked to a vast number of people. He stated, we conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter. Biden did nothing else than was considered normal for most of the duration of his long career. Again, as Mr. Hur, who was a Trump- appointed United States attorney who spoke from the podium in the Trump administration, in the Trump White House, here's what Mr. Hur had to say about that. \"Historically, after leaving office, many former Presidents and Vice Presidents have knowingly taken home sensitive materials. My distinguished opponent tells you that the President had materials in his house that he shared as he was reviewing for his book. But here's what Mr. Hur says about that, that there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that they could have been stored by mistake and without his knowledge. Mr. Hur would not have charged him. This is apples and oranges with the situation of Donald Trump, where there's ample proof that Trump knew he had documents, he refused to cooperate. Hur points out, Biden did cooperate, that shows criminal intent for Trump.",

Number three?DANIELLE CORNWALL, JUROR, LAURA'S COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION:  No, I don't. I think it's two different things. President Trump obstructed justice and then I think, unfortunately, made himself look more guilty than maybe he was. And President Biden did cooperate. It's clear that there's a pattern of politicians taking home classified materials, often in many judiciaries or justice systems like crimes come before them and they make a decision on whether they think it's enough to prosecute or not. And in this instance, that's not the case. So there's no smoke here, just no fire. LARRY MADISON, JUROR, LAURA'S COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION:  Yeah, I agree. Vice President Pence was not charged. He had documents. And it's unfortunate. It's happened over the years. But there is a precedent for not charging a President when there's a belief that some crime may have been committed. And that was the Mueller investigation. He did not exonerate Trump, but he did not charge him. So, the issues, true, are different, but again, the end result is the same.

I think that there was also a difference in the personal documents. Some of them were classified documents, and some of them were his own personal notebooks. And so, I think where he had handwritten notes, where he had written notes during meetings. And so, I think that we kind of look at that and you say, well, what's considered classified and what's not classified if it's someone's personal notebook and they're writing their personal notes from a meeting. So, I think that some of the documents that Donald Trump had were actually documents that he was maybe trying to keep for something in the future, I don't know, but they were, those documents weren't necessarily from personal notes that he had taken.",

That is not what is happening. I think Republicans writ large are tired of being dismissed, tired of being disrespected, tired of there being these shifting goal posts where on one day, Democrats are allowed to pretend that Ray Epps is a hero. On another day, they're going to sit here and pretend that anybody who was even in the presence of January 6th is somehow the same as somebody who quite literally forced their way into the building, broke glass, defecated in the building, all these different types of things. So, I just think we have to be very specific because where we are right now, where people in Congress are referring to Republicans writ large as insurrectionists, I think that's how we got into this place where the division has basically runneth over and gotten us to the rhetoric that has gotten people in a lot of trouble.",

It was not on the ballot for the caucuses. She participated in the primary.But they still are feeling very good about tonight. And part of that is because it's capping off a great day for Donald Trump. I spoke with some of his advisors and they argued it was one of the best days on the trail for him yet. And that's not just because of winning the Nevada caucuses and also the Virgin Island caucuses earlier today, but because of what we saw play out on the legal side of what has been in wrapping Donald Trump, which is the Special Counsel's report from Robert Hur saying that Joe Biden willfully retained classified documents and mishandled classified documents. Something that Donald Trump and his campaign have already seized on, and plan to continue to use against Joe Biden moving forward, particularly the language around Joe Biden's mental fitness and what Hur described as maybe being a poor memory. That is really something already we've seen Donald Trump's team really try to push the narrative on, and I know they're going to continue to use that in the weeks ahead, especially as they pivot to a general election strategy. But then you also had the SCOTUS arguments, so the Supreme Court arguments where Trump in his team really do feel like they are primed for a victory where it seems like the justices do -- seem prepared to side with Donald Trump over Colorado. And so, I've got in addition to this big win in Nevada tonight has really emboldened them and emboldened their confidence that Donald Trump is going to continue to keep picking up the delegates that he needs to -- what they hope become the nominee by mid-March -- presumptive nominee by mid-March, I should say.",

Ryan Binkley, the only other guy who's competing in these caucuses, with 26, just two percent of the estimated vote is in, so far. We've got votes down from Clark County, which of course home to Las Vegas. Look at this, Donald Trump way out ahead there. Also, Washoe County, which of course is where Reno is. I prefer Reno to Las Vegas myself. Look at this, Donald Trump way up there, 96 percent of the vote to Ryan Binkley's, four percent of the vote. Now, you might be wondering, where is Nikki Haley on here? Where is Nikki Haley? And the reason you don't see Nikki Haley is because she decided to instead take part in the Nevada primary. Basically, the candidates had to choose, take part in the primary on Tuesday or take part in the caucuses on Thursday. The caucuses are where the delegates are allocated, but on Tuesday, I think Nikki Haley had the idea, hey, maybe I could notch you in here even if I don't get any delegates. No, she in fact, lost to none of the candidates or none of these candidates. Nikki Haley just got 30 percent of the vote. But again, if you look at where we are right now in these caucuses, we see that Donald Trump is well ahead here. He is leading in both of these counties. And I will also note, Laura, there was another contest that took place today and that happened right over here. Let's see if we can get over there. There we go, the U.S. Virgin Islands. We have 99 percent of the estimated vote in there. And what do we see here? This was actually a match-up between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. We see Donald Trump easily winning here, 74 percent of the vote to 26 percent. Look, it's just four delegates, but you know what? Four delegates will certainly help Donald Trump as he's on his road. Right now, as we look overall, we see, look here, Donald Trump with 60 delegates, Nikki Haley with just 17. Donald Trump should expand that lead tonight as we moored more and more delegates to Donald Trump based on the votes in this overstate, where, of course, we see Donald Trump absolutely dominating, even though there's two percent of the vote in right now. We'll keep counting, Laura. COATES:  This breakdown is so helpful and also a reminder of why Nikki Haley is not part of this in Nevada and that Tuesday that was that primary and here we are with this caucus which had all the marbles as you rightly point out in the delegate count.
