The 45th president of the United States now plans to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail this Thursday. Donald Trump also agreed to a $200,000 bond today, including $80,000 on count one violation of Georgia's RICO act and $10,000 each on the counts of criminal solicitation, conspiracy filing, false documents and false statements. His attorneys signing off on an agreement that includes this warning to their client, quote, the defendant shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice. The agreement goes on to warn that it includes social media. And it comes as a source of telling CNN that employees with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office are now being threatened over the role that they'll play with the former president's surrender this week. We're going to go deep into all of that tonight. Plus, a Southern California clothing store owner hangs a rainbow pride flag outside of her business and is shot to death. We have the latest developments in that investigation. And the angry reaction to Spain's soccer chief giving an unwanted kiss on the lips to a woman's World Cup soccer star after the team's final victory over England yesterday. Is it a setback for women's sports? But, first, I do want to begin now with the breaking news on the former president's surrender on Thursday. Here with me in the studio is Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez, CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel and CNN Legal Analyst Elliot Williams. Evan, I want to start with you. So, the day is going to be Thursday. Do we know anything more about what that is going to look like, what the plan is for him?",

In this case, the sheriff's office in Atlanta says that they're going to treat him like any other defendant.He's gotten a lot of deference when he turned himself in in New York and certainly in the federal system. They didn't even take a mug shot. In this case, they are going to take mug shots, they're going to fingerprint him, they're going to do all of the things they normally do.",

It's a place that's getting a lot of scrutiny even from the Justice Department for the conditions under which prisoners are being held there. So, it is not a nice place.And the former president is going to be going in there. He's going to go through a process, obviously surrounded by Secret Service, a lot of protection for him, but it is not going to be like the other ones. And in this case, the Georgia law allows for the release of that mug shot. It's something that he's so far not had to have happen. Obviously, his fundraising people, I think, believe that this could be something that he could use to his own advantage to try to raise money off of. We'll see whether that's really how it works.",

You saw the lawyers come into the government center down in Atlanta and they worked out the details.And part of it in this $200,000 bond is -- again, this is the first time that the former president is actually having to do a cash bond. The other ones were personal recognizance and personal surety bonds. This is actually he's going to have to put up money under the Georgia system. And under the terms of this, it's a lot more extensive than what we've seen in his previous cases, where he's been warned by judges. You can't threaten witnesses. You can only talk to witnesses through your own lawyers. In this case, as you pointed out in the document itself, it warns him about intimidating witnesses and also points out that he cannot threaten or intimidate people using social media, which is something he was doing on the day of his indictment. He warned Geoff Duncan against showing up and testifying against him, which, of course, he did on that very day.",

Now, once that happens, the judge is going to have to sort out, now is that really a threat, did it step up to the line, did it step over the line to the point that we're going to have to revoke his bond and put him in jail?

That said, we're told that there are some Trump advisers who really think that he should be participating for two reasons. One, heaven forbid, someone in that group rises to the top and he's not there. We know how effective he can be. The second is, if he becomes the nominee, he needs to argue that Joe Biden should debate him. If he doesn't show up for the debates, that undercuts that argument.",

She believes that this is an important thing for the public and certainly for voters.And so I think they believe that they're in a good place to try to make sure that they get this trial perhaps by early summer.

That's like a lifetime in a political world to do it that far ahead. Do you expect that to actually work, to steal -- truly to steal the oxygen from this debate as a form of just sort of distraction here? KINZINGER: No, no. So, that's not going to do it. So, Tucker Carlson, even though we all still know his name, every time he's put something out, like it's kind of gone over very quietly. Only we get a little chatter on Twitter. But people don't pay attention to Tucker Carlson anymore. When he lost his position at Fox News, he lost his megaphone. He was -- yesterday, I did see, he was basically being a traitor to the United States, going out and talking about how great all these powerful dictators were. But we're not talking much about it because nobody cares about Tucker Carlson anymore. So, I don't think this is going to be the thing that overshadows the debate or that gives Donald Trump some special attention. It will make him feel good because Tucker will continually kiss up to him and Donald Trump loves that. But what will do that is the arrest on Thursday.

So, it's interesting, DeSantis always couches his criticism with praise in these interviews. But I will also say, I mean, look, Trump is probably maybe the most experienced debater in terms of presidential debates, who could be on that debate stage. But to your mind, is there anything that he loses by not being out there, not flexing this muscle in a couple of years against some of the people that maybe when he decides later on in this process to join them on a debate stage, is there anything he can lose? KEVIN MADDEN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't think so. I mean, he actually tactically, he has the lead in the race. He has the ability to drive all the attention towards him anytime he wants by just saying something or doing an interview. So, I think his main goal here is to deny his opponents any oxygen, right? So just try to block out the sun on their candidacies, while at the same time letting them fight amongst each other. And so, by not showing up it really does perfectly suit his strategy.",
