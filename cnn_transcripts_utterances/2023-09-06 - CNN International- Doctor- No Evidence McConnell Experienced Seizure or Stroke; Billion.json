Experts say the first lady should be doing well despite a positive test. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE: I think she should be doing really quite well for a number of reasons. One, she's funded -- fundamentally a healthy woman. She has been vaccinated. She's been boosted and she has had a prior infection, as you can recall last summer. Which means she has a hybrid immunity or a good amount of immunity. It didn't prevent her from getting infected, but certainly would go a long way to prevent her from getting severe disease. So although you never can predict, I would imagine very strongly that she should do really quite well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Especially that $4.5 billion pledge from the United Arab Emirates ahead of their hosting of COP 28 later this year. That's a big one because they've been talking about how much investment is necessary in the renewable energy space on the continent.The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who spoke here yesterday, said Africa could be a renewable energy superpower because the vast potential exists here. But it's untapped. Over the last two decades, about only two percent of the total global investments have come to the continent despite a huge potential here. And that's what President William Ruto of Kenya and the other African leaders have come here are trying to tell the rest of the world that there is massive potential here and carbon sinks that exist in the continent, but also in renewable energy such as green hydrogen, and they want the money to come in. But this is one of just the angles. The big one is around adaptation. Because Africa contributes less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions but suffers some of the worst impacts of the climate crisis. And they feel that there's been a lot of commitments from the global North about how to pay for that adaptation. To shore up communities that are most affected by this, but the money just hasn't come. And they hope to agree on a common platform into COP 28 to convince the rest of the world why they need to be paying more attention here, and especially where they need to be sending more money to African countries that are suffering the worst effects of the climate crisis.",
