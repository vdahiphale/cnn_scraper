Consider the timing request for trial to begin. And also consider the scope if you will the evidence that the district attorney says she has against the former president and others.

She wants that trial to kick off in just over six weeks from now, October 23rd. But as we all know, Donald Trump's legal team is asking for a later date, a much later date for him to face his 13 criminal charges alone. CNN's Sara Murray, she leads us off this hour.

DOUG JONES (D-AL): Well, you know, I was concerned too, I got to know Mitch, we disagree on so many things, but I respected as his position of a minority leader. So like a lot of people, I was concerned, the President of the United States, called him and expressed those concerns to. I just don't think that he is in real jeopardy of losing his spot as Majority Leader at this point. That Dr. Monahan from the House has got incredible respect among the senators.

And I think as minority leader, he can stay this course right now. Try to keep the Republican Party on a path that is a little bit sane in the Senate. What you're seeing is bipartisan efforts in the Senate. We've seen it for the last two years. And I think that that's important for the country. I think it's important for democracy.

And once they get in office, I mean, I think Senator Johnson is the best example of that -- on term limits. But then when it was time to give it up, he decided to the people of Wisconsin wanted another term. And in fact, they voted for him another term. You know, the term limits think Kate, is at about, there is term limits every six years for the Senate in every two years from members of the House.

I mean, they essentially said thanks, Supreme Court, no, thanks, we're not going to do exactly what you're telling us to do. What's going to happen now? JONES: Well, I think that you're going to have a special master, like the court said, special master, who has got up a mapmaker, they're going to draw a map that the court is going to give both parties an opportunity to talk about, and the court is going to approve amount. I mean, you know how Kate, that's the way we do things in Alabama. We're the make me state and this legislature was just poking a finger in the eye of the United States Supreme Court, and the district courts. It was stunning, that they just completely ignored. The map that they had was worse than the one that we got right now. And the court found that and it was a 200 page opinion, well documented, just like the one a couple of years ago that the Supreme Court upheld, ultimately upheld. And I think that this Court is going to do the right thing. I've always believed this Court was going to do the right thing. And this is going to be a big event, I think for not only Alabama, but also for the South.
