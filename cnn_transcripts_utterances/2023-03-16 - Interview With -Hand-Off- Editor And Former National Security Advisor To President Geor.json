Hari Sreenivasan talks solutions with neuroscientist Stephani Sutherland, and long COVID patient Tara Ghormley. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. A lightning Russian invasion into a neighboring state sends shockwaves around the world. President Putin blames the west, and particular, the United States, for triggering this attack. And the White House scrambles to make the right response. Now, what if I were to tell you, I'm not talking about Ukraine today, but about Georgia in 2008, when then-President George W. Bush was stunned by a Russian attack on one of its neighbors. The same imperialist forces that emerged then dominate President Biden's foreign policy priorities now. So, was it a learning moment? And has the W. Bush era shape contemporary American foreign policy? I've been speaking about this with Bush's former national security adviser, Stephen Hadley. Whose new book, \"Hand-Off\" digs into the top-secret foreign policy memos that Bush handed to his successor, President Barack Obama and how they continue to shape U.S. policy to this day.

And those trends have continued to the present. You know, at the beginning of the administration, the end of the cold war, America was the pre-eminent power. Our model of political democracy and market economy -- economic seemed to be the only model that people were interested in following and the international system, based on our values and principles, was unchallenged. A great power of competition seemed to be a thing of the past. All of that has changed. The world we face now, of course, is authoritarian state capitalism is offered by China and Russia as an alternative to our model. They're challenging the international system, great power competition is back, and America's relative power is not what it was 20 years ago. So, the world has really changed. We saw those trends begin under the Bush administration. We were the first administration to try respond to them, they've only strengthened and deepened up to the present.",

In some sense, deter China, and maybe moderate some of its aggressiveness. That's what our hope. You know, our policy under the Bush administration was to try to integrate China into the international system but to hedge by strengthening our alliances in South Korea, Japan, Australia. Bringing India into a strategic relationship with the United States.

You know, Christiane, one of the little secrets about foreign policy is there is a lot more continuity betweenadministrations than many times we recognize, given all the rhetoric. I think the Trump administration gets a lot of credit for waking up the American people to the China challenge. I think that it helped to build a bipartisan consensus behind the notion that we need to be more aggressive in terms of dealing with the China challenge. And the Biden administration now has continued that line has actually developed a policy that has bipartisan support for how to deal with China. The trick, of course, is a more competitive relationship. And we need to manage that competition in a way that it does not result in confrontation and military conflict, because that would be a loss for everybody. And particularly over Taiwan, it would be a loss for Taiwan, for China, and the United States. So, I think we have had a framework. We've had this Taiwan issue since really, the opening of -- to China under President Nixon. We've had this issue. We've been able to manage it between the two of us. I think we have a framework for doing so and the two countries need to continue to engage on that issue.",

And once that statement was made, Saddam Hussein thought he had to get out of jail free card. He thought President Bush would not go to war without an 18th resolution, and that the French and the Russians would veto that resolution. So, at that point, the president was faced with his face -- faithful choice of either to use the troops that he had built up in the region or basically to say to Saddam Hussein, 12 years of diplomacy, economic sanctions, military action, forget it. You know, your home free. And the president decided that that latter choice was just unacceptable for the credibility of the United Nations and the credibility of the United States.",

And, you know, I think that one thing about long COVID is that because so many millions of people got sick with COVID-19 at the same time, and people all started to develop this long COVID in 2020, it was really hard to ignore the length. It was very clear that this was a post viral illness. And I just want to mention, this is similar. There's a lot of overlap between long COVID and the condition called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS, which also affects many more women than men and also really was treated as something that, even very recently, that doctors maybe didn't believe existed and many women have really suffered with it. Because it's also a post viral illness, but it didn't arise during a global pandemic, it's really hard to pin down when people might have developed it or when the viral infection may have happened.
