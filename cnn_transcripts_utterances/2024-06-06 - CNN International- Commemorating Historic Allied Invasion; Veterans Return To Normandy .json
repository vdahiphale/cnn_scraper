U.S. President Joe Biden has arrived for the international memorial ceremony at Omaha Beach, as we said, which is expected to start in just minutes. Now, right now, you're looking at live pictures, as we see more world leaders take their places. Let's take a listen.(VIDEO PLAYING) Earlier, the somber ceremonies included a fly over honoring those who fought so bravely during the Allied invasion of France. (VIDEO PLAYING) As we see here, U.S. President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron among the world leaders who are gathered in Normandy. Mr. Macron gave thanks to 11 U.S. Veterans of World War II by awarding them with the Legion of Honor. President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden earlier paid their respects at Normandy's American Cemetery. Now, Mr. Biden's speech marking the anniversary, not only honored the heroes of D-Day, but also spotlighted just how similar the threats posed by Nazi Germany in 1944 are to those facing the world today. With wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza, he said that the fight for democracy is the responsibility of every generation. The U.S. President says that the men who landed on those beaches 80 years ago understood that the fate of free people across the globe was in their hands. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

People are waving to each other. They've come out really with extraordinary feelings about what went on. There is, of course, all the solemnity of the occasion what we heard from the heads of state remembering the huge sacrifices that were made. But, there is also out here on the coast, as you can see, much more of the pleasure that people have in coming out here and remembering in their own way, paying tribute as they can.And I think what these vehicles that are so lovingly cared for remind us of, Rahel, were these extraordinary -- this extraordinary logistical feat that underpinned all this, these amphibious vehicles that allowed the allies to come on in those first few crucial hours and days after the first man managed to get their feet onto these beaches to bring those critical supplies in. The other logistical feature or part of it is, of course, something else that was in the heart of the tributes that were made by President Macron earlier in the week, further inland. The extraordinary, again, coordinated efforts with these Allied armies to take out German communication centers to German resupply positions that would, once the initial D-Day had begun, have allowed the Germans to respond in a far more aggressive and adequate defense of their positions, and in fact, they were able to do. At the heart of that, the German inefficiency was also, of course, Rahel, the ability of this extraordinary Operation Overlord to trick the enemy into thinking that this wouldn't in fact be the main event, that this would be where minor operations took place, that the main landings would happen far further north and close to the coast. So, a year of preparation and a remarkable amount of coordination between the armies of so many different countries, and I think that's really at the heart of what we've heard today, the homage we paid to the bravery of the few men still standing up here that day. But, underneath it all, underpinning it all, that extraordinary ambition and desire to fight for freedom and the coordination that allowed one of the most successful military campaigns in the history of Europe.",

What happened last summer with the counteroffensive in Ukraine, was exactly what happened in 1942 when the allies rushed ashore at Kyiv (ph). They went with a small force. They didn't do adequate reconnaissance. They didn't have combined operations. They didn't seal off the area behind the obstacles. They didn't have air superiority, in Ukraine I'm talking about. And of course, they got the same result that the allies got in 1942.And so, for Ukraine to eject, kick the Russians out of Ukraine, Ukrainians have to prepare an operation on this scale. And they can't do it without Allied help. So, they're going to need the equipment, the communications, the aircraft, the air superiority, the air defense, the deception planning. It's going to be eventually an operation just like this one, if they're to succeed in regaining their territory and convincing Mr. Putin that aggression doesn't pay. And I would suspect, if we give them those resources and Putin sees it forming, he may have a different view of aggression, and he may then be willing to come to the table and pull out before he loses everything.",

And it's interesting if you sort of think about the genesis of D-Day, the D-Day landing, Operation Overlord. This was actually conceived and agreed between Prime Minister Churchill, President Roosevelt and Stalin in Tehran of all places late in 1943. So, that just gives you an idea of how much times have changed.But, yes, absolutely, it is Putin that has seemed to be the aggressor now in Europe, and for that reason, that ally of the alliance that came out of World War II, those 12 nations that fought together on the beaches there in Normandy that have now become the 32 nations of NATO, and Ukraine wants to be a member of that.

So, we expect comments to come there. But, for him, he is looking at this and he sees the alliance that he thinks wants to encroach on him. He thinks and has said quite clearly that if these nations continue to support Ukraine, particularly allowing Ukraine to use the weapons they give them to strike inside Russia, there will be consequences. He said that would be the case for the United States.So, I think for President Putin, days like today, these commemorations, do send a clear message, but it's not one that I think we should expect him to be about face and change track and pull out of Ukraine.

It's the day tens of thousands of Allied troops stormed the beaches of France to liberate the country from Nazi troops and punch a hole in Hitler's Atlantic Wall. These are live pictures from France. More than 20 heads of state are attending ceremonies to remember the thousands of young men who died that day.(VIDEO PLAYING) So, he is just giving the Legion of Honor there to some of the Veterans, which is the highest honor that France can bestow. And now, we're about to hear from the President of France, who has s hosted this momentous event. But, we're going to bring you the highlights as we get them through the course of the day. King Charles also attending today's commemoration in France on behalf of the United Kingdom. He and the Queen met with D-Day Veterans and their families. The king also spoke about the pivotal battle 80 years ago. He thanked those who fought for their courage and their ability to stand in solidarity against tyranny. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the Veterans that you see here, now before you were listening from the -- listened to the French president, they were just in their teens. So, it's an extraordinary moment to see them still able to get there. But, the numbers get smaller and smaller every year, and one of them, who Christiane was speaking to earlier, said this would certainly be his last visit to Normandy in France. So, it's a bookend (ph) in many ways, the 80th anniversary for many of them, King Charles as well. His mother, of course, serving in the war. So, so many people there still have direct connections with World War II, and with D-Day.But, as time moves on, this is more about remembering the stories and passing them on to young people. But, we heard from General Wesley Clark earlier on that he worries that these messages aren't resonated with young people, and they don't really realize the threat that we might be under going forward if such an occasion ever happens again. We will bring you the highlights of President Macron's speech a little later on. But, that's it from London.",
