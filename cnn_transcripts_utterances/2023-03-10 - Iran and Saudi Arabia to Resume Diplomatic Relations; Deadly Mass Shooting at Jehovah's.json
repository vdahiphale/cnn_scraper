Nearly half a million without power in Ukraine's second largest city after Thursday's strikes. Israel's prime minister is in Italy amid turmoil at home. And later this hour, Ronaldo storms off the pitch in Saudi Arabia. Well, we start this hour with some developing news and a surprising diplomatic move that could have major geopolitical repercussions for this region and beyond. Saudi Arabia and Iran today agreeing to resume diplomatic relations after talks mediated by China, with a signing ceremony happening in Beijing. A statement says the countries plan to reopen their embassies within two months and both agree to respect the sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Now the Saudis severed ties with Iran in 2016, when Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran following the execution of a Shia cleric in Saudi Arabia. Well, this news coming as Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry is once again calling for a permanent cease fire in Yemen. The conflict there is seen as a proxy war between the Saudi-led military coalition and Houthi rebels backed by Iran. Prince (INAUDIBLE) made the cease fire call while meeting with his Russian counterpart in Moscow. The war has tipped Yemen into what's described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. And all this as the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"The New York Times\" report that Saudi Arabia is laying out its terms to the United States for peace with Israel. Both outlets say Saudi wants U.S. security guarantees and to help developing civilian nuclear program in return for normalization. Those are just reports from the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"The New York Times.\" The middle of this and what's going on as far as this is concerned for the U.S., well, Iran who has been ramping up its own nuclear, program and has been supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine. This up the ante for the Biden ministration to bring two of its most important allies in the region closer together. This is a very, very busy day for news on and from this region. And of course, I am broadcasting to you from our Middle East programming hub here in the UAE. Stories here that have impact way beyond this region. Cinzia Bianco is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. She joins us now. Cinzia, as I say, a very busy. Let's pick apart what we have here starting with the restoration of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Why is this a big deal?",

Washington needs a stakeholder that is talking to both sides at the moment because frankly, you know, the West does not have open channels of communication with Moscow.

They're certainly not afraid of getting in the mix and of sort of having eggs in different baskets, balancing both Iran and possibly a normalization with Israel, although I am not that confident that they are in any rush to go ahead with normalizing relations with Israel. And also sort of getting in the mix of the Ukraine-Russia war to sort of also cement their role as a global actor, no longer just a regional actor. And you can see that, you know, they're very active in India as well. They possibly, possibly might join the BRICS or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as well.

Another possible hint at motivation is that the police said they had no contact with him. There was no police record, although he had filed a motion and filed to question about some kind of fraud. So there is a question, too, that may have motivated him. It's not known at this time. But they're still investigating trying to see what could possibly have motivated this.

And it is a reminder of just the immense cost, the immense price, that this country is paying for what many see as a war for independence from Moscow's rules and control. This is one man out of untold numbers of people who have died since Russia invaded this country, many of course in the armed services, but civilians as well, and that death toll is growing with every passing day as the Ukrainian government says, in the huge missile salvo that was fired by Russia over the past 36 hours, at least 11 people killed. Most of those believed to be civilians. So this is a price that the entire society is paying in addition to this individual commander, who, again, many people view as a hero. One of the people that I spoke to at the memorial was a mother in her late twenties of a young son whose own husband is also fighting in Bakhmut as we speak. She tries to message with that man every day, get at least an SMS to heat that he's still there, he's still alive.

But it was feared those trapped inside would never make it out, but secret talks were underway.
