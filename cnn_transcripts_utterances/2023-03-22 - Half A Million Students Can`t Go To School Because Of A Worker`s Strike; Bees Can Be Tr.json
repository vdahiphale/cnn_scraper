Some folks may think bees just randomly fly around feeding on flowers, pushing around pollen, and then hang out in the hives making honey. Turns out these insects are organized, smart and coachable. A recent study shows that bees can be trained to solve puzzles, and other bees can study a demonstrator bee to then accurately solve the puzzle themselves. No wonder bees are able to divvy out responsibilities in hives with specific jobs and roles to strategically live their daily lives. Let`s learn more now how for bees, teamwork makes the dream work.

The prize sugar.Researchers studied bumblebee colonies to see if they developed social learning, also known as learned behavior. Scientists designed a two-option puzzle box that could be opened by pushing a red tab clockwise or a blue tab counterclockwise. One set of bees, called the demonstrator bees, were trained to use the blue or red tab. Other observer bees watched, and when it was their turn, most bees chose the same option they had observed from the trained bee. One professor said, our research shows, however, that new innovations can spread like social media memes through insect colonies, indicating that they can respond to wholly new environmental challenges much faster than by evolutionary changes. The researchers concluded that bees, like humans, are capable of culture by socially learning behavior. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Tater tots were invented back in 1953 in Oregon as a way to keep potato scraps from going to waste. Let`s go be spectators in Portland.

I mean, who doesn`t want tots with mac and cheese and fried chicken on it? If you can think about the cuisine, we have a tot for it. So there`s Oaks Bottom, which coined the term totcho. That obviously has a Mexican bent to it. There`s Japanese restaurant Boxer Ramen, and they do an okonomiyaki tot that is savory and is served with bonito flakes, which are fish flakes that kind of dance in the heat.
