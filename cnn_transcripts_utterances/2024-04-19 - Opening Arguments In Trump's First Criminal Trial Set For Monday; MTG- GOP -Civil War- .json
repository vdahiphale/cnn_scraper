We'll take you inside the courtroom for details on what Trump was zeroing in on today and what it may tell us about his legal strategy. Plus, Marjorie Taylor Greene says it is civil war in the House of Representatives, just hours before a vote that could very well end Mike Johnson's stint as speaker. And breaking news just into CNN, a, quote, huge explosion reported at a pro-Iran military base. We are working on those details. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. Opening statements in the first criminal trial of Donald Trump is set for 9:30 a.m. on Monday. The jury of 12 and six alternates have been sworn in, and an appeals court judge just rejected Trump's last-ditch effort to delay that trial further, as he tries to move the case that of New York City. All of this comes after a flurry of pretrial motions from Trump's legal team, the judge shutting them down. And finally this afternoon telling team Trump, it has two quote, has to end saying there comes a point where you accept my rulings. Well, Trump appears to come to terms with opening statements starting on Monday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants to go as fast as possible. That's for his reasons, not for my reasons. (END VIDEO CLIP) HILL: The stakes are, of course, high emotions running even higher today in court, some prospective jurors broke down as they were being questioned. Just ahead, you're going to hear from the courtroom sketch artist who was there just feet away from Donald Trump. I do first though, want to turn to my colleague, Evan Perez, who is OUTFRONT live tonight outside the New York courthouse. So Evan, were waiting from a judge -- from a ruling from the judge that could come any moment would tell us what we may hear at trial. Why is that so important? What will it mean?",

And the things that they want to bring up, of course, are some of his past legal problems, some of the rulings that have gone against him. And, of course, a civil some of the civil fraud judgment, the $355 million civil fraud judgment that was rendered against the former president, just a few months ago, just a few weeks ago, the fact that he was -- he violated a gag order of judge had ruled that he violated a gag order, things like that. The prosecution says should be used, they should be able to use to impeach his credibility before this jury. Today, during that at the end of -- after they had sworn in the jurors, they stayed behind to argue some of these points to Trump team again, saying that they don't believe any of these things should be able to be brought up. The judge said that they will he will make a decision before Monday -- before we begin our trial on Monday -- Erica.",

How much do they center Michael Cohen or other people that we haven't heard of as much like David Pecker, who was apparently allegedly in on the deal from in August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower to set up the catch and kill operation and then when Trump is president, Trump, thanks him, allegedly for helping with the campaign, which means that this was about election interference of a certain sort.

He's also particularly interested when they're talking about some of the stuff that annoys him with this case, and that happens that happens quite a bit, not surprisingly. We had a hearing this afternoon where prosecutors are going through all of the other cases they want to bring up these civil fraud verdict against him, the E. Jean Carroll defamation verdict said have gone against him. And when one of the prosecutors raise that verdict, Trumps shook his head and was glaring at the prosecutor. One other interesting thing, just seeing that this afternoon, the end of the day, Trump, he went to get up. He thought that hearing was done and we thought it was too is trying to write it was wrapping up. But as Trumps sit up, the judge turned me in quickly, said, sir, sit down, please sit down.

And I think Trump is certainly going to both be engaged with what's happening, but also he's going to have to help himself not to react. Remember back earlier in this week, the judge reprimanded Trump for turning toward a juror and muttering while the juror was speaking and Trump is real going to have to watch himself as the judges already put him on notice and we're going to have a hearing, of course, on Tuesday about the violating the gag order.

I was very active in getting people vaccinated during COVID. I've been very active in a nonpartisan way in trying to teach people what's the right thing to do. And then I behave badly and I suffer for it.And so I looked people right now, take your medications, do what your doctors tell you to do and we have to take personal responsibility in this country.
