That was better than expected. But what does that mean for the prices we all pay for things? What does it mean for interest rates? Let me bring in Lael Brainard. She is the director of the National Economic Council. Director Brainard, good to have you. Thanks for being with us today.",

Inflation at 2.5 percent. That suggests the economy can continue expanding, the employment can continue expanding with low inflation. And that is good news.But the work on lowering costs needs to continue. Many middle class families are still facing high prices, and that is the focus of Vice President Harris, President Biden lowering costs. They're doing that on prescription drugs. A real focus on housing affordability. A plan to build 3 million houses. And, of course, we are actually seeing relief at the pump. So, $3.35 national average, that's a reduction of about $0.50 since last Labor Day, and the lowest Labor Day gas prices we've seen in three years.",

Talk to us a little bit about how we get to a better place with shelter costs when people are suffering and dealing with that right now.",

VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I actually think what Donald Trump is trying to do is identify some common ground so that we can focus on the big national questions like, why can't Americans afford groceries and housing? American families can't afford groceries or health care. Young families can afford to buy a home to raise their families in. Those are the real crises that we should focus on. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, completely agree that those are the issues that the president, the vice president want to focus on, on behalf of the American middle class families that are being squeezed.Now, if you look at the tariff proposal that some Republicans have put on the table, interestingly, those would amount to a national sales tax of about 4,000 per middle class family. A lot of that would raise food prices. So, we have made incredible progress already on bringing down prescription drug prices, $35 insulin, down hundreds of dollars per month for American families, capping ten prices in Medicare, or at least negotiating those prices for the first time, capping out of pocket costs on drugs for seniors. You know, Republicans - every single Republican voted against the bill to get that done, to bring down health care costs. The president and the vice president understand how important health care costs are and they want to make those kinds of lower drug prices and caps on out-of- pocket costs available to all Americans. And that's what they're going to continue working to do.",

So, we have no doubt she will endorse her when the time is right. I think we've seen with the Vienna statement recently, Taylor will speak when the time is right for her.

And when they're in office, hopefully those policies will protect us a lot more.And so that's kind of what's brought us together. Like, as Swifties, we share a lot of values. And so it kind of translate over pretty naturally that we would care about this because it's the same way that we try to make merch sales more accessible, whether it's something for like record store day and people will rally around that to organize around people who might not have access.
