They told me that all of the evacuation orders have been lifted. But it doesn't mean that all of this is over because of all the water that is still here.As you can see in this neighborhood, it is house after house that has been flooded. I've talked to many of the people here who have told me look, we've been here for years and this is the worst that it's been. The one thing that they're worried about is that the water is not receding. We've been here since very early this morning and we have not seen the water go down very much or at all. And so, that's what these residents are worried about. Normally, if it floods here, the water goes away. But here it is. And this is what they will be dealing with over the next couple of days if not weeks. The county is still saying, look, you should not be on the roads because a lot of them look like this. So, even though evacuation orders have been lifted, they're saying, if you don't have to be out and driving around, just stay home because, of course, it could be extremely dangerous. The ground is saturated. This is a county with a lot of trees, large trees, and with the ground so saturated, it was very easy for the street to come down. And again, you're seeing the water street after street. I want to show you this street, but also, I'm going to turn around because right across the street, you're seeing the same thing you know. And these neighbors hear just telling me that they're frustrated, they're tired because they're having to clean up. It is a difficult process not just physically but financially as well. A lot of them telling me that they were worried about how much all of this is going to cost. So, they're hoping to be able to get some of that government help, especially the federal aid but it's unclear if they're going to get that. They're going to be here cleaning for a very long time.

Now the U.S. has made it very clear that they see that managing migration needs to be a regional approach. And that includes the help of Mexico and Canada. So, the measures they're rolling out today reflect just that.One of them, for example, is a virtual portal that would allow migrants to apply for legal pathways to either of those countries, Mexico, Canada, or the United States, and see what they're eligible for. The other is a center in southern Mexico at Tapachula, that's a transit location where migrants pass through where they can also receive services and see what again, they may be eligible for it. The idea here is to make it more accessible for people to come to the United States, through legal means. Now, of course, it has to prove to be a viable option for migrants who as we know, are often fleeing very desperate conditions, and they're doing so urgently. And so that really is the challenge for the administration. And a senior administration official I talked to you conceded that and said this is an experiment, but it requires the help of all three countries. So, expect that to be a taut button topic as they meet today, as well as touching on other issues like economic development, trade, climate change, all of that expected to come up during the summit. And we will be hearing from all three leaders later this afternoon, Victor and Alisyn.",

They included materials about Beau Biden's funeral arrangements, condolence letters, reference material. In fact, that's why a personal lawyer to Biden was going through the material and cleaning it out so that it would remain confidential.My understanding is the lawyer is going through the boxes. He sees a manila envelope marked stamped on the front VP personal, which may explain how it -- how it got packed up. He opens it up. He sees classified, immediately closes the folder again, and calls for help. The Archives are informed that day, immediately. They come the next day to pick up the three or four boxes. And in those boxes -- my understanding is when the Archives come to the office, they sort of look around, do a -- do a cursory check, they identify three or four boxes that contain these 10 classified documents, as well as some unclassified documents that fall under the Presidential Records Act.",

      "sentences": "Sure, Victor. So, let's understand, first of all, how did we get here? Now, Joe Biden, of course, left office as vice president back in January of 2017. After that, he took a position with something called the Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania, it was mostly an honorary academic type of title. Now, he had an office in Washington, DC, which he left in 2019. Joe Biden left but his stuff stayed behind. And now, just two months ago, in November of this year, Joe Biden's attorneys were going through those documents and they found some of these classified documents.Now, there are some vital differences between the Biden documents and Donald Trump's documents, starting with the sheer number of documents. As Jamie just reported, 10 documents found in Biden's office, over 200 classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. Also, the classification level. Now, this is actually the same. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump's documents included documents at the highest level of classification, what we call SCI, Sensitive Compartmented Information. Now, this is what in a prosecutor's view is the single most important differentiator, knowledge and intent. Now, thus far, Joe Biden's people have denied that he knew anything about this. DOJ surely is going to investigate that. There's nothing to indicate to the country. Donald Trump has openly admitted that he knew he had these documents at Mar-a-Lago. He's offered up various other defenses. So, he clearly knew there was still a question about whether he had criminal intent. That's going to be crucial for prosecutors. And then finally there's compliance, as Jamie just said, as soon as Joe Biden's lawyers found this, they notified the Archives and turned over the classified documents. Of course, Donald Trump's team was much more resistant and put up -- and is now being investigated for potential obstruction of justice.",

He is actually a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney to investigate the Biden documents. And we just reported earlier today, that Lausch has already given his preliminary report to Merrick Garland, the Attorney General. Now, Garland really has two choices. He can say, I see nothing here, we're closing it down or he can say there may be something here let's launch a full-scale investigation. Of course, with respect to Trump's documents at Mar-a-Lago, Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, who is investigating both the Mar-a-Lago documents and Donald Trump's involvement in January 6.Jack Smith is going to make the initial recommendation about whether to indict or not.
