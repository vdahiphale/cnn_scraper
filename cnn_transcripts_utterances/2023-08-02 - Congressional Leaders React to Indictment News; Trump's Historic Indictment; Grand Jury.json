      "sentences": "Yes, and this reaction, this organized reaction, was part of a weeks' long effort as Trump's team knew that this indictment was looming. Republicans on Capitol Hill, at least in the House of Representatives, largely coming to Trump's defense and swiftly. You saw last night comments coming quickly from Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, Elise Stefanik, the GOP conference chairwoman, as well as Jim Jordan, who's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Stefanik calling it a dark day.But I would just remind people that there is a split between what we are seeing in the House of Representatives, where some of Trump's closest allies are, and what we are seeing in the U.S. Senate. We still have not gotten statements from Mitch McConnell or John Thune, the top Republicans in that chamber. And that's really not a coincidence. It is something that we have seen play out in previous indictments of former President Donald Trump. But I would just point out that Mitch McConnell has made it clear in the past how he felt about Trump's actions back on January 6th. If you remember, Donald Trump was impeached for his actions when it went to the Senate. Mitch McConnell voted to acquit him. But following that vote, here's what McConnell said on the floor in February 2021. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office as an ordinary citizen. Unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while he was in office. Didn't get away with anything yet. Yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune for being accountable by either one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For Republicans in the primary, you know, it's about how much they're going to address this or, frankly, run from it as an issue. And if Trump emerges as the Republican nominee, how much is this just a referendum on whether or not he should be able to pardon himself?TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, you have to sort of bifurcate the primary from the general election. In the primary, Trump has been pretty effective at telling his voters that this is something that's made me a victim. This is the weaponization of the Justice Department. And it's rallied support for him. And you haven't seen any other Republican candidate able to take on the president over these indictments, over the rule of law issue. Instead, they are siding with him on this idea of weaponization of the Justice Department. And for that reason his numbers are going up. But when you talk about the general election, you're going to see a number of independents who are not happy about January 6th, who remember what happened on January 6th and have turned away from Trump because of what he did on January 6th. And that issue had faded from the headlines for much of the last six months, much of the last year after the January 6th Committee finished up its report. But now that this indictment is back in the mix, it's going to be in the top of the agenda for this upcoming presidential campaign. And there's little Trump can do to win back independents over how he handled January 6th.",

But he's standing like Liz Cheney, who just won the Profiles in Courage Award for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Pence is standing up as a Republican who had the -- had the decency and loved his country enough to uphold our institutions.And Pence is somebody who's coming out of all this drama in good shape in history. And so, you know, they - you never know where you're going to find the person that stands up for democracy at the last minute. We remember during the Joe McCarthy era where the Army final came up and took McCarthy on. You had senators like Margaret Chase Smith taking McCarthy on. In this key moment, we had Vice President Pence do the right thing, take contemporary notes, share it with federal investigators, and let the chips fall where they may. And that's hard to do when you worked in close tandem with the boss, Donald Trump. His break and that line that will live forever is Trump telling Pence, you know, the problem with you basically, Mike, is you tell the truth. And I think that will be used in this case also. So, it's -- it's a big moment in American history right here. It's one of more to come. Atlanta is going to pop in a couple of weeks and you're seeing a former president of the United States, and the leader of the GOP besieged by legal troubles. BERMAN: Toluse, first of all, every time I hear your computer beep, I think \"The Washington Post\" is about to break something. So, if you are, tell us here first. That aside, our friend John Dickerson over at CBS wrote something really, I think, interesting, or provocative, overnight. He said at the first Republican debate Mike Pence's competitor should be asked if they believe what he did on January 6th was heroic. Then having recorded everyone's answer, ask if they would have done the same thing.",

And so there are a number -- actually a majority of Republican primary voters who believe that the election was stolen, who don't have a problem with what Trump did on January 6th and who, if you look at the polls, do not side with Mike Pence, do not think that Mike Pence did the right thing. His ability to raise money, his ability to get support in the polls as a former vice president has been limited, in part because he is on the opposite side of Trump. And I think a number of these Republican candidates realize that and they're going to stick with Trump versus Pence.",

So, she has subpoenaed people like Jen Jordan, who is a former Democratic state senators from Georgia, and who bore witness at the end of 2020 to Rudy Giuliani coming to the Georgia state capital with a bunch of other Trump allies and making this conspiracy-riddled presentation before Georgia state lawmakers in an attempt to try to subvert the 2020 election results. So, she got a subpoena, George Chiti (ph), an independent journalist in Atlanta who stumbled upon the fake electors who met in Georgia, also got a subpoena.And Jen Jordan was on \"CNN THIS MORNING\" earlier today and she was asked whether she had any concern about the fate of some of these unindicted co-conspirators we saw in the federal indictment and what might happen to them in Georgia. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEN JORDAN (D), FORMER GEORGIA STATE SENATOR: Trump never actually came to Georgia. You know, there were the phone calls. There were the overt actions with respect to any kind of conspiracy. But the people who were actually here, who made misrepresentations, who lied, right, to officials here in Georgia with the intent to overturn the election, they were Rudy Giuliani, they were John Eastman, they were Sidney Powell. So, all of the unindicted co-conspirators that y'all have been able to identify this -- thus far, right, were the folks who were actually -- they were like the soldiers that were sent into the battleground states to actually implement the plan. So, whether or not they get named at the federal level eventually, I have no doubt that with respect to the indictment here on the ground that they're definitely a target. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
