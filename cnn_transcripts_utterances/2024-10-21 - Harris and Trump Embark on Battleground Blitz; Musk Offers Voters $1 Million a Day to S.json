You've got 15 days to go, mind you. Plus, testing the limits. A million- dollar giveaway has experts questioning whether Elon Musk's MAGA stunt actually violates election law. And a reckless disregard for the truth. How the Central Park Five are trying to make Trump pay for comments he made in the last presidential debate.It has been no secret for months, and actually make it years at this point, that the race for the White House would come down to these seven states. If you thought you would have a little bit of clarity on who's got the edge just a few weeks away, sorry, not going to happen tonight. A new Washington Post poll shows no clear leader in all seven of these states. In fact, six are within three points. Harris holding a robust four-point advantage in Georgia. So, it all comes down to these next just two weeks for both candidates to try, try to close the deal. And naturally, Harris and Trump, they obviously know that, racking up frequent flyer miles, dotting those battleground states with campaign rallies. You got Trump in North Carolina, Harris in Pennsylvania, also Michigan and Wisconsin. Harris's strategy, enlisting Liz Cheney to convince Republicans and those who might be undecided to cast a ballot for her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What I don't understand, as a way to wrap this, is that Trump has been very similar in his approach, only more of it, only more extreme pushing the boundaries of communication. He's finished. He has gotten the votes he's going to get, and it may be enough. For her, there are still a few people that she can close the deal on. She's not going to close it by beating up on him. We already know where he stands. She's going to close it by focusing and saying to people, I'm not the same person I was, I've learned something over the last five years, I am -- you can trust me, you can have confidence in me and here's why, and this is exactly what I will do on day one, day 100, and day 1,000.

Right now, Donald Trump is getting 92% of the republican vote. That's actually higher than it was in 2016.So, we can have these narratives that Liz Cheney may play a role. We can have these narratives that Nikki can play a role. But the reality is that Trump is getting the largest share of the republican vote that he has ever received, and that's a direct result of his policies that he wants to implement, but also running against Harris, which has unified the Republican Party.",
