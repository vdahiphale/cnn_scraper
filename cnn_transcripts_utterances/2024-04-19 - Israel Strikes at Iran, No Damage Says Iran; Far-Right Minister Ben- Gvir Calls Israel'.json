Iranian officials say air defenses intercepted three drones fired towards an army base in central Iran. Israel isn't commenting, but a U.S. official says Israel carried up a attack. Iran's army chief reports no damage and state media is downplaying the incident and broadcasting scenes of calmed streets near the strikes. Now despite pointed warnings from Iranian leaders of a severe immediate response if Israel, of course, attacked inside Iran. I want to now -- we're now going to go to Paula Hancocks who's standing by for us in Beirut. She's going to give us an update on the latest. I mean, there's so many questions about whether infrastructure was damaged. Why Iran could be potentially downplaying what this attack meant inside its territory. What do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, most of what we know is from Iranian state media at this point. And the Iraniancommander in chief of the army, for example, speaking and saying that there were explosions in the early hours of the morning, but they were the air defense systems of Iran that were taking out three drones and this was nearby an army base. Now there are still many details that have to be confirmed, most notably we still don't have confirmation from Israel itself that it carried out this attack. We have heard that from a U.S. official saying that it was Israel that carried it out, also pointing out Israel had warned it shortly beforehand that this was going to happen. But the U.S. had not endorsed this plan in any way. So we also heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Blinken really trying to distance the U.S. from what has happened, not being drawn after being asked many times about this attack, basically saying that it is important to deescalate. It was important so all the foreign ministers of the G7 that there was this de-escalation given the fact that we have really seen tensions in this region escalate since the beginning of the month really. So what we have seen is an attack, an Israeli suspected attack on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, a retaliation then with that unprecedented launched of more than 300 drones and missiles against Iran last weekend and then just in the early hours of this morning what appears to be at this point a far smaller operation. Now we have heard from a U.S. official that they believed the Israeli response was going to be limited in scope. It would at face value at least appear to be the case that this was not a significantly large or damaging a strike. And what we're hearing from the Iranian side is there has been no damage. It is business as usual. You're seeing on state media images, street scenes of the areas where the air defense systems kicked into place and took those drones out to show at least a visual proof that this was not a significant strike. And I think that's the hope, Eleni, at this point is that is really to allow them to not retaliate because that's the concern, that this tit-for- tat retaliation does continue certainly between these two countries, which up until a couple of weeks ago had not carried out direct attacks on each other's territory. So it's very different to what we have been hearing from Iranian officials in recent days who have been quite vocal in saying that if Israel were to carry out another attack then they would have a very immediate response and it would be far stronger. We're not seeing that in the Iranian reaction to this attack at this point -- Eleni.",

If they are going to respond,then that could obviously change everything. So everything we are saying at this point does bear some pretty hefty caveats with it. And the fact that we don't know the exact details of what Israel was targeting, what possible damage there may have been on the ground. These are all details that we may or may not get clarity on in the hours ahead. But of course, even if there isn't this direct contacts and this direct attack between Israel and Iran, you can still expect to see this continuation of Iran's proxies engaging with Israel. For example, Hezbollah here in southern Lebanon. We have seen this week in particular a significant uptick in the amount of cross-border attacks and launches and strikes that have been happening -- Eleni.",

And clearly, while Israel appears to have achieved a kind of happy medium with this strike to avoid escalation, avoid escalating the situation further into an all-out war, it certainly fell short of the kind of overwhelming military strike that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have been pushing for. That being said, when you look at the Israeli public overall, an interesting poll came out earlier this week from Hebrew University that suggested that 74 percent of Israelis would not want Israel to strike inside of Iran in a way that would undermine its -- the support that it gets from its allies, namely the United States. And that really reflects the fact that this successful Israeli air defense operation over the weekend in cooperation with the United States and other regional allies really was viewed as quite a victory inside of Israel. And there was also a recognition that it was the power of those alliances, the power of that coalition, that allowed Israel to be as successful as it was. And so there is a sense inside of Israel that it would be better not to undermine the power of that coalition. And so as Israel carried out the strike with no public fanfare, no public acknowledgement from its military, from its government, what we are seeing in turn is that the United States and other G7 allies are now continuing to focus not on these overnight strikes, but rather on Iran's attack this past weekend, and on new efforts now that are being summoned to further isolate Iran, to hold Iran accountable as the Secretary of State Tony Blinken said earlier today -- Eleni.",

I mean, look, these negotiations haven't been abandoned altogether, but we heard the CIA director yesterday making comments abouthow disappointed he was to see Hamas' reaction to the latest counterproposal. And I think it's fair to say at this point that, you know, Israel has really quite substantively shifted its positions in these negotiations over the course of the last month. They started off with a red line in terms of allowing any Palestinians to go back to their homes in northern Gaza. They then move to a number of about 2,000 per day and they have significantly upped that number since, talking about allowing much more freedom of movement for Palestinians to go north than they initially were. But they also have offered more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for those 40 Israeli hostages, more Palestinian prisoners with significant sentences. And so it's clear that Israel was kind of trying to move closer to Hamas' position. Hamas meanwhile has really not even moved an inch. And in fact, rather than moving at all towards Israel's position, they have in fact gone backwards, talking not about 40 hostages, which has been the basis of these negotiations for months, but now talking about fewer than 20 hostages in exchange for that same period of time, demanding more Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for a smaller number of Israeli hostages. And so it seems clear that Hamas, from the perspective of Israeli officials, it seems clear to them that Hamas is not interested in a deal and therefore that once again puts Rafah, puts more military pressure back on the table as the only avenue the Israeli government officials see to getting those hostages back home.",

Whether they have the capacity to fly drones from inside of Iran or not is an interesting question. The Israelis have a tremendous capacity of striking inside of Iran and have assassinated numerous Iranian officials and nuclear scientists, et cetera. Far greater capacity than the Iranians do. But the fact that the Iranians are saying that this is coming from inside of Iran may be something they're saying in order to further reduce the pressure on themselves to take action against Israel, by saying that essentially this may not have been Israel directly.",

What is new in this entire situation is that the Iranians have the capacity to make Israel very wonderful. Yes, it's true a lot of those drones were shot down, but that's largely because the United States had the time to be involved because the Iranians had given the United States and Israel 72 hours' heads up. If they hadn't, and if the U.S. wasn't involved, that there would have likely been far more than the seven Scud missile that nevertheless did hit Israeli base.

It's made up of seven men and five women. We have an investment banker, we have two lawyers, a speech therapist, and it's really interesting, too, because there's a wide array of viewpoints about Donald Trump himself that these jurors expressed before they were sworn in. We have one juror who said that they don't like Trump's, quote, \"persona\" and they called him -- they said he seems selfish and self-serving. And yet another juror who was also sworn in yesterday, who said that they appreciated Trump's candor. And then there were several jurors that said that they didn't really feel a strong way about Trump one way or the other, but it's important to note that all of these jurors said that their feelings about Trump, whether his personal, feelings about him personally or about his politics would not impact their ability to render a fair and impartial verdict in this case. And that's what the lawyers and the judges in the judgments looking for today in the remaining five alternates that they're going to pick. As we've said, a few have already been dismissed. They are dealing with this group of 22 remaining potential jurors. These are leftover from yesterday's panel. There is another 96 -- a group of 96 potential jurors who are also sworn in and will be brought in later today if we need to go through more jurors. We go to this questionnaire again, but we'll see if we can fill out that remaining five without having to go to the next panel of 96. The process is the same as what we've seen play out as you mentioned. They are going through the questionnaire process right now asking the questions about whether or not they've ever attended a Trump rally, what are their personal views on Donald Trump, and trying to narrow down that group into about five more.",

As you know, I've been saying for a long while, this is rigged trial. It's coming from the White House. They have White House DOJ people in the trial, in the D.A.'s office representing the D.A. because he's probably not smart enough to represent himself. The guy got elected using Trump.

A lot of people are not going to be moving to New York. But this is a rigged case and this is a case that was put in very strongly because of politics.

But I think by the morning we will have been in a much better shape than we are today. We've had full resource (INAUDIBLE) which have been a problem in the past, and now clear. So a lot of the things we were struggling with are now actually back to normal.",

The infrastructure of the airport is fully functional, has been for the last couple of days. So there's no restrictions on the operation. The difficulty has been our airline partners trying to get crews, catering, fuel, all of the logistics associated in getting aircraft away, to the appropriate aircraft and getting passengers boarded and away. That's proved immensely challenging because of the resources we've had because of access to the airports.",

At the moment, our biggest concern is we've got aircraft and crews out of position distributed across different parts of the region and the world, and trying to get all of that logistical exercise back into its planned state is probably the biggest hurdle that our airline colleagues are facing. So making sure we can get aircraft and crews and catering and fueling and passengers and baggage all at the right place at the right time to ensure a timely departure and getting back to a normal schedule, I think that's the biggest hurdle that we're facing at the moment.",

Thank you.We're also watching Washington on this Friday where U.S. House lawmakers are getting their first chance to vote on a package of foreign aid bills that have deepened a rift within the Republican Party. Just before midnight Washington time, the Rules Committee advanced the bills with support from Democrats. So now the full House will vote on the rules. Speaker Mike Johnson, whose political future and frankly his job as speaker, is riding on this, says the House will likely vote on the bills themselves Saturday. CNN's Manu Raju is live this morning in Washington. So, Manu, boy, talk about tough to get here, but here we are. What is different in these bills that we have at this point? How do they differ from that aid package that had already been approved by the Senate?",

      "sentences": "Well, its different in some respects, but it's very similar in a lot. The overallprice tag is a, say, $95 billion. There's some aid to Ukraine that will be in a form of forgivable loan. There's also some other provisions as well, allowing the United States to seize frozen Russian assets and turn that into aid for Ukraine. There's also another -- there's a language in there that would essentially force the sale from the Chinese owned company ByteDance of TikTok. If not TikTok would be banned in U.S. app stores. And so those are some of the provisions, but overall, the idea is the same. And one thing that this does not include is border security provisions. Remember that have been a demand of Republicans and the speaker of the House for some time. The speaker calculated he simply did not have the votes to do that. And that is why he is facing this revolt on the right flank and potentially a threat to his speakership because of that decision not to include border security and frankly his decision to move ahead with this Ukraine aid. And some of those memories on the far-right don't want to spend another dime for Ukraine. Now this measure right now we're seeing a procedural vote happened on the floor of the House. That is expected to pass on a bipartisan majority. That is unusual. Typically these rules have gone along party lines. Democrats are in the minority would vote against it. Republicans who are the majority vote for it. But because of the divisions over this aid package, Democrats will need to come and such bail out the speaker of the House to push it over the finish line. That's what we expect to happen in this vote. And then tomorrow on final passage in the House with a bipartisan majority there as well. The question will be, if and when Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is trying to push for Mike Johnson's ouster, when does she call for that vote? She can do that anytime and that would happen within two legislative days. And what would Democrats do at that point? Because their support would be needed essentially to keep Mike Johnson in the speaker's chair. So a lot of questions, a lot riding on this vote, not to mention all the money in aid to Ukraine, into Israel, to Taiwan, that is expected to be approved by the House tomorrow and then over to the Senate after that -- Erica.",
