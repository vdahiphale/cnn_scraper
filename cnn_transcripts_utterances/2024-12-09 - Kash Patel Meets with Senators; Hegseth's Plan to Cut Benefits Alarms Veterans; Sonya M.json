His pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, is up on Capitol Hill meeting with Senator Joni Ernst. You can see him walking into the office right there. We're tracking all these developments. And keep you posted on anything that develops in the coming minutes.In the meantime, Pete Hegseth is also up on Capitol Hill this morning fighting to keep his hopes of becoming defense secretary alive. But his vocal support for shifting access to veterans' healthcare from the V.A. to private providers is raising red flags among veteran groups. It's a stance Hegseth and Trump's pick to head the V.A. both share. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, TRUMP'S DEFENSE SECRETARY PICK:  It's a typical swampy feedback loop, outside the box thinking of say providing private choice for veterans is a threat, complete threat to the American people. ecosystem around the government bureaucracy and the V.A. and the veterans groups. They exist to defend their territory. And they'll say, oh, it's for the betterment of the vets. Well, if vets are getting better treatment from non-conventional places, why aren't we exploring that? Well, the bureaucracy can't handle that. DOUG COLLINS, TRUMP'S VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY PICK:  We've got to get back to a system that puts those veterans' patients first. And if that means they want to go to their own doctors, then so be it. Let's quit thinking in the same bold and box. I've been there before, just like the congressman. And it's not about a metrics of money, it's about a metrics of effectiveness. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a very typical position by politicians in the veteran space. You probably noticed over the course of however long we've had television that is extremely popular for politicians to basically crap on the V.A. all the time. And don't get me wrong like the V.A. has problems, but they don't originate from the V.A. Where they originate from is Congress because we ask the wrong question when we create veterans benefits. The question we ask when we create veterans benefits is, are we doing everything we can to make sure that nobody gets access to this benefit who doesn't deserve it?And the reason that's the wrong question is because it begins with the assumption that there are veterans who don't deserve it. And that's how you get a byzantine system that is often too hard to navigate. So, when Pete Hegseth talks about veterans protecting the bureaucracy being the mission of the V.A. instead of serving veterans or Mr. Collins there says that, why aren't we doing everything possible to help the veterans by letting them go to private providers? One, there are instances already where you can go to private providers. But two, what that tells me is that those two gentlemen almost certainly have never used the V.A. for their services -- for their health care services. Because if they had, what they would know, that the reason we have an entire administration of health care just for veterans is because when you go to the V.A., as I do, you find that people who work with veterans all the time, there's a specialty to that so that the person who's working on your back is also looking for signs of say PTSD or they know that the reason your back hurts is because of the specific job you did in the military because they can look at your chart and they understand that in a way that a private provider doesn't. So, I think a lot of this is a function of two things. One, assuming that kicking the V.A. constantly without putting any sort of responsibility on Congress for the way they create the programs is OK. And two, I don't think either of these two have ever gone to the V.A. for their services.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, it's going to be a lot like when veterans try to go get care from the private system right now. It's a lot like when you try to go get private care, when I do. Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't work at all. But what I know is that it doesn't make sense to create a system that is motivated entirely by profits. Efficiency and profits are not actually synonymous. Here's the thing that almost none of your viewers probably know. Most of your viewers, understandably, probably think what most Americans think, which is if you served in uniform, if you raised your right hand and swore the oath, you can go to the V.A. for your healthcare services. That's not actually true. There is a huge percentage of people who fit that definition who are not considered veterans by the federal government. We actually need to broaden the sight aperture on who counts as a veteran, not shrink it. And what Hegseth and Collins are talking about is saying there are too many people who are eligible for the V.A.Well, you know what happens when you shrink the amount of people who are eligible for the V.A.? You increase veteran suicide and you increase veteran homelessness. We already don't have enough veterans who are eligible for the V.A. It should be very simple. If you serve this country, if you raised your right hand and swore the oath, you should be able to go to the V.A. for your healthcare services. What they're talking about doing is even beyond the idea of privatizing part of the V.A. What they're saying -- what Hegseth at least is saying is, you should only be able to go to the V.A. if you can prove that you have a service-connected disability. That means he wants to increase the amount of bureaucracy to check out those sort of claims, and it's going to keep a lot more people out of the system. It's going to make the system much more of a chutes and ladders sort of system. And that's not going to help anybody at all.",

There's all sorts of things they're not going to see. Like, you go in for a back problem, your doctor is not going to say, OK, what was your MOS? They're not going to look at your MOS and say, oh, I understand. You carried 50 pounds on your back on a regular basis. So, I think we should look at your L4 or L5. That's not going to happen for veterans, first of all.Second, you're going to have private insurance providers handling as contractors for the V.A. who are highly incentivized to say, you know, this kind of trauma doesn't fit these five definitions that we have for PTSD. And what you're going to end up with is an increase beyond the 22 a day that we see already. The most important statistic to know before we leave this segment, Jim, is this, is that the -- of the 22 veterans who take their own lives every day, out of that 22, 16, on average, are not connected to any veteran specific services of any kind at the time that happens. If you make it harder to access veteran specific services, you will increase that number by a lot.",
