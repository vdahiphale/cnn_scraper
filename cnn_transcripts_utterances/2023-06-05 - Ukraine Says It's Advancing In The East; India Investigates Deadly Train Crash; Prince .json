      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine says it's making some advancesin the east, and that is fueling speculation its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia may be underway. We'll get a live update from Kyiv for you. Then Indian authorities have began investigating what caused the deadly train crash which killed nearly 300 people. We have the very latest. Plus, Prince Harry is back in the U.K. preparing to give evidence in a major phone hacking trial. We'll bring you those details for you. But first tonight, after months of waiting for weapons, better weather as well as training, a long-awaited counteroffensive could be underway in eastern Ukraine. But if it's happening, the Ukrainians remain rather cagey. New video out of Donetsk region shows an intense battle near Bakhmut. The Russians say they have repelled a large-scale offensive in the region. Ukraine's military first said it didn't have information on a Donetsk offensive, an official later said operations are happening, but framed it part -- as part of Ukraine's larger defense efforts. And she said Russian talk of a counteroffensive is actually an effort by Moscow to divert attention from challenges it's facing around Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tells the \"Wall Street Journal\", his troops are ready for a counteroffensive. But he crucially didn't say a counteroffensive has begun, and his government has released this video signaling if it's something afoot, well, don't talk about it. It's a cryptic war, who know? We're also hearing reports of more attacks against Russia's Belgorod region. We'll have the very latest from our Fred Pleitgen who is in Kyiv for us. So, Fred, I think it's fair to say that we are starting to see ramping up of military activity on the frontlines. So, is this the beginning of a counteroffensive or is this Ukraine probing Russian defenses ahead of this expected counteroffensive. What are you hearing from officials?",

The Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom for Russialegion where they came out, they posted some videos, saying that they had prisoners of war or Russians that they had taken there who were Russian soldiers. Now, they said they wanted to give these Russians back to the Russian authorities. They called on the governor of that region to come to a certain point yesterday and collect those, even they wanted to talk to the governor as well. They said that didn't materialize, they were obviously very angry about all of that. But those groups very frankly are saying that they are operating on Russian territory. It's territory that's right next to the border with Ukraine, it's a small village, sort of on the route to the actual city of Belgorod. But of course, at the same time, again, for the Russians, that is very significant that something like that might be happening. And yesterday, the governor of the Belgorod region said that there was house combat going on in that village, that the Russian forces obviously needed to attend to. So right now, there is a lot of public pressure in that area. The governor has said over the past couple of days, that there are a lot of questions the local population there has for the Russian military. And you know, in a broader picture of all of this, you can't say often enough. Belgorod is one of the main military areas of the Russian federation. The area that we're talking about is only about 30 to 40 kilometers away from the actual city of Belgorod, where there are a lot of Russian military bases, and which was the main hub, one of the main hubs for the Russians to attack Ukraine at the beginning of last year.

Now, I want to take you to exclusive CNN reporting because multiple sources familiar with U.S. Intel say Ukraine has cultivated sabotage agents inside Russia and it's giving them drones to stage attacks. U.S. officials believe these pro-Ukrainian agents carried out the attack you see here that targeted, if you remember, the Kremlin, that was back in early May. Well, it is believed they launched the strike from within Russia instead of flying drones from Ukraine. Zachary Cohen is in Washington for more on what we are learning.

Now, the big picture, this is part of what is viewed by U.S. officials as an effort to take the war to Russia ahead of the expected counteroffensive. And look, these drones by all accounts, based on what our sources are telling us are Ukrainian-made. And so, that would avoid crossing a red line that U.S. officials have made clear that they don't want to see -- they don't want to see American-made weapons used to conduct strikes inside Russia. So -- but we are seeing that this network of agents inside Russia is receiving drones from Ukraine and carrying out at least, one attack as you pointed out on May or in May, on their drone that crashed into the Kremlin. it's unclear if these network is behind other attacks that we've seen recently pop-up.

Now, there's a well-established smuggling network at theUkrainian-Russian border, our sources pointed to that as a potential way to move parts, drone parts across the border from Ukraine into Russia, and then allowing these agents to, you know, put the drones together after they get into Russia. Now, another possibility that European officials cited is that, look, the border between Russia and Ukraine is very vast and very hard to control. And this is a very peripheral area of Russia too. So, you know, there are some potentially mutual interests in helping move these parts or moving these drones from Ukraine into Russia. As far as who is controlling these agents, that also remains unclear. It's not -- you know, there are elements of Ukrainian military and intelligence apparatus that are known to support conducting attacks inside Russia, and have been very vocal about that. And we spoke to one spokesperson from the Ukrainian security services who made clear that we can expect to see more attacks like this inside Russia going forward.",

But it appears that there's some distinct coordination going on between the frontline and the Ukrainian forces, as well as insurgent forces or what we would call the territorials behind the enemy lines, behind Russian lines. And even some forces you might call freedom fighters under whatever name you want to call them going on inside of Russia.

These are things that haveproven that Russia does not have complete control of the border. You were asking earlier about how did they get these drone -- drones into Russia, where they could attack behind enemy lines. If you don't have control of the border, you can certainly move that kind of equipment through through smuggling rings, and even through trucks that are driven through with these pieces of equipment hidden. So when you're talking about an insertion of forces into a Russian ohblast Of Belgorod, it tells me that Russia is not defending their border really well. It causes a requirement for their military and their government to say, what should we move there? And how do we counter these kinds of operations? And whenever they do that, they're usually moving forces from other places on the front line. And you can bet that Ukraine's intelligence is watching the movement of Russian forces, and in fact, trying to force that movement so they can find holes in the Russian lines that they can send offensive operations through.",

Of course, former president Donald Trump refused to say any of that at the CNN town hall, and also on Social Security, an Entitlement Program. She's trying to show fiscal conservatives that she's on their side, if you will. So I think by trying to draw those distinctions, she clearly, though, is trying to go through Ron DeSantis to get to Donald Trump, if you can follow that logic there. It's a bit of a puzzle here in this big of a field. But it was interesting that she decided to start throwing a few punches. Of course, as this field gets bigger, you have to do that to stand out.",

But I remember many races here over the years where frontrunners have been humbled in Iowa and challengers have been elevated. We think back to 2008, for example, Barack Obama was behind Hillary Clinton for most of the year before the presidential primary. But it was that victory in Iowa that propelled him to a win. So it certainly is possible. So, she has some work to do, there's no doubt. But she does stand apart. She's the only woman in the race there. And I think her comments on that, I was in the room last night, they certainly were well received. So, you know, this race begins in Iowa in about six or seven months time.

It's a few miles away from us in terrain like this, which is very steep and jagged. You can see the Cotton Mountain behind me here. That's the kind of terrain that they've had to navigate just to get to the crash site. So they're there at the site right now. They're looking for possibly a black box that has a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder in it. However, a plane like this, this jet was not required to have a black box in it so they may not find that there. We did talk to first responders at the scene who took several hours to get to the wreckage last night. These are the first people to arrive at the scene. It took come hours of, again, going through terrain like this behind me. Some of them almost got injured just getting there. They found human remains. They found several parts of wreckage strewn all over the place. And they said that other than maybe four or five pieces of recognizable wreckage, most of it was \"not bigger than your arm.\" One of us told -- one of them told us. So they all -- and they also said that there was a crater in the order that this plane left.
