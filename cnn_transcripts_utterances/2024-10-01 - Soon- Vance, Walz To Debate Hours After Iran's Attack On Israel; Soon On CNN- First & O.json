The candidates will take the stage in less than two hours, and Iran's attack is certainly to be a key line of questioning that's only adding to the pressure on Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as they take part in what could be the most important vice presidential debate in modern American political history. Vance and Walz are tasked with delivering closing arguments for their running mates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, since there are currently no plans for another presidential debate. What the VP nominee say tonight could potentially make a real difference in this razor close race for the White House with election day only five weeks away. Our political team is here to set the stage for the vice presidential debate that you will see live on CNN and our correspondents are standing by in the Middle East to give us the very latest on the aftermath of that Iranian attack. First up this hour, the dangerous escalation in the Middle East as Iran launched an unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles into Israel. Let's go straight to CNN's Jim Sciutto, who is joining us now from Tel Aviv. Jim, the Israeli prime minister is vowing revenge",

      "sentences": "That's right, and initially both U.S. and Israeli officials described this attack, this Iranian attack as unsuccessful, that it had been defeated by Israel. And while that's largely true in the aftermath as a damage assessment begins, we are beginning to see that some missiles struck, they struck the ground either close to their targets or even hit their targets. It does not appear they drew a great deal of damage at this point. But, first, we can show some video here from are coming around and Israeli airbase to the east of -- to the east of where we are here in Tel Aviv.And in that video you can see that some of these missiles struck the ground. What you're seeing here actually these are in and around Tel Aviv. We do also have pictures from an airbase nearby. It is not clear whether there was significant damage to the airbase, but at least those missiles getting close to close to there. There were also images that were seeing from just north of where our position is in central Tel Aviv where a strike gets within, it appears no kilometer of the headquarters of Mossad. That's the strike you're seeing right there. Mossad, of course, Israel's international so intelligence services. In fact, we saw this strike from our vantage point as it happened. And I saw quite a large explosion from the roof of the hotel where we are right now when it struck, it is not clear what the damage is, and around there, but again, it shows just how close these missiles came to what appeared be their targets. Our understanding is that the three of the main targets were two Israeli airfield fields, and one -- and the Mossad headquarters. Now, in addition to that, as we were here in central Tel Aviv, we saw dozens and dozens of missile intercepts over the city, just over our heads, in fact, as they were happening and as those Iranian missiles were struck, pieces of either the missiles themselves or the interceptors fell in and around us here in Tel Aviv. So the truth is, Jake, even with a success its full intercept, there's debris that falls to the ground, sometimes a great velocity, and with the capability of doing damage.",

I can't stand Donald Trump, I think he's a jerk, but my life was better under him. I might have liked his policies better. If J.D. Vance can show up tonight and give a final touch to Trump policies. Put a little more detail on, then Trump has been capable of articulating that could be a win, but this is a man with huge unfavorabilities to overcome one of the lowest unfavorability rankings of a modern vice president right now.

Right now, essentially a tie for the Electoral College, 225 votes strong or likely for the vice president, 219 strong or likely for Donald Trump. You see the seven battleground states in yellow plus Nebraska's second congressional district. Let's just take a quick look at the state of the race right here. First, the national poll of polls. Let me stretch this out. Forgive me for turning my back. If you average the five last reputable national polls 50 to 47, which means no clear leader. That's within the margin of error in a national poll. So, no clear leader heading to five weeks. You've heard me for years. We don't pick presidents in national polls, we pick them state by state. So we look at the battleground states here, and let's pop this up and take a look. Wisconsin, no clear leader Michigan, no clear leader. Pennsylvania, no clear leader. North Carolina, no clear leader. Georgia, no clear leader. We don't have enough polls to have an average out in Arizona and Nevada, but there have been individual polls out there recently, Anderson that show no clear leader. Maybe Donald Trump up a little bit in Arizona. So that's where we are. So can the vice presidential candidates impact that a race, that is closer than 2020? And I would argue even closer than 2016.",

Also joining us, CNN analyst Barak Ravid. He's a political and foreign policy reporter at \"Axios\". General Hertling, let me start with you. So many, if not most of these missiles from Iran were intercepted but how unprecedented and dangerous is a barrage of ballistic missiles such as this, at least theoretically. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, if you can take 180 plus -- 180 plus missiles, shoot them into an area and have most of them shot down, Jake. It is tribute to the Israeli Defense Forces, but its also an indicator of how important Iran sees this attack to be. When you're talking about only ballistic missiles, they are much more difficult to be intercepted than some of the cruise missiles and the drones that they sent during the April attack on Israel. So, you know, Israel has probably used the David's sling and the Arrow missile system does shoot them down. This is not within the capability of an Iron Dome. Those are usually used for rockets and artillery shells. So Israel has spent a lot of money tonight in shooting down those 180 missiles. In addition to the 180, what you're seeing whenever you have an air defense system, its usually going to shoot more missiles at the targets, the incoming cruise ballistic missiles, than it would the number of missiles. So in other words, what I'm saying, in some cases you have to shoot two or even three missiles to get a target hit on an incoming ballistic missiles. So they're very good in terms of defending the area. The other thing that I just saw, Jeremy report was it was -- it was aimed at the Mossad headquarters. I think that was in retaliation for the beeper in the walkie-talkie attacks that were conducted over a week ago.",

BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, Jake, Hezbollah wanted the Iran to get involved in this war already, ten bit more than ten days ago after the pager attack and after the walkie- talkie attack, and after Israel started launching attacks against Hezbollah's long-range missiles, Hezbollah went to the Iranians and told him we need your help and they really and sort of told them, well, you know, maybe next week, this week are new president is in New York and U.N. General Assembly, it's not a good time. And we saw that what happened was a few days later, Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel. And I think that this is what pushed the Iranians over the edge and basically in this internal discussion within the Iranian leadership, you know, gave more influence to the hardliners, the IRGC see that said -- that told the supreme leader, we need to retaliate against Israel.",

But the real issue here for J.D. Vance as he takes the stage, as this has to be an opportunity. One of the only opportunities he has to prove that he was the right pick to be the vice presidential nominee. He has had a rocky rollout. Polling shows that he is underwater when it comes to public opinion. And one of the reasons that Donald Trump chose J.D. Vance was because he was good at debating. He watched him in 2022.

TOM NIDES, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, listen, Anderson, it's -- it's quite serious, but I think we need to also step back and put this in perspective. We're about a few days away from one-year anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in Israel's history, 1,400 Jews got killed that day, and still 50 or 60 Israelis and Arabs are also sitting in tunnels in Gaza. I mean, I thought these hostage families every day, and they're waiting for them to come out. In the same time, over the last year, Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in the north. Every single day and 100,000 Israelis had to leave the north to go to Tel Aviv. That said today's rocket barrage was sort of a disaster for Iran to some extent because not only because the United States support of the state of Israel and Israel's ability to knock these out of the sky. And so I think from -- from Iran's perspective, it certainly wasn't a great day for them and for Israel.
