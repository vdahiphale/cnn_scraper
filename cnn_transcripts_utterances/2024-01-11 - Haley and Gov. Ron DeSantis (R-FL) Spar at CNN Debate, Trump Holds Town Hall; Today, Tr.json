That lawyer represents you, speaks on your behalf. You don't get to go back and forth between whether you want to be pro se, meaning representing yourself or having counsel president represent you. So, typically, a judge would not consider this. You wouldn't have the opportunity to say, I've had lawyers the entire time, but now I have things I need to get out. In fact, most judges, if a client stood up or defendant stood up, would tell you to sit right back down. Your lawyer speaks, not you.",

I think there have been concerns about so called muzzling the president, impacting his First Amendment rights, the gag orders. I think those concerns are probably influenced the judge's decision here to allow him to potentially speak. What the judge did was give very reasonable restrictions. Closing arguments are about commenting on the material relevant facts and evidence, applying the law to those facts, and making an argument about how the fact finder here, the judge, should interpret all that together. That's what the judge said the former president had to do. What he couldn't do was get up there, give a campaign speech attacking the judge, attacking the judge's wife, attacking the law clerk. And I think the fact that not only did the former president not abide by the deadlines but chose not to come, I think, shows you that what the former president wanted to do was a campaign speech and not a closing argument.",

      "sentences": "Well, the short answer is the future of the Trump organization. I mean, the entire ability of the Trump Org to continue doing business is what's at stake here.So, just to set the stage, this is a civil lawsuit brought by the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, against the Trump Organization and various individuals, including Donald Trump. The allegation is that Trump and his organization vastly inflated the values of their properties, their assets, in order to get loans that they maybe wouldn't otherwise have gotten, or perhaps at better interest rates. Now, important to know, the judge has already found on one of the causes of action, one of the claims here in favor of the attorney general and against Donald Trump. That was something the judge decided before the trial. The judge said, just based on the filings I have before me, I'm ruling in favor of the A.G. There are still six other causes of action relating to submitting false documents and that kind of thing, and what the attorney general is now asking for is $370 million in what we call discouragement, meaning we're taking away ill gotten gains and most importantly cancelation of the Trump Organization's business certificate, which you need to do, do business in the state. So, when Trump's lawyers, maybe Trump, but I agree, I think probably just his lawyers get up, they're arguing for the future of the business.",

When you look at this case and other similar cases involving fraud, it's hard to find another example where the New York State A.G. has asked for the corporate death penalty on a company like this, in scenarios like this. There's other scenarios where you've had fraud, where victims, innocent victims, were essentially stolen from, and still this wasn't sought. So, there's a legit look.The Washington Post ran, I think, a compelling editorial a few months ago arguing that the remedy sought here was overkill.",

I mean, because the judge is well-steeped in these facts here, I suspect that he's already been drafting his opinion. I mean, he knows what he's going to do here. These closing arguments are going to be in a sense less impactful because the judge is a fact finder. He doesn't need as much of the lawyers to put together the arguments for him the way you would if you had a traditional jury. So, I suspect he's already drafting opinion and we'll see it come out in the next few weeks.",
