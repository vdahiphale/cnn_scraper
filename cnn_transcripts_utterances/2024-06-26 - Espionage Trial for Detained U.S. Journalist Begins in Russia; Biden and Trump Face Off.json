But now that this case has advanced to the point of this trial, which I'm tempted to put in air quotes, because this is less a legal proceeding than a kind of political show trial conducted for other motives, but nonetheless, the real emotion is one that that of hoping that Evan can make his way home soon. And in the meantime, continues to be strong and in good spirits and in good health, which amazingly, after a year and a half in Russian custody, he seems to have maintained.",

You're right in noting that he had been held in Lefortovo prison in Moscow, which is known as the kind of house prison or the detention facility under the control of the FSB, Russia's main security agency. And Lefortovo is known for its difficult conditions in terms of isolation, sensory deprivation in terms of not really being exposed to other people or outside. And it's a very tightly controlled environment.He's been moved to Yekaterinburg, the site of his trial that is now ongoing to a detention facility there. It's all so new that we don't really know much about this new facility in Yekaterinburg. But at the end of the day, you know, as I mentioned in my remarks a minute ago, wherever Evan's being held, whatever Russian jail or detention facility has custody over Evan, it's a place where he shouldn't be because these charges against him are false and he's being held as a hostage and such, he should be released. So I hope that the conditions in Yekaterinburg are no worse and that perhaps even Evan finds some relief, psychological, if not physical, but we don't know much more beyond that.",

How concerned are you about transparency as this process unfolds, as you described it, a trial in air quotes? YAFFAThat allows the judge, the prosecutors, the FSB to conduct the trial in secret without having to reveal this evidence or open themselves up to any scrutiny or criticism. So in that sense, I'm not surprised. It is, of course, worrying and it only deepens the outrage that our friend is not only being held hostage, but he's being held hostage without his hostage takers really having to explain themselves. And I find that very frustrating and angering. But like I said, not surprising because I know, and all of Evan's friends, colleagues know, that there really isn't anything to these charges. And so to expose them to the kind of daylight, the kind of investigation that Evan himself, as a professional journalist, carries out, I think they know that that wouldn't reflect well on them. And so since they have total control over this process, easier just to make it secret.",

You can't have one good line that that can take away four years of the countervailing narrative on the other side of the aisle.When Reagan had that line slip up or when they thought he did in the first debate, they had that line prepared for him in the second debate. But there really wasn't everyone out there talking about how he had been slipping as much as we've heard about Biden. So how Biden counters that is he shows a lot of energy and he answers the questions on point. That's all he has to do. And then that narrative goes away.",

I think Donald Trump's two problems in these debates are that he, unfortunately, he lies excessively. Daniel Dale from CNN called his second debate, the one he was on in last year, an avalanche or four years ago, an avalanche of lies.So he has to calm down on the hyperbole and the lies. And like you said, he's got to be more calming. One of the things Trump likes to do is use humor. But without an audience there, humor can backfire. And so if he starts to use humor that's a little bit more satirical in nature or a little mean in nature without an audience that they're laughing, it can come across as rude. And unfortunately, that's something that he'll need to work on is the interrupting and the rude.",

But the muted microphone can certainly work as it did last time and help out. There will be some things we miss, obviously, because the mics are on or off, etc.My worry is that one of the two debaters will figure out, oh, my mic's muted, but I can still talk. And what happens, I've watched tons of public debates where the person speaking gets interrupted by someone on the other side, their opponent, etc. And while we in the audience, in the TV audience, we can't hear the opponent, we see the person speaking begin to stumble and flummox over their words. And if Trump decides he wants to continue interrupting Biden, it might give an impression that Biden is stumbling and can't give through a speech because we can't hear Trump or see him interrupting.",

They go out there, it's their enjoyment, it's their peace to go out there and torture these sharks and drag them around by the face with a big hook in it. They also make a living off that as well.As opposed to the conservationists and people like us on Shark Week that love these sharks, that see how important they are, want to protect them. And also the fact that these sharks, after a study, have been designated as more valuable alive than dead, like 10, 20 times more valuable just through ecotourism. And so these animals have a right to exist in our oceans. And the thing that a lot of people don't understand, especially these fishermen, these sharks are hugely migratory species. So they don't belong to one state. They don't even belong to one country. Some of these sharks traveled from Australia to Hawaii, from Florida to the Bahamas.

The bipartisan game was first played in 2009.Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz organized the game after her breast cancer diagnosis. She did that along with her former Republican colleague, Joanne Emerson, and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Susan Collins. All proceeds from the event benefit the Young Survival Coalition to help young women who are diagnosed with breast cancer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): We all come together, the members come together against our common adversary, the female press corps, but our real common adversary is fighting breast cancer. When we're recruiting women candidates to run for Congress, one of the first questions is, have you played softball? SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): And Shelley Moore Capito and I have been friends, certainly because of softball. And so we work really well together on the Senate floor. I love it too, because I get to meet House members, both Dems and Republicans. We get a lot of things done on a bicameral basis. It really helps us as legislators. But more than that, we've become friends. SEN. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R-WV): But I think it's a good night. We see the gathering crowds. There's more and more people. There's more families. It's a realization that we all play together against the press, but also that we're fighting for something bigger than all the rest of us. And that's obviously young survivors of cancer.
