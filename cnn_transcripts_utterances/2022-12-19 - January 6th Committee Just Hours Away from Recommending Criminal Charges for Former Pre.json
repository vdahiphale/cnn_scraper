A state of emergency at the southern U.S. border with a surge of migrants waiting for Trump-era rules to expire in the next 48 hours.And Argentina on top of the world as fans get ready to greet the World Cup winners when they get back home today. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans. We begin with the House January 6th Committee set to wrap up its work after a nearly 18-month investigation into the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. The panel meets in public one last time today. They're expected to recommend multiple criminal charges against former President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  This is someone who tried to interfere with a joint session, even inciting a mob to attack the Capitol. If that's not criminal, then I don't know what is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The house committee investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol is set to hold its final public hearing on Monday. A source tells CNN that they are expected to refer former President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution on at least three charges.Those include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Now, these referrals don't necessarily carry a ton of weight with the Justice Department. DOJ does not take its cue from lawmakers on who it is going to bring criminal charges against, on who it is going to prosecute.   But lawmakers have said they think this is important for the historical record. Also in talking to some of them, they believe that they found evidence of criminal wrong doing, and that it is part of their duty to la that evidence out and to lay these referrals out to the Department of Justice. Now, all of this comes at a sort of politically and legally perilous time for former President Trump. You know, we know he's already under DOJ scrutiny for activities around January 6th, efforts to subvert the 2020 election. We're also learning from sources familiar with the matter, that a special grand jury that has been investigating Donald Trump and his allies in a criminal investigation there is set to wrap up its work. And it will be up to the district attorney there to decide whether she's going to bring charges against Donald Trump or any of his allies. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

JOE MANCHIN (D-WV):  The president needs to use every bit of power he has as an executive to find a way or ask for an extension. The president can basically -- I think ask for that extension, I think his administration is doing that or will do that. I sure hope they do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was a huge moment of collective elation and just sheer collective joy. You can probably see just behind me, you know, this is one of the -- this is probably the biggest avenue of Buenos Aires. It's a big seven- lanes avenue, and yesterday, it was filled from south to north with hundreds of thousands of people wearing their shirt and simply just sheer joy and pure celebration for these national football team, and of course, for one man, Lionel Andres Messi, 35 years old, finally conquering the only trophy that was still missing from his cabinet.

And it can be proved in many different ways.Doesn't have to be a conspiracy, like seditious conspiracy. It can be acts undertaken during the course of the insurrection, to aid and abet or to encourage them or even inaction like failing to call up the National Guard as a means of facilitating the ongoing insurrection.

You missed out if you weren't watching last night.It's -- the superlatives are free-flowing. It was insane. It was staggering. It was emotional edge-of-the-seat kind of stuff, and that was as a neutral. You can only imagine what it was like for those invested in either Argentina or France, for the players who were taking part. And yes, FIFA is saying it's the best World Cup final ever. But for me, what is always a great indicator is how other sports people, the greatest in their field react to a moment like that. They are the people who know what it's like to perform under that pressure on the biggest stage. You've had the likes of Serena Williams, LeBron James, Usain Bolt, Roger Federer all absolutely giving their applause and celebrating that moment for sports. It was billed as Kylian Mbappe against Lionel Messi, as you said it, rightly delivered. It was advantage Argentina, France pulling back, the momentum going back to Argentina, then France again, then the penalties and ultimately Lionel Messi crowned at last as a World Cup winner.
