A trooper telling CNN -- quote -- \"There has a confirmed sighting tonight and that is still being investigated further.\" We've got a live report coming up.Plus, the legal challenge is coming fast and furious tonight as Donald Trump's team is battling the criminal charges against him on multiple fronts. In Washington, he wants the federal judge, one Tanya Chutkan, to recuse herself from the 2020 election subversion case, the one that's brought, of course, by special counsel Jack Smith, and he's arguing the public will not accept the outcome of the case if she doesn't recuse herself. Hmm. Meanwhile, in Georgia, he's also asking a court to dismiss several criminal charges against him in that election interference case. And let's not forget, tomorrow is the deadline for one Fani Willis to explain how all 19 cases there would possibly or could possibly be tried together. That's \"Tomorrow's News Tonight.\" Plus, what is the strategy of those 19 defendants behind the scenes in the Georgia RICO case? And are they getting a little bit of a preview of the government's case? I'll tell you all about it. And listen to what Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told Anderson Cooper tonight. We've got much more to come, everyone, on all of that. But I want to begin with all the fast-moving developments tonight in their criminal cases against Donald Trump. Joining me now, former Trump White House lawyer James Shultz and former Georgia prosecutor Chris Timmons. I'm glad to see you both here, gentlemen. Let me begin with you here, Jim, because Trump's lawyers are honing in on this comment that was made by Judge Chutkan in a case of a rioter from January 6th. Does that argument stand out? Listen, the filing says this: The people who mobbed that Capitol were there in fealty, in loyalty, to one man -- not to the Constitution. It's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this very day. People who exhorted you and encouraged you and rallied you to go and take an action and to fight have not been charged. I wonder when you think about that statement there and what she is saying. Are you seeing that as a cause to justify the request from Trump's team to have her recuse herself because, frankly, Jim, a lot of judges on this very docket have had to grapple with and preside over cases involving January 6th defendants. Is it enough to recuse her?",

And I think they're going put it in context, right? I think they're going put it in context in the way that -- in such a way that these comments were made in response to claims that were made by folks who were being sentenced in those cases. And they deserve the response, and she made an appropriate response. And I think that's how it's going to be -- that's how it is going to be portrayed by Jack Smith's team on it.

He's arguing there that the state's case is deficient. He's also saying that he wants maybe to move to federal court. We're going see a lot of these motions first of all.

But I think if I were the judge in this particular case, knowing that I'm going to have to tie up my courtroom for probably nine months to a year, just trying one trial, looking at that times two, and then thinking about the thousands of other cases that are going to be held up or at least a thousand cases are going to be held up while those cases are pending, that's going to be problematic.

I mean, you've got other cases that Fani Willis has tried, one involving school officials and administrators, one involving a rapper and those who were alleged to be a part of a criminal enterprise as well.Not unheard of to have multiple defendants. They might whittle down, obviously, to a smaller number by the time it actually goes to a trial. And right now, as Chris said, it's only two. But I'm wondering what impact you think the idea of the appellate process will have, because you remember, last week at the hearing, Judge McAfee said, look, are we sort of kicking the can down the road? Are we prolonging the inevitable here? Because people are going to want to appeal. And as one says, let me have my turn, maybe it's theirs next, and we'll wait and see.",

We're probably two years out from any real trial on this thing, other than the folks who have, you know, availed themselves of the speedy trial provisions. And you're going to see motion practice after motion practice.As it relates to the Meadows matter, I do think there's a good chance that the circuit court may try to ask for expedited briefing on that because they're going to want to address that issue, take it up, and either overturn it or send it back down so that they can do what they need to do at the state court level.",

The briefing will be very important to figure out whether to convince the judges can all be done logistically. But the real question in Georgia everyone is wondering is, okay, say Fani Willis's team comes back and convinces the judge, look, I've got it all covered, I can logistically do this case of 19 people at once, look at this lovely yearbook photo we have right here of all these different people, assuming they all go forward with trial, if they're able to convince the judge of that, does the fact that two have already asked for their speedy trial and have an October 23rd date, me and the other 17 could actually also have to go on that date?",

He has confirmed there has been another sighting of Danelo Cavalcante tonight.Trooper McKee was not able to provide more details, but I can tell you that within the last two hours, my team and I saw and moved through some visibly ramped up areas of -- ramped up police presence. That was in the area of East Nantmeal township. And that was the area where Danelo Cavalcante, according to local residents and police, ditched a van that he had stolen. He ditched that van late Saturday. He had stolen it earlier on Saturday from a dairy farm. That very area where he ditched that van behind a barn is the area that we're talking about, where we saw a ramped-up police presence a short time ago. We can also tell you that the Pennsylvania State Police just moments ago issued a series of reverse 911 calls to all the residents in that area. I'm going to read you the contents of this reverse 911 call. Stand by here, calling it up. This is from Pennsylvania State Police that says -- it says the Pennsylvania State Police are receiving reports of escaped convict, Danelo Cavalcante, in the area of Ridge Road, Coventryville Road, and Daisy Point Road in South Coventry Township, possibly armed with a weapon. Residents in the area are asked to lock all external doors and windows, secure vehicles, and remain indoors. Please review your surveillance cameras and contact police. If you observe anything suspicious, if you see this individual, do not approach him, call 911. Very significant there, Laura, because they are saying that Danelo Cavalcante possibly has a weapon. Up until this point, the police have not confirmed that he has a weapon. We have asked them repeatedly over the last week, do you have any indication that he has a weapon? They have said, no, we do not have any indication. This is significant. Not only a sighting, but that he possibly has a weapon on him, and it's in the area where he allegedly ditched that van on Saturday night. This is the second confirmed -- well, basically the third confirmed sighting of him in the last 48 hours. On Saturday night, he was captured on two ring doorbell cameras that are connected to former work associates of his. Police say he went to those residents on Saturday evening seeking help. He did not get it. He did converse with someone over the ring door, you know, the audio speaker there in Portuguese asking for help. That person was not able to help him and the other person that he tried to get help from was not home. So, three confirmed sightings in the last 48 hours, this one tonight, and now a reverse 911 call to local residents saying that he possibly has a weapon. That's pretty significant, Laura.",

I mean, he is engaged in a non-stop hunt for resources, right? He cannot stay where he is. He's got to get away. And to do that, he needs transportation, he needs food, he needs shelter and clothing periodically. And so, he is constantly, 24 hours a day, on the hunt for those items.He improved the situation over the weekend by changing his appearance. He changed his clothes. He acquired some transportation, but seems like he ran out of gas with that van. And now, he has been in the same area for at least 24 hours, which tells us that he has not acquired new transportation. If he has armed himself with either a gun or a knife or any other sort of weapon, that elevates the concern in law enforcement significantly because his next interaction with a citizen, whose home maybe he approaches in an effort to kind of get those things that he needs, could turn violent. We know this is a person who has used violence before, he has killed twice before, and he desperately does not want to go back to prison. So, they're looking in the right places, but the desperation is elevated.",

The fact that law enforcement is pushing into this area with all their assets that are available, you have canine, you have air assets who have infrared moving into the area, pushing in really hard at this point, you're going to get him running backwards on his feet. And, as Andrew stated, this point can get really dangerous because if he is armed, there is no reason why he won't go all out into a house and create a barricade situation, which then causes a situation where civilians may get caught in a crossfire.",

Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police told us today that the people who owned that van left the keys in it. So, he took advantage of an opportunity there. He stole the van. He had it for several hours before he ditched it. They did say that there were indications that he was running out of gas and that he parked behind a barn.That's significant because we drove out to that barn. We went live from that barn earlier this evening. It seems like a very random and remote place for him to have driven, especially so far away from the area where he was previously -- where they had a search perimeter previously in the area of Longwood Gardens. That's about roughly 20 miles away from there, also about 20 miles away from the prison itself. It's a long way to drive. It is a long, again, series of meandering, kind of random country roads out there. The fact that he chose that place to ditch the van, it could have been that he ran out of gas. It also could have been that there was another reason for him to ditch the van there. But if indeed he has been sighted in that area, you know, the suspicions that we had that maybe he got another vehicle, which again they have not said that he has. Maybe that's unfounded, maybe he did go off on foot, and maybe he's still in that area. It's also very, very dark out there. You know, if anyone has seen him as we've been told there's been a confirmed sighting, that's pretty extraordinary. It is pitch black in that area.",

But you have to wonder if he really is under the impression that attorneys general are waiting for instruction from the president of the United States. They're not. Yes, they are political appointees to serve the pleasure of the President, but it doesn't make them puppets.But look, sarcastic or not, he is suggesting that President Biden has somehow directed Merrick Garland to pursue indictments against the Republican frontrunner, not because he's guilty of a crime, but to simply hurt his political chances and figure something out. And don't forget that a president actually cannot and should not put his thumb on the scale. And don't forget that the Department of Justice is actually a lot more than Merrick Garland or Jack Smith. There are more than 115,000 employees across 40 separate components. You got the criminal division, the civil division, the antitrust division, the civil rights division, the national security division, the tax division, the DEA is under the umbrella, the FBI, the ATF, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, even Interpol. And I only scratched the surface just now. So, if you think that the Department of Justice's work comes down to two federal indictments against a former president, you've really got another thing coming. You have to wonder why the person asking to be the head of the executive branch over that whole org chart and asking to be the president again, by the way, doesn't already understand that. But then again, maybe he's just being sarcastic. We'll talk about all this once again with Andrew McCabe, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former deputy director of the FBI. Andrew, look, you were a former FBI deputy director. I have to say, how alarmed are you to hear a former president and, by the way, a current GOP frontrunner float the idea of sham prosecutions that are retaliatory and on the campaign trail?",

So, I -- you know, the one thing I disagree with you on, Laura, is I don't think he's being sarcastic at all. I think Donald Trump has always been incredibly artful about hiding his true meaning or giving himself a way out of what he's saying by saying it in a way that he could always later say, oh, well, I was only joking. I don't think he's kidding at all. I think what he's saying is exactly what he intends to do if he becomes president, and that is to use the department and its resources and its people to seek retribution against those people who he feels have injured him in some way.

And you still must do it correctly. And the DOJ, as you know, is involved in hundreds, if not thousands, of cases every single month. They don't grab any headlines, but certainly matter to people's safety.
