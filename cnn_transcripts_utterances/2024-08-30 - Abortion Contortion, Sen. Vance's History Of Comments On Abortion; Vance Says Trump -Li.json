What he said, and what voters could make of it, keeping them honest.Also tonight, that vulgar post he spread online about sex acts, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton. His running mate was asked about it and how he tried to explain it is causing fresh uproar. Later, all we're learning about the tragic killing of a star hockey player and his brother by a suspected drunk driver the very night before their sister's wedding. Good evening. Jim Sciutto here, sitting in for Anderson. The former president will be speaking tonight at the Moms for Liberty Convention here in Washington. That is the right-wing group which got its start pushing to restrict sex education topics in schools and banning books on gender and sexuality from school libraries. We begin though, keeping them honest with the knot the former president has just tied himself into over abortion. Not for the first time either, and potentially not without electoral consequences. It involves Florida, one of 10 states with abortion measures on the ballot this November, Donald Trump is, you may remember a Florida voter. Yesterday, he was asked about the state's proposed ballot measure on a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion until fetal viability, roughly 24 weeks. The amendment would make the states new six-week ban unconstitutional. And here's what Florida voter Donald Trump said about how he'd vote.

S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What's really astounding is that Donald Trump has had eight years to figure out an abortion policy, including specifics. And I have written a version of this column. I think for the past eight years, over and over and over again, that Trump simply doesn't know or care what his abortion policy is, the flip-flops and the absolute aversion to laying out specifics what he would want and when and how. Apparently it's driving pro-life conservatives crazy and I think what it's leading a lot of other women, moderates, and independent women, women in swing states to believe, is that you just can't trust what he's saying. They don't believe him when he says, I'm going to be great for women's reproductive rights or I'm not going to vote for an abortion ban. They don't believe him.

That means that this is an all-out ban. Its extreme. We've seen how these bans have been impacting women's health all over the country.

When you are going and using racism or misogyny as political currency the way that he does, you have to call that out by name and you have to say, look, I see what Donald Trump is doing by saying I just turned black.

One, the judge could say, we'll do it on the papers, meaning both parties, you give me detailed briefs. You tell me what you think the evidence is and why you think it should be in or out.
