When was this -- what was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?

About a third of Kenya's budget is stolen by officials in government and so they feel slighted that President Ruto did not listen to them by reappointing half of the cabinet which he swore in today. They had called for this mother of all protests, but police made sure it didn't happen by violently dispersing people from the streets, as we saw the use of flashbangs and tear gas and shooting in the air whenever three or four people came together.

In the same truck you see moves ahead of us, parks then, then directly aims at us. And we were not even the only journalists targeted today. A lot of other media colleagues complained about police throwing tear gas at them, targeting them with flashbangs, shooting in the air very close to them. These are all dangerous at close range. This can cause a lot of -- a lot of hurt or even sometimes can lead to death. So CNN has reached out to the police to understand exactly what happened here if journalists were targeted. We have not heard back yet, but this is actually extraordinary. Because just a week ago, Kenyan journalists went on the streets to protest against police brutality against targeting of journalists, and yet, even after police promised to make sure that peaceful protesters protest and that they respect the media and the freedom to do our job, they don't appear to be following that.",

But they also have raised that the discrimination within the job and the lack of opportunity in the economy, which is basically a result of the longstanding corruption of the previous regime.

It's things that are inspirational, things that are outreach inducing or things that are funny. And what the Harris campaign has done an excellent job of leaning into is making sure that they're creating funny content and building a joyful movement. I think people are so tired of the past eight years of, you know, living under this shadow of Donald Trump and the existential kind of just dread that he brings and the anger and hatred that he brings. And what the Harris-Walz ticket is doing is bringing a lot of that joy back and showing people like, hey, you know, it is OK to laugh. It is OK to -- for us to have fun. We have to work hard, but we're building a joyful movement to bring joy back to our country and not let people like Donald Trump dictate what it means to be a man, what it means to be an American because what it means to be an American is to -- like Governor Walz says, mind your own damn business and let people have their freedom. Because the Republicans, they go out there and talk constantly about how they want freedom so much. But what freedom looks like to me is kids being able to survive their math class. What freedom looks like to me is being able to make a decision between your doctor and yourself and not have a Republican member of Congress get into that exam room. And what it looks like to me is letting teachers teach and not being freaking out around stuff that is simply not happening in a lot of these classrooms and trying to dictate what these kids can and cannot read. Ultimately, you know, we are America. We have a complicated history. We have a great history. We are a great country, but we have obviously had many flaws along the way. And we need to have a holistic understanding and educational system to address that past so that we can move forward to create a more perfect union.

At one point, some streets were near -- were under nearly four feet or 120 centimeters of water. And scientists say these kinds of outbursts are happening more often because of climate change.

The folks most susceptible to this actually are in the Himalayas. There's some 8,000 glaciers that are sort of dripping time bombs in Pakistan. You know, you have entire communities built high in the mountains below these glacial lakes. Well, the most vivid American example is the capital of Alaska. Juneau is built below the Mendenhall Glacier. And about 15 years ago, I went to do a story on a photographer, James Balog, who had set up time-lapse cameras around the Mendenhall because he was trying to get people's attention that these massive mountains of ice are melting at staggering rates and receding up these valleys. Well, you don't need time-lapse photography. This time around, city manager thankfully said there's no injuries reported, but they had people showing up dripping wet, freezing cold in the middle of the night in emergency shelters because this lake up near the Mendenhall just released all at once and came right into the city there as well. As we say, this is becoming more and more common around the world. This happened last year in Juneau. You might remember a sort of a viral clip of a house just disintegrating into a flowing river. That was a result of a gloth outburst last year up around there as well. So this is again one of those things, thankfully, that didn't cost any life or injury, but is a vivid reminder that the world we live on now is we built for something else. We did not build for a world where these permanent ice glaciers would melt with such rapid intensification there that threatens the communities, the cities that live below them as well. But thankfully, things are OK there now, but, you know, not for the folks. You could say it's cold comfort for the folks who now have to deal with flooding in their home, no injuries there.
