Welcome to CNN PRIMETIME. This is just the beginning, on Monday, the very first big hearing in Georgia's election interference case will get started. Mark Meadows, his first stop, he'll try to convince a judge to move his case into federal court, arguing that he was must doing his job as then- President Trump's Chief of Staff. And it could be a preview of what this whole trial might look like. Plus, the country singer who dethroned Taylor Swift on the charts with the boost from conservatives, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, his song, Rich Men North Of Richmond was even playing at this week's debate, as we were just discussing, but there is more to this story than you may think. And Bronny James, the older son of NBA super star LeBron James, is now expected to make a full recovery after suffering a cardiac arrest last month. That stemmed, we now have learned, from a congenital heart defect. Now, a family spokesman says he'll return to basketball in the very near future and we'll have much more on his condition tonight. But, first, I want to begin with the latest moves in that Georgia election case. Here with me in studio, CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider and former January 6th Committee Investigative Counsel Marcus Childress. Jess, I want to start with you. The Meadows hearing that is expected on Monday could be a big moment for this case that could set the course of what we might see going forward. What are we expecting exactly?",

That's what the evidentiary hearing will be on Monday. We're also seeing the argument from Jeffrey Clark from the Justice Department and also most recently today, three of these fake electors who basically said Donald Trump made me do it, I was acting in accordance with what he wanted, therefore, this should be removed as well. So, this going to be a lengthy hearing. We already know that Fani Willis has issued several subpoenas that includes to two of the people who were on this call, January 2nd, that now infamous call from Donald Trump to Brad Raffensperger. So, the subpoenas are for these two people who were on the call in addition to the former chief investigator at the secretary of state's office.

But there's a distinction between official duties or acting under official authority and doing things that you happen to do just because you're president or chief of staff or anything else. So, I think it's a weak argument. But it is one that could appeal, and for the particular kind of removal we're talking about, I think it's in Trump's interest and therefore probably some of the other defendants to get the case removed because if Fani Willis, the prosecutor, doesn't like the outcome, my recollection is she's got -- that's an appealable order and she could take it up, or if Trump loses, he could take it up and thereby delaying the start of the case, at least with respect to Trump.",

I think you just have to look at this on two tracks. In the context of the Republican nomination fight, Trump has clearly been successful in convincing most Republican voters to see all of these indictments the way he wants them to see it, as an attack on them through him, and I think, in many ways, he's connected this to his core message from the outset in 2015 to his supporters that he is the real victims of bias in a diversifying America are people like you, whites, Christians and conservatives.So, within the context of a Republican primary, it's possible all of this activity could eventually grind down his support, but I thought the most important moment by far in that debate was when six of the eight candidates raised their hands and said they would vote for him even if he is convicted. The message they're sending to Republican voters is if this is not disqualifying for us, why should it be disqualifying for you? But I would say, finally, that while all this is true in the Republican context, there are lots of yellow lights on the dashboard about what this might mean in a general election with majorities of Independents consistently saying, including two-to-one, in one poll this week, that he should not serve as president again if he is convicted of a crime.",

I mean, look, there are a lot of flashing lights not just from a political perspective but also from a legal perspective.Temidayo, when I look at this, I see Trump trying to basically have a 4-0 record on four separate cases, two of them in state jurisdictions. That seems pretty risky to me. I mean, is there a strategy here that would say maybe try to get one of these cases off his plate, settle in some way on something that carries a lesser penalty so that there isn't a huge risk that he might lose on one of them and face real consequences? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER JAN. 6 COMMITTEE LAWYER:  I think that would be too risky, frankly. I think if I'm President Trump here, the goal will be delay, delay, delay. I think that's exactly what he's going to do. He's going to find any way to take these cases out of this next calendar year and to push it after the election. I think that's his strongest angel here. Frankly, I think the case in New York, I would expect that that's going to get pushed. I think the hush money case, even D.A. Bragg has suggested he's willing to move that later, that case is the most -- I think is the least important of the four. I think Judge Cannon seems not quite inclined to move these forward and I think that documents case, even though it is the most streamlined case, also may have issues. Because if the judge isn't not ready to push the case, that case is not going to go. But I do think Jack Smith's case and D.C. is the most likely case and I think we can look forward to Monday and we'll see the judge -- the date that Judge Chutkan sets. And she sets a date which I expect is going to be closer to Jack Smith's date, perhaps on January, but February or March.

So, all of that, Abby, is keeping the horse race polls quite close, most of them, between Trump and Biden. But underneath those numbers, the general election reaction to Trump, I think, should be worrying the Republicans in that we consistently see a majority of Independents saying he did commit a crime, a majority saying his actions after the election threatened American democracy, the majority saying he should not be president again if he is convicted of a crime. And, you know, as you point out, he is the one who finished 7 million votes short. And several things have happened since then. January 6th has happened. The Supreme Court has overturned Roe. And now we have the four unprecedented indictments. And whether any of that allows him to expand his coalition, particularly in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, the states that will decide the winner in all likelihood in 2024, that is highly questionable.",

This talk of how Washington doesn't serve anyone, and it's a lot of politicians and fat cats not doing the work of the people. Well, that seemed to come likely mostly from Vivek Ramaswamy.

If you look at Republican voters, they who were asked in a Washington Post poll, they say that Ramaswamy was right up there with Ron DeSantis as one of the winners of this debate.

DeSantis has been given this, what seems like a finite period of time, to say, I can do this. I can step up and be Trump. Well, Ramaswamy to me is trying to be Trump 2.0 in a way that he could never achieve.Now, a few of these comments he's made I think are extremely disqualifying and show everybody, Nikki Haley most of all, who I think gave this performance that really appealed to the general population saying, we all have one thing in common. We want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris out of the White House. And Vivek Ramaswamy is missing the mark on that. He's going straight in to get MAGA. And then he's going to say, I'm going to come to the center and grab those moderates, too. Oh, and then, hey, everything else I'm saying is going to be palatable to you by then.

In Bronny's age group, 18 years old, the overwhelmingly most likely diagnosis remains something called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a congenital thickening of the heart muscle with also sort of an abnormal architecture of the heart muscle that predisposes the heart to a potentially devastating heart rhythm, which apparently Bronny had last month when he collapsed during the game.Other possibilities include anomalies of the coronary arteries. Years ago, a famous ball player named Pistol Pete Maravich died a few years after retiring from the NBA. And it turns out he had a single coronary artery, an unusual abnormality. And these kinds of things can be found in young athletes who have these kinds of arrests. We don't know which particular disorder he has, but it's encouraging that the family believes that there is a treatment that... not only will help him return to a basketball, but which will prevent a subsequent event from occurring.",

I mean, there are pretty high hopes for Bronny from his father, perhaps most of all.RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST, \"HEADLINERS\" WITH RACHEL NICHOLS ON SHOWTIME: Yeah, I mean look, the good thing is they've identified this, they clearly know how to treat it, and people who have been around sports for a long time know congenital heart defects do not stop athletes from playing sports. In fact, there's some very famous instances of it. Snowboarder Sean White has a congenital heart defect. U.S. soccer player, world champion Lauren Holliday had a congenital heart defect. There's a lot of players who have overcome this, so it's perfectly reasonable for LeBron, for Bronny, for the entire family to expect that he will get back to the court. I have to mention also Tedy Brusci who has won three super bowls with the New England Patriots, also a congenital heart defect and that's a much more physical sport than basketball even. So we have seen time after time example of this. The thing also that he can do is look to his own teammate. This is bizarre but exactly almost a year to the day that Bronny James collapsed, a year earlier, one of his teammates at USC had collapsed from a cardiac arrest and in fact came back to play in the middle of last season. I do want to tell you this, tough. I think because Bronny has been thinking about basketball, and I can tell you he personally loves basketball, I think it is great news for him and his family that he is able to come back and play. But I will say that this is not a kid who needs to play basketball. Obviously, he will have a terrific life if he never steps on the court again. And he has a family that feels very strongly about the fact that if he was in any kind of serious danger, they would never let him pick up a basketball again.

If he requires open heart surgery, then it might be, you know, much later in the season or next season.So, the devil isn't in the details. I think the positive message is that they understand what happened to Bronny. And that's key. You can't treat something that you haven't identified. And they feel they have a good treatment plan going forward. They've discussed who they've met with, and they met with some of the best people in the country.
