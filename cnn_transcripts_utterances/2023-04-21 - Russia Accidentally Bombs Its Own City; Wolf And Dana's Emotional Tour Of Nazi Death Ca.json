The high court is up against the deadline tonight and a ruling could come at any time. And we'll also take you inside Auschwitz, where Dana Bash and I took a very emotional and deeply personal tour of the Nazi death camp, including the spot where I believe two of my grandparents were murdered.

Residents of the city of Belgorod close to the border with Ukraine waking up to damaged buildings and destroyed road. The culprit, Russia itself. Moscow saying one of its aircraft accidentally struck the city. CCTV footage shows a first impact as the bomb penetrates the ground, moments later, a large explosion. Residents feeling lucky it wasn't worse. Thank God there are no dead, the Belgorod governor says.

He joined the armed forces on the first day of the war.And when CNN visited last July, he had long left for the front, like many of the dancers there. Those that stayed behind, like Kateryna Kalchenko braving the stage to give Odessa a sense of normalcy, dancing in defiance, but very much still struggling. I want the whole world to stop this horror so that innocent people and children stopped dying, Kateryna says. I ask for help and for people not to remain silent. Its silence is how they began rehearsals this Friday amid tears one minute of silence for one of their own. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And yesterday, the NATO secretary general came to Kyiv and pledged that Ukraine is part of NATO's future.

They've now backed that up several months because they found out a different way to use an older version of the Abrams tank that they have a little bit more available to them, getting them refurbished in a quicker timeframe.So, I think there's still working on that basic timeframe here, certainly by the end of this year. But the training will take some time as well. This is a very sophisticated, advanced tank. It's going to take a little bit of time for them to learn it, and not only to learn how to operate and fire it, use it on the field of battle, but to maintain it, to sustain it.

It doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to get that. But I do think when you talk to White House officials. They made clear a couple of things, Wolf. One, the president's age was an issue in 2020, and he won. And if the president's age was an issue going into 2024, take a look at what he's accomplished in his first two-plus years. Perhaps the experience that he's had, the decades in Washington, has been a large reason for that. I don't think anybody's going to run away from the reality that the president is 80 years old, would be 86 by the end of the second term, but they definitely don't believe that it's the deciding factor for a lot of voters.

This is not expected to reveal any sort of final disposition on the case. But, of course, it raises a lot of questions about exactly what is happening with that criminal investigation.As you may remember, last summer, CNN reported that prosecutors had sort of whittled the charges down to a few possible tax crimes and a possible false statements charge related to the purchase of a gun. There have been no public developments in the case since then. So, it'll be interesting to see what we learn in this meeting. But we have definitely seen, Wolf, Hunter Biden's legal team becoming a lot more aggressive and forward-leaning, especially since Republicans took over the House. We've seen them become more litigious, suing people like, for example, former Trump Adviser Garrett Ziegler, who they accused of harassing the Biden legal team, also the owner of a computer repair shop, accusing him of mishandling and improperly sharing information on Hunter Biden's laptop.

So, it will continue to be status quo for Mifepristone and the way it's administered while the appeals process plays out in the Fifth Circuit.This is something we've -- you know, this is the third time the Supreme Court has issued something related to this case. It took a little longer. We're expecting something perhaps on Wednesday, and here we are Friday night. And we're now seeing that the reason it took a little bit longer than expected is because there was a dissent from this from Justice Clarence Thomas and then also a dissent from Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Alito did write about four pages of dissent saying why he would have let those restrictions go into effect, why a stay, he believed, wasn't warranted. But the takeaway here is that, you know, this will help the FDA. The FDA had warned of chaos and confusion if the stay had not been continued, if the stay had not been granted by the Supreme Court. So, now, things will remain as it's been for the past weeks and months and years as this case continues to play out in the lower courts. Because the lower court here, the Fifth Circuit, has really fast-tracked this appeal. They have set a very fast briefing schedule. Oral arguments will be in less than a month on May 17th. So, the underlying issue in this case as to whether the FDA went through the proper procedures to grant approval for Mifepristone, that case will play out while everything else is on hold. So, it will be status quo for this drug until the Fifth Circuit, I'm sorry, can we hear these arguments and then make a decision. But, Wolf, it is very likely that this is not the last time the Supreme Court will weigh in on this after the arguments play out and are decided in the Fifth Circuit. It is very likely that either party, the party that loses, will appeal this to the Supreme Court. But for now, a win for the Biden administration and all things stay status quo, meaning women can continue to access this abortion pill, as they have previously. Wolf?",

And if they had gone in any other direction here, it would have been backtracking on their promise of states being able to do what they wanted.And one thing I would stress here is the lower court judges who acted in this case were really out on the outer limits here. They were going beyond what the Supreme Court had had said back in June. Judge Kacsmaryk, who heard the case originally in Amarillo, Texas, had really imposed his own moral and policy decisions here. I mean, he acknowledged that he was second guessing the FDA and he used language that certainly showed where he stood relative to abortion rights straightly against them. And then the regional appellate court that had affirmed a portion of that decision had also shown that it was willing to engage in essentially a policy analysis by putting itself into the shoes of the FDA and its own scientific determinations. And the Supreme Court has pulled back. You know, again, as Jessica said, we don't know what will eventually happen when it results the merits of this case, but I think what we see now from the Supreme Court at this point is they are not going to try to extend kind of this aggressive anti-abortion movement against what states individually want to do and against a federal agency that approved this drug dating back to the year 2000 and has done its own scientific determinations about its safety and effectiveness.

And it is -- it has been shown for 20 years, 20 years to be safe, in fact fewer deadly side effects than penicillin, fewer than Viagra, and now they can keep using it.If this decision had on the other way, and they weren't allowed to give mifepristone, they would have given the other drugs that this is used with. It's called misoprostol. They would have had to have used that on its own, and that is an inferior treatment. So talking to doctors for the past two weeks, they said, why in the world what I want to give my patients and inferior treatment that I know is going to put them at a higher risk for having what could be potentially serious complications. I should be giving my patients the best treatment, treatment that's been studied in clinical trials and approved by the FDA.

And what the Supreme Court did, at least for the time being is allowed them to continue with it if they so choose that consistent argument that it is up to the states to deal with abortion, and it should not be a federal decision to just completely do away with this medication, which is Elizabeth just said has been proven time and time again for two decades to be quite safe, not just for abortion, but for other medical issues like dealing with women who have miscarriages.",

Choice number one is it could affirm Judge Kacsmaryk's ruling, but that decision would not have immediate effect because of this stay -- this stay will remain in place, no matter what the Fifth record does.Choice number two is that the Fifth Circuit actually read some tea leaves here and thinks the writing is on the wall. The Supreme Court is not going to ultimately side with Judge Kacsmaryk. And maybe that this could actually reverses Judge Kacsmaryk and says he was wrong at which the case might actually come back to the Supreme Court, with the challengers asking the Supreme Court to weigh in, and the Supreme Court might say no. So, Jessica is right that the total focus now shifts to the Fifth Circuit. The good news for all of us is that it won't in this kind of haphazard Friday night emergency posture because no matter what the Fifth Circuit does, this stay is going to remain in effect until the Supreme Court either takes up the case and decided on the merits or denies a petition for review from that Fifth Circuit ruling that's going to be a while from now.

And my guess is that's what we're likely to hear unless there are candidates and that we know there are actually say, with the exception of candidates who want this drug to be completely eradicated and that the FDA should not be able to approve it.I think given the real politics of what has happened across the country, particularly in swing states, Wisconsin a few weeks ago, is the most recent example of a Democrat winning in a judge race because there was so much focus on the issue of abortion. And that's one example of many examples of Democrats doing quite well because there are people out there are so riled up about the notion of Dobbs, never mind what we saw on what we're seeing with this mifepristone situation.",

And this was to get to Steve's point about how what we've been seeingof these haphazard random decisions on a Friday night, the decision to approve those two drugs 20 years ago was not random. It was not haphazard. It was done the way that it should be, which is by -- not by a judge, but by teams of scientists spending, you know, months or sometimes years, reviewing applications for drugs and looking at all the data and talking to scientists within the FDA scientists outside of the FDA advising them. That's the sort of procedural way that this kind of thing should be done rather than as Steve said, haphazardly, you know, let's use this drug let's not use this drug, and it's being done by judges, not by actual scientists.

You are criminally liable. Wolf, that seems inconsistent at least with what Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his Dobbs concurrence a year ago about the right to travel still allowing people to choose to leave their state, if the state restricts abortion access.

And the second thing he did say was the Supreme Court is not outlawing abortion nationwide, and I think what we're going to see is the Supreme Court itself, stepping back in several of these cases, it's ruled -- it ruled in a very big way in June, rolling back a half century of abortion rights, but I think now, it's going to wait and let the lower courts do what they're going to do and just take a pass, step back from the brink, so to speak.
