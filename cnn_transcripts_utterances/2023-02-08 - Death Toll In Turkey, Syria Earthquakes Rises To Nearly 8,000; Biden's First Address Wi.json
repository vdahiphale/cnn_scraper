In Syria, rescuers from the White Helmet Group say many who are trapped under debris and rubble in freezing temperatures will not survive for much longer and warns of a significant increase in the confirmed number of dead. Many residents in the vast quake zone in Turkey have described the pace of rescues as slow and the government response inadequate. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three month state of emergency in 10 provinces and ordered hotels in the tourist heart of Hatay to be opened rooms allocated for survivors whose homes have been destroyed. The earthquake has caused significant damage to a major road, leading to a crucial border crossing between Turkey and Syria. The crossing is the only humanitarian aid corridor approved by the UN between both countries, and the damage is slowing relief efforts. Meantime, countries across the world are working to get aid quickly to the affected areas. India said a second plane carrying relief and disaster response personnel that happened on Tuesday and the UK also pledging continued support. Here was Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

We have this video to show you. It is extremely dramatic. It shows what these rescue operations look like. Let's pull that up, please. There you're going to see a little girl, her name is Mariam, and her little brother Ilaaf, smaller than her. She's stroking her hair. And she is speaking to a volunteer rescue worker, a White Helmet member. She's begging him, Becky. She's pleading with this rescue worker to save him. She says, Please do anything you can to pull me and my brother out. I'll do anything for you. I'll be your servant. She's so desperate to get out. This is about 36 hours after the earthquake. You do see them. Those rescue workers are able, thankfully, to pull out Mariam and Ilaaf. Again, just a little girl that tiny boy crushed probably in their bed. There is very little help there. There is actually no help there at all currently, Becky. There is one access road, one humanitarian corridor that is established and agreed upon between Syria, Turkey. That road has been damaged by this earthquake. The UN says it's made it almost impossible to bring aid in. There are various UN organizations, Red Cross workers, aid workers trying to negotiate with the Syrian government. But already it seems that aid is being politicized divided by the civil conflict. That means for those people who are trapped under the rubble still, that means for the dead who are underneath their homes, Becky, there are very few options to pull them out. And for those families standing by that I know you see everywhere, just waiting for answers, wondering where their missing loved ones are, hoping authorities will give them some sign, some good sign in Syria, that hope is completely faded right now. At this point, Becky, no one really expecting that any help is coming and just trying to find shelter in this freezing cold.",

So it's common, it's expected what's the damage but not that sort of damage. What we expect after earthquakes are what we call is the heavy damage and partial collapse. But it's saddening to see so many buildings that failed in what we call the Pancake type of collapse that makes the rescue, of course, always very difficult. It's a widespread.

You know that every single North Korean expert around the world will be watching closely because these kind of military parades are not just showing what Kim Jong-un has achieved and what the Korean people's army has achieved, but also can sometimes give clues as to what he wants to achieve, so what his intentions are.So we will be watched very closely. Of course, if it does happen, we never know for sure if these military parades are going to happen until we actually see them or hear from North Korea itself. What we have heard, though, is that commercial satellite imagery has been seen by a number of international experts and think tanks that pour over this kind of satellite imagery. And they have seen practices ongoing. They have seen thousands of people in Kim Il-sung square, where these parades usually are, and they believe that this has been the practice for this kind of parade. And it is a significant anniversary. Any anniversary that has a zero or a five at the end is generally played up by Pyongyang. So this is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the country's military. And there's been a real military theme over the last couple of days. Today, this Wednesday, state run media published photos of Kim Jong- un, his wife and his daughter visiting military barracks of the KPA generals. Now, he thanked them. He also said he wants to see the strengthening of the military in a speech he gave. And it comes just a day after he had a meeting with key military leaders saying that he wants to see more drills, more combat operational training from his military and that they have to increase the war readiness. So we're really seeing this military theme very significantly over this anniversary. What we could see tonight, some local media has been speculating, is it could be a massive military parade. Often, in fact, the past four times, Pyongyang has held these parades in the middle of the night or 10:00 at night. So in darkness. And we could well know within hours if we are about to see exactly what Kim Jong-un wants us to see, what his military prowess is, what his ability is, and potentially what his intentions are.
