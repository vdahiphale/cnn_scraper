The 81-year-old is departing from a physical that is likely to be his last before November and re-election here in the United States with a lot of focus on the President's age, obviously the oldest sitting U.S. President. And so we will be watching and waiting for what we may hear from his physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. He'd previously issued a report on the President's health following previous physicals. We will bring you any information once we get that. Hello, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". And we begin with warning bells about the U.S. election. Senior Democrats in Washington say Joe Biden could be in real trouble. They are pointing to Tuesday's primary vote in Michigan, where more than 100,000 Democrats cast a protest vote of uncommitted to tell the President that they oppose his policy in the Israel-Hamas war. Now, in a swing state like Michigan, Mr. Biden will need to get as many of those voters back on his side to win the general election in the fall. Biden's campaign says he shares the view of those uncommitted voters that ending the violence in Gaza is a key goal. But Senate Democrats say the President needs to do more to keep his coalition intact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Stephen, we should note the Democratic primaryvoters have always had the option of marking their ballot uncommitted in the past. In 2012, Barack Obama suffered 20,000 defections on his own. But given the circumstances now and the narrow numbers that we see coming out of this swing state for Republicans and Democrats both, every vote counts, as we heard from those Democratic senators.

      "sentences": "That's right. But this is also a big number -- a hundred thousand. It's not something that can beignored by Democrats. This state, Michigan, could well be the state that decides the destiny of the White House. Donald Trump won it in 2016. Joe Biden won it in 2020. Each time, the margin was very narrow, and it looks like it's going to be very narrow. It doesn't mean that a hundred thousand people voted uncommitted, that these Democrats won't show up to vote for Joe Biden or that they'll prefer to vote for Donald Trump in November. But given the margin is likely to be very small, it doesn't take that many not to show up for Biden to be in real trouble. The caveat, of course, is that Trump has his own problems with his own coalition. Once again, 30 percent of the Republican vote voted for Nikki Haley. That's a lot of people who don't want Donald Trump to be their Republican nominee in a Republican primary. I think the one thing I would say for the Biden White House and the campaign is that this happened eight months before the general election. There is time for the President to try and mend some of these issues, for some outreach to the Arab-American progressive communities that have been particularly outraged by his support for Israel and Gaza. But these are serious issues, and I don't think they're actually confined to Michigan. I think we see them playing out in some other swing states, too.",

And the situation in Gaza, the deaths of more than 20,000 civilians, this is something that is deeply felt in a place like Michigan,where there is a huge Arab-American community, which normally votes overwhelmingly for the Democrats. It's the kind of moral issue that can make somebody a single-issue voter and that is, I think, a big danger for Biden. To your point about the Middle East and how it's all out of the President's control, right now, I think you could argue that the political interests of President Joe Biden in ending this war and those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in prolonging it are going in exactly the opposite direction. It's clear, even more so after last night, that it's a political imperative for the President, for the hostilities to end soon and the civilian carnage in Gaza to stop. There are a lot of people who think that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to keep the hostilities going just because of his own powerless political position in his coalition, his far-right coalition and in his cabinet, and to forestall the possibility of an election that he could lose. So, you have quite a fascinating political dynamic playing out between two characters, President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, who have sparred with one another. And at the beginning of this conflict, Biden literally flew across to Israel and embraced Netanyahu and Israel after the Hamas attacks in October, it seems their political interests are diverging quite sharply right now.",

That is according to the Ministry of Health there. Israel's response has been overwhelming and sustained across the Gaza Strip. Most of the enclave's 2.2 million people have been displaced, much of the infrastructure destroyed. The U.N. says over half a million people there are, quote, one step away from famine. And yet the leadership of Hamas remains at large. And the Israeli Prime Minister's office says today that there are 99 living hostages still being held captive somewhere in Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas sending mixed signals about an imminent hostage deal that would result in a longer term ceasefire, despite President Biden's unexpected announcement this week that a deal could happen as soon as Monday. Well, with communications blackouts and restrictions on journalists, it's difficult to get a real true picture of what's happening in Gaza. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and a team of CNN journalists decided to document in unprecedented detail one attack that killed more than half of the members of one family.

We tracked down seven survivors, gathered video, satellite imagery, Israeli military press releases. We verified social media content and spoke with ballistic and forensic experts, allowing us to piece together the events of a bloody night of death and horror amid intense and indiscriminate Israeli military fire that left civilians dead. We started by asking the IDF about the incident, giving them pictures and exact coordinates. The military said their troops had come under fire from that location on January 4th and responded with a quote precise strike to remove an imminent threat and cannot confirm if the bodies are linked to that strike. Our investigation raises serious questions about the IDF's actions that day. This is where it all unfolded. This is a wide area of Salahuddin Street. Before the war, it was an industrial zone. But as Israel designated Salahuddin the evacuation corridor out of northern Gaza, business owners allowed hundreds of displaced people to stay in these warehouses. All of a sudden, in early January, those families could hear war creeping closer. This was the scene filmed by a journalist in nearby Maghazi. The families decided they would leave when morning came, but it was Israeli forces who arrived first. Eyewitnesses say the warehouses on both sides of the road we recreated in this 3D model were repeatedly struck from the ground and air. Families sheltering in the warehouses on the left broke holes through back walls, escaping into the farmlands. For the warehouse on the right, there was no escape for most. They were surrounded. They say the Israelis shot at anyone who tried to walk out. SUMAYA ABU JIBBA, SURVIVOR OF ISRAELI ATTACK (through translator): My son, along with other relatives, started getting our belongings out the door. A bomb exploded. They struck him in the heart. He bled, ran, fell to the ground and died. Our relative and another guy were also killed. Everyone was screaming and calling for an ambulance. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Roba's mother, Sumaya, helplessly watched as her son Hamdi died in front of her eyes. But nothing could have prepared her for what would come next. ABU JIBBA (through translator): As we were calling for help, another bomb hit. We were all knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I found my children and relatives killed.

KARADSHEH (voice-over): She and her relative felt they had to get out of this shelter-turned-morgue. They decided to make a daring escape. They were questioned by soldiers about links to Hamas before making it to the relative safety of a local hospital. We cannot confirm the Israeli military's claim that their troops came under fire. And yet survivors we spoke to tell us there were no militants in the warehouses. Some witnesses say they heard what they called resistance fire. And local journalists that day reported clashes in the area. CNN found that the Israeli military has separately alleged there were Hamas weapons facilities nearby, but never linked them to the warehouse where the Abu Jibbas sheltered, which we've highlighted here on this IDF map. However it began, there's no doubt the Israeli military used ferocious firepower. The size of the bomb was by its nature indiscriminate. And survivors say they were not warned to leave by the military, as it claims it always tries to do. In response to extensive questions from CNN, the IDF claimed it told civilians to leave in the days before the deadly incident, but provided no evidence when asked. The first time the military publicly said this part of Gaza was no longer a safe evacuation route came in this post on X at 11:28 A.M. on January 4th, hours after the attack. ABU JIBBA (through translator): They knew we were civilians. Their drones saw everything. We had big white flags up. They said it's a safe area. The south is safe. We came to the south for nothing. They bombed us and killed our children in the south. KARADSHEH (voice-over): The events of that January day, only a small window into the vast undocumented suffering that the Israeli military has inflicted on civilians in Gaza, with tens of thousands already killed, leaving so many, like the Abu Jibba family, grieving, traumatized, with no recourse to justice and accountability.",

But, you know, it's interesting, as we are seeing members, both Democrat and Republican, who are sitting in on this interview, come out and talk to us as this interview is ongoing, they each have kind of a different message from what they have witnessed. Democrats point out that Hunter is just the latest in a string of Biden family members and business associates to say that Joe Biden was not involved in any of these business dealings, and they call this impeachment inquiry a waste of time and say it's time to wrap it up, especially with government funding being such an important issue. But Republicans are maintaining that they have a lot of questions that Hunter Biden has to answer for.

But no doubt this is a significant moment for the man who just turned 82 years old last week. He said that out of all of his contributions, he said, \"The end of my contributions are now closer than I would prefer,\" acknowledging that it's \"the end of an era and time for new leadership\". He was first elected to the Senate to represent the state of Kentucky in 1984. He then became the Senate Republican leader in 2006, then on to the Senate majority leader from 2015 to 2021 and has since been Senate minority leader. Clearly, Annie Grayer, I want to bring you into this conversation. There have been some concerns about McConnell's health over the past few years and some scares he's had, some tension, growing tension with President Trump at the time of his presidency. And they continue now, even as Trump is ready to send the nomination for Republican candidate once again, coming up with a funding bill that is just days away from a government shutdown.

There's been a lot of questions about his health and his ability to serve. And then there's also the Trump factor. Mitch McConnell has not spoken to Donald Trump since January 6th.

Just moments ago, Mitch McConnell announcing that he isstepping down as Republican leader, the longest serving Senate leader in U.S. history. I want to get back to Annie Grayer about the implications from this announcement. Annie, he turned 82 last week. As you noted, there had been concerns about his health. He said today that what sparked his decision was the tragic death of his sister-in-law. No one wants to question his intentions on the timing right now, but it was clear between his age, between his health and between growing divisions within the party and Donald Trump that it may not have been so much of a surprise that this is what we had today.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I think while it is still shocking because it is such a big moment for McConnell, who has been serving for so long and has been agiant in the Senate, I think there are many around Capitol Hill who saw this coming at some point, given his age, given his health issues, and of course, given his tense relationship with Donald Trump. McConnell and Donald Trump haven't spoken since January 6, 2021. That feels like eons ago. Certainly, it is years ago. And as Trump continues to be the leading candidate for President in the Republican primary, he has a very strong hold on the party, both nationally and on Capitol Hill. So, McConnell, who had consistently gone up against Trump, whether it was about government funding or aid for Ukraine or even just how he spoke about January 6th, these were big issues that kept coming up and kept undermining his leadership and his relationship with the rest of the Republican conference in the Senate, which is kind of split in terms of how its allegiance is to Donald Trump. So, now with McConnell stepping down as leader but not retiring, the next, of course, obvious and big question is who is going to take his place. There are a number of lawmakers who kind of have been waiting in the wings for years because McConnell's had such a stronghold on that leadership position. But now, I'm sure we're going to see a lot of jockeying in the coming days about who's going to fill that top spot for Senate Republicans.",

We can'tunderstate the significance of this moment with McConnell announcing that he would be stepping down as Senate leader there. And he will be there holding out until 2007, finishing his term. But if you can speak to the impact this has on, let's not talk about the Republican Party right now, but on the Biden administration, because despite their differences ideologically on a lot of policy issues, specifically as it pertains to foreign policy, they were more aligned.",

There are divisions about the direction of this party. It was notable that in the rather short speech that he gave, he said global leadership is essential. And once again, hearken back to the days of President Reagan, where he just started his career there in the Senate. We will see how President Biden responds. We have yet to hear from former President Trump. One would imagine this only emboldens his wing of the party. More coverage on this breaking news that Mitch McConnell will be stepping down as Republican leader there in the Senate. He will remain out and serve out his term until January of 2027, he said. Stephen Collinson, Annie Grayer, thank you.",
