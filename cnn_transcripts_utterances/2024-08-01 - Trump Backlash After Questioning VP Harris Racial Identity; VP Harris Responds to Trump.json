I mean, kind of, to Mike's point, this is what Trump does, right? He tries to be incendiary. He tries to draw the conversation back to him. And I think by -- you know, by not letting these kinds of things go unchallenged, but by not suddenly reorienting your entire message into like high outrage about this, they're not playing into his hands in there. And I think that's smart. And I think we're seeing from her, just generally, a sense of, you know, the kind of happy warrior sort of joy that I think is part of why she's connecting so directly with people right now, because people are so hungry for that.

She has less than a hundred days to introduce herself to the country, to make her argument about why she should be president. If she spends 50 percent of that time or 75 percent of that time responding to Donald Trump's antics, you will never have an opportunity to tell people why she should be president.We have to remember that a lot of what Trump is trying to do is to otherize her, like he did with Hillary Clinton, tried to talk about why she shouldn't be president, why people should be uncomfortable with the idea of having a woman president, having a black woman president, having someone that has South Asian heritage as president. And he's trying to remind people about that because we've never had it before. He's done it in the past. He even did it with President Obama and tried to question his qualifications for the presidency, saying things like, someone should look into, that's what he said yesterday. I think it's very clear that he's trying to appeal to the people that are uncomfortable with Kamala Harris as president, for a number of different reasons. And giving these dog whistles makes it easier for people like that to question their choice, question the enthusiasm around Harris. And so, she has to introduce herself without getting sidetracked by those kinds of arguments.",

There's failed, I'll call it Israel policy, because I like my three I, by the Biden-Harris administration.Talk about the failures of the previous administration and define the fact that -- you know, the vice president was a lightly regarded vice president. I don't mean that derisively, but she was not -- she has become the savior of the Democratic Party, I think, because she's not Joe Biden, not because she's Kamala Harris, and there's a big difference there. So, I think you can define her by painting her with the policy failures of the Biden-Harris administration. That's a better place to start than where the president has gone.

And these are distractions to a number of voters who are looking for someone to provide actual solutions. And so, it does open an opportunity for Kamala Harris to lay out her policy platform. She has not yet done an interview with someone and detailed her policy stances on some of the things that she said in 2020 and 2019 when she was running for the presidency and the difference between where she was then and where she is now. It doesn't give her an opportunity to lay out her policy platform on actual issues that people are thinking about. Not very many voters are going to be swayed about questions about her identity. And so, it does give her an opportunity to do that. We'll wait and see whether or not she takes that opportunity.",

And so, the fact that we're starting to see those numbers trend towards Kamala Harris, the enthusiasm, the energy trending towards Kamala Harris, it does really call into question some of the Trump campaign's strategy of trying to separate black men and women, trying to appeal to black men and peel off some of the votes that had gone to Joe Biden because there was less enthusiasm behind Joe Biden.
