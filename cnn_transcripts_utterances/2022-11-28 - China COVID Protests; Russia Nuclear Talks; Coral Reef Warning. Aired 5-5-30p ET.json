China's zero COVID policy is set to have created extensive disruptions and damage to the world's second largest economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAOQIANG SUN, AUSTRALIAN PROTESTER (through translator):  Thirty-three years ago, tanks were used to crack down on the citizens and the students, and then, after 33 years, the government is doing exactly the same thing and cracking down on citizens. And Chinese people should never forgive what the government did. We need to stand up and say no. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the first time during Xi Jinping's reign or rule that we see such widespread protests. What's the government's response been so far, what are we seeing from them right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly. This is unprecedented since Xi Jinping took rule a decade ago, in fact, the most widespread protests involving demands forpolitical change since the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Now, what is really telling is I was at that protest from Sunday night into Monday morning in Beijing. And they were crowds of people there. They were chanting for an end to COVID lockdowns for freedom. There were a lot of people gathered there. There was a heavy police presence but as far as what I witnessed, it was peaceful. Around 2:00 a.m., masses of police, they came in. They started to push us back, forcing us to disperse. Well, I drove back to that exact same spot in Beijing last night. It was eerily quiet. It was a giant row of police fans with their lights flashing parts in that area. It's hardly a person in the street at all. Ands that's a reminder when it comes to the responses is that this is a police state, where they have a far-reaching security, surveillance apparatus. The Internet is heavily surveilled. There is no communication platform like Facebook, or Twitter for people to easily mobilize and gather, the dominant messaging platform here is monitored by authorities. It's incredibly difficult for a movement like this to continue. Of course, this is a large country and Beijing is the capital, where there's always a heavy security presence. But the fact that from one day to the next, to have protesters in the street, and then absolute quiet with police cars -- well, that's telling.",

In some of the cities, using the protest not just be around an end to zero COVID lockdown. They're spilling over into other demands for broader reforms, for more freedom, for more democracy. The most embolden and defiant acts were in some of those protests in Shanghai when people were actually calling for Xi Jinping himself to step down, calling for the communist party to step down. Now, when I was speaking to the protesters in Beijing, it was interesting. There is disagreement among the people I was talking to. That mask-less man I spoke to, it speaks volumes that he was willing to speak to me without his face covered. That's extremely rare, in public to be speaking to foreign media, CNN in China. But interestingly, he told me, he said, I'm not looking for regime change. Xi Jinping and the CCP, they can stay in power. I just want them to hear my voice. There were other people at that protests I attended that started to shout for regime change. They started to shout for more political reforms. I heard some other protesters say, no, no, no, let's not go that far. Let's have them here are voices. Tell them that we want more freedoms. But they don't actually have to step down. So, this movement, like I said before, can't be this nationwide coordinated campaign, because of the ways censorship and surveillance works in China, and that voices, they are desperate.",

Sheis also a rights activist who has been jailed for her activism in the past, according to Iranian activists. On Wednesday, she was arrested according to her brother. And Iranian human rights activists who say that she was interested to serve 15 year sentence for what was an ongoing case that had been going on for a few months. We don't have the details of this case, but what we do know is that a couple days after her arrest, her brother posted this video online, a seven-plus minute video message in which Moradkhani slams the Iranian regime for oppressing its people. She also criticizes the international community and the United Nations saying that they were not doing enough to support the brave people of Iran. She said she was called on the free people of the world as she describes it, to push their government to cut ties with the Iranian regime that she describes as a murderous child-killing regime. She says international sanctions against Tehran were laughable, and she called against action right now she says, saying that the world watched back in 2019 as the regime crack down on protests. She said that shouldn't happen again, when hundreds of people are believed to have been killed within several days of that crackdown. She also likened her uncle to Mussolini, Hitler, Gadhafi, Saddam Hussein. And she called -- she ended her video message with the slogan of the protests, women, life, freedom, clearly supporting the ongoing movement in her country. While her position is not surprising, it's still considered very brave for someone to come out with this sort of statement while still inside Iran. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The island was hit with torrential rain during the weekend, triggering the landslide. Cars, roads, buildings collapsed and rushed away. The governor of the region says most of the homes were not up to proper building code, adding to the destruction. Australia's Great Barrier Reef must be listed as endangered according to a new U.N.-backed report. A team of UNESCO researchers spent ten days monitoring the world's largest coral reef systems and says urgent action needs to be taken. UNESCO has now waited, was now waiting for responses from various governments including Australia's which has pushed back on the recommendation. We're joined by CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill Weir to learn a bit more about this. So, Bill, tell us -- why is it important that the Great Barrier Reef is listed in this way. And what is the fear if it's not?",
