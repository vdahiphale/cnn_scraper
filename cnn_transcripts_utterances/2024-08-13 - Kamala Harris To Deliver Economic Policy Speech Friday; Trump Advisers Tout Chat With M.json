Today, the Trump campaign celebrating that chat, but sources say some of his allies aren't so sure. We're going to start with CNN's Eva McKend, who's covering the Harris- Walz ticket.

In Minnesota, for instance, there is free college tuition at public two or four-year colleges for families making under $80,000 a year. And a generous Child Tax Credit. You know, does that become part of their vision together. On the campaign trail, we hear the vice president talk about her career as attorney general in California, going after price fixing schemes. And she is pledging to work to bring down prices. She claims to be focused on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that raise rents on working families and capping the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. A lot of these proposals, though, will require working in concert with Congress, and we're really waiting to get a more detailed argument from the campaign, beyond what they have said on the stump. Now, as for the DNC, CNN has learned Hillary Clinton and President Biden will speak Monday night. Former President Barack Obama will address the convention Tuesday, and former President Bill Clinton slated to speak Wednesday. Jess?",

Either they don't care or they don't like anybody, or they don't see that it impacts them in a personal way. I commend the Trump campaign. It's the candidate that's problematic. The candidate who can't stick to issues like inflation or immigration, can't stick to policies that the public supports, that instead, he has to deliver a attacks against a president who is not running against him. What people think of Joe Biden has no impact on Kamala Harris, and it's actually damaging Trump's efforts right now, at a time when the nation is so evenly polarized, so hostile to each other. So, yes, it is a very effective strategy and adding to the voter pool, and increasing the opportunity to win votes.

And the public believes that the -- no matter what inflation is right now, they are looking at it over the last four years, and that's a dangerous situation for Harris. She wants to get ahead of it. So, it's smart for her to be doing it.And in fact, she doesn't really have a choice. Now, that she is the candidate, she's going to have to draw a contrast, because the public does not believe that Joe Biden was affected on inflation, and they do give Trump credit in his administration for numbers that we haven't seen since he was president. One last thing about inflation. Everyone feels it doesn't matter whether you're working paycheck to paycheck or whether you are middle class. Doesn't matter whether you're from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, the South, Georgia, North Carolina, because it's so universal, and it impacts everyone from whether they are 18 years old or 80 years old. This is the key issue, because everyone feels it, and Harris has a way to go to show that her policies aren't going to make a tough situation even worse.",

When you see both candidate, side by side, and they both are answering the same questions at the same time, and challenging each other. Whether she gets no bump or two points, whether it was before or after the convention, in the end, it is that side by side comparison that's going to make the entire difference in this campaign.And the question is, is the Harris message stronger than the Trump message? And I will tell you this, if it's just about policies, just about issues, Trump has the advantage. If it's about candidate traits and attributes and who the people are, Harris has the advantage.

One is they can get -- maybe get a good deal out of a U.S. administration that wants it, others that want it. But also, they don't want -- Iran does not want a major regional conflict. And at this point in time, if they retaliate in the way that they probably need to, with more force, and what they demonstrated in April, where they had 300 plus missiles and drones, then a risk a wider regional war that neither Tehran nor Hezbollah, for that matter, wants. So, I think they're trying to apply this leverage in a way that would conclude a ceasefire that would benefit Hamas. And so, we'll wait and see how this plays out over the next 48 to 72 hours.",

And there was a lot of prudence in terms of moving the additional ships, destroyers that can shoot down missiles and drones into the region to support Israel. But the movement of the guided missile submarines, which is not a defensive capability, but an offensive one, signals that if Israel, I'm sorry, if Iran, takes action or Hezbollah, we're prepared to strike with over 150 Tomahawk land attack missiles at targets either within Hezbollah or Iran for that matter, to take out launchers, to do whatever they need to defend, help Israel defend itself.So, it's a deterrent gesture to signal strength and support for Israel.",

And so, he clearly has no regard for his people. So, it's -- again, both are fighting for strategic aims, and nobody wants to see this repeat. And Netanyahu's view has been, the more military pressure we can put on them, the more -- the more likely we are to bring Sinwar to the table.
