And the White House says he'll outland his plans to reduce the deficit and vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz joins us now. So, Arlette, the president has not announced that he's running for reelection but there's some expectation that this speech is going to have the tone of a campaign speech.",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, just take a look at where President Biden decided to unveil his budget, and that is here in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which would be critical to the upcoming presidential election. But look. The president and his advisors are aware that the budget as it is proposed is unlikely to go anywhere up on Capitol Hill. But it does offer the president an opportunity to really lay out what's at stake for both the policy and the political battles ahead, especially when you think of the fight -- the looming fight over the debt ceiling that is expected to play out over the coming months.Now, the OMB director, Shalonda Young, called this budget, a healthy start to a conversation. And ultimately, she said shows that -- it lays out what exactly President Biden values. Now, take a look -- taking a look at what this budget entails. The president is calling for three trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next ten years. In order to pay for that, he plans on increasing taxes on some of the wealthiest Americans, including a billionaires' tax as well as increasing the corporate tax rates on large corporations. So, some of the items that are highlighted in this budget are things that the president has been talking about for years. And that includes trying to shore up Social Security and Medicare at a time where he's trying to draw some battle lines with Republicans on those programs. He has also called for billions of dollars in investments in child care along with enhancing the child tax credit. And he's also calling for a $35. cap on payments for insulin for all Americans. So much of this is a major part of the Democratic wish list that the president is really trying to outline in this budget. But then there are those fights expected to come with Republicans up on Capitol Hill as Republicans now have control of the House when it comes to government funding and also the debt ceiling. Of course, Republicans have said that they do not want to see any increases to the debt ceiling without cuts to spending. And one thing that the president is doing with the unveiling of his budget is trying to put Republicans on the spot, trying to get them to lay out for Americans how exactly they expect -- plan to reduce the deficits. So -- but so much of this budget for the president is about trying to draw that contrast between what his White House is doing and what Republicans are eyeing, especially as he could be heading towards a 2024 reelection bid in the coming months.",

We'll take you back to Philly as soon as that starts.Let's go to Capitol Hill now. We've just received an update on Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. He was taken to a hospital last night after he fell at an event in Washington. Now, McConnell is 81 years old. And his staff says that he's being treated for a concussion.

A lawyer representing one of the Proud Boys on trial has now asked a federal judge to throw the case out. Now, that attorney claims that the government prosecutors hid what they call plainly exculpatory Capitol security footage. Katelyn Polantz is CNN's senior crime and justice correspondent. Katelyn, first, what does this attorney claim about this footage is plainly exculpatory. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this attorney for the Proud Boys watching this footage that was aired publicly on Fox News. He's in trial, he's watching it and he's now saying that it's exculpatory because he believes it was peaceful that the video that Fox News airs showed that the Senate chamber of the U.S. Capitol was not violently breached on January sixth and the Capitol Police were ushering people in. That is just not the facts of what happened that day. There was violence. There was a push to get into the Senate chamber. There were Capitol police officers trying to stop many, many rioters but they were overwhelmed. But he is trying to bring this up in court so that the judge will take a look at it, and that the Justice Department will have to respond.",

He's the person that wears horns on the Capitol grounds, called himself the QAnon Shaman. And actually, he previously pleaded guilty and admitted to what he did that day.His attorney has argued repeatedly in his case, that he was being peaceful and that he was being ushered in by Capitol Police. But when he ultimately was under oath, he spoke to the judge admitted and confessed his guilt to using a bullhorn to rile up the crowd, screaming obscenities in the Senate gallery as other rioters were flooding in, and then also he admitted to leaving a threatening note on the table where Mike Pence, the Vice president, had been sitting minutes before saying on that note, it's only a matter of time, justice is coming. So, that's the facts in the case that we've seen in court related to Chansley who is in that video.",

And when you've got neither, you pound the table. That's what these guys are doing. They're pounding the table.They were given just about every bit of footage, like 730 terabytes. So, slightly, they had this already. And even if they didn't have this, this doesn't show their client that shows the QAnon shaman walking peacefully during an Off period when he wasn't acting crazy. So, it doesn't show anything that in my mind would convince a jury to acquit their clients. So, in the law, we say it's not material and they will not get a mistrial. They will not get a dismissal. This is just a defense lawyer tactic.",

So, I don't see how it affects other cases unless you want us to believe there's no violence on that day. There was violence.And you know, violence takes a lot of energy and there's downtime. So, these people who went inside the Capitol illegally, yes, there's going to be a video of them just walking around without committing violence. It doesn't mean there wasn't violence the rest of the time. This short cherry-pick video is not like fairy dust where it undoes all the violence of that day. And besides, Victor, when it comes to the Proud Boys, they're being accused of seditious conspiracy. It's an agreement between two or more people to commit violence to shut down a function of the government. You don't even have to have the violence. You just have to have the agreement to commit violence and then have one what's called an overt act. So, this video proves nothing. It is just a way for the defense to try something -- throwing something into the wind but it's going to fail.",

This was a completely preventable incident. And the North Southern needs to be held fully responsible for all damages that have been caused, both to the community and to our environment. So, I think Senator Carper was absolutely right to ask those questions. We want to make it clear that they're going to be held totally responsible for the damages that were committed. We also want to understand why the safety issues were not dealt with. We want to make sure moving forward, we have the proper safety protections to make sure this doesn't happen in the future.
