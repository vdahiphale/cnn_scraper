Just ahead, with only 11 days to go until Election Day, Kamala Harris brings in the star power. Last night, it was Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama, and today, it's Beyonce.Israel strikes Gaza with force, killing dozens of Palestinians in overnight strikes, while Lebanon accuses Israel of killing three journalists. And after more than 200 days in space, NASA's SpaceX Crew 8 makes a safe return to Earth. All right, the sprint to the White House is speeding up. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both set to be back on the campaign trail in the coming hours, with just now 11 days to go in the race to be President of the United States. Harris will be joined at a rally in Houston on abortion rights. And she'll be joined by Super Star and Houston Native Beyonce. And on Thursday night, there was more star power on display at a Harris rally in the battleground State of Georgia, including Rock Icon Bruce Springsteen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Bruce Springsteen last night, Beyonce this evening? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENTI want to talk about where the vice president is going to be today, though, because it is unusual for her to be going to Texas, which, of course, is not a battleground state, but the campaign having her travel there because they describe it as the epicentre of abortion bans. The event will feature a Texas couple who led a lawsuit against the state's abortion bans after suffering life threatening pregnancy complications. Shanette Williams, she is the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 from a treatable infection due to delays to her medical care stemming from Georgia's restrictive abortion law. She's also going to be in attendance. And that's what we're seeing Fred from the Harris campaign. They're leaning on women to tell their own stories, to illustrate the tragedies abortion restrictions have led to. Now take a listen to how the vice president talks about this issue on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump still refuses to even acknowledge the pain and the suffering he has caused. He insists that, quote, everybody wanted for Roe Versus Wade to be overturned, which is just a further example of how out of touch the man is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, Former President Donald Trump will also be in Texas later on today, he will be with Senator Ted Cruz, before moving on to a rally in the swing State of Michigan. In Nevada on Thursday night, the Former President was asked about comments by his Former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who says Trump admired the Nazi generals of the Third Reich. Trump answered quote, I never said that. I would never say that end quote.CNN's U.S. National Correspondent Kristen Holmes is tracking all of this. She's joining us live now. So good morning to you. Trump, clearly denying John Kelly's claims. So, what is Trump trying to focus his campaign on in the meantime? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that Donald Trump is really trying to maintain focus on three key issues, immigration, economy and inflation and crime. That being said, it is still Donald Trump. So, any conversation Fred around focus is often a loose one. But when you hear Donald Trump speaks, particularly in these recent days, you can see just how dark his rhetoric is getting. I want to play for you just an example of what last night looked like. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She will obliterate our economy, kill millions of jobs, kill thousands of people too by the way. We're like it. We're like a garbage can for the world. That's what's happened. That's what's happened to -- we're like a garbage can.

      "sentences": "And part of the strategy is one that Donald Trump sees as successful, at least in the past. He believes that his dark rhetoric, particularly around immigration, listen to those trash can of the world comments that helped propel him to the White House in 2016. He believes it could help him again in 2024.Now, as for what Donald Trump is focusing on today, he will also be in Texas. He's going to be in Austin, Texas. He has arranged for a speaking event. He's just going to be talking to press, obviously, talking about immigration, tying it to the border. He's going to be in a border state. But the real reason that he's in Austin, Texas to sit down with basically podcast king, and I say that because that's a moniker he's been dubbed Joe Rogan, who has more than 15 million followers on Spotify. This is really the crowning jewel of a strategy that Donald Trump's team has been trying to deploy, which is sitting him down for these podcasts that reach people who could be voters but don't generally vote, people who don't really engage with politics in a typical way. And Joe Rogan, for them, is something they've been working on for months. They enlisted RFK, who Joe Rogan has a good relationship with, to help with this sit down. They are trying to bring those low propensity or voters that don't typically hit the polls to the poll in -- to the polls in November, and this is part of that strategy. So will be interesting to see what these two men talk about, particularly because they don't necessarily have the rosiest past after Rogan said that all politicians were manipulative, except for RFK Jr., Donald Trump, obviously one to hit back. Did in fact, go after Joe Rogan after that. So, we'll see how this plays out when the two men sit down together today.",

And in Lebanon, the health ministry says three journalists were killed in an Israeli air strike in a building known to house media workers. A senior Lebanese official accuses Israel of carrying out a quote, deliberate assassination. This as U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, tries to revive a Gaza ceasefire hostage release deal.

These talks have been stalled. But we also understand from officials that it appears the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, wants to wait and see who he will be dealing with in the White House. We heard from the Former U.S. President Donald Trump saying that in recent days, he's spoken multiple times to Mr. Netanyahu. And there is a general assumption that Netanyahu believes that Trump would be more positive and more sympathetic to his goals. So, at this point, the overwhelming feeling is that even if you do get everybody in the room again, and they do start to talk about this possible cease fire hostage deal, it is unlikely that the Israeli side will want to commit to anything before it knows who it will be dealing with going forward Fredricka.",

Now tonight, they're taking it to not a traditional battleground state, but a state where reproductive rights is front and center, and that's Texas, and quite frankly, bringing out one of her highest profile surrogates.

Now, the district attorney says that they have done a meticulous review of the filings, they have spoken with family members who are supportive of this. They are really looking at the rehabilitation and that the focus has been that prison is where you serve out your sentence. That is your punishment. And this is according to California statute, and that the prison sentence itself that you have endured is rehabilitative. It is the rehabilitation. Next step will be it will go before a judge.

This is literally reducing the hours. And the results found that productivity stayed the same or even improved at most workplaces, and employee well-being sort of shot through the roof. Everyone was much happier. So, it was following this that trade unions around the country started negotiating reduced working hours for many more people. So over half of Iceland's workforce, the half of the population are in the workforce, are now doing reduced hours, and the results seem to be pretty good. The economy is growing at 5 percent, unemployment is low, but before everyone sort of ditches their stuff and runs out the office on a Friday. Ice's economy is fairly different to most. It's heavy on services and on tourism. With this work, for instance, with an economy based on factories where you need that sort of output, who knows?
