Erica.As the U.S. president increases the pressure on Israel to hold back from an all-out assault in Rafah, activity in Gaza's border cities are intensifying nonetheless. These satellite images show the IDF expanding from airstrikes to ground operations. The use of bulldozers in certain places in the start of what appears to be mustering areas for military vehicles. The images obtained by CNN bear striking resemblance to how the IDF's initial ground invasion was conducted back in October. A UNICEF worker told CNN the city is, quote, \"hanging on the precipice or the edge of a precipice.\" Around 79,000 people have already fled since Monday, according to the U.N. Meantime, Israeli officials are reacting sharply to a CNN exclusive interview with the U.S. president, speaking to my colleague, Erin Burnett. Joe Biden said that he will halt the supply of some weapons to Israel if prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu orders a major invasion of Rafah. The Israeli war and security cabinets are now set to meet later today to discuss these comments. Let's listen to exactly what President Biden told Erin Burnett. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Have those bombs, those powerful 2,000-pound bombs, been used to kill civilians in Gaza? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers. And I made it clear that, if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gone into Rafah yet. If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem. We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure, in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently. But it's -- it's just wrong.

The war cabinet, I'm told, is going to specifically review assessments of how many munitions they have left, how to manage those munitions going forward in light of the fact that the United States may effectively cut Israel off from certain munitions if indeed they proceed with that ground offensive in Rafah. But I'm not getting a sense, Becky, whether publicly or privately from Israeli officials, that there is any sense that these remarks from President Biden, that this new U.S. policy is going to deter Israel from continuing to expand its ground operations in Rafah. There is no sense that that threat is being met with any sense of a course correction of -- from the Israeli cabinet's part. Although that is going to be one of the subjects to be discussed during this war and security cabinet, the security cabinet meetings set to happen later this evening. So we'll wait and stand by for that but in the meantime, we are already getting a range of reactions from top Israeli government officials. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, for example, tweeting, \"Hamas loves Biden.\" Similar comments from Bezalel Smotrich, another member of the far right, who is in Netanyahu's governing coalition, who basically said that this new -- these statements from Biden should only harden Israel's resolve to carry out this major ground offensive into Rafah. Other Israeli politicians, those on the left or in the center of the political spectrum, are blaming Netanyahu and his government for allowing U.S.-Israel relations to sour to the point where President Biden would make such a public statement about this policy. But the question now, Becky, of course, is what will happen next on the ground in Gaza. We have already seen, as even this limited ground incursion by Israeli forces into eastern Rafah is having tremendous impacts on the ground, one of three functioning hospitals in Rafah has now shut down. Because it fell in that red evacuation zone that the Israeli military ordered evacuations from several days ago, when they began their ground operations. So we're already seeing multiple ways in which the humanitarian situation in Gaza is being affected by this. The Rafah border crossing remains closed. Now the question is, when or if the Israeli military will choose to move forward with an all-out ground offensive into those population centers that President Biden has said would trigger this new red line.

There's really a focus today on that non-disclosure agreement and also on a subsequent statement that Stormy Daniels signed. I want to bring in my colleague, Brynn Gingras, who has been following this very closely. At this point now, where they're going back and forth a little bit, just looking at my notes, this really stood out to me, that Stormy Daniels was just asked about this statement that she had put out at one time, saying, look, this isn't true. There is no truth to the rumors that I had received hush money from Donald Trump, that -- the statement was rumors I had received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false.

She was actually -- her lawyer was dealing with Michael Cohen, Keith Davidson, who has been on the stand already. And so she's distancing herself from Michael Cohen. If you remember, the defense already asked her, really insinuated that they were, quote, \"buddies,\" that they've been on a podcast together talking about this trial.
