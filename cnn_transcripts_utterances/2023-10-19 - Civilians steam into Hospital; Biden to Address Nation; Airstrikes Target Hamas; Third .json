      "sentences": "Tonight, President Biden, two wars and one primetime address to the nation. We will see the president this evening from the Oval Office making a direct appeal to the American people to essentially stand tough. This as he says he's also going to ask Congress for tens of billions of dollars to help support Ukraine and Israel.Right now, in Gaza, new air strikes and explosions were seen this morning. In southern Gaza, where civilians, of course, as you know, have been told to flee for safety, this was the scene we saw over and over again this morning outside a hospital in Khan Younis. This was a few hours ago. It was a stream of people being rushed in for aid. Right now it is unclear what caused the explosion. The IDF says they are looking into it.",

      "sentences": "So, Kate, let me give you a sense of where some of these locations are. Khan Younis, where we saw those people injured, is right there. The Rafah crossing is right here. This is where President Biden says he has brokered a deal to allow some aid from Egypt to cross. We are waiting to see when and if that will happen. This, the line inside Gaza where Israel has told people to evacuate south of. You can see Khan Younis very much in that zone.Some other important new information today. Two hundred and three hostages. The IDF now says they've contacted families of some 203 people who could be held hostage inside Gaza now. This would be their 13th day in captivity. One other key thing the IDF says, the Hamas terrorists who infiltrated into Israel, killing some 1,400 people, largely in east kibbutz (INAUDIBLE), Israeli defense officials now say it's possible some of those terrorists might still be operating within Israel. We'll get to all of this coming up. I want to start, though, with the situation unfolding in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Let's get to Selma Abdelaziz for that. Salma. SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so the latest death toll we have is 13 people killed, that's according to a local hospital director in Gaza. But the fear is that that number could rise. The hospital director saying that an entire city block was levelled in this explosion. I do want to bring you - I do want to play you those images that Kate was playing just earlier for us. They are disturbing. But there's something I want to point out, as you're looking at those people just streaming into that hospital. Many of those victims are children. You have 2 million people, about 2 million people trapped essentially in an urban war zone. Of that population of 2 million, half of them are children. And half of the population of Gaza, just in the last ten days of conflict, about 10 days of conflict, have been displaced, have been forced out of their homes, are desperately seeking a safe place, are looking for refuge. Rights groups say that doesn't exist in Gaza. There is no safe place. As you mentioned, it is the south that many families were told to flee towards during that evacuation order by the Israeli military over the weekend. Well, this is the south. This is where they're supposed to find safety. Absolutely none of that there. In the hospitals that they're streaming into, they are on the brink. There is a complete siege of Gaza that was imposed by Israel after that horrific terror attack left some 1,400 people dead. That siege means no food, no fuel, no water. That means, doctors tell us, that inside those hospitals they are performing surgeries without painkillers, they are treating people on the floors, they are running out of fuel to even run these hospitals. People are dying of preventable causes. And rights groups, when you look at these images, say the situation is spiraling out of control. Israel's offensive on Gaza amounts to collective punishment again of these two million people trapped inside. And you mentioned that aid coming in as well, John. We're talking about 20 trucks. That's what was agreed upon, 20 trucks. That is a drop in the ocean of need on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it sounds like this is going to be a big picture speech from President Biden this evening. Only his second ever primetime address from the Oval Office. And he's going to try and make the case, the case for American's role in the world, its response to both the war in Ukraine, as well as Israel's fight against Hamas, talking about the essential role that America plays in supporting both the Ukrainian people, as well as the Israeli people, as the president views it.But really this is about the funding. A big funding request that he's about to put before Congress. He's expected to request north of $100 billion combined for both supporting Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, as well as resources for the U.S. border with Mexico. And so this is about driving up public support for these various causes and also trying to connect them. The connective tissue that the president is going to try and find between all of these events is really going to be a central focus of the president's speech this evening. We heard from John Finer (ph), the president's deputy national security adviser, who said that the president is going to, quote, \"lay out his view of this extraordinary moment that we're in, connecting all of these events and explaining why they matter to the American public.\"",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, Ashkelon is the city in Israel that has received the most rockets of anywhere else. They have had more than 1,200 rockets rain down on this city in the last 12 days. About 200 of those have made direct hits on apartment buildings, on businesses and more inside the city here. That's 25 percent of all the rockets that have been fire on Israel have rained down here on the city of Ashkelon.And behind me here, what you have is the city's command center where essentially they are coordinating a variety of emergency response in terms of when a rocket falls, they pinpoint the location of that rocket, sometimes before it even lands they can track it and know where to direct emergency services there. But what they're also doing is they're coordinating the evacuation of people who are choosing to leave the city. About 25 to 30 percent of this city's 170,000 residents have made the decision to leave the city for a safer grounds. The majority of the city remains, but it really has come to a standstill in many ways. About 90 percent of the city's businesses are estimated to have closed. And those that remain are essentially supermarkets, pharmacies, grocery stores, et cetera. We spoke with a woman who was at the grocery store today making her weekly shopping trip. And she says that that is the only time that she leaves home. Even though the Iron Dome system intercepts the large majority of those rockets, you don't know where the rockets that actually do make impact are going to hit. And so people here, there's certainly a sense of resilience. They want to remain in their city. But some of them also taking precautions, like only leaving for essential reasons. Kate.",

And this is an expansion of the map where the -- Hamas can hit different targets from Gaza right here. What we're talking about is they have low yield weapons that don't go very far, about 17 to 20 kilometers, that's under Ashkelon. Over the last several -- about the last decade, they've got better rockets that can go up to Ashdod, where some of the reporters have been. But the interesting thing is, they also have long range rockets that can go 70 kilometers or more that can hit Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Bethlehem.

He said that his expectation was they would still vote, but he signaled that they would likely have a Republican conference meeting ahead of that vote. And a lot can change when Republicans go in a room behind closed doors and have a conversation about the next steps.I also talked to a close ally of Jim Jordan, Warren Davidson, who said that there is some discussion about how you could give Jim Jordan more time to try to win over those skeptical Republicans, more than 20 of them at this moment. Obviously, far more than he can afford to lose if he wants the speakership. One of those ideas that has been floated over the last several days is the idea of empowering Patrick McHenry to be a temporary speaker pro- tem. That would empower him to put legislation on the floor, to deal with urgent issues, like funding the government, making sure that there was more U.S. aid directed to Ukraine and Israel. Both issues, by the way, that would be very messy for any new speaker to try to handle as they just got into the job. So, there is some warning, some openness from some Jordan allies that that could be one way to give Jordan more time to try to win over skeptical votes. But, again, even if you got McHenry into a position where for a few months he was the interim speaker, it's not clear that Jim Jordan would ever change the minds of some of those members who had been voting repeatedly against him on the floor. Again, timing of a vote today is very fluid. It's very unclear what is going to happen on the floor of the House. Because if Jim Jordan goes to the floor and loses even more votes, it makes it very hard for him to have an argument that he's the best guy for this job. John.",
