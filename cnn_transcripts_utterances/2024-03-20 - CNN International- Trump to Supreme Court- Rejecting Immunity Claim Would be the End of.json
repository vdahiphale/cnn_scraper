The central bank will release new economic projections and analysts expect the Fed to keep the interest rates steady. Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been indicted for alleged fraud. He is accused of ordering an aide to falsify COVID-19 vaccination records. The former president's closest aide and 15 others are also accused of participating in the scheme. But Bolsonaro's lawyer calls the indictment absurd. And China just launched a relay satellite that enables communication with the far side of the moon. The mission is part of its lunar exploration program. China made history back in 2019 when it became the first country to successfully land on the far side of the moon. Donald Trump has told the U.S. Supreme Court that if he doesn't receive immunity for trying to overturn the presidential election, it would be, quote, the end of the presidency as we know it. The brief filed by the former U.S. president on Tuesday is part of his defense against special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges. Lower courts have soundly rejected Trump's immunity claims and the Supreme Court has arguments scheduled for April 25th. More now from CNN's Evan Perez. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: This is designed to appeal to the conservative justices who have this expansive view of the power of the presidency. I'll read you just a part of what the Trump lawyers say in this filing. They say: A former president enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts. Criminal immunity arises directly from the executive vesting clause and the separation of powers. They go on to say that: The impeachment judgment clause reflects the founder's understanding that only a president convicted by the Senate after impeachment could be criminally prosecuted. During the impeachment proceeding, the Trump lawyers argued that you could leave it for the criminal justice system to take care of this issue that the president was being accused of. And of course now they're arguing the opposite. They're saying that first you have to be impeached and convicted by the Senate before you can actually take any kind of criminal action against the former president. (END VIDEOTAPE) NOBILO: Earlier, a former federal prosecutor and legal analyst weighed in on the immunity claims and Trump's strategy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He can't really make a more nuanced argument about, well, all of these things I did were part of my official duties as president and therefore I should be protected in the way that he could if he, say, ordered a drone strike and some DA somewhere tried to prosecute him or something.What he did, he did as a candidate for his own personal benefit and his political benefit, not for his job as a president in the country. And that's why he has to go big on this argument for absolute immunity. And he has to raise the specter of, oh, if you do this, you know, everyone's going to be prosecuted after this. Well, no one has been prosecuted before in the history of our country. No one who lives within the bounds of the law while their president will be prosecuted again. This is really about his actions. And because those actions are outside of any reasonable scope of what the president is supposed to be doing, I think the court will have to set a standard that is below absolute immunity.

CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now to discuss. It's a difficult statement for Lloyd Austin to make to say that the support is resolute when the U.S. is in an election year. There are obvious disagreements, the funding bill is languishing in Congress. Is that believed? And I guess the bigger issue here is the fact that Russia has, you know, the luxury of time.

And we obviously see from Lloyd Austin, he's also having to tread a fine line. There's always this balancing act, between emphasizing Ukraine's successes, the way it's managed to erode Russia's capabilities. He said just so that he can show the American people and members of Congress in particular that they are getting a return on their investment, while at the same time emphasizing that this is a very fragile moment for Ukraine as another argument as to why they should get support. So take a listen to some of what he said about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Regarding a potential Russian breakthrough, what we've seen on the battlefield is a series of incremental gains by the Russians. These gains have come at significant cost in terms of personnel and equipment. But nonetheless, you know, we have seen some incremental gains. And as I have engaged my counterparts and the chief of defense in Ukraine, they feel confident in their ability to continue to defend their sovereign territory and hold the line.

President Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of March alone, they've dropped nearly 900 guided aerial bombs. So the situation is critical. Europe is stepping up, though. This Czech initiative to buy ammunition from outside countries is gaining traction, including at that Rammstein meeting.
