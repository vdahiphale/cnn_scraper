That rose to 40 percent of black voters, 40 percent of Latino voters, over half of younger voters.

He wants to make the case that, you know, people had more money in their pocket at the end of the week, the border was under control. The world wasn't as chaotic when he was president kind of, you know, memory holding the 2020 experience with COVID.Harris, like Biden before her, really wants voters more to be looking forward. I mean, she wants them not so much to be treating this as a referendum on whether they think the Biden years or the Trump years were better for them personally. She wants them to be focused on what the next four years would bring. And that's kind of the turning the page, a new way forward. Project 2025, and not only that, but what you know, Trump calls Agenda 47 the videos that he's put out himself on his own website, which overlap a tremendous degree with Project 2025 provides plenty of targets for her. Economists, for example, will say, you know, multiple economists have said that looking forward, Trump's agenda of tariffs and mass deportation is a greater risk of inflation going forward than Harris's agenda is. The challenge, of course, is that a lot of voters, you know, getting voters to kind of orient that way, as opposed to kind of casting a ballot on their immediate circumstance, particularly talking about that last seven or eight, 10 percent that participate in a presidential election, but not in the midterm. That's not an easy task. But I am guessing an early queue for tomorrow -- for Tuesday night, will be Harris will be trying to get voters look forward, talking about things like Project 2025.

Democrats, they prefer a short term spending bill into December. They want to kick the negotiations until after the election. And many Republicans, they want to fund the government into spring, pushing the fight until after the leadership races in the House, which would help Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. They will, of course, need to settle on spending levels, and there's a separate battle brewing over whether to include a noncitizen voting measure.

But still, this marks a major change to a policy that has seen more than 160,000 Chinese children being adopted all over the world since the early 1990s, about half of them going to the United States. But remember this program began when China was dealing with an overpopulation problem, that government very much enforcing its draconian one-child policy that basically limited most couples in cities to one-child, forcing many families to abandon children especially girls and disabled kids. Now fast-forward to today, they are dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking labor force and a rapidly aging society. That's why within the last decade, the authorities here have twice relaxed its once strict family planning policies, now allowing most couples to have up to three children. But none of that seems to have worked against this backdrop of a slowing economy and young people's changing attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Now the Chinese reaction to this policy change seem to be mixed on social media, but those applauding this decision seem to be expressing a nationalistic sentiment saying China's now rich and powerful enough to take care of its own abandoned children and often, citing rising tensions between China and the United States and other Western nations as well. But none of this economic, social, and political realities, of course, offer any real comfort to the hundreds of international families in the middle of adopting children from China because the government here has reportedly indicated this ban goes into effect immediately with very limited exceptions, leaving hundreds of Americans in limbo and potentially heartbroken.

And many of the reasons cited are, you know, reasons many people around the world have or not wanting bigger families. It's more expensive. People are starting their families later. Women are more educated and have smaller families. But the one thing that is very unique for China is the one-child policy on top of that. And what it has done is created a -- it's reshaped family structures. I mean, all -- many of the women today, who are being asked to have one-child, have grown up in -- to have more children -- have grown up only in one-child families. They've been told all their lives that the one-child family is the best structure ever. And so it's hard to turn on a dime about that. And in addition to that, there's also the issue of generational trauma. You know, the one-child policy was enforced very strictly and very painfully in many cases were forced abortions and abandon children. These are now, this is a generation that's inherited it, you know. And so I can't imagine why any -- many of them tell me that they find it incredibly hard to build happy families with such painful memories.",

If you had a female child, you could then potentially go again and have a male child. So even the value system around females born during that time must impact women today of reproductive age.I'm wondering if you've heard from women in China or women that have been adopted, what their views are on this new policy.",

And many of them are resisting.So for example, one of the problems with the one-child policy when it's a swift move to a two- and three-child policy is now that there's workplace discrimination against women of childbearing age, because many employers don't want to give two or three lots in maternity leave and maternity benefits. So, many women say that they are being asked to, you know, promise, which is illegal, but its common, that they won't have more children. They're not being promoted on the suspicion that they might have more children. So, the factor is whether or not, you know, the women were punished in a one-child policy for having more children and now they're being punished in the suspicion that they might have more children. In any case the end results are not great. And of course, the other part of it is a very practical matter. Because of the one-child policy and the fact that it forced many families to limit the size, there grew up to be acute shortage of women. So there's something like 30 million surplus bachelors in China. These are what they call bare branches. Men who will most likely never have a chance to get married because the girls are just not there. And these are mostly rural men. So you have a real issue there just, just finding women to build families.",

You know, you've gone from a nation that said you can't have any children and gave away their children, to one now where they're desperate to have more children and they can't so they shut the doors on the global adoption process.",

But if you look at where its sitting in parts of the Gulf of Mexico, you've got ocean temperatures there that are incredibly warm, nearing the low 90s. And if you look at its path that it could take as it heads towards the U.S. Gulf Coast, it's going to take this ride through some very warm ocean temperatures in the middle 80s, even in some upper 80s. So what that's going to do is help it organize and strengthen pretty quickly, especially as we head into the work week. We could be looking at some tropical storm-force conditions along that Texas coast line as early as late Tuesday. And then this thing could ride the coastline towards Louisiana as we go into Wednesday, bringing with it the threat for some heavy rain, some storm surge, and rough surf as well. When we look at recent named storms that have made landfall in this part of the country, I mean, we had Beryl make landfall over the Texas coastline just a couple of months ago this season and it brought some power problems to parts of Houston. We also had Ida in 2021, Beta and Hanna in 2020. But when you look at hurricanes, the last time that Texas had two hurricanes make landfall in one season was 2008 -- 16 years ago, Ike and Dolly. So if this does in fact become Hurricane Francine and make landfall on the Texas coastline this will be the first time in 16 years at Texas has seen two hurricanes in one season. Whether it's a hurricane or a tropical storm, no matter what it's called, it will bring some heavy rain to parts of the Texas and Louisiana coastline. Forecasters are already worried about four to eight inches of rain that could grow to 12 inches in some localized areas. So flash flooding is going to be a great concern as we go into the workweek.
