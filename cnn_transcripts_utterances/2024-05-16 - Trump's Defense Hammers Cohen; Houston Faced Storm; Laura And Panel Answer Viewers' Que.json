I mean, 34, the number of the felony counts against Trump for falsifying business records, 130,000, the amount of dollars Stormy Daniels was actually paid to keep quiet. But the number that might be sticking with the jury tonight is, well, 96, the 96 seconds of a critical October 2016 phone call that is now in question. On Monday, Cohen testified that he made that October call to Trump's bodyguard, a man by the name of Keith Schiller, to try to talk to Trump. The whole point of that call? To tell Trump that he was planning to pay off Stormy Daniels. Now, from Tuesday's transcript, here was the question: Why did you need to speak with Mr. Trump at that point in the evening of October 25th? Cohen then responded, to discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it. Now, that testimony is important to the prosecution's allegations that Trump directed Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels. But today, today, the defense took a sledgehammer to that story. They suggested that Cohen may have made it all up. They referenced texts that Cohen sent before making that phone call. And in those texts, Cohen was complaining about a teenager who was prank-calling him. Cohen texted Schiller -- quote -- \"Who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office?\" Schiller responds, call me. From the transcript, Blanche says about that call -- quote -- \"That was a lie, you were actually talking to Mr. Schiller about the fact that you were getting harassing phone calls from a 14-year-old, correct?\" Cohen responds, part of it was the 14-year-old, but I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more than potentially just this. That's what I recall based upon the documents that I reviewed. Now, keep in mind, the jurors have also had it drilled into their heads that Cohen is a liar and is out for revenge. The defense played his own words from his own podcast to make that point.

The one good saving grace for Michael Cohen in all this is that he did stay calm. He was flustered in that moment.

Former U.S. Army sergeant Daniel Perry was serving a 25-year prison sentence for fatally shooting Air Force veteran Garrett Foster in 2020. Today, Perry was pardoned by Texas Governor Greg Abbott.And just to remind you what happened, prosecutors say that Perry drove his SUV through a red light into a crowd of protesters in Austin. He was apparently approached by Foster, who was openly carrying an assault-style rifle, which is legal in Texas. Foster then motioned for Perry to lower his window, at which point Perry shot Foster with a handgun. The defense argued that Perry's actions were justified as self- defense, but the jury, they went on to convict him. Now, Governor Abbott made an unusual request for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to carry out an expedited review before Perry was even sentenced. Now, that board unanimously voted to pardon Perry and restore his firearm rights earlier today.

He seems to have forgotten a basic truth that our founding fathers knew well, namely that respect for the rule of law begins with respect for the will of citizen jurors. And in this case, there were 12 citizen jurors who gave up two weeks of their lives to consider the evidence. They heard from 40 witnesses. They deliberated 15 hours. And at the end of that, those same 12 citizen jurors voted unanimously to convict Daniel Perry. And assuming the governor or anybody else who would say this is a travesty of justice is correct, then there are two separate courts of appeals in Texas that can be allowed and should have been allowed to weigh in on this and potentially reverse it if it needed to be reversed. But when the judge steps in with two big feet and undoes the will of citizen jurors, a legitimate question arises. Is this based on the merits or is it based on some crass political calculation?",

She is adapting indigenous values to apparel and giving back to a changing industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMY DENET DEAL, FOUNDER, 4KINSHIP: Everything we do here at the shop is based on working with vintage, things that have already been here on the planet. So that's a way just for me to really approach sustainability from an indigenous lens. I was an active wear designer for major corporations. I decided to leave corporate fashion and start my own company. Back in 2015, I rebranded in 2021 to the name 4Kinship. My indigeneity has been really a big part of how the brand has evolved. Growing up in Indiana, in a very rural area, being adopted into a white family, but being native, there was always a void. And as I got older, it became a stronger need for me to really know my identity. So, I found my mom and birth family. Who's that?",

It's just wonderful to find ways to be part of a positive change in our community. Kids in the remote areas of Navajo Nation, they have so few resources. So, we've built a skate park. Skateboarding is there in so many ways as a sport that can really, truly help the mental health and wellness of our kids. Just FYI, I had no idea what I was doing when I thought, oh, let's build a skate park. But there's so many things that we can be creative as native people by simply reimagining stuff that we already have. For our young people, a lot of them don't know people within creative industries that could help them. So, I think that is my job, as someone that comes from the outside, that comes back with different gifts, is to use that to create bridges.",
