Some of them are giving up on the fight and going over to the Ukrainian side. Others will be captured through the course of the war. So they can expect not only to face the potential for justice in Ukraine. Of course, a lot of prisoners do get exchanged at the moment.But there is the potential that that can be upscaled to an international forum. And certainly, European nations are working to build the capacity and capability to do that. They're pointing toward the Hague in the Netherlands as the venue for that. But a lot more work needs to be done, but it's clear that's where the momentum is going. And of course, for the leadership, those that stay inside Russia are very unlikely to be picked up, which also would raise the question for President Putin, should he ever decide to back down in this war and try to flee the country and get out, it perhaps shuts down opportunities there for him to flee Russia. I don't think anyone is really expecting him to do that, but now he knows that he will potentially face accountability for those crimes.",

And it really serves two purposes, right. And it's hard to explain what the atmosphere is like here. The free world has gathered in Munich right now. And of course, there's a hunger for justice here given the images that continue to come out of Ukraine. But the other thing that's really important about this is that, from the private on the battlefield in Ukraine right now, the Russian private, right up to the masters in the Kremlin, they need to understand that this ends with them in handcuffs, that this ends with them being held accountable, as the vice president said, for these crimes against humanity.

But it comes at a very pivotal moment here on the ground with both Ukrainians expected to soon carry out a new counteroffensive and the early stages of a new Russian offensive we believe is beginning to build.Now, it is not going very well for the Russians on the ground, but that doesn't mean that they've stopped trying to hit and hurt Ukraine from the skies. Of course, we've seen week after week of huge missile salvos being targeted all across the country. Just today, a smaller one, four cruise missiles fired into Ukraine from the Black Sea. Two, we understand from the Ukrainian air force, were intercepted, but there were two strikes in a southwestern city including one on a military target. So Russia does continue to try to hit Ukraine both on the ground and in the air. We've heard a number of top Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy renew their calls for more weapons. And Boris and Amara, not just more weapons, but more weapons faster. President Zelenskyy saying that time really is of the essence here. Speed is key to prevent Russia from using their potential. That's a reference to the fact that they still have a huge amount of weaponry and men in reserve despite the fact that they have been suffering quite significantly on the ground. In terms of weaponry, we also just heard the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, renew the call for fighter jets. Fighter jets is something that we've heard Ukrainian officials call for time and time again. Western countries, NATO countries not saying that they are going to do that any time soon. The U.K. has committed to training some pilots, but if Ukraine were to get fighter jets, that is likely a couple years off. But Ukraine's foreign minister saying he is quite confident that eventually at some point they will be getting those fighter jets. More immediately, in terms of that counteroffensive, the U.S. and others would like to see Ukraine shift its focus from the fight in Bakhmut, in the eastern part of the country, which has been so fierce for the past few months, and carry out a counteroffensive in the south. And that is why we've seen the U.S. donating, contributing these armored vehicles over the past few weeks as well as a new training program for hundreds of Ukrainian troops at a U.S. base in Germany.

And late yesterday evening we learned from the state of Ohio and from federal officials that FEMA will be supplementing the federal response on the ground in the coming days in the form of a FEMA senior response official, and also what that federal agency describes as a regional incident management assessment team, basically assessing what the long-term needs will be there in eastern Ohio. This coming just days after we heard originally, initially from the governor of Ohio saying that the state would not qualify for any kind of FEMA support.So what has yet to be seen, though, is to what extent will these additional FEMA resources actually benefit the region. As you mentioned a little while ago, frustration continues to build, as do concerns. Our teams have heard from residents there in East Palestine, Ohio, saying that they are experiencing things like rashes, sore throats, headaches, feelings of nausea as well. And they're concerned that that could be directly linked to this train derailment that happened earlier this month, this after local and state officials saying that those ongoing tests of the air and also of the water quality should hopefully reassure residents that it is safe to return back home. But again, that may not be enough for many of the people there that still want more to be done. And there is help on the way, as you mentioned, as federal officials are sending in medical experts, top experts in the field of toxicology as well to hear the concerns and to physically examine some of these individuals that are coming forward with these concerns. Amara, Boris? SANCHEZ: We'll keep our eye on that story. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much for the update. Meantime, five former Memphis police officers have pleaded not guilty in the beating death of Tyre Nichols. They each face several charges, including second degree murder, kidnapping, and assault. Nichols, a 29-year-old black man, was repeatedly punched and kicked by the officers after a traffic stop and a brief foot chance in early January. That second degree murder charge carries a penalty of 15 to 60 years in prison. Meantime, funeral service are going to be held today for an unarmed black man shot by police in Louisiana.",

As you mentioned, the grand jury recommended that -- excuse me, the district attorney could consider perjury charges for one or more of the witnesses who testified before the grand jury that was investigating the efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.Now, the grand jury, it heard from 75 witnesses in all, everyone from election workers and state officials to election deniers and some of the former President Donald Trump's aides and advisers. What we don't know is who it is exactly that the grand jury says committed perjury. So that is a question that is still lingering out there after the release of this report. We also don't know what other recommended charges the grand jury may have made. We just got excerpts from this report. In addition to the perjury charge, we learned that the grand jury unanimously found that this was a legitimate election that happened in 2020, which the finding they say came after hearing from extensive witnesses about the election. This is important because it lays the foundation for the potential for charges of overturning what is a legitimate election. The big question, of course, now is what does this mean for Donald Trump? And will Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, will she consider charges against the former president? The president's spokesman this week said again that he made a perfect call when he asked the Georgia secretary of state to find enough votes for him to win, a claim he's made over and over again since the 2020 election.

There is so much fear in this community. I talked to many people in the area who told me, look, I don't want to let my kids out this weekend. I'm afraid of my husband walking to the synagogue. There is just an overall fear in the community despite the arrest, because people say, look, I do feel reassured that this man has been arrested, but, of course, there is still that fear of someone else doing the same thing. And it's important to point out the rise in antisemitism, not just here in Los Angeles with these two cases, but in general nationwide. So I think the big picture here is to remember that there's people in this community who are in fear of what happened and what could happen next. Boris, Amara?",

And it's still very much a developing situation, what we do know, what we don't know.What we don't know at this point is who carried out this hack or why. What we do know is that the FBI is being very tightlipped on this and may not be providing many public updates unless our reporting shakes some updates loose.

Pleasure to have you on, and thank you so much for coming into the studio. Just the statistics are heartbreaking and staggering and really concerning. And one of them that stood out to me is that 13 percent of teenage girls attempted suicide. I'm sorry, one percent is too high, right. And 30 percent seriously considered suicide. And we're talking mostly teenager girls. What is going on? DR. DEB HOURY, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: It's a call for help. And what I think is so important to realize is if somebody attempts suicide and you can intervene, really, really likely they won't go on to die from suicide.
