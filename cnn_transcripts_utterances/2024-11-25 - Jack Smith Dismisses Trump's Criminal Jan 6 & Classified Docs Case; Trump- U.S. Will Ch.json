Breaking details on what Donald Trump warns is coming, on day one that he's back in office. And the President-Elect is free and clear in both of his federal criminal cases, after the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, dropped all charges today. But will he still issue a report? And if so, what will it say? And fallout from a story that was first reported here on CNN. One of Donald Trump's closest and most trusted advisers now under investigation by Trump's own attorneys. And Trump himself is weighing in tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Both of those striking federal cases that made history against Donald Trump have now been dismissed, and the only U.S. President to ever be criminally charged is now fully reaping the benefits of winning back the White House. Special Counsel, Jack Smith, moved to drop his charges, in the election interference and the classified documents cases, given the long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted. Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington quickly granted Jack Smith's request today. And of course, down in Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed that documents, case over the summer, as Smith was trying to revive it, but now is no longer doing so. It may not be the last that we hear of that case, though, because others were indicted there as well. More on that in a moment with our experts. But tonight, Jack Smith made sure to mention this, in his filings. He said, quote, \"The Government's position on the merits of the defendant's prosecution has not changed... the circumstances have.\" Those circumstances, of course, being Trump's reelection to office. It's been an extraordinary turn of events since Smith first announced these indictments, which I should remind you, were handed down by grand juries made up of American citizens. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

My lead sources, tonight: Elie Honig, former federal prosecutor. And Maggie Haberman, Senior Political Correspondent for The New York Times. Elie, can we just talk about how Jack Smith did this? And was this his only option, essentially, that he had left, given Trump is promising to fire him, two seconds after taking office? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It was his only option. He had to do it. He did the right thing, today. It's important to understand why, though. It's not because of that promise to fire him. It's because, and Jack Smith said this in his motion, it's because of the DOJ policy, which goes all the way back to 1973, Watergate.",

But they all feel as if their lives were turned upside down, and they were, you know, they were hanging on in the hopes that he would win. I mean, Trump was very clear with a number of people, back in 2023, when he got indicted, that, if he won, this would all go away. That's obviously what happened. No, the Manhattan case doesn't magically go away that he was convicted in. But it's -- they're not sentencing a sitting president. We've seen that get delayed indefinitely now. And the Georgia case is a real question mark for me. He is articulating what they all feel. What that ends up looking like, Kaitlan, I don't know, because there are civil service rules about the prosecutors who worked on these cases. And so, the question becomes, Trump can't just fire them.

He ordered Dave Warrington, who was essentially the campaign's General Counsel, to look into it.Warrington has, over the course of the last couple of days, we are told, and produced some kind of report that explained in detail, two instances, we are told, according to people who have seen it, where Epshteyn did this. One of which was allegedly with Scott Bessent, who was Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. And Treasury Secretary, as you know, was the messiest fight for who was going to get the job, in a Trump-world that has seen an awful lot of knife-fighting lately, since the election. Now what ends up happening after that? The recommendation was that he should not be allowed around Trump essentially that, I think -- I think the language as described to us was that his access to Trump should be, quote-unquote, terminated. Whether that ends up happening remains to be seen. As you said, Epshteyn has denied that this is the case. It's up to Trump. Trump has a long history of getting irritated, when people make money off of him, as he would put it. Epshteyn has worked for a number of Republican candidates, in 2022, despite having pretty limited political experience of his own, one of whom was open with The New York Times, in 2023, that he was hiring him because he thought that he had good relationships around Trump. So whether this ends up mattering, I don't know. I certainly imagine it's going to make it harder for Epshteyn to get people to hire him right now.",
