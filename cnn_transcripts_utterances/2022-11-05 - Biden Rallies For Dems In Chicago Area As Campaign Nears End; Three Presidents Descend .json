And that is who will fight for you? That's the choice in this election, who? Who will fight for you? Who will fight for working people who are struggling to pay their bills? You all listen, inflation is a real problem right now. It's not just here in America, it's worldwide. And it has to do with the legacy of the pandemic. It wreck supply chains, disrupted the economy, then you've got a war in Ukraine that sent energy prices through the roof. So, you know, folks see grocery prices going up, gas prices going up. It takes a real bite out of their paychecks. It hurts. I get that. But, the question you've got to ask yourself is who's actually going to do something about it? The Republicans like to talk about it. But what's their answer? What's their economic policy? They want to gut social security. They want to gut Medicare, they want to give rich folks and big corporations more tax cuts.",

You're listening to former President Barack Obama there. (END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD (on camera): Touching on just about everything, from the responsibility of voting, how there is no place for hate and anti- Semitism, or the dangerous vitriol out there, in his words, the poison. Instead, inspiring and both educating, as he's also stumping for John Fetterman -- lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania, in -- someone who is now in a very tight, hotly contested U.S. Senate race. So, after months of campaigning, there are now just three days away until midterm elections, and the balance of power in Congress is on the line. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Jessica Dean are following the latest on the campaign trail. So, Arlette, to you first, President Biden will soon be speaking there in Illinois. In fact, he is speaking, right? He is there in the Chicago suburb. What's he saying? And what are people who have turned out for this rally thinking and feeling just days away from midterm elections? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Well, Fred, President Biden is trying to focus on highlighting the economic relief that Democrats are trying to extend to American voters at a time when the economy and inflation remain of top concerned, just three days away from the election. The president trying to draw a contrast with the Republican policy that had been put forth, specifically, in these instances today, talking about democratic efforts to lower prescription drugs, and also to protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare. The president arguing that under Republicans, those programs would be on the chopping block. Now, the White House has been watching this election unfold over the course of the past few weeks, and is aware of how big of an issue the economy is for American voters and there's concern that voter discontent about the economy could jeopardize Democrats' chances of taking -- holding on the control of the House and Senate. Now, the president is here in Illinois today. This is build as an official events by Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, a House Democrat in a competitive race. She is on hand hear. The president talking about things that she has done for the district as he is at this event. But then, later on today, he will be heading over to Pennsylvania where he is linking up in Philadelphia with his former boss, President Barack Obama to campaign for John Fetterman. That's one of the few races -- one of the few competitive Senate races that the president has gone into in the closing week of this election. The White House, of course, saying that he's trying to go to places where he can be helpful to the candidates there. We've seen him go time and time again to Pennsylvania. Now, later, in the week, tomorrow, he's heading to New York to try to help Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat in a tighter than expected race, as the White House is trying to deploy the president to the areas where he -- they believe that he can be helpful, especially in those blue states where they're trying to shore up support amongst Democrats.",
