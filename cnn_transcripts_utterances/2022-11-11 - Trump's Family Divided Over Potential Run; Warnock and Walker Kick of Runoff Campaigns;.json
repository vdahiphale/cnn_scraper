They're doing their own thing. And, apparently, Trump is OK with that.Donald Trump Jr., however, is eager to join the campaign. His political footprint has exploded since Trump left the White House, of course. And this is all happening under the backdrop of Tiffany Trump's wedding. This is happening this weekend. There's a lot going on. Obviously, the president has - the former president has not been in a great mood, as you just mentioned, going off against Ron DeSantis, et cetera. So, the family will be coming together to discuss the future. I mean this announcement could come next week. But it's going to look different for them. And I think it's just a sign of how perhaps Ivanka and Jared have moved on and Trump Jr. and Donald Trump himself really have not.",

Now, they both held events last night. Take a listen to what they had to say.
