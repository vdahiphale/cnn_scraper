And it comes as both Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, both of whom have a history of inflammatory rhetoric, seem to be putting the two assassination attempts at the center of the campaign, blaming Democrats for both.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, there's a lot of rhetoric going on. A lot of people think that the Democrats, when they talk about a threat to democracy and all of this, and it seems that both of these people were radical lefts. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  No one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months. I'd say that's pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Since Trump showed up, our politics has gone to crap.All right, let's get right to CNN's Alayna Treene for the plans for today. Alayna, what are you learning? Well, John, we actually are going to see Donald Trump publicly today for the first time since this apparent second assassination attempt when he addresses the crowd in Michigan. It's a town hall in Flint, Michigan, hosted by Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, of course, his former press secretary who worked very closely with him. And I think a lot of people are kind of waiting to see how Donald Trump appears visually. Now, I will say we did hear from him last night at 8:00 P.M. Monday evening. He participated in a Twitter Spaces event, and we did hear him kind of walk through some of his reaction. What I found notable was that he recounted what happened on Sunday in detail. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, no doubt, authorities here are still trying to figure out exactly how 58-year-old Ryan Routh knew that the former president was going to be at his golf course here on Sunday.Yesterday, the acting director of the Secret Service said that the former president's visit here was an off-the-record movement. So it's something that wasn't pre-planned. There are also no doubt still trying to figure out exactly just how many days perhaps Routh may have been here in south Florida. As you noted, cell phone data seems to show that Ruth was in the area of the golf course for about 12 hours, nearly 12 hours on Sunday before he was spotted by this Secret Service agent. We're told that he got within 500 yards of the former president. Though it is important to note that, according to law enforcement officials, he did not have a line of sight on the former president. Yesterday, we also got a look at some rather dramatic body camera video showing the moment that Routh was taken into custody about an hour north of here by deputies in Martin County. And we also learned an interesting detail from the sheriff up there about this person who was the one that spotted Routh leaving the golf course. So, this person spots Routh leaving, takes a photo of the car that Routh is in and is able to call 911 and provide all of this information to law enforcement. We're told that this person was taken by helicopter by the sheriff's office, again, about an hour north of here and was able to identify Routh as being the person that they had spotted leaving the golf course here.
