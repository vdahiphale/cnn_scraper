Israeli warplanes have been pounding numerous locations in the territory, hitting targets that Israeli officials describe as strategic to Hamas, but causing what appears to be also widespread destruction in densely populated neighborhoods. Today, Israel's Defense minister ordered the military to put Gaza under what he called complete siege, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to his people tonight warning that what we've just seen is the beginning of his campaign against Hamas, just the beginning. Hamas for its part warned it will begin killing hostages that they have taken and broadcasting those killings if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. It is here as we did last night when we have to warn you about some of the images you'll see in the hour ahead, because again today, new stories and new videos have emerged that show unmistakably, the sheer barbarity of Hamas gunmen, unleashing and what they unleashed on innocent civilians up close, slaughtering hundreds. There is so much sorrow here shrouded in the waking nightmare for those who are missing loved ones or worse, who have witnessed their abduction either in person or on video that they see on social media. People like a woman named Efat (ph), who saw these images of her cousin, Shiri (ph), Shiri's two young children, Arielle just three years old and Kafir just a year old taken by Hamas militants.

But people who've been living here for a lot longer say they've never seen anything like this.We've seen a huge amount of armor, weaponry, manpower, personnel being moved down from Israel, alongside that border. And primarily, initially, it seemed to be a response to dealing with the Hamas militants who were continuing to run amok in areas along that border. There were hundreds of them who infiltrated and it took a couple of days before the Israeli Army felt that they had a decent grip on that. But now the question is as they remain poised there, do they push further in and frankly, to what end? What would that look like? What would it mean for the hostages who are inside the Gaza Strip and would it potentially actually really put an end to this bloody cycle of violence that has been many decades in the making -- Anderson.",

And Hamas will draw on the experience of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which ravaged Israel's armor in 2006, all the while trying to protect the lives of at least 130 hostages that Hamas says they will kill if Israel's attacks continue. Dealing with violent groups backed by Iran, a country that's bent on destroying Israel and building a nuclear weapon that could do just that. Sam Kiley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Why did Hamas choose to strike now? Was it divisions within Israel that they sensed the looming Saudi deal? THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, NEW YORK TIMES FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: I have to believe that the looming Saudi deal was a big factor in this, because we're talking about something that would have been a fundamental geopolitical shift in the region. Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel opens ties up between Israel and really the rest of the Muslim world, possibly Indonesia, Malaysia. It would be a huge strategic shift. But more importantly, Anderson, it also would have had to been done as part of a deal that would have, I think, strengthened the legitimacy of Hamas' arch rival, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Because that normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia could only have been done if Israel also made concessions to the Palestinian Authority, giving it greater control over certain areas in the West Bank, administrative control, putting some kind of freeze and settlements down, and basically reviving hopes for a two-state solution. So I think both of those were in play. And at the same time, I think it sensed that Israel was completely distracted by a needless judicial coup inside, and the two came together properly.",

Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas.They want Israel to occupy Gaza, get enmeshed in a door to door, house to house fighting there, kill a lot of Palestinian civilians, and completely erode the moral high ground that it has right now, which does have real value. That's what they want. They don't care less about their people. If they did, Hamas would have been governing Gaza in a completely different way. I hope that Israel can achieve its goals of restoring its deterrence, getting its hostages back, but doing it in a way that is not going to play in the hands of Hamas.

How are the Palestinians of Gaza better off? But you've just shown Israel, blessedly for Israel, that it had all these vulnerabilities. They will -- the Israelis will study this. They will close them. Hamas has now fired off a lot of weapons, also shown Israel what new missile technology it had. So I think there's a lot of things that Israel can achieve in the long run that will leave Hamas much more weakened without having to go in and try to reoccupy the place. Because if -- you know, maybe there's only one thing worse than Hamas controlling Gaza, and that's nobody controlling Gaza or Israel having to control Gaza.
