And then what we've seen, for three nights in a row, are these brightyellow and red tracers from the air defenses being fired up into the sky. Those are trying to take down those Shahed drones. You can see those spotlights that are searching the sky, looking for the drones. But then you start to hear the much bigger munitions -- the rockets, the interceptor rockets -- going up to try and knock down and destroy the incoming cruise missiles. Sometimes they're successful. You'll see these huge explosions in the sky. The glow just completely lighting up the black sky. Sometimes, like here, the missiles will land. It is -- it can be, certainly, a terrifying experience. Last night we saw families running into the shelters. Again, this was the middle of the night, around 2 a.m. And it's not brief. It lasts for a long time. At the end of these -- at the end of these nights, at the end of these attacks, there is an all-clear that is given by the Ukrainian authorities. Thankfully, there are some very good detection, early detection warning systems put in place, so we do have some sense of what is coming. And people do have, to some extent, some time to get into shelters.

Midnight is the deadline for Trump's lawyers to respond to Smith and to decide if they want to put Trump in front of that stand.

A conspiracy, Phil, means two or more people, meeting of the minds to commit a crime. Does not necessarily mean somebody else will be charged along with Donald Trump, if he's charged. Charges could come later or not at all. But two or more people; that refers to the broad effort to steal the 2020 election. Now, the one you're talking about that's interesting here is deprivation of rights. Let's look at what that means. Forget about all the legalese. The important part here is two or more people, again, getting together to interfere with any right or privilege that a person has under the Constitution of the United States. As we sort of speculated yesterday -- now it looks like we were right -- this looks like it refers to the right of every person to cast a vote and to have that vote counted. And then the third potential charge that we're learning about is witness tampering, but that asterisk is there on purpose. Because we have to be careful here. There is a very broad law called witness tampering, but the titles of law sometimes can be misleading. One section does deal with your typical witness tampering: trying to influence or intimidate a witness. But there's a different subsection within that law that deals with obstruction of an official proceeding. So that could deal with attempts to try to derail Congress from counting the electoral votes, which is different from witness tampering.",

He wanted to walk his case, basically about a half block from state court over to the federal court, where I used to work. Now, why would you want to make that move if you were Donald Trump? Well, you could get -- you would get a different judge. You could have a more favorable jury pool, because in federal court, you're going to pull your jury from many different counties.

He was accused of, you know, getting into basically a fight with people. He was on his way back to Texas. He was actually checked into an American Airlines flight bound for Dallas, where he was going to get kicked out of the Army.

Now, we are standing about five kilometers or so from the actual joint security area where this incident took place on Tuesday. He was able to get on this tour. He took the tour inside the Demilitarized Zone. His name cleared the passenger manifest, which the United Nations had to approve before they let any of those people in there.
