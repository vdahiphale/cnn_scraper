This is likely -- the outcome of this election here in Pennsylvania is likely to determine the outcome of who is going to hold power over the U.S. Senate, so both Republicans and Democrats very, very focused on this race. And we're seeing John Fetterman, the Democrat, and Mehmet Oz the Republican coming together for their first and only debate tonight, the first time these two men will be meeting.And there are some interesting dynamics at play. You'll remember Fetterman is recovering from a stroke he suffered just days before the May primary. He's been very open about his auditory processing issues. He's talked about that and admitted that he does have those. He uses some closed captioning, which we saw this happening over the weekend with an event with Senator Amy Klobuchar. They kind of took this out for a spin. They will be using that same technology at the debate tonight. So, you have Fetterman who's recovering from a stroke and who even by his own campaign and surrogates estimations doesn't love debating isn't his strongest suit appeared up against Mehmet Oz who of course, spent years and years as a television celebrity, a doctor talking on camera all the time. So we will see those dynamics playing out. It's just going to be the two men and the moderators, no audience for this one here in Harrisburg. But we do expect to see them each trying to kind of get an edge in with any undecided or persuadable voters that still exist out there. I have talked to some of them. There are some people who do feel like they still don't know who they might vote for in a race that is so tight and continuing to get tighter and tighter as the polling continues when we get closer to Election Day. Our new CNN polling is showing Fetterman with a slight advantage, 51 percent to 45 percent. And when it came to what issues matter the most of these constituents here, you'll notice it is economy far and wide at the top of there, guys. We do expect to hear a little more about that from them tonight. And what's also intriguing and kind of ironic, both of them trying to paint the other as the most extreme. So keep an eye on that as well, Bianna and Victor.",

It's one or the other. And I think it's important for people to know that it's OK to vote for the lesser of the two evils. It's OK to cross party lines. It's OK to split your vote. What did I see yesterday? I saw a very heated debate. I thought both of them did well. I actually have forgotten how Charlie Crist was as a debater, and he was better than I expected. As far as that question of whether Ron DeSantis is going to run in 2024, I don't know that that changes anything. I think it's kind of baked in the cake in Florida. Basically, if you live in Florida and our elected official and you drink the water here, you think you can be present, you know. You have, of course, Rex, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, so I don't think it's something that sways that influences the way people vote. BLACKWELL: Yes, I was thinking about this. Some Democrats are pointing out that Ron DeSantis did not commit to a full-term, Congressman. He didn't raise nine figures to be reelected, just as governor of Florida, right?

But you know, I think people are compassionate and I think people can relate to those who are going through illness or going through medical issues. And it's not a rare thing in the U.S. Senate, right? Just recently, there's been two U.S. senators who have been stricken with strokes, have recovered, and are back working in the Senate. I'm talking about Senator Lujan and Senator Van Hollen.Pennsylvanians are used to people like Senator Specter who continue to work as a senator while battling cancer. You know, we all remember John McCain, who single-handedly with one thumb, save Obamacare while battling a battle he ultimately lost, glioblastoma. So, I -- you know, I think Americans know people get sick. I think Americans know people go through medical circumstances, and many recover, and many have to continue working through it. To me, that makes them more relatable.

As a matter of fact, if you look at the even bigger picture, 20 percent of Americans haven't gotten a single COVID shot. Over the past couple of years, they haven't gotten a single COVID shot, 20 percent of Americans. So, the CDC and others have a lot of work to do on how to do good vaccine education.

And for many of us who have had our primary series and have had our boosters, some people tend to have fatigue, muscle pain, headache after the vaccine, and some people tend to have no side effects.But there is new research in the journal JANA -- JAMA Network Open, excuse me, that finds that -- or it suggests that people who do have some of these side effects it's associated with possibly having a greater antibody response elicited from the vaccine. But the researchers also note that if you do not have side effects, do not be concerned. Of course, the vaccine still elicits an immune response for you. Among more than 900 study participants, antibody reactivity was observed in 98 percent of people who were asymptomatic did not have these side effects. And of course, antibody reactivity was observed and 99 percent of those who did. So this is interesting research that kind of puts into perspective how our vaccines will become routine possibly on an annual basis and how we should think of when we feel crummy after the vaccine and what exactly that might mean, Victor and Bianna.",
