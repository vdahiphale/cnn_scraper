You - you, in an earlier segment, mentioned there are people who had not seen the Obamas speak publicly.

They were - they were taking everything down with them. They were cascading. And what we're seeing now is rising tides lift all boats. You know, what we're seeing at the D-trip (ph) for congressional races is, many, many more volunteers, dollars raised, polls changing. The task that the Vice President Harris had was, unite the party, ignite the base and change the polls. We're three for three. What you're seeing this week is a continuation of that momentum. But, you know, going after those swing voters, because again, as you just mentioned, it's still going to be close and the message last night - last night was, get to work. It's not a self- fulfilling prophecy. You've got to carry it across the finish line.",

There's a lot more work to do.But campaigns, who your referenced before, it's a little like Tom Sawyer convincing people that it's fun to paint that fence. It's not always fun. It's hard work. You have to leave your family, knock on doors, get on phones. It's stressful. It's - you know. But there's a part of it that can be very dynamic. And I think last night feeds into that.

We are seeing numbers grow with young voters, with black voters, with Hispanic voters. Getting to the levels where Joe Biden was.But there is still a sizable amount of voters, particularly in those battleground states, according to the polls, that think she's too liberal. They're concerned about her policies. On the economy and immigration, coming in, Donald Trump was winning on those key issues, which is a big reason why a lot of those Republicans say focus on policies not personality. Don't make this a personality contest. So, can she make that pivot to the middle? And to some extent at least woo those disaffected Republican and independent leaning Republican voters?
