Now, a couple of things to note about Dr. Oz, in addition to being a television doctor, he also is somebody that Donald Trump put up for Senate in 2022 in Pennsylvania and lost. He was very unhappy with Dr. Oz at that point, but obviously, they have cleared the air since then, since he is naming him as part of his administration. Part of the statement reads, he is an eminent physician heart surgeon, inventor and world class communicator. I really wanted to highlight that point, Jake, because as we continue to see these names drip out, so many of them, are being chosen because Donald Trump and his team believe that they can be an effective communicator because of their experience on television. He wants them out there defending him, defending the administration. He wants people who can actually communicate. Remember, one of the ways he's choosing them is watching clips of them on television. And obviously with doctor oz, there was a lot to choose from there.",

The other candidate at that point had been Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager.We still don't know if Bessent is the only one left. We have been told that they had expanded the list. He did a number of interviews over the last two days with new candidates for secretary of treasury. We'll see if we get that tonight. Just remember this is one of the biggest positions that is left.

It's there. We're about five miles away. We can see it there in the distance. And as after that rocket launches, what is propelling it up is something called the super heavy booster. And what is interesting about this particular launch is that it is designed to come back to the launch pad. There was a test back in October where you saw these mechanical arms on the launch pad. There returned the super heavy booster and catch it. And bring it back into place. That is the attempt here is to replicate that there is a possibility that it does not go as planned, and then the rest of the spacecraft continues on and supposedly in about an hour or so after the launch, the spacecraft will crash into the Indian Ocean, where it will sink to the bottom of the water there. So, it will be incredibly dramatic for the thousands of people, Jake, that are here. They will hear several sonic booms. One of those is the launch itself, and then those two pieces will separate, and then they'll once again seven minutes later is when that super heavy booster is expected to return back toward the area of the launch pad and you will hear another boom. Then, as those rockets propel that machinery back here to the Boca Chica launch pad here in south Texas.

Elon Musk has had an impact on this transition period and shaping what it's looked like. Jake, I have been down here in Palm Beach almost every day since Trump won the election as we've been talking to sources about this transition process and the one recurring theme that has happened in almost every interview that I've talked to people, that they've gone into, or conversations they've had, is Elon Musk has been in the room or in Donald Trump's ear and speaking with him on this. It's not a surprise that Donald Trump wanted to go to this space launch today, Jake. You've seen him and heard him marvel at SpaceX on the campaign trail time and time again. It was in almost every single speech, actually that he was doing close to the end of the 2024 campaign, where he was marveling at one of the reusable rocket boosters as it was being recaptured. Trump was talking about watching it live on TV, leaving some billionaire donor on hold while they were talking. And you're seeing that continue.
