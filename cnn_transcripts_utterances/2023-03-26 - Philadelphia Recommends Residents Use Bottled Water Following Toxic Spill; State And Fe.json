I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we begin with major developments out of Pennsylvania.The Philadelphia Water Department now saying it's confident that tap water from a main water treatment plan will remain safe to drink and use through at least 8:00 tonight. Just in for the past few hours, the city urged residents to use bottled water following a toxic chemical spill in the nearby Delaware River. It happened along a tributary in the Bristol township area of Bucks County Friday night. Phillies municipal water serves more than two million people. The city send push alerts to cell phones today urging people to drink bottled water, quote, \"out of caution\" due to potential dangers posed by that chemical spill. Some stores had already started limiting bottled water sales because of shortages. CNN's Danny Freeman is live for us in Philadelphia. So, Danny, some mixed messages there. So Philadelphia Water saying it is OK to drink but then at the same time it's encouraging people to get bottled water?",

That's the phrase that we keep hearing from Philadelphia city officials when it comes to this particular water situation, but, again, as you said, despite those mixed messaging people here in Philadelphia, they got that alert on their phones. We all got that alert who lived in Philadelphia, and it has not stopped people from coming to supermarkets like this Acme behind me and rushing to get water.We just got here a little while ago and this Acme, it's a big one in South Philadelphia, and we went up there and they are already out. They are finished with water. The last few people were able to get a little bit -- a couple of jugs earlier. But aside from that, all of the water is gone here, and people have been trying to figure out, well, do I get vitamin water? Do I get some of these, you know, other water brands that have, you know, flavors in it? But the regular bottled water that people were told that they should be thinking about using tonight through the afternoon into the evening by the city, they can't get here. We're seeing and we're hearing that other stores in the area have felt that. So again, let's go back to what we do know, though, about this spill again. It all started Friday night about 20 miles north of here in Bucks County in a township that's called Bristol. A chemical spill happened there from the company and almost immediately the coast guard, the state environmental protection workers, they all went up there to try and figure out what had happened and to control the contamination. But then it was this morning that city officials came out and said, listen, out of an abundance of caution because the Delaware River is one of the main sources of water for the city of Philadelphia, we've decided to say to Philadelphians, it might be good to boil your water and to use bottled water if at all possible. And we asked, I should say we asked questions as to what exactly is in this water that makes it dangerous, take a look or listen rather to one of the city officials said earlier this morning.

And of course, we've seen these protests going on now for some 13 weeks every Thursday, every Saturday evening. This is a Sunday evening. This is not a normal time that these people you see here come out on the streets to protest, but they have done so in direct response to Netanyahu's sacking of his defense minister. We heard from the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, former prime minister of course, saying that this is just effectively Netanyahu looking after himself again at the cost of the state of Israel security because Yoav Gallant is a very respected military man. He was obviously the minister of defense and the sacking of him is not something that is taken lightly in this country where the defense establishment and where most adults served in the army at some point in their lives. And so it's a very big move by Netanyahu. And I suppose what really happened here is that there was hope. There was hope on Saturday evening on the part of these protesters and on the part of people in Israel who are against this judicial overhaul that you have Gallant's statement that is called report to this judicial overhaul would put pressure on Netanyahu, on the prime minister, to do exactly that, to pause this overhaul. But the sacking of Yoav Gallant simply means that Netanyahu is not going to be accepting challenges to his authority of the overhaul. This judicial overhaul will continue. And now the other people in his own Likud Party will see what's happened to the defense minister, they would perhaps be thinking twice before they too come out against this judicial overhaul, which is very much supported by Netanyahu and which could and which will in its current state pretty much removed all checks and balances on the government by allowing it to put its allies in the Supreme Court and preventing the Supreme Court from striking down laws passed by the government except in very narrow circumstances. So all these thousands of people you see here out on the street this evening to show their support for Yoav Gallant, the ex-defense minister, and their opposition, reiterating their opposition to the judicial overhaul that Gallant called to be paused and which has now cost him his job -- Fredricka.",

You know, on the left, it's all about, well, this is because of the Dodd-Frank rollback and Trump's anti-regulatory posture, which might be true but we don't necessarily know yet if that was the reason why there was an oversight failure.And on the right it's a combination of blaming woke banks, which is sort of patently ridiculous as well as categorically denying that the roll back -- the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank could have had anything to do with it. So I would love to think that these lawmakers are going into these hearings with an open mind, but I suspect that there is going to be some grand standing prioritizing over necessarily seeking out the truth.",

So I don't think that it's a complete loss that there will be some additional testimony that gets on the record this coming week, but I think what is required to restore faith in the banking system probably requires supervisors, regulators being relatively open about what they got wrong, stepping up their oversight in the meantime when there are reasonable things to anticipate going wrong again in the future, as interest rates continue to rise.And basically just maintaining vigilance over the financial sector because when interest rates rise this quickly, which to be clear I think that they have needed to rise. You know, we've had a problem with inflation, but when they do rise this quickly that can cause things to break. And we need the regulators, the supervisors paying closer attention to what potentially could go wrong and giving greater assurances to the public that they're not asleep at the switch.",

There's a lot of ambiguity about the fraction of deposits that are not under that threshold, what happens to them, and right now the ambiguity I fear is leading people to pull their money -- you know, small businesses that have to make payroll that might have an account larger than that, for example, they might be pulling their money out of the smaller and regional banks and into the larger banks.You might also fear that on the other -- on the flip side ah, the managers of these banks perceive that all of their deposits are in fact fully insured when they may not be and might take bigger risks as a result, so I just think it would be very helpful to have some clarity about what the actual policy is under what circumstances we could expect the Fed, the FDIC, the Treasury secretary to step in and say if there's another run on a bank this means we will treat it as fully insured or not. We will abide by the usual $250,000 cap. And right now, I worry that we have kind of the worst of both worlds, both deposit flight and potentially what economists call moral hazard, basically more gambling with people's deposits.",
