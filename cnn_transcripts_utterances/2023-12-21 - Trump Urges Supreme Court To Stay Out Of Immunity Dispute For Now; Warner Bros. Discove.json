It's not exactly clear why this video was only located yesterday. But there is some indication that this military canine was actually killed by Hamas fighters during a firefight between Israeli soldiers and these Hamas fighters who were apparently holding those three Israelis hostage. And there's some indication that perhaps the soldiers didn't go into that building for days to retrieve that canines body as well as this video camera.But once this footage was actually analyzed, just two days ago, it was clear that you could hear the voices of those three Israeli hostages according to the Israeli military. At the same time, we're also getting reaction from the mother of one of those hostages who was killed by Israeli soldiers. And she actually delivered a voice note to the unit that was involved in this incident and in it, she tells them not to blame themselves. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IRIS HAIM, MOTHER OF SLAIN HOSTAGE YOTAM HAIM (thought translator): I know that everything that happened is completely not your fault, it's nobody's fault except the mass. May their name and memory be wiped off the face of the earth. We all need you to be safe and sound. Don't hesitate for a single moment. If you see a terrorist, don't think that you have deliberately killed a hostage. You need to protect yourselves because that's the only way you would be able to protect us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump's team argued that a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. should rule first. Now we wait to see what the court will do.And as we wait, joining us now former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short. Marc, I appreciate your time this morning. There's a lot to get to in terms of where things stand. But I want to start there with the Trump team. This is a dilatory tactic, one that they're well within their rights to make, but they have been quite clear that they're trying to push these cases off, particularly the Jack Smith cases until after the election. I know the Vice President and you repeatedly said while you guys were campaigning, that this should be up to the American voters, not the justice system. Do you still maintain that?",

We're actually a district court had ruled that the executive privilege was not blanketed immunity. And the Special Counsel asked the Supreme Court to take up that case. And they did. And the Supreme Court ruled that no, the executive privilege is not something that is blanketed. And that happened within two months, the district court had ruled in May of '74. Supreme Court came down in July. And I think therefore, there is a precedent in this case for the Supreme Court to follow in denying the notion that executive privilege applies even when there's been potential criminal activity.",

I find it, you know, disquieting, that the events leading up to January 6th are much more disqualifying. And a Republican primary is the state of where the party is and where many of our conservative leaders are.But I'm not one who advocates the legal system should be the one that Trump's, the opinion of American voters. And I think that it's really one that has to be brought to the American voter make a case and still remained as much as I've articulated. My belief that the President's actions were wrong around January 6th, that there's a question, a real question whether or not that necessarily means it was illegal. It was wrong. It was I think, who asked the vice president to basically put aside his oath to the Constitution should be disqualified.

At the same time, though, it's not something that I would want to be in a camp that's looking to help elect Joe Biden, because I believe so many of his policies are hurting our country.

Warner Brothers Discovery of course owns CNN, a potential merger would create an entertainment and news juggernaut encompassing Warner Brothers and Paramount Studios as well as CBS, this network, of course and a number of other cable T.V. assets.The talks are said to be in the early stages. There are still major questions about how this deal would work. So who may have the answers, the reporter who broke the story, CNN senior media analyst and senior media reporter for Axios, Sara Fischer. Good to see you this morning. It's always a little awkward when you're talking about a story that involves the company where you work. But a lot of people looking at this not just our colleagues this morning is and trying to understand what's the upside here? We're talking about a lot of debt.

And that matters for people watching, because right now, we're all toggling between so many different streaming services, and our bills are going up. And what consolidation would mean is that some of those services would likely come together. So you're thinking -- you're talking about having fewer things that you have to pay for, have to navigate through, it also means that there's going to be different types of deals for your favorite kind of entertainment content.Think about it, if you love Yellowstone, for example, it's confusing, right? Because Paramount might have the rights but they license them out to different companies. Well, if there's more consolidation, it might be easier to navigate where your favorite shows go and where they exist. And so I think this might be good for consumers. The question, though, and Erica brought up the regulatory concern is whether or not regulators think this is good for consumers. And in the past, Phil, there have been concerns about whether or not these types of mergers actually, you know, eliminate competition, and especially in things like diversity of programming, we'll have to see what they say.",

And regulator said, look, we'll let that go through but you have to divest some of your networks. You can kind of see that might be playing out here. I mean, there's not a broadcast company that's owned by Warner Brothers Discovery. So that makes it easier to merge. You can't put two broadcast networks together.But they both owned like minded cable networks. I mean, that could be a place where regulators might want to take a look at it. Where this is different, though, is that the climate is so different. When you think about those mergers that happened a few years ago, Fox and Disney, think about Viacom and CBS coming back together to form Paramount. You think about your company right, Discovery buying Warner Media. That happened at a time before the pandemic when streaming was not as intense as it is today.

So an example this could be for a patient who's considering a four-day to 30-day prescription for opioid pain medications for after a surgery, for instance.So these are the kinds of patients who this kind of test is for. And the intention is really to assess them before they possibly start on a pain medication.

Now, I will say Erica and Phil, there are some experts out there who are making the argument that simply asking a patient their family history of addiction may be just as efficient.So there are some complexities when it comes to genetics. But overall, whether you ask a family history or you conduct this test, assessing the risk for opioid use disorder is so important because just last year, about 6 million people ages 12 and older had opioid use disorders here in the United States. And it's estimated that more than 83,000 people nationwide die of opioid related overdose deaths each year. So this is an ongoing issue for the country. The opioid epidemic is ongoing. And this test looks like it's just one additional tool that can be used to address this ongoing public health concern.",
