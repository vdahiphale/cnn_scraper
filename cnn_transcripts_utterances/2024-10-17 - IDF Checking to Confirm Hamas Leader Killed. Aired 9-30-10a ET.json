Because there are a lot of questions, if it is true that the Israeli military has taken out the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, then what happens next and what needs to be worried about? For example, the hostages and the war itself.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Thanks for having me.You know, this is the Middle East. I don't usually believe in game- changers or inflection points. They have a way of being ground up in the daily grind of this conflict. But this is a big rock dropped in a lake and the ripples are quite extraordinary. If - if - and Secretary Blinken, I think, is right, Yahya Sinwar was the preeminent Palestinian decision maker responsible for the terrorist surge of October 7th, inflicting a degree of cruelty and pain on Israeli civilians, unprecedent in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Then the question becomes, if he is the pre-eminent decision maker, who - who ultimately will make decisions on so many issues? Who is going to essentially plan Hamas' military strategy. The Israelis killed Hassan Nasrallah. He's dead. Hezbollah survives. What impact will this have on command and control with respect to Hamas' continued insurgency and military campaign? Second is the issue of hostages. We know from the tragedy, the willful execution of six hostages, that the standing orders were, if Israeli patrols approach, kill your hostages. Does this enhance the prospects of negotiations leading to a deal, or does it injected the kind of uncertainty that is going to jeopardize and fundamentally mean that the 101 hostages, half of whom the Israelis believe are no longer alive, what - what are the prospects now for their release? Sinwar does have a deputy, at least on paper, Halila Hiya (ph). He's in Qatar. He's been sort of subbing when negotiations, brokered by the Qataris and the Egyptians, were ongoing. Does he matter in this sense? And then to Barak Ravid's point, the reality is, you're not talking a year of this confrontation. Hamas as a military organization and has been more or less decimated. It could survive as an - as an insurgency, but will this provide the kind of political explanation and justification for Benjamin Netanyahu to begin to seriously consider, to cooperate in a way to try to de-escalate and ultimately end the war in Gaza. These questions, I think, are unanswerable right now. But the ripples are quite clear. One additional point. You know this - how they found him. I mean this is an example perhaps of hiding in plain sight. You have a tunnel system half the - half the length of the New York - New York subway system. Sinwar may well have been moving from tunnel to tunnel. They killed Mohammed Deif because he's surfaced at a team meeting. And the Israelis were able to target and eliminate him. So, again, there's a lot of TikTok on this backstory that has yet to be revealed. But it is, I think, a transformative moment in - in the war in Gaza.",

We continue to ask about that as well. In the meantime, let's bring in chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt. Alex, you've been working your sources as well. What are you hearing about this and the significance truly if Sinwar is dead?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, no doubt massively significant. And just to follow on what Aaron was saying there, I think the real question that not only we are asking, but U.S. officials are asking this morning, because they don't know the answer to it is, to what extent would the death of Sinwar be an off ramp for Netanyahu? You have an organization, a military organization, and a governmental organization in Gaza, that has been severely crippled. Around half of their fighters, according to IDF estimates, have been killed. The senior most echelon, many of them also taken out. Mohammed Deif, the head of the military wing, his deputy Marwan Issa, now possibly the head of the entire organization, Yahya Sinwar. So, does this provide a moment for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare victory?It was hard for U.S. officials to see how Israel could say that they had won the war with Hamas without killing Sinwar. So, they have looked at this potential moment for months as that tipping point, as that moment where Netanyahu would be able to say, look, we have taken them out militarily. And the U.S. agrees with that, that they would not be able to carry out another massacre, another attack like October 7th. They have taken them out in terms of their political and governance structure. They're not the organization they once were. So, can Netanyahu now say the war is over? And what are the ramifications after that? What are the other dominos after that? Because you have other militant organizations, terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, the Houthis, who have all said that we are attacking Israel because of what Israel is doing in Gaza. And once that war ends, so too will our efforts against Israel. Now, the horse is already out of the barn when it comes to Lebanon. Israel is fully - has dived in headfirst into a conflict there. Those operations are fully underway. But this is a real moment that U.S. officials will look at as a possibility where they will be able to, yet again, tell the Israelis, your war in Gaza is won. It needs to end. We need to come to some kind of ceasefire agreement. Of course, you know, Aaron and the other guests have been saying that that - those conversations have been dead in the water for quite some time now. This will be a time when U.S. officials will say we can perhaps revive that. Major questions, of course, about the hostages. It's not like with the death of Sinwar that suddenly Hamas is up - going to up and release those hostages. There will certainly still need to be negotiations. But the Biden administration and, of course, they have not confirmed this yet because they are waiting for the Israeli confirmation, but they will look at this as a real opportunity to end, not just the war in Gaza, but the rapidly expanding conflicts across the region.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, U.S. officials officially has been quite quiet so far as the IDF has said that they are investigating whether an operation did, in fact, kill Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a bit earlier today, but it - or at some point. But if this is confirmed that he has been killed, it would have major implications and ramifications for the Biden administration and their push to try to end this war.U.S. officials have repeatedly said that they believe Sinwar is one of the main obstacles in place to try to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. As recently as Tuesday, the White House - a spokesperson, John Kirby, has said that there were no fresh negotiations to end this war, and that part of that is because Sinwar had no interest in having serious discussions at this matter. But U.S. officials have long viewed the potential death of Sinwar as a major game changer in this conflict. Officials have clung to hope that this could maybe serve as an - if - if he were to be confirmed dead, that this could potentially serve as a path the trying to find an end to this war. One thing that officials and people have been talking about on our air believe is that if Sinwar were to die, perhaps this would be enough of a catalyst for Israel to decide that many of its objectives in this war have been achieved. Now, of course, even as they are seen arguing that this could potentially be an off-ramp to this war, it's still unclear exactly how all of this will pan out. I will note, President Biden is currently on a plane to Germany. He is traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan. They were sent to have meetings there relating to Ukraine. But certainly they will be watching these developments in the coming hours very closely as this could have a major effect on the way that this war has been proceeding at this time.",

Barak, for the Palestinians who have been caught in the middle of this horrific war, you have said that if Sinwar has indeed been killed, if that has what has been determined by the Israeli military, that it could give Prime Minister Netanyahu and off-ramp to get out of this war. But there is something that is a sticking point here. The 101 hostages who are still in Gaza, whose families have been begging Netanyahu to get them out safely. What might this mean for them?",

      "sentences": "So, first, about the Palestinians in Gaza. You know, one of the amazing things I saw on social media by Palestinians who are in Gaza right now, on October - on the one year anniversary of October 7th, the amount of curses and, you know, harsh criticism against Sinwar for, you know, leading Gaza to where it is right now was pretty astonishing to watch.On the hostage deal, two things. First, Prime Minister Netanyahu asked the IDF to inform all the hostage families that no hostages were harmed in this incident. Second, I think that this really can be on the one hand an opportunity get to a hostage deal. On the other hand, there's also a big risk here because Sinwar was the leader that was a centrally - centralist leader. He was in control. Without him, you now have several Hamas commanders and warlords who are holding hostages. And it might be even more complicated now to get a deal.",
