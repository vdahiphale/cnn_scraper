We will continue to monitor this press conference, but history made in the House today.You just heard from Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who will be the first black leader to lead one of the parties in either chamber of Congress. Democrats just chose Jeffries, a representative from New York, to succeed Nancy Pelosi in the party's top spot in the House for the incoming Congress And CNN's Melanie Zanona is joining us at the Capitol. Melanie, Jeffries is breaking a barrier here that has been up for centuries in Congress. This isn't just symbolic, though. How is he going to reshape things for House Democrats?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is definitely a new era for House Democrats. Aside from being the first black leader of any party, Hakeem Jeffries is also going to be the youngest leader at age 52. I know it doesn't sound that young, but around here it is compared to the previous leaders in Democratic leadership.Hakeem Jeffries, as leader, has promised to also give junior members more say in the legislative process, give them more opportunities to be involved in writing bills, and to give them more opportunities for high-profile positions. That obviously is a nod to some of the frustrations that have been pent up in the Democratic Party for many years. But a big part of Jeffries' job as minority leader is going to be beating back against the GOP investigations and potential impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden's administration. He does not have a very good working relationship, if at all, with Kevin McCarthy, who's in line to become speaker next year. They have had somewhat of a contentious relationship in the press. So we will see how that relationship plays out. But there are going to be moments when they need to work together because McCarthy will likely be working with a razor-thin majority. That means he's going to be leaning on Hakeem Jeffries to supply him Democratic votes for things like funding the government or raising the debt ceiling. That's going to be a huge fight. But it's also important to point out that Hakeem Jeffries had the blessing of his predecessor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hakeem Jeffries was part of her leadership team. And my colleague Daniella Diaz reported that they hugged today during this internal closed-door leadership election during the speeches and that another member, Gregory Meeks, stood up and said the passing the baton is the most important part in the relay race. So that is the mood inside the Democratic Caucus right now. And it was a really important passing of the torch moment from Pelosi to Jeffries.",

Here's why keeping trains running is so critical for so many Americans. Experts say, if they stopped, supply chains would halt, prices on everyday goods would surge even higher than they already are, and millions of commuters wouldn't have rides. Bottom line, the U.S. economy would lose an estimated $1 billion in just the first week. Let's get the latest from the Hill. CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is joining us. Manu, some unions have set this deal on the table that was reached back in September doesn't go far enough. They want more paid sick time. Lawmakers today are trying to get them more. What's the status?",

He's the director of strategic coordination and research for the BMWED union, representing roughly 24,000 track maintenance workers. Peter, thanks for joining us. I know this issue of sick leave is an important issue for you. But we -- if we can put the graphic back up, I want to show our viewers the deal as we know it that was reached back in September, a deal reached by the majority of unions previously, although I know your union was not one who signed off on this, but it does include an immediate 14 percent raise with back pay to 2020, a 24 percent pay increase by 2024, $1,000 annual bonuses for five years, no health care cost increases. This includes the biggest raise in 50 years for union members. Are you letting the perfect be the enemy of the good by rejecting this?",

      "sentences": "Thank you for having me on, Ana.Absolutely not. Look, we appreciate the recommendations of the Presidential Emergency Board, but, frankly, it was long overdue. Railroads have made record profits year after year, quarter after quarter, and they have went around the country bragging about it, all while their services have just deteriorated. And those profits came at a time when the economy has faced numerous challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. And these workers were put out there in harm's way and kept the country running. And it made very clear during the pandemic that railroad workers need and deserve paid sick leave. Now, I want to address something very quickly. Health and welfare, you said that there's no increases to that. The health and welfare costs are going to go up $100 a month for our members. And that's a substantial increase, by the way. But I also want to address one other thing about this, because the implication is that these workers are getting huge raises, and which, again, they're respectable. I heard Senator -- I'm sorry -- Congressman Graves during the debate, saying that railroad workers make $130,000 a year, they make $160,000 a year. Well, that's just a lie. A railroad worker makes $85,000 a year at the end of this contract. That's what they bring home, which by -- or -- I'm sorry -- $80,000 a year. That's still $3,000 less a year than shills like Graves received from the railroads in political contributions. So it's pretty rich for a guy who makes $174,000 a year to get up there and rail against people that are trying to make his country run, that are trying to make his state move and get goods to the customers and to the people out there. It's just ridiculous and despicable. And, frankly, it's offensive.",

By 292 to 137 was the vote.There were 79 Republicans who voted for it. There were eight Democrats who voted against it, so largely bipartisan. Now, this essentially would implement that September rail agreement between the unions, some of the unions, and the industry. It does not have the paid sick leave that the labor unions have been demanding. The House is about to vote on an amendment to include the paid sick leave, but because of the process the House is using, the Senate can essentially ignore the paid sick leave provision and then pass the bill that does not include it, simply implementing the September agreement that was reached between the two sides. So, it was expected -- this was expected to happen in the House, expected also along party lines, with some bipartisan support, but dozens of Republicans did vote for it. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, as he walked into the chamber, told me he was going to vote against this plan. So it's uncertain whether it had much support among top Republicans, but it did have 79 Republicans who voted for it, and Democrats who voted against it, fewer than 10. Eight Democrats voted against it, as the rest of the Democratic Caucus voted for it. So, this passed the House today. The question now is, how quickly will it pass the Senate, as Democratic leaders are pressing to get it done tomorrow in the Senate with bipartisan support, and the expectation is, they will get there, but they still need to reach an agreement to schedule that vote -- Ana.",

This is an issue about protecting the economy, about protecting the railroad workers, and about protecting our supply chain.

And the fact of the matter is, the railroads, and their utter arrogance, they refused to engage with us in any sort of meaningful way. And if they did, if they did engage with us meaningfully throughout this round, guess what? We would have never needed a Presidential Emergency Board. We would have never needed Congress to step in.

Now this marks the first time a jury has agreed that elements of the Capitol attack were part of a preplanned effort to overthrow the government and to subvert the Constitution. It's a major win for the Justice Department, even though it was a split verdict on that top- line count. Three of the defendants were found not guilty.

And I think it sends a message to the other Oath Keepers awaiting trial and to the Proud Boys that there is real jeopardy here. They have shown now that they can convict people. So I think there's a deterrent effect, for sure.

I mean, there was a uniform conviction by the jury on the obstruction of the official proceeding. So, as a prosecutor, I might take from that, oh, that concept is a little bit easier for the jury to grasp, and I would want to make my presentation of seditious conspiracy more akin to the obstruction one, to make it more easy access for the jury.",
