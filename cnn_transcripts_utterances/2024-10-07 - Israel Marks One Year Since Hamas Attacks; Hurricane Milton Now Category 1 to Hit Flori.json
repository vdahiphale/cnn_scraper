And in the hours ahead, other commemorations will be held for victims of the attacks. Ahead of the one-year anniversary, images of the hostages taken by Hamas that day were projected onto the walls of Jerusalem's old city. As of today, the Israeli prime minister's office says there are a total of 101 hostages in Gaza, including 35 believed to be already dead. The mother of one victim had this heartbreaking message.

I stand before you today, dear family, wanting to shout that I am not miserable because none of this actually happened. I'm still in denial.

People who survived coming back, looking for closure, not finding it. Families coming, telling me this is like the day after it happened. They don't believe that their loved ones are dead and gone. I don't think you can -- I can't put it into -- into words for what this means for people. Everyone just flinched just now, because not far away, there's an artillery position that's sort of firing towards Gaza. There's a huge military presence around here, but also reinforcement around Gaza, in essence, to allow this commemoration to happen so close to Gaza, just -- just a couple of miles away. We know that there have been military operations inside of Gaza over the past couple of days, 25 people killed yesterday when the IDF targeted a mosque there. They said it was a Hamas location. It's clear that the tempo has picked up in the past few days, but here, I think what you're seeing is the mood set here for a very solemn and very somber day. And I think it was the images from here, a year ago that really were the first powerful images for people as they were trying to grapple with what was actually happening. Of course, everyone here fleeing for their lives. But those images of rockets flying over the musical -- the music at the festival everyone in panic, everyone running, trying to get in their vehicles. And gunned down, not just here at the festival site, 340 -- more than 340 killed. The people also chased and gunned down at the nearby kibbutz all around the area, hundreds more gunned down there. So, this was kind of the moment when the country, when it got the images from here, began to understand, and the world began to understand what was happening. So, the president of Israel here, Isaac Herzog, arrived a little while ago. I saw him greeting with and talking with family members. He's expected to give a speech in a little while. The detonation that you're here as they say that Gaza is not far away, the IDF and their artillery positions not far away, firing in the direction of Gaza. And I think -- you know, this site has become a place of pilgrimage for so many families over the past year. Clearly, it will continue to be so. It changes. I've been here many times, been here with one of the survivors. And she told -- showed me where she hid in the bushes and watched as her friends begged for their lives, she said, before they were killed. This is now a place, not just a place in the desert where beautiful flowers grow, but this is now -- it has paths. It has car parks.

And we estimate that about 400,000 of those children -- that's several football stadiums full of children -- displaced from their homes with almost nothing. The families that I've spoken to here tell me that many had to leave in the middle of the night with only the clothes that they are wearing.

It would have a tremendous toll on the children here, because of course, Lebanon was already a vulnerable population before this conflict. They've been through five years of economic collapse.
