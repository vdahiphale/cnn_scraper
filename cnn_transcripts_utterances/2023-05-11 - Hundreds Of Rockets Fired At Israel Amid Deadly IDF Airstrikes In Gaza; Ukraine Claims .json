Last week, we saw over 100 rockets that were fired into Israeli cities at the time, Israel did not really retaliate. And what we saw Tuesday morning with the targeting of those three Islamic Jihad operatives was Israel's response to what had happened before.This was an act of self-defense. Just over the last 48 hours, we've seen over 500 rockets fired towards Israel, some of them landing inside Gaza, those are failed launches, but several 100 of close to 400 landing and crossing into Israel, many of them intercepted by Israel's missile defense system. I think that I don't know that there's a solution. I don't know that in the way that we want to look at this kind of with our Western eyes, Rosemary, we can see a solution or an end to this conflict. What we sadly have at the foundation is a desire by some Palestinian terrorist groups to try to kill Israelis to target them and their civilians with these rockets. And with cross border tunnels, there is an attempt by an anti-tank missile squad in the Gaza Strip to target Israeli vehicles traveling along the border. This is something that we've seen over the last 20 years coming from Gaza, and until the Palestinians lay down their arms. Unfortunately, this is going to continue and Israel will have to do what it needs to do, which is defend itself.",

Israel is not taking out the entire building. It's trying to be as accurate, as surgical and as precise as it can be.Unfortunately, we know though, that these terrorists embed themselves within civilian infrastructure, they hide behind what are called human shields. They purposely and intentionally use children and women and other civilians, thinking that this will provide them with immunity. And unfortunately, this is the reality. It's a terrible reality, every loss of life is tragic. But we also have to keep in mind, Israel does have to find a way to be able to defend itself and taking out these terrorists is way that is able to impair their operational capabilities.

We've seen some reports that what they want, for examples, the return of a body of one of their terrorists from Israel, they want a cessation of all targeting of their top operatives and their top militants and terrorists. They would like to see Israel stop targeting and going after their infrastructure in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory.So they're making conditions. Israel will not agree to all of this. And I think what you're seeing is Israel, keeping up the pressure on them to A, weaken their capability, but also get them to understand they're not going to walk away with the win. It's important for these terrorist organizations to understand that force is not what's going to make them come out victorious from this. They're not going to destroy Israel. They're not going, you know, they're able to cause damage. They're able to terrorize Israeli civilians with these hundreds of rockets that are raining down on our cities.

And CNN's Ivan Watson has more now from Hong Kong.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The dramatic arrest of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday has touched off a firestorm in Pakistan with two competing narratives here, the government and the military arguing that they're carrying out rule of law that they're arresting a politician who was resisting arrest and he's accused of corruption charges he and his supporters deny and his supporters are accusing the government of abducting him and basically ripping up rule of law in the country. Now, Imran Khan after being detained overnight was brought to the police headquarters where he appeared before a judge. We're not seeing him shown in public. The police don't seem to want to show him and his lawyer says that Imran Khan had bruises that he claimed he was beaten overnight, that he's being kept in a dirty room without even being provided a toothbrush. This is what one of his supporters had to say kept outside of a cordon for outside the police headquarters where police periodically fired tear gas to keep demonstrators at bay. HASSAN RASHEED, IMRAN KHAN SUPPORTER (through translator): We're standing here for the truth. If we have to give our lives, we'll even take a bullet but one that anything happened to Imran Khan.",

I'm Rosemary Church.Well, the prime suspect in the disappearance of American student Natalee Holloway in Aruba 18 years ago is heading to the United States to face charges. Peru has agreed to temporarily extradite Joran Van Der Sloot to Alabama, where prosecutors want to try him for extortion and wire fraud. Van Der Sloot has been serving 28 years in a Peruvian prison for murdering the young student he met in a casino in 2010. Holloway's parents say the extradition means they will finally get justice for Natalee. U.S. officials, federal agents and migrants seeking asylum are all bracing for the end of Title 42 in less than 24 hours. Hundreds of troops are set to begin anew mission along the southern border as the COVID era policy expires at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Thursday night. The measure allowed federal authorities to swiftly expel migrants. The head of the U.S. Border Patrol is downplaying a potential surge of asylum seekers. He says the bulk of the influx is already behind them. Still, officials in cities along the border are taking action. The mayor of Laredo, Texas, says the city is preparing as if, quote, it's a hurricane coming. In El Paso, the mayor says they are preparing for the unknown. CNN's David Culver is in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas, and he spoke with migrants seeking asylum about what's next.",

That's Texas soil.On the other side of that barbed wire, and yet not yet. through the border wall, you see hundreds, if not thousands of migrants now camped out, some of them for hours, some days, some weeks, and pretty dire conditions, cold at night, scorching sun and heat during the day. And at this hour, a lot of wind too, whipping up the sand. [01:35:13] But what was interesting was what we've seen now happening just within the past day or so, and that is increased activity in processing some of these migrants. Let me show you what we captured from above, and that is Customs and Border Protection vans coming through what's known as Gate 42 here. This is just one small portion of the border wall. And they come through with a few vans and begin processing. So it seems some of these migrants and then loading them up into the vans. Now in months past, we know that many of those migrants would then go through the border wall, be processed. Sometimes they would be in custody for a few days. And under Title 42, could be immediately expelled back to Mexico. And we saw folks who were then loaded up, dropped off on the Mexican side, and then would try again. If they're processing under Title 8, which will take precedence after Title 42 comes down, then they'll have to go forward with their claims for asylum. And the stakes are much higher if they don't qualify. They could be banned from entering the U.S. for five years. So it can be a bit more significant if they don't have the criteria to meet asylum. We caught up with some of the folks who want to do it the right way. They want to enter the U.S. legally. We saw those migrants camping out, not here, but near to the city center in Ciudad Juarez and hundreds filling sidewalks and then starting their mornings on their cell phones, trying to log into the CBP One app. That's essentially one of the ways that the Biden administration has started to enhance so that they could log on and people could potentially get an appointment for an asylum officer to meet with them. Now the people we were speaking with had been trying for days and seemingly unsuccessful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (Speaking Foreign Language)",

The chaos and confusion is because the United States has failed to prepare an adequate response to these migrants.And this has gone through multiple American administrations. We've gone through eras of, you know, family separations, talk of build the wall, mass deportations under Obama. And through all these different policies, really nothing has stemmed the tide of migration. And that's because for so many of these Central Americans, people from around the world who are migrating, this is not a choice that they are living. Migration is a matter of survival.

And this is very much a pressing issue, not only for Republicans, but Democrats as well, because as the Republicans have seized on this issue politically, because it resonates very much with their base, what we see on the Democratic side is really a failure to counter this type of misinformation. I think the average American voter knows where Republicans stand on immigration. They want to shut down the border and they don't want to let more people in. But when it gets to the Biden administration's approach, I think people are not even sure what that is. So far, President Biden has tried to move on immigration in sort of what he sees as a balance attempt between -- a balance between border security and a more humane approach. But so far, that really doesn't seem to be working. And we saw polling out just this month of Global Strategies Group, about two-thirds, 68 percent of Americans want a humane immigration system and border security.
