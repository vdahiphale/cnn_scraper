Form has to do with how something formally appears, what is its sort of official appearance. And so, today, the court has said, formally speaking, race may not enter into decision-making. But a whole other basis for making decisions or framing decisions is substance, which has to do with the actual internal aspects of a decision or its effects. And so I think while the court has forbidden formal consideration of race, it hasn't necessarily excluded and may never be able to necessarily exclude a substantive practice or a practice which has this substantive effect of giving some consideration to some things which are effectively proxies for race, like socioeconomic status.",

And she had played such a prominent role during the oral arguments in these cases in -- actually, in the single case, because she was out of the Harvard one, because she had to recuse herself because she had formerly been on the board of overseers there. But during the University of North Carolina one, she had been so active talking about, what is the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause? What was it designed to do? So, in this moment, when the court has reversed decade upon decade of history, and, as I said this morning when I was talking about these cases, they really do implicate the promise of Brown v. Board of Education from 1954. And Justice Sotomayor, in her dissent from the bench, which captured, again, Justice Jackson's sentiment, talked about what that promise was in Brown v.Board, that schools would be integrated, that we were walking away from segregation. And, in this, Justice Sotomayor said, there would be segregation. And that sharp line about the bunker and boardroom, that was matched by several others, at least out loud. I haven't had time, of course, to read the opinion. But, just in the courtroom, there were so many zingers going back and forth. And I have to say about the chief justice we have seen him try to couch some of his strongest opinions with language that would -- might mollify some people, but there wasn't any of that. And one thing he did say, Sara, about what universities can and can't do, he said, what universities are being told today that they cannot do directly, they cannot do indirectly either. He said -- he kind of warned that he didn't want universities and colleges trying to set up programs that would work in the shadows that might somehow take into consideration applicants' racial backgrounds. It was -- it was one of his most robust and strongest statements ever. And, as I said, it's been building for him personally for almost as long as Bakke has even existed -- Sara, John Kate.",

      "sentences": "Certainly.Of all, the reaction coming in, some very interesting reaction from former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, both of whom benefited from affirmative action programs. They have talked about it extensively over the years. And they are also both issuing separate statements this morning, very unusual, in the wake of this Supreme Court decision. Let's look at a passages from each of these statements here. They really reflect the view here. Former President Barack Obama, he says this: \"Like any policy, affirmative action wasn't perfect, but it allowed generations of students like Michelle and me to prove that we belonged. Now it's up to all of us to give young people the opportunities they deserve and help students everywhere benefit from new perspectives.\" Of course, former President Obama, who graduated from Harvard Law School, where he wrote very passionately about the need for affirmative education programs back in the early '90s. And now Michelle Obama. She attended Princeton in 1981 and then Harvard Law School. She issues a very lengthy statement, a very passionate statement about the need for affirmative action and how it helped her. But listen to this as well, one passage from her. She says this: \"Today, my heart breaks for any young person out there who's wondering what their future holds, and what kind of chances will be open to them. And while I know the strength and grit that lies inside kids who have always had to sweat a little more to climb the same ladders, I hope and pray the rest of us are willing to sweat a little too.\" So, certainly, very interesting reactions there. But I'm thinking back this morning to a time on the campaign trail back in 2007 when then- Senator Obama was asked about affirmative action and if their daughters, Malia and Sasha, also benefit from these programs. And, at the time, Senator Obama, the junior senator from Illinois, who would go on to be become president, but it was not clear at that point in 2007, he said he did not believe that they should benefit from these programs because they had many other advantages that Michelle Robinson at the time and Barack Obama did not have. So, certainly, as generations pass here, a very interesting reflection of this. But talking broadly about how the public views affirmative action as a whole, a very interesting Pew study from earlier this month that I think is instructive to a public opinion. Let's take a look at those numbers if we have them. A bare majority, about 50 percent of Americans, said that they believe that affirmative action programs have run their course. They do not support, they disapprove of affirmative action programs overall. Only 33 percent approve and 16 percent unsure. And that has a very stark partisan divide in it. About 75 percent of Republicans, about three-quarters of Republicans, believe -- that they disapprove of these affirmative action programs, and only about 54 percent of Democrats -- actually, 29 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said that they support these programs. So, certainly, this is being viewed through a very predictable partisan lens here. But those comments from former President Obama and Mrs. Obama certainly are reflective of to people who benefited from these programs and now are calling on society and others to do more to help students like them along the way -- guys.",

      "sentences": "OK.Just reminding everybody sort of where we are. The U.S. Supreme Court has made a huge decision that will affect many, many, many Americans and universities and colleges. They can no longer use race as a factor in deciding whether or not students get admitted. That's the bottom line. There are lots of caveats that we have seen from Justice Roberts, but that is the bottom line at this point. I want to get to Steve Vladeck and also to our Laura Coates. I'm going to start with you, Steve, because I know you have been watching every single thing that has come down on this. And you write that it does not end all race-based affirmative action. I was curious, though, because we just heard from someone in the court, who basically said, look, Roberts wanted to be very, very clear that you could not do this, and you couldn't go around it as well and try to use race in another way to try to get students in. So, could -- does this mean that the courts are saying schools cannot use it, for example, for scholarships or other things?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and I think that what's really tricky here, I think this is where there's a lot of confusion in some of the headlines coming out from other media outlets, is race as a policy, race-based preference as a policy, that's dead.I mean, that is clearly forbidden by today's majority opinion, at least, except in the military service academies, which Chief John Roberts exempts in a footnote. But the court actually goes out of its way to say that if, for example, an applicant writes about how race shaped their experience in a diversity statement, in an application essay, that's not beyond the ability of the university to consider. And so what this really opens the door to is a very, very different use of race in college admissions, where schools can't say, we're going to have preferences. Schools can't say race is a plus factor. Schools can't say racial diversity is one of our goals, but where applicants can still choose to talk about themselves, guys, at least in those contexts where it's permissible. I mean, I teach at the University of Texas, a public school in a red state, where the legislature has actually gone to some lengths to actually restrict the ability of schools to consider these kinds of diversity statements. But in those places where they're still viable, there's at least a sliver left. And what's so important about that is, it allows the Supreme Court to claim that it hasn't overruled its decades of precedents formally recognizing the validity of a race-based affirmative action, even while today's decision effectively neuters them and makes these policies all but impossible to pursue in the vast majority of colleges and universities across the country.",
